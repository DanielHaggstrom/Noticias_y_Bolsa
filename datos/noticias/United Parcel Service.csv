0;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Europe split over handling of postal services while in lockdown;France and Spain cut services while UK, Germany and Italy run operations as normal;The handling of postal services and treatment of workers in response to the coronavirus has been starkly different across Europe as millions of people are trapped at home under quarantine orders.As closures threaten to leave people stranded just when they need the service most, France and Spain have sharply reduced operations to protect workers from falling ill, while in the UK, Germany and Italy deliveries are running largely as normal. Only about 10 per cent of postal offices are open in France and deliveries have been cut back to three days instead of six. This poses a problem to the estimated 1.5m older people and the poor, who rely on postal offices to collect monthly welfare payments.Spain has temporarily cut postal staffing levels to about 13,000 workers a day or a quarter of normal levels.Unions in France have pushed the state-owned postal service to put workers’ safety first, calling for closures despite their status as an essential service.“Our postal workers are working without masks or gloves, threatening their health with every delivery,” said Valérie Mannevy, a representative for the CGT union at La Poste. “We want to fulfil our public service mission but can only do so if the health protection measures are correct.”How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereIn Spain, two unions have accused the state-owned post office of turning the two-week-old lockdown as a “business opportunity”, maintaining an excessively high level of activity and “obliging staff to work without protective equipment”. They say that more than 600 postal workers have tested positive for coronavirus.The Spanish post office says such figures are confidential and that staff on duty are now supplied with masks, sanitiser gel and gloves. It says demand has fallen along with staffing levels, and that it is still assuring services as required by law.In contrast, Italian postal workers are still working despite the death toll from the outbreak being the worst in Europe. Deliveries are being made as normal six days a week, although some of its smaller 12,800 offices have closed. Ecommerce giant Amazon relies on the Italian post for its deliveries, and is Poste Italiane’s single biggest client by postal volume.Italy’s post offices also remain open to serve the 8m pensioners who collect their state pensions in person.Deutsche Post, which is publicly traded and only partly owned by KfW, a state-backed development bank, says letter and package deliveries are continuing as normal in Germany and full services are available in post offices. Steps have been taken to protect workers such as equipping trucks with canisters of water for handwashing.Royal Mail in the UK is still operating daily service.The Communication Workers Union is delaying planned strikes under a long-running labour dispute because of coronavirus. But it said an appeal to reduce deliveries to three times a week and for employees to work on alternate days for the duration of the outbreak was rejected.“More than ever, people are relying on us,” said the company.The patchwork of approaches among the national postal carriers also contrasts with private companies, such as UPS and DHL, which continue to deliver packages to European businesses and residents relatively smoothly.UPS says it continues to operate regular service, except for in roughly 1 per cent of European postcodes where governments have suspended pick-ups and deliveries. The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.Since Europe entered lockdown three weeks ago, demand has risen not only for online groceries, but also for exercise equipment, office supplies, toys and books, according to market researchers NPD and Kantar.But with postal services being cut back, consumers risk longer delays to getting the stuff they order and businesses could miss out on a lifeline to keep activity going. For example, newspaper and magazine publishers in France have criticised La Poste’s position as an existential threat to their advertising and subscriptions.“La Poste is radically cutting back on package deliveries just as our sales are exploding,” said one top executive at a national online retailer in France, who declined to be named. “Things are quite tense with fewer delivery workers than normal.”Additional reporting by Domitille Alain, Michael Pooler and Guy Chazan
1;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-01-29T21:15:26Z;UPS orders 20,000 vehicles from electric-van maker Arrival;Boost for UK start-up one week after receiving €100m injection from Hyundai and Kia;UK electric-van maker Arrival has received an order for up to 20,000 custom delivery vehicles from UPS in a deal worth hundreds of millions to the British start-up.UPS has ordered 10,000 purpose-built vans to be rolled out between 2020 and 2024, with the option to purchase another 10,000 in 2023.The vans will be produced at Arrival’s production sites in the UK in Bicester and Banbury, as well as a new plant in Reading, one in the US in New Jersey and another site in mainland Europe.Deliveries of the first vehicles will begin later this year.The orders are a further boost to the group, which has been a bright spot in a UK car industry struggling with falling output amid lower sales because of trading uncertainty following Brexit.The order comes a week after the company received €100m from Hyundai and Kia, valuing the start-up at €3bn and providing capital for the business to expand.The first generation of Arrival vans were existing conventional vehicles retrofitted with battery electric technology and used by companies including Royal Mail and BT.Its new generation of models have been designed from scratch and use a flexible skateboard-style base, or chassis, for battery vehicles that can be used to make large vans or smaller cars.Its production method allows the business to use a network of “microfactories”, which can make tens of thousands of vehicles, producing cars flexibly in several locations, rather than relying on the large facilities used by traditional manufacturers.The production centres employ about 40 to 100 people.UPS and Arrival have been working together since 2016 to develop the new vehicle based on the skateboard platform.The delivery group has also invested tens of millions of euros into Arrival, which has been seeking new investors to help fuel its growth plans.Arrival has about 400 employees in the UK, as well as 400 others across the world.Denis Sverdlov, founder and chief executive of Arrival, said: “UPS has been a strong strategic partner of Arrival, providing valuable insight to how electric delivery vans are used on the road and how they can be optimised for drivers.“Together our teams have been creating bespoke electric vehicles, based on our flexible skateboard platforms, that meet the needs of UPS from driving, loading and unloading, depot and back-office operations.”Juan Perez, chief information and engineering officer at UPS, said: “We recognise the need to work with partners around the world to solve both road congestion and pollution challenges for our customers and the communities we serve.“Electric vehicles form a cornerstone to our sustainable urban delivery strategies. Taking an active investment role in Arrival enables UPS to collaborate in the design and production of the world’s most advanced electric delivery vehicles.”
2;UPS;United Parcel Service;2019-10-27T05:00:28Z;David Abney: Making the big decisions to transform a company;The UPS boss seeks out the people who will give him the bad news;"David Abney was in an airport last month when it dawned on him that he had spent more than 70 per cent of his 63 years working for one company. The chairman and chief executive of United Parcel Service joined the delivery company while he was in college, taking a holiday job in 1974 loading packages on to trailers because he wanted cash to take his teenage sweetheart (now his wife) on dates.“I was going to be a history professor [but] I became what we call brown-blooded,” he recalls, in reference to the UPS company colours.The tale of Mr Abney’s first job serves as a folksy ice-breaker when a man who now earns 272 times as much as his median employee needs to bond with his unionised staff.“Anywhere I go today with a group of drivers . . . if I can get in in the first 30 seconds, ‘Back when I was a driver,’ it’s like I immediately get admitted to the club,” he says.But it also gets to the heart of the leadership challenge Mr Abney faced when the UPS board promoted him from the chief operating officer’s role five years ago to the top job: how could the quintessential company man credibly shake up a group with which he had spent four decades?“My goal when they started talking to me about becoming the CEO was not necessarily to be the transformation CEO,” he admits, but with UPS facing rising competition from Amazon, a backlash to globalisation, and technological disruptions from drones to driverless trucks, it became clear that keeping the company as he had known it was not an option.“There are people that say, well, if we can just get through this, we can catch our breath and we can get things back to normal. My view is that this is the new normal,” Mr Abney says, and that means that its transformation will never be complete: “We’re always going to be adjusting and we can like it [or] we cannot like it, but if we don’t embrace it, we will fade away eventually.”At a business that styles itself a “purpose and prosperity company”, he knew that core values such as service and safety were not to be touched, but “everything else is open season”.Mr Abney set out his plan for overhauling UPS last year. Its headlines were faster expansion in international markets, improving its offering to smaller businesses, and a strategic focus on the ecommerce and healthcare markets.A plan alone does not convince employees of the need for change, however, and Mr Abney decided early on to use his long experience to his advantage. “No one could really say that I don’t understand the business,” he says, observing that his own career has been one of regular upheavals.At the same time, however, he recognised that an insider’s knowledge was not enough: “I said, if we’re really going to transform this business, I’ve got to bring someone in from the outside.”So two years ago he brought in Scott Price from Walmart as chief transformation strategy officer, and after three other external hires, a third of his 12-strong leadership team now boast external perspectives. “Promotion from within is hugely important to us; it’s what got me to where I am, but it has to be a blend,” he says.Mr Abney meets his team each Monday for a weekly review, which he describes as critical for keeping track of how fast a company with 480,000 employees is really changing. Over lunch, his team works through a “transformation scorecard” to measure progress against the roughly 750 projects that have flowed from his strategic priorities.Yet such metrics can only tell a company where it is that day, he cautions. To understand where it needs to go next, a CEO cannot stop asking questions of customers, community leaders and employees. “People are trying to tell us. We’ve just got to listen to them,” he notes.Leadership is about allocating capital as well as listening, however, and Mr Abney has had to make big bets on technologies whose potential is still uncertain, from electric Tesla trucks to software for optimising drivers’ routes. The first thing he had to learn as CEO, he says, was that he could not wait to have all the information he wanted before acting.“If you do, that perfect decision is no longer perfect because you’re making the best outdated decision you can make,” he says. A bad decision can be corrected later but stalling puts the whole company in limbo, he explains: “If you’re not making decisions, that means you’re voting for status quo in a world that’s anything but.”Mr Abney has two strategies for mitigating the risk of rushing into the wrong decision: the first is to encourage his direct reports to voice their opinions, even on subjects outside their purview. The second is to keep scanning for signs that decisions are not going to plan.He tells the story of when he was asked to pilot a lauded new voice technology in the sorting facilities he ran in Utah in the mid-1990s, only to discover that it did not work. It fell to Mr Abney to give his bosses the bad news, and he was struck when they swiftly switched to another system, rather than wasting time allocating blame.“That’s what you have to do . . . If you’re keeping score and you start punishing people for being wrong, they just won’t take a stand in the future,” he says.Mr Abney is now in the bosses’ shoes, and claims to seek out people who will give him bad news. His trick when touring UPS facilities, he confides, is to stray from the path his hosts have set out for him.“I’m not really looking for the most smiling of faces. In fact, if I see frowning faces, I will make sure that I go to them,” he says. First, he uses his “when I was a driver” icebreaker; then he asks what’s on their minds.“I’ll never forget when leaders did that for me,” he says. When his first bosses went out of their way to talk to him, he would wonder “why would you talk to me [when] you’ve got all the ties [to] the people that are somebody,” he recalls. Now, as CEO, “What you find out when you do that is that everybody, of course, is somebody.”What was your first leadership lesson?When I was [19] I had this manager that took a real interest in me, put his arm around my shoulder one night, and said, David, and he started telling me about the great company that UPS was. Then he started telling me the greatness that he had seen in me already . . . I became brown-blooded . . . from that night. So the lesson is to all of our leaders . . . how we can touch people and make such a difference in their lives?Who is your leadership hero?Last week I got to meet one of my heroes . . . Colin Powell . . . [He was] the most humble man that placed his people first and accomplished so much in the world. I told him he was a living legend.If you weren’t doing this, what would you be doing?I spend a lot of time reading history books . . . but a bigger interest — and it’s resurfaced a lot lately — is astronomy . . . The reason it’s resurfaced is [that] one of my seven grandkids is obsessed with being an astronaut. [It’s] all he wants to talk to me about, because he knows I get the astronomy magazine . . . he knows more than I do, unfortunately, and he’s six."
3;UPS;United Parcel Service;2019-10-22T11:53:18Z;UPS profits boosted by strong US online shopping;The Atlanta-based company has invested to keep pace with growth in ecommerce;Parcel delivery company UPS, considered an economic bellwether, said strong demand for next day deliveries driven by retail and healthcare deliveries helped fuel its profits in the third quarter.The Atlanta-based company reported revenues rose 5 per cent from a year ago to $18.3bn, just shy of analysts’ expectations for $18.35bn, according to a Refinitiv survey.In the US, the company’s largest market, revenues rose 10 per cent from a year ago to $11.46bn. UPS said next day air delivery volume grew nearly 24 per cent, driven by the surge in online shopping as well as shipping between businesses, led by retail, healthcare and high-tech sectors.“The investments we are making in new facilities and automation in our network, coupled with solid execution of our strategies are producing strong results,” said David Abney, chief executive.The company has been investing in new technology, aircraft and automated capacity to combat delivery delays and as it seeks to keep pace with the growth in online shopping. On Monday, the company said its new Flight Forward drone unit will start delivering prescriptions from CVS Health in two American cities in the coming weeks.UPS and its rival FedEx face growing competition from Amazon, as the ecommerce giant has sought to expand its shipping operations on the ground and in the air in an effort to cut freight costs and speed up deliveries of its customers’ orders. In an effort to grow its customer base, UPS has also partnered with Stamps.com giving its customers discounted shipping rates.Revenues at the company’s international segment edged up a more modest 0.5 per cent to $3.49bn. The company’s international export volume grew in all of its intra-European and Asia trade lanes, except the US-Asia trade lanes. The declines come amid ongoing uncertainty in the trade war between the US and China.Net income rose to $1.75bn or $2.01 a share in the three months ended in September, up from $1.5bn or $1.73 a share. Adjusting for one time items, like transformation costs, the company posted earnings of $2.07 a share, a penny above expectations.The company reaffirmed its full-year outlook for adjusted earnings between $7.45 to $7.75 a share.UPS shares, which are up more than 20 per cent year-to-date, were 1 per cent higher at $118.52 in pre-market trade.
4;UPS;United Parcel Service;2019-10-21T21:44:55Z;Stamps.com soars on UPS shipping deal;;Stamps.com rallied more than 20 per cent late on Monday after UPS said it had partnered with the company to provide discounted shipping rates to customers.An announcement in February that Stamps.com would end its exclusive shipping partnership with the US Postal Service caused the shares to plummet 58 per cent in one day. At the time, Ken McBride, chief executive, said the company wanted to “fully embrace partnerships with other carriers” and was operating under the belief that Amazon “will be a big global player in shipping”.The partnership with UPS would provide discounted shipping rates to Stamps.com’s more than 740,000 customers, UPS said. The discounts would be up to 55 per cent off daily rates, including waived fees.Shares in Stamps.com, an online provider of mailing and shipping services, jumped 20.2 per cent to $91.47 in after-hours trading. UPS, which reports quarterly earnings on Tuesday, was up 1.3 per cent.“This new collaboration will allow us to bring the leading shipping solutions of UPS to our customer base in a simpler and more seamless fashion, and at very attractive new discounts,” Mr McBride said in a statement. “We want to empower our customers, and we know that delivery speeds and competitive rates are an important factor for small business success.”In May, Stamps.com suffered another steep drop, of 56 per cent, after the company reduced its financial guidance. Stamps.com has since retraced much of those losses. Its share price has more than doubled since the end of May, having closed on Monday at $76.13. It remains down 51 per cent year-to-date.
5;UPS;United Parcel Service;2019-10-16T17:54:56Z;Courier groups hired to keep medicine flowing after no-deal Brexit;Tenders worth £25m aim to meet supplies within 24 to 48 hours of being ordered;Plans are in place to try and ensure urgent medicines and medical products can reach the UK within two days in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government announced on Wednesday.Logistics groups UPS, DFDS and Biocair, have won health department tenders worth a total of £25m to provide an express freight service, with a remit to deliver drugs and medical products — including radio-isotopes that are used in the treatment of cancer, in 24 to 48 hours of being ordered.The news follows the disclosure last week that Brittany Ferries, DFDS, P&O and Stena Line would provide capacity for the equivalent of 2,500 heavy goods trucks to be transported into the UK a week for six months from October 31 as part of the plans to ensure that patients can receive the medicines they need.The department said the aim was to ensure that the NHS had access to next-day delivery on small consignments, including temperature-controlled or hazardous products, 48-hour delivery for larger loads, and access to specialist services, including hand-delivered courier services if needed.Under the arrangements put in place in the run-up to the March 29 Brexit deadline, supplies would have been consolidated in Belgium, from where separate arrangements would have to have been made to get them to the UK. However, the service announced on Wednesday will allow for door-to-door delivery of products.Matt Hancock, health secretary, said: “This dedicated delivery service will get urgent supplies and short shelf-life medicines, like radio-isotopes for cancer treatments, rapidly into the country, including by plane where necessary.”The service would supplement other preparations for Brexit, that include pharma companies stockpiling medicines and additional ferry capacity, he added.On how much the three companies would be paid if there was not a no-deal Brexit, the department said there was no specific contract termination fee. “In the event of postponement or early termination, the government will be required to pay a proportion of costs that would have otherwise been due.”According to information given by the department to the National Audit Office earlier this year, the contracts will run for an initial period of a year, with the option to extend for a further year. The health department expects to pay £3.9m towards the service, with the rest of the cost met by companies using the service.Mr Hancock said that detailed plans were now in place for every medicine, including those with short shelf lives, to help ensure that the supply of drugs and medical products would be uninterrupted through Brexit.Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said that while there were many things beyond industry’s control, “this is an important contingency plan that will help our members continue their preparations — alongside the stockpiles they have already built and alternative freight routes they have secured”.
6;UPS;United Parcel Service;2019-04-25T12:48:47Z;UPS holds firm on outlook even as bad weather deals profit blow;Package delivery company says severe US weather led to $80m hit;Package delivery company UPS, often seen as an economic bellwether, stuck to its full-year guidance even as severe weather in the US earlier this year contributed to its first-quarter results missing market expectations.David Abney, chief executive, said the company had a “good start to the year” as recent efforts to overhaul the company bear fruit, most notably with its international business reporting a record adjusted operating profit for a first quarter.The Atlanta-based company reaffirmed its full-year target for adjusted diluted earnings in the range of $7.45 to $7.75 a share. In the current quarter, though, adjusted earnings in its second quarter are expected to be flat from a year ago owing to planned pension financing costs, which would fall short of Wall Street’s estimate for a 4 per cent rise.In the three months ended March 31, total group revenue rose 2.7 per cent from a year ago to $17.16bn, which fell short of the median forecast among analysts for $17.78bn, according to Refinitiv. Diluted earnings of $1.39 a share missed Wall Street forecasts by 2 cents.UPS said severe weather in the US lowered operating profit for its domestic segment by $80m, or 7 cents a share, to $666m. The division still made up almost half of group operating profit.Shares, which were up 17.3 per cent for 2019 at yesterday’s close, were down 2.8 per cent in pre-market trade on Thursday morning.
7;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
8;UPS;United Parcel Service;2019-01-31T13:06:32Z;UPS posts profit beat despite ‘challenging’ holiday quarter;Parcel delivery company facing stiff competition from rivals and new entrants like Amazon;Package delivery company UPS, seen as a US economic bellwether, on Thursday unveiled stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings despite a “challenging” holiday quarter leading to disappointing revenues.The Atlanta-based company said revenues rose 4.6 per cent from a year ago to $19.85bn in the three months ended in December, just under analysts’ projections of $19.93bn, according to a Refinitiv survey.The company’s consolidated average revenue per piece rose 4 per cent from a year ago to $10.59.Its net income fell to $453m from $1.1bn in the year ago quarter. That translated to earnings of 52 cents a share, down from $1.26 in the same quarter a year ago. The fourth quarter included after-tax pension charges of $1.24bn or about $1.42 a share.Adjusting for one-time items the company reported earnings of $1.94 a share, ahead of analyst expectations for $1.90. The company attributed this to successful execution of investments that helped improve efficiency.UPS has been ramping up investments in new technology, aircraft and automated capacity to ease delivery delays amid a jump in online shopping. But UPS and rival FedEx face growing competition from Amazon, which has sought to expand its shipping operations on ground and in the air, to lower costs and speed up delivery to customers.Revenues at its US division — the company’s largest — rose 6.3 per cent year-on-year to $12.58bn as its network delivered more than 21m packages on average per day domestically. However, operating profits fell 8 per cent to $999m “reduced by planned pension expense, start-up costs for several large facilities, and one less operating day than in the prior year’s fourth quarter”.In its international segment, UPS saw revenues grow by 2.9 per cent to $3.8bn and operating profit rise 6.2 per cent to $781m.“UPS executed very well during the quarter in a challenging environment,” said chief financial officer Richard Peretz. “In 2019, we plan to generate substantial increases in operating profit growth in all three business units.”The company expects to report full-year adjusted earnings of between $7.45 to $7.75 a share, with the low end of its range missing analysts’ expectations for $7.69.UPS shares, which are up nearly 4 per cent year-to-date, were up more than 3 per cent in pre-market trade.
9;UPS;United Parcel Service;2018-12-13T11:00:24Z;US slowdown or Amazon effect? Investors divided over index fall;The Dow Transports is seen as a barometer of the economy, but this time may be different;To the list of areas where Amazon is wreaking disruption, from retail to cloud computing, add another candidate: a stock market index that has been watched by investors as a barometer of the US economy. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, the less well-known sibling of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, includes railroad operators, airlines and shipping companies whose fortunes are tied closely to economic activity.The transport index has fallen more than 9 per cent since the start of December compared with between 3 and 4 per cent for other equity market benchmarks. That is exactly the kind of divergence that gives support to bears, who worry about trade wars and see slowing global growth.“I do not think we are heading for a recession, but we are seeing a global economic slowdown and the Transports are reflecting that,” said Michael Underhill, chief investor officer at Capital Innovations.But Mr Underhill and other market participants point out that idiosyncratic factors are pressuring some influential index members. That potentially reduces the signalling power of the Transports index.Shares of FedEx, which has the biggest weighting in the index, have lost more than 17 per cent since the start of the month, in part due to concerns about Amazon Air, the ecommerce giant’s in-house freight delivery service. Amazon has been expanding its own shipping operations, both on the ground and in the air, to cut freight costs and speed up deliveries of its customers’ orders.In early December, Morgan Stanley warned that investors “may be missing the risk” Amazon Air posed to growth at FedEx and rival UPS.In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley said Amazon Air’s growth represents 2 per cent of potential revenue lost for UPS and FedEx in 2018 and at least 10 per cent by 2025, based on an analysis of Amazon Air’s overlap with the shipping companies.Unlike the S&P 500, an index that reflects the market capitalisation of its members, the Dow Jones Transportation and Industrials indices are calculated on the basis of each member’s share price, which means a company with a high share price exerts a big influence even if its market cap is small.FedEx accounts for about a quarter of the month-to-date loss in the Transports index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Add in UPS, whose shares are down 12 per cent this month, and the two stocks threatened by Amazon Air account for about 3 percentage points of the index fall.Those who think that the underperformance of the Transports could be the canary in the coal mine signalling an economic slowdown are not deterred, however. “FedEx does skew the reading on the Transports index, but does not wash it out entirely,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek.It is particularly notable that the transport index is falling sharply even as oil prices have been going down, something that should be giving transport stocks a lift.“Energy is typically a big part of their cost structure — they should be doing better than they are,” Mr Colas said. “The Transport index performance mirrors what other financial markets like the flattening of the Treasury yield curve are telling you: slower growth. It is just one more brick in the wall.”
10;UPS;United Parcel Service;2018-12-04T20:56:26Z;UPS, FedEx tumble as analyst warns of Amazon Air risk;;Amazon Air took the wind out of United Parcel Service and FedEx shares on Tuesday, as Morgan Stanley warned that investors have yet to fully account for growing competition from the ecommerce giant’s freight delivery service.But it, too found itself on the receiving end of issues pertaining to shipping, amid reports on Tuesday afternoon that a task force set up by US President Donald Trump has recommended that the US Postal Service should have the authority to charge market rates to deliver most packages.Amazon has sought to expand its own shipping operations, both on the ground and in the air, to cut freight costs and speed up deliveries of its customers’ orders. The retailer has leased dozens of aircraft to create a fleet of cargo jets, and it plans to build an air hub capable of housing 100 planes. The moves — in addition to an order of 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans for ground deliveries — could reduce Amazon’s reliance on logistics companies such as UPS and FedEx, whose networks have been strained by growing ecommerce shipments.In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley said Amazon Air’s growth represents 2 per cent of potential revenue lost for UPS and FedEx in 2018 and at least 10 per cent by 2025, based on an analysis of Amazon Air’s overlap with the shipping companies. The investment bank also sees Amazon Air weighing on volume growth for the companies’ domestic air and express operations.“For now, investors are focusing on Amazon’s last-mile efforts but we believe the challenge in Air is just as relevant,” a team of analysts led by Ravi Shanker wrote.Morgan Stanley cut its price target for UPS to $87 from $92 while lowering its FedEx target to $230 from $240.“We expect this drag to intensify once Amazon Air has all 40 planes in the air (and potentially 100 planes if it runs its planned air hub at capacity) and as its utilisation improves to UPS/FedEx levels,” Mr Shanker said.As for Amazon, the buildout of its air fleet should result in savings of $2 to $4 a package, or a total of $1bn to $2bn, according to Morgan Stanley’s research. However, those savings will largely offset shipping cost increases from third-party carriers in the short run.Shares of UPS and FedEx slipped into bear-market territory during Tuesday’s session, reflecting a loss of at least 20 per cent from recent highs. UPS fell 6.8 per cent, and FedEx was down 5.5 per cent amid a broader market rout driven by trade and economic concerns. The Dow transport index, of which UPS and FedEx are members, was headed for its worst day since June 2016.Amazon slipped 5 per cent amid reports that a task force created by President Donald Trump recommended that the US Postal Service should have the authority to charge market rates to deliver most packages. Mr Trump has accused Amazon of using the Postal Service as its “delivery boy,” saying the company should pay more in fees.
11;UPS;United Parcel Service;2018-10-24T12:13:49Z;Strong dollar, higher fuel prices add to cost pressures at UPS;;UPS reported weaker-than-expected third quarter sales on Wednesday, as a strong dollar and higher fuel prices heaped further cost pressures on the business, sending shares in the US package delivery company sharply lower.The company, which is seen as a bellwether of US economic activity, said the strengthening greenback has resulted in a $28m hit to earnings from its international business.“Operating profit includes headwinds primarily from currency and fuel, as well as some economic softening related to changing trade policies,” it said of its international business, which accounts for a fifth of group revenues but close to a third of total operating profits.UPS has already seen its margins squeezed in recent quarters as it ramps up in investment in new technology to cope with the delivery bottlenecks delays caused by the surge in demand for e-commerce related deliveries.While the company said the impact the currency headwinds and fuel prices were offset by tax gains during the third quarter, more signs of cost pressures unnerved investors, who pushed UPS shares down more than 3 per cent in pre-market trading.For the three months to end of September, revenues at UPS rose nearly 8 per cent to $17.44bn as the growth of online shopping continues to drive demand for its services. However that was a shade below the $17.49bn the market had expected.Net income came in at $1.51bn, compared to the $1.25bn reported in the prior year period, thanks to a sharply lower tax bill as a result of the reforms pushed through by the Trump administration last year.Excluding this and other one-off items, adjusted earnings was $1.82 per share in line with expectations.The results from UPS continue to underscore how the rise of online shopping is both a blessing and a challenge for package delivery companies.At the company’s all-important US business, revenue was up more than 8 per cent at $10.4bn during the quarter thanks to the surge in ecommerce-related deliveries. But operating profit at the unit fell 6 per cent to $949m as UPS continues to invest in network upgrades and pension contributions.It was a similar story at the international business, where revenues rose 3 per cent but operating revenue fell 11 per cent during the period.Despite the rising cost pressure, UPS reiterated its guidance for 2018 adjusted, diluted earnings at $7.03 to $7.37.Shares in UPS are down 15 per cent since hitting a record high in January.
12;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:59:53+0000;UPS earnings marred by higher expenses;;Concerns over rising cost pressures overshadowed a solid set of quarterly results from UPS, pushing shares in the $96bn package delivery group down more than 1 per cent in pre-market trading.The company, which is seen as a bellwether of US economic activity, reported a near 10 per cent jump in revenue to $17.45bn for the June quarter, ahead of Wall Street’s forecast for $17.32bn, as the growth of online shopping continues to drive demand for its services.Net income was up 7.3 per cent at $1.48bn. However operating profit fell 13 per cent during the quarter amid higher pension contributions and costs related to network upgrades at its all-important US business.Margins were also pressured by the 38 per cent — $236m — jump in fuel costs during the quarter.The company was able to offset some of the fuel price increases by raising prices for its customers. A strong performance from UPS’s international business and supply chain and freight delivery unit also helped. Both divisions reported double digit gains in sales and a rise in operating profits.But it is the US division — UPS’s largest — that remains the most challenging. While the unit delivered a 6.3 per cent rise in revenue during the period thanks to the surge in ecommerce-related deliveries, operating profits were down by a quarter as result of “planned increases in pension expense and cost for ongoing network projects.”UPS has been ramping up investments in new technology, aircrafts and automated capacity as it seeks to ease delivery bottlenecks delays caused by the surge in demand for e-commerce related deliveries.“UPS is making great progress on our transformation initiatives to enhance profitable growth and improve operating leverage,” said chief executive David Abney. “We are confident that our strategies will position the company to provide improved value for customers and shareowners.”Shares in UPS, down 15.6 per cent since hitting a record high in January, were down 1.2 per cent in pre-market trading.
13;UPS;United Parcel Service;2018-07-02T09:00:25Z;Amazon delivery plan poses threat to US Postal Service growth;Logistics spending spree aims to find other ways to get parcels quickly to customers;Amazon’s plan to foster a network of small delivery businesses is set to exacerbate a slowdown in the growth of US Postal Service package delivery, analysts say.Package delivery is the fastest-growing part of USPS and is expected to overtake first-class mail as the largest contributor to revenue next year, according to research estimates from Cowen. But Amazon’s increasing need to put parcels in customers’ hands in a day or hours has sharpened its focus away from the post office.The changing dynamics come amid a review of the postal service’s finances ordered by President Donald Trump, a vocal Amazon critic. He has called for USPS, which lost $2.7bn in its latest fiscal year and which has not reported a profit in the past decade, to double the rates it charges the online retailer.Amazon and the postal service do not disclose the terms of their contract, but analysts believe it is profitable for USPS. The post office has been buoyed by an acceleration in the past few years in package shipping, thanks to the rise of ecommerce, which has mitigated a drop in total mail volume.Cowen projects USPS’s share of Amazon deliveries will drop to 45 per cent in 2023 from 63 per cent in 2015. That will be driven by a shift in packages toward independent courier companies and, increasingly, deliveries made by Amazon itself and by individuals and small businesses working directly for Amazon.The postal service cannot match the speed that they want“We’re already seeing a massive deceleration in volume growth” of USPS parcels, said John Blackledge, a Cowen analyst. Increases slowed from 26 per cent in 2015 to 15 per cent last year.Amazon said its moves were meant to complement, not replace, existing relationships. “We have great partners in our traditional carriers and it’s exciting to continue to see the logistics industry grow,” said Dave Clark, its senior vice-president of worldwide operations, at the launch the new delivery programme last week.A USPS spokesman said the agency “continue[s] to attract ecommerce customers and business partners because our customers see the value of our predictable service, enhanced visibility, and affordable pricing”.Amazon has a number of delivery options in addition to USPS. It sends packages through UPS, FedEx, DHL and courier services and, increasingly, it employs its own drivers and signs up people to deliver packages with their own cars through a programme called Flex.UPS and FedEx will also lose share in the shift, but analysts say those two are less exposed to Amazon’s whims in the near term.“UPS and FedEx have seen the writing on the wall for a long time and they’ve diversified. It’s going to take a long time for Amazon to make a dent,” said Tuna Amobi of CFRA Research. “But there’s no question the market understands that UPS and FedEx are going to be disrupted by this. It’s just of question of when.”Amazon’s logistics spending spree, including building delivery centres, buying planes and truck trailers and launching programmes such as Flex and the Delivery Partner Service, reflects growing demand for faster delivery from the 100m members of its Prime subscription programme. Its shipping costs ballooned to $21.7bn last year from $11.5bn in 2015.Prime members get free shipping, often in as few as one or two days. Amazon is also expanding options for free same-day delivery and beefing up Prime Now, which delivers food and household items within two hours.“The postal service cannot match the speed that they want. For a customer to get something delivered on the same day they order it from Amazon, it needs to be in the post office system at 6am,” Cowen’s Mr Blackledge said.With its $13.7bn acquisition of US grocer Whole Foods last year and its $1bn purchase of mail-order pharmacy PillPack last week, Amazon is venturing into new retail categories where demand for quick delivery is even higher.In addition to expanding its shipping capacity, Amazon may also be positioning itself for contract talks with carriers, said David Vernon, analyst at Bernstein Research.“Holding a press conference and rolling out a truck decal doesn’t cost much and may help negotiations” with USPS or between USPS and the White House, he said.
14;UPS;United Parcel Service;2018-06-28T07:38:15Z;Amazon encourages entrepreneurs to build logistics network;Tech group will provide vans and other services in bid to control last-mile delivery;Amazon is rolling out its own fleet of vans to deliver packages to US customers’ doors in the ecommerce group’s latest push for greater control of its sprawling logistics network.The company is encouraging individuals to launch delivery businesses that will lease van fleets from Amazon, which will offer discounts on uniforms, fuel and insurance coverage.It says it wants to keep start-up costs as low as $10,000, with business owners potentially making as much as $300,000 in annual operating profit with fleets of up to 40 vehicles.The new programme will give Amazon additional options for “last mile” delivery of its parcels, which are typically handled by FedEx, UPS and the US Postal Service. The company also uses individual drivers to deliver packages in US cities using their own cars under a programme called Flex.“Customer demand is higher than ever and we have a need to build more capacity,” said Dave Clark, senior vice-president of worldwide operations.Amazon has been investing heavily in logistics in recent years amid surging demand in online shopping. This has included buying cargo planes and truck trailers and building an extensive network of delivery hubs.Analysts estimate that Amazon’s share of the US ecommerce market is expected to nudge to over 50 per cent by next year. Worldwide shipping costs topped $21.7bn in 2017, and it sent more than 5bn packages to the more than 100m people around the world who subscribe to its Prime programme, which offers fast free delivery of packages in as few as one or two days in 17 countries.In the US, the volumes of items Amazon ships have strained the capacities of some traditional partners and pushed the company to seek a bigger role in getting its deliveries into customers’ hands.President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Amazon and chief executive Jeff Bezos, recently lashed out at the company over its financial dealings with the US Postal Service. Mr Trump has called for the company to pay higher rates and has ordered an audit of the postal service’s finances.Amazon said its efforts were meant to complement, rather than replace, its existing relationships with carriers such as the postal service. “We have great partners in our traditional carriers and it’s exciting to continue to see the logistics industry grow,” Mr Clark said.
15;UPS;United Parcel Service;2018-04-26T11:52:37Z;UPS sales top estimates but higher costs crimp margins;;First quarter results revealed by UPS on Thursday underscore how the rise of online shopping is both a blessing and a challenge for package delivery companies.The US bellwether reported another quarter of strong sales growth as it shipped and delivered ever more packages and exercised better pricing power. However, profit margins fell as higher operating expenses ate into its bottom line.For the three months to end of March, revenue jumped 10 per cent at $17.1bn, handily topping expectations for $16.5bn. Net income rose 15 per cent to $1.34bn, or $1.55 per diluted share, in line with analyst expectations.The challenges and opportunities that the online shopping boom is presenting to UPS was highlighted by the company’s all-important US business. The division, UPS’s largest, reported a 7.2 per cent rise in revenue to $10.2bn during the quarter thanks to the surge in ecommerce-related deliveries.Operating profit at the unit fell by more than a fifth to $756m however as the company took a $85m hit on costs related to severe winter weather, Saturday delivery services, network upgrades and pension contributions. Fuel costs also jumped sharply during the period - climbing by nearly 21 per cent to $750m - amid a rally in global crude prices.The company was able to offset some of the fuel price increases by raising prices for its customers. A strong performance from UPS’s international business and supply chain and freight delivery unit also helped. Both divisions reported double digit gains in sales and operating profits.“The execution of our diversified global strategies and our investments produced double-digit growth in revenue and profit,” said chief executive David Abney. “Each of our International regions is contributing to our financial gains, and we expect this strong momentum to continue.”Shares in UPS, down almost 9 per cent so far this year, dipped 0.6 per cent in pre-market trading.
16;UPS;United Parcel Service;2018-04-13T16:34:23Z;Trump escalates Amazon clash with US postal price review;President ramps up personal crusade against online retail group founder Jeff Bezos;"Donald Trump has increased the likelihood of Amazon being charged more by the US Postal Service by ordering an official review of the mail agency’s pricing of package deliveries.In an unexpected move, Mr Trump established a task force to evaluate the “operations and finances” of the post office after spending recent weeks amplifying his complaints that the post office is losing out on shipments for Amazon.The move shows the president is continuing a personal crusade against Jeff Bezos’s online giant even as the tech-related worries of lawmakers on Capitol Hill revolve around Facebook, whose founder Mark Zuckerberg they grilled this week.A White House executive order creating the task force — to be led by Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin — said it would examine “the expansion and pricing of the package delivery market and the USPS’s role in competitive markets”.Despite Amazon’s high-tech credentials, it relies on about 230,000 postal workers to deliver millions of packages along the “last mile” to many American homes.I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery BoyDiscontent over the alliance of the postal service with Amazon appears to have become entangled with Mr Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post — one of the president’s least favourite media outlets.Amazon struck a landmark deal with the post office in 2013 under which the organisation agreed to start Sunday deliveries for Mr Bezos. The deal, on terms which are kept secret, is due to expire later this year.Paul Steidler, senior fellow at the Lexington Institute, a free market think-tank, said: “The president and people in his administration can make queries about that contract and hold regulators’ feet to the fire to make sure it is profitable and does not pose a danger to taxpayers.”Package deliveries for ecommerce have been a source of revenue growth for the postal service, going some way towards offsetting a sharp decline in letter volume. But the post office has still posted a net loss in each of the past 11 years, including a $2.7bn loss in 2017.The US postal service accounts for around 40-50 per cent of Amazon’s US shipping costs, according to an estimate from analysts at Credit Suisse, with every 5 per cent increase in postal charges adding $400m extra to the company’s annual costs.If the White House review, announced late on Thursday, led to a 15-20 per cent increase in postal service rates, the ecommerce company would have to boost its annual Amazon Prime fee in North America by $20 to cover the extra costs, the analysts added.Allies of the postal service say it cannot lose money on its work for Amazon since it is barred by law from charging its customers less than the cost of delivery.Critics of the post office, however, say its metrics are wrong. It is accused of underestimating how much it costs to serve Amazon because its data are incomplete and it has not updated the way it allocates overheads to reflect more parcel deliveries.“There is too much chaos and too much of an arbitrary approach to the numbers at the postal service,” said Mr Steidler.In one tweet this month, Mr Trump said: “I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy.”The executive order says: “The USPS is on an unsustainable financial path and must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout.”The task force is required to summarise its recommendations in a report for the president within 120 days.Although radical changes to the postal service would require legislation by Congress, Mr Trump has another chance to influence it by appointing people to fill nine vacant seats on its board.Amazon has stayed silent about Mr Trump’s criticism, but it has built a team of eight in-house lobbyists registered to work on postal issues, part of the largest group of staff lobbyists of any big tech company in Washington.Private-sector delivery companies such as UPS argue that the post office is undercharging Amazon to prevent rivals — mainly itself and FedEx — from grabbing more ecommerce business.The task force will also examine the postal service’s business model; the implications of the decline in mail for its monopoly on letter delivery; the definition of its “universal service” obligation to reach all households; and its role in small towns and rural areas.In addition to Mr Mnuchin, the task force will comprise Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House budget office, and Jeff Pon, director of the federal government’s Office of Personnel Management.Additional reporting by Kadhim Shubber in Washington"
17;UPS;United Parcel Service;2018-03-19T08:00:25Z;UPS moves to using only electric vehicles in London;A ‘smart grid’ will allow a large fleet to charge at once;Delivery and logistics group UPS said on Monday a technological development meant its entire central London fleet would soon be made up of electric vehicles, and that this marked the “beginning of the end” of the reliance on internal combustion engines.The Atlanta-based company said the development of a “radical” electric vehicle-charging “smart grid” had solved the problem of needing to recharge a large number of vehicles simultaneously, without having to pay for an expensive upgrade to the power supply grid.UPS will now increase the number of electric trucks it has in operation in central London from 52 to 170 over the next few years. Going electric will soon be a cheaper alternative to diesel, the company said.“We certainly believe this to be groundbreaking,” said Peter Harris, director of sustainability at UPS Europe. The development will herald “a new generation of sustainable urban delivery services both here in London and in other major cities around the world”.The company’s new “intelligent” charging technology works by spreading the same amount of electricity between vehicles more efficiently: although all can be plugged into charging points simultaneously, a computer will stagger which vehicles charge when.Global carmakers and logistics companies have looked to invest in zero- or low-emission electric vehicles in recent years to comply with increasingly strict emissions targets, which aim to reduce pollution and improve air quality in cities.In London, all new taxis must be capable of running solely on electric power, while UPS’s rival DHL has been ramping up its fleet of electric delivery vans since 2016.Before this latest development, UPS’s central London site was restricted to using a maximum of 65 electric vehicles, because of the limits on how much electricity can flow into its charging depot, how much energy each car requires and the costs associated with upgrading.This is believed to be the first time the technology, developed in partnership with UK Power Networks and Cross River Partnership, has been deployed at such scale.“It’s not about using more electricity, but the same amount in a clever way,” said Mr Harris.Electric vehicles are a “huge area of interest” for investors across the board, said John Manners-Bell, chief executive of research company Transport Intelligence. Investing in charging network technology that works well is “the holy grail at the moment”, without which a revolution in electric vehicles can’t happen.The charging system has “significant value for UPS, both in terms of saving money and being seen to be a leader in this area”, said Frank Proud, director at market research company Apex Insight. With London’s poor air quality hitting headlines, UPS will want to be “seen to be part of the solution rather than the problem”.As the costs of buying and running electric vehicles both fall, their potential has grown. Although internal combustion has been “hugely important” over the last 100 years, said Mr Proud, it now has “a longer past than it has a future”.As part of long-term sustainability targets, UPS said it aimed to ensure a quarter of all vehicles purchased by 2020 used alternative fuel or advanced technology, and that a quarter of its electricity came from renewable energy sources by 2025.Beyond London, Mr Harris said, it is conceivable that all UPS’s collection and distribution vehicles worldwide could be electric in the near future. For longer-haul vehicles, which are poorly suited to current technology since they would need to stop to recharge, “the jury’s still out”.
18;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;UPS sues EU for blocking €5bn TNT Express deal;;United Parcel Service has sued the European Commission for compensation over its 2013 decision to block its €5bn takeover of TNT Express, its Dutch rival, on anti-trust grounds.The US delivery company has filed a case with the European general court to recover €1.7bn as well as interest and tax in “compensation for the losses suffered as a result of the acquisition being unfairly prohibited”, according to court documents and a UPS spokesperson. The case was filed in December but was revealed when documents concerning the case were published on Monday.It follows a decision in March 2017 by the general court, which overturned the EU competition commission’s January 2013 decision to block UPS’s takeover of TNY.It was the first time in more than a decade that the court found that the EU regulator had wrongly blocked a transaction.The EU’s competition commission, headed since 2014 by Margrethe Vestager, has played an increasing part in shaping global mergers and acquisitions by setting out its views on how deals might affect the bloc’s consumers.It vetoed the US logistics’ group plans to buy TNT citing concerns that the deal would drastically reduce choice and would probably increase prices for small-parcel delivery in the EU.But the general court ruled in its decision last year that the commission “infringed UPS’ rights of defence” by basing its rejection of the UPS-TNT deal on an analysis that had changed from that discussed with the US logistics group during the process of considering its plans.The Dutch company was subsequently bought by UPS’s arch-rival FedEx for €4bn in a deal unconditionally approved in January 2016.UPS confirmed it had filed the case and said: “We feel strongly that the proposed acquisition (of TNT) would have constituted a good deal for logistics customers as well as B2C consumers. UPS continues to remain bullish on Europe.”The commission said it would defend itself and noted that it had also appealed against the annulment of its decision to block the original UPS plan to acquire TNT.A final resolution of the claims is likely to take years. The court may decide to consider each case in parallel or delay a decision on UPS’ damages claim until the commission’s appeal is concluded.The last time EU courts overruled the regulator’s decision to block a deal was in 2002, when the judges annulled a trio of decisions in one year — proposed deals involving Airtours/First Choice, Schneider/Legrand and Tetra Laval/Sidel.
19;UPS;United Parcel Service;2018-02-09T12:26:51Z;Amazon said to be near own delivery launch, UPS, FedEx shares drop;;It’s the news that investors in parcel delivery heavyweights UPS and FedEx have been dreading.Shares in both companies fell more than 5 per cent in pre-market trading on Friday after a report said Amazon is just weeks away from launching a new service that would allow it to deliver more of its own packages.According to the Wall Street Journal, the e-commerce giant will roll out “in coming weeks” a new programme that will see it pick up packages from third party merchants on its website and deliver the goods to consumers.Dubbed “Shipping with Amazon” or SWA, the report said the service will initially be only offered in Los Angeles, but Amazon hopes to expand it to other cities later this year.Amazon has been making moves towards running its own delivery logistics network in recent years — filing patents for a drone delivery system, leasing planes, opening its own cargo air hub and buying a fleet of delivery trucks.But the SWA programme — rumours of which have been circulating for more than a year now — would mark Amazon’s boldest attempt yet to lessen its dependence on UPS and FedEx for the most crucial part of its appeal to shoppers — quick, reliable delivery.Report of the delivery move comes a day after Amazon announced plans to offer free two-hour delivery at Whole Foods this year for its Prime members. The service began yesterday for customers in Austin, Cincinnati, Dallas and Virginia and will be rolled out to other cities this year.Shares in UPS, up just 2 per cent over the past 12 months, dropped 5.3 per cent ahead of the bell. Fedex shares fell 5.1 per cent, although they remain up more than 27 per cent over the past year.
20;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:59:53+0000;Cost concerns rattle UPS shares;;Concerns over high package delivery costs continued to dog UPS on Thursday, pushing shares in the $109bn company down more than 6 per cent in early trading.While the parcel delivery and logistics group delivered better-than-expected sales and profits growth for the fourth quarter as it reaped in the benefit of America’s addiction to online shopping, the performance was overshadowed by the higher operating expenses incurred at its all-important US business.For the three months to end of December, adjusted operating profit at UPS’s US unit fell 5.5 per cent to $1.26bn as the company — whose network got crushed by a surge in packages shortly after Thanksgiving — was forced to spend an extra $125m in order to clear those bottlenecks and delivery delays.“[The] bottom line results were muted by additional peak operating expenses due to cyber-period volume surges and short-term costs related to capacity projects yet to come on-line,” said UPS.Overall, revenue at UPS came in at $18.8bn during the quarter, an 11 per cent jump from a year ago and ahead of the $18.2bn that analysts were expecting.Net income was $1.1bn, compared to a loss of $239m in the prior-year period, boosted in part by gains stemming from changes in US tax laws.Adjusted net income was $1.67 a share, a hair above the consensus estimates of $1.66 a share.UPS, which delivered 1.5bn packages during the quarter, said it expects earnings this year to get a boost from lower US corporate tax rate. It is forecasting 2018 adjusted diluted earnings of $7.03 to $7.37 per share, up from the $6.01 reported in 2017.It is also planning to spend between $6.5bn-$7bn this year on investments in new technology, aircraft and automated capacity.Shares in UPS, up 13.4 per cent over the past 12 months, fell 6.2 per cent to $119.32. The stock hit a record high of $135.53 earlier this month.
21;UPS;United Parcel Service;2018-01-02T19:32:10Z;Dow transport index notches fresh high;;The Dow Jones Transportation Index kicked off 2018 by rising to a fresh intraday high.The index, which tracks 20 US transportation stocks and tends to rise along with positive sentiment for the economy, rose as much as 1.5 per cent on Tuesday to a high of 10,771.55.Fedex and UPS, both up about 3 per cent, were among the big gainers while JetBlue Airways was among the laggards. Fedex also hit a fresh high above $250 a share, giving the company a market cap of more the $68bn.Investors and analysts pointed to figures from Amazon and the PMI data in explaining the gains. Amazon said on Tuesday that more than 5bn items shipped with Prime in 2017 while the eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers’ index in December hit 60.6, its highest level since surveys began in mid-1997, according to figures released on Tuesday.“We re seeing accelerating global growth and still a relative low interest rate environment,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations. “It points to a positive first day of trading for 2018.”
22;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:05:21+0000;UPS boosted by online shopping, but higher costs weigh down profits;;America’s addiction to online shopping continued to power sales growth at US package delivery and logistics company UPS during the third quarter. However, questions remain about whether the Atlanta-based group can preserve profits amid rising delivery costs, which ate into its bottom line during the period.For the three months to end of September, revenue was up 7 per cent at $15.97bn, handily topping expectations for $15.61bn as UPS shipped and delivered ever more packages and raised some of its prices for customers to offset higher fuel costs.However, net income dipped 0.5 per cent to $1.26bn, hit by operating expenses, which rose 8.1 per cent to $13.9bn during the period.The challenges and opportunities that the rise of online shopping are presenting to UPS is underscored by the company’s all-important US business. The division, UPS’s largest, reported a near 4 per cent jump in revenue to $9.64bn during the quarter thanks to the surge in ecommerce-related deliveries. Operating profit fell 0.5 per cent to $1.18bn as the company spent nearly $40m to build new facilities and finance Saturday delivery services to handle the rise in home deliveries.UPS also had to incur costs related to Hurricane Harvey and Irma, which slowed regional economic activity and damaged infrastructure, shavingsome $50m off operating profit.“The US consumer increasingly prefers to shop online and UPS is benefiting from this trend,” said UPS.UPS’s international business also had a strong quarter, with revenue up 11 per cent to $3.3bn amid increased demand for cross-border shipments. Its supply chain and freight delivery unit saw sales rise to $2.96bn, from the $2.61bn reported in the prior-year period.’Shares in UPS, up nearly 11 per cent over the past 12 months, dipped 0.3 per cent in pre-market trading.
23;UPS;United Parcel Service;2017-10-19T05:10:17Z;Chinese and western tech giants battle for Southeast Asia;From ecommerce to cloud services, the fight is on to dominate a market of 200m online;"When Sea Limited launched its prospectus to list on the New York Stock Exchange last month, the South East Asian ecommerce and gaming group sparked a war of words — or rather numbers — with Lazada, which disputed its rival’s claims to be the region’s top dog.The spat, between companies respectively backed by China’s tech giants Tencent and Alibaba, was part of a proxy war and shone a light on what Bain & Co dubs a “clash of the titans”: a broader battle for share in this market of 200m digital consumers, who last year spent $50bn online, according to the consultancy.It involves not just Chinese and local players but also multinationals such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, the latter rolling up in Singapore earlier this year. This showdown in Southeast Asia comes after Chinese and Western players have neatly carved up the major markets: the multinationals controlling the US and Europe and Alibaba and Tencent ruling the roost in China, where Facebook, Google’s search engine and Twitter are all blocked.“The importance of Asia is coming to the forefront,” says Karim Temsamani, president of Google’s Asia-Pacific operations.“Half the world’s population is here and household wealth is set to grow faster than anywhere else over the next 15 years. This is the centre of the world again, and companies that understand the people here and the way they use technology are going to win in this region.”As well as customers, both sides are fighting over investments. In the past few months, Alibaba has lifted its stake in Lazada to 83 per cent and bought into Indonesian ecommerce group Tokopedia; Tencent has reportedly invested in Indonesia’s ride-hailing start-up Go-Jek, while Expedia put money into regional online travel group Traveloka.“There’s a lot of deal activity now,” says Florian Hoppe, partner at Bain & Co in Singapore. “It’s clearly an escalating battle and the impacted sectors are getting broader and broader.”That wide frontline sees the groups stretching their tentacles into the ecosystems around ecommerce, such as payments and logistics, while offering other services to keep consumers hooked within a single app — such as gaming, food delivery and messaging — to capture more of their time and money.These models mirror those pioneered by Tencent and Alibaba in China. The Western multinationals, while increasingly flirting with similar models, are counting on customising their international offerings to capitalise on the region.The US groups, says Mr Hoppe, are enjoying record quarters in the region on the back of growth there. “Facebook is playing a massive role on mobile, and YouTube is a real asset [for Google] out here. They are making good money on ads, and benefit from the fragmentation of the ecosystem, as recommendations and search matter a lot more in Southeast Asia than in mature online markets with dominant digital players.”Mobile ad spending in the six countries that make up Southeast Asia — Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore — is expected to reach $1.4bn next year and surpass $2bn in 2020, according to eMarketer. Sea, formerly known as Garena, controversially includes Taiwan in its greater Southeast Asia definition.The region, notes Max Bittner, Lazada chief executive, is far from homogenous — it has different languages, religions and cultures — but what the countries have in common is “an exploding middle class, comparable to China a decade ago”.“In Southeast Asia, this middle class explosion is happening simultaneously with the ongoing smartphone revolution, and all the growth in retail is driven solely by ecommerce,” he adds, noting that the catalyst was the $100 smartphones that began going on sale in late 2012.Making money on ecommerce is a tougher proposition, notes one player: “We’ve seen competitors come and go quite frequently over the past five years.”Sea’s initial public offering prospectus makes the same point, warning “we may fail to monetise our business effectively” and “we have a history of net losses and we may not achieve profitability in the future”. Its operating loss grew to $205m in its latest fiscal year and $150.5m in the first six months of this year.This partly reflects bloated operating and marketing costs. Logistics are tough — unlike the US or Europe, some of these markets lack a large efficient postal network or big regional players like UPS or DHL — and the land-grab means companies are using big subsidies to woo customers.Analysts and investors note that connections and local knowledge hands an advantage to domestic players. Tiang Lim Foo of Seed-Plus, an early-stage investor, says it was local knowledge that helped Indonesia’s Go-Jek, as it filled its fleet with motorbikes in traffic-jammed Indonesian cities, reducing Uber to the sidelines.Amazon, meanwhile, whose entry into Singapore earlier this year was marred by being forced to halt orders when demand exceeded its ability to ship goods, has been reduced to co-opting Uber cars to deliver, according to local players.With a big and growing market at stake, there is little to suggest any reining in of spending any time soon, as competition for online business in the region intensifies.As Sea warns would-be investors in its prospectus, this means the odds of success are weighted in favour of the biggest players: “As ecommerce in [Greater South East Asia] is relatively new, competition for market share is particularly intense . . . Global ecommerce companies . . . in particular may have greater access to financial, technological and marketing resources than we do.”Behind all ecosystems looms the cloud — vast data centres capable of storing the troves of data thrown off by gamers, shoppers and all the other users of internet services offered by the big US, Chinese and local players.Demand for cloud services is compounded by different regulatory regimes across the region, some of which require local data to be held onshore. Google, one of the big cloud providers globally, clearly intends to be a player in Southeast Asia too — toilet cubicles at its Singapore offices were recently plastered with ads appealing: “Google Cloud team is looking for customer engineers in APAC”.Sea’s IPO filing, lamenting the region’s lack of qualified technical talent, notes its dependence on third-party data centre providers, echoing Snap’s admission of reliance on Google’s cloud services in its own IPO documentation earlier this year.Thus, the aggressive hiring of engineers and building of data centres, particularly by Alibaba and Google.“There’s an arms race with cloud,” says Niranjan Arasaratnam, Singapore-based global head of the TMT sector for Linklaters, the legal firm. “Microsoft, [Amazon Web Services] and Google are all pushing [ahead], but my money’s on Alibaba and Tencent, because they will have the connections and cash and know-how to grow that business.”"
24;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Amazon/UPS/FedEx: Ship shape;Amazon has managed to find a trickier business to jump into;E-commerce is a brutal, grinding business with scant profits and little margin for error. So Amazon naturally wants to drill deeper into another dicier business: transport and logistics. The internet juggernaut has a pilot programme in the US called Seller Flex. Here Amazon would deliver products to customers marketed on its website by third-party sellers, as part of the two-day free shipping programme called Prime.The latest foray into delivery should not be surprising for a company already investing in trucks, planes and drones. Shares in UPS and FedEx dipped following a Bloomberg report on Seller Flex but, for all the established companies that Amazon has hurt, the shipping companies may be the most resilient.UPS and FedEx have a collective enterprise value of nearly $200bn, after the sector essentially consolidated into a duopoly. Complex logistics requires technical expertise and capital investment on a scale only a handful of companies can match.The e-commerce boom has been a tailwind for the pair in recent years and its proportion of revenue is only supposed to accelerate. The problem is shipments to consumers are not as profitable as transporting to businesses. Residential customers are spread out, so resources (fuel, labour) are wasted delivering a gift to grandma.UPS and FedEx then have ramped up capital expenditures, together expected to be $10bn this year or nearly a 10th of revenue, in order to cluster deliveries more efficiently and create “synthetic density”.Such investments are worthwhile and compare favourably with retail. Both FedEx and UPS have operating margins greater than 10 per cent. UPS boasts a return on capital above 20 per cent.In 2016, net shipping expense at Amazon jumped 43 per cent, year over year, to $7bn (total retail revenue was 124bn). Amazon’s promises to customers about quick turnrounds has forced it to wade into an extremely expensive business where it will not be able to cut out FedEx and UPS altogether. And the part of the delivery chain it has entered happens to be the costliest. Amazon investors should be more worried than those at the shipping companies.
25;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:05:21+0000;UPS, Fedex drop on Amazon own delivery service report;;First it was brick and mortar retailers. Then it was grocers. Now Amazon is reportedly looking to disrupt the package delivery industry with its own in-house service.Shares in UPS and Fedex both fell more than 2 per cent in pre-market trading on Thursday after Bloomberg said Amazon is experimenting with a new delivery programme called “Seller Flex” in which the e-commerce juggernaut will pick up packages from third-party sellers on its website and deliver the goods to the consumers.Amazon has been making moves towards running its own delivery logistics network in recent years – filing patents for a drone delivery system, leasing planes, opening its own cargo air hub and buying a fleet of delivery trucks.But the Seller Flex service, which Bloomberg said has already started on a trial basis this year on the west coast with a broader roll-out planned in 2018, would mark Amazon’s boldest attempt yet to lessen its dependence on UPS and Fedex for the most crucial part of its appeal to shoppers – quick, reliable delivery.America’s addiction to online shopping was a boon for both UPS and Fedex with the surge in e-commerce related deliveries padding the companies’ bottom lines and sending their shares to fresh highs this year.
26;UPS;United Parcel Service;2017-08-21T07:13:29Z;Total to buy Maersk Oil for $7.45bn;;Container shipping group AP Moller-Maersk has agreed to sell its oil and gas division to Total for $7.45bn, as it seeks to focus on its core transport and logistics businesses.The sale marks the first step in Maersk’s move to break itself up and is likely to be the biggest single transaction. Maersk will receive approximately $4.95bn in Total shares, and Total will assume $2.5bn of short term debt to fund the remainder of the deal. It will also take over all decommissioning obligations, worth around $2.9bn.The Danish group is getting rid of all its energy-related businesses – which also includes drilling rig and oil tanker units – to concentrate on being a transport and logistics group, centred on the world’s largest container shipping line. It gave itself a two-year deadline last September to achieve the break-up through sales, stock market listings, or mergers.Maersk has boosted its container business by buying Hamburg Süd, the German operator with a strong position in Latin America, for $4bn. It is also seeking to integrate closer Maersk Line with its port terminals business and other logistics arms in an attempt to become the UPS or FedEx of container logistics, according to Soren Skou, chief executive.Maersk said it expected to record a gain of about $2.8bn from the deal and that it would return a “material portion” of that to shareholders, subject to securing its investment-grade credit rating first. Shareholders could expect an extraordinary dividend, share buyback, or distribution of the Total shares Maersk will receive in the deal.Total promised to “maintain Maersk Oil’s strong position in the North Sea,” and its deal comes after it said last month it was ready to make acquisitions while global assets were still cheap.Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive of Total, said in July that the company had a “strong balance sheet” and would “take advantage of the low-cost environment by being able to launch profitable projects and acquire resources under attractive conditions”.Total has proved more resilient than many other oil companies following the price slump that struck the industry from 2014, cutting costs faster and earlier, which is now allowing it to invest in new projects.It has already started making major investments, earlier this year signing a multibillion-dollar agreement to develop part of South Pars — the world’s largest gasfield shared between Iran and Qatar.The transaction is subject to regulatory approval from the Danish Minister of Energy and a consultation process with Total employees. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.
27;UPS;United Parcel Service;2017-08-03T10:44:08Z;SoftBank invests $250m in online lender Kabbage;;"SoftBank is investing $250m in Kabbage, one of the biggest US online lenders to small businesses, in a deal that could provide the firepower for a potential takeover of
OnDeck Capital, a rival digital lender.The investment by a subsidiary of SoftBank cements the Japanese telecoms and technology group as the heavyweight backer of fast-growing financial technology, or “fintech”, groups that are challenging traditional banks around the world.Kathryn Petralia, co-founder of Kabbage, told the Financial Times that the deal would finance growth in the company’s direct lending operation, which has provided nearly $3.5bn of funding to more than 100,000 small businesses in the US.She said the latest funding round, which takes the total raised by the company to $500m and values it well over $1bn, would also fund an expansion of its “platform” that partners with banks to help them make automated loans to small businesses.There has been speculation that Kabbage is planning to make a bid for OnDeck, a rival online lender that went public in 2014 and has since suffered an 80 per cent fall in its share price, hit by growing losses, rising defaults and higher funding costs.Kabbage declined to comment on the speculation. Ms Petralia said the SoftBank investment would allow the company to diversify away from its main offer of up to $150,000 lines of credit. It plans to develop “customised products” such as invoice financing and asset-backed loans. “These are all problems that are solvable.”Kabbage was founded in Atlanta nine years ago to provide loans to vendors on eBay. It uses an artificial intelligence system that analyses hundreds of real-time sources of data on companies — from Facebook pages to UPS shipping accounts — to provide an automated lending process.Ms Petralia said 95 per cent of its small business borrowers “have a 100 per cent automated experience” and they complete loan applications in 10 minutes on average — compared with the many days it can take at a traditional bank.“Our customers can get a checking account at a bank, but they just can’t get a small business loan — the banks won’t lend to them — so they have no choice but to come to us,” she said.Kabbage provides its loans through Celtic Bank, a Utah-chartered lender. It has financed its rapid growth by securitising loan repayments. Ms Petralia said it kept the credit risk on the loans and had reserved 6 cents in every dollar of loans for bad debts — “we’re pretty comfortable with that”.SoftBank has invested in several of the world’s leading fintech companies, leading funding rounds worth more than $1bn at Paytm, the Indian digital payments and ecommerce company, and SoFi, the biggest online lender in the US.The Kabbage investment will be offered to the $93bn Vision Fund, a technology investment vehicle that SoftBank set up recently with Saudi Arabia and other partners.SoftBank will take two seats on the Kabbage board. Ms Petralia said the Japanese group “could certainly help us expand in Asia”. The online lender has already teamed up with Banco Santander of Spain, ING in the Netherlands and Scotiabank of Canada, which have all invested in the company and use its technology to automate their lending to small businesses.Other investors in Kabbage include BlueRun Ventures, SV Angel, Mohr Davidow Ventures, Thomvest Ventures, Reverance Capital Partners, UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund, Warren Stephens, and David Bonderman, founder of TPG Capital."
28;UPS;United Parcel Service;2017-07-27T20:45:15Z;UPS shares hit on bumper day for corporate results;Nasdaq and S&P 500 lose ground while Dow moves higher;UPS tumbled by the most in nearly six months on Thursday, with $3.3bn wiped off its market value, after the US package delivery and logistics company cautioned that the strong growth of the first six months of the year might cool in the second half.The stock fell as much as 4.3 per cent to $107.50, its weakest level in almost two months. The decline comes despite UPS recording another bumper increase in sales and profits in the second quarter thanks to surging ecommerce related deliveries. It shares closed 4 per cent lower on Thursday at $107.79.However, investors appeared rattled by the company’s cautious note that currency headwinds, alongside continued investment in building up its business-to-consumer shipping strategy, would weigh on results.For the three months to end of June, revenue jumped 7.7 per cent to $15.75bn, ahead of market expectations for $15.5bn. The bulk of the gains were driven by the US business — by far the largest for UPS. The division reported an 8.1 per cent rise in revenue to $9.7bn, boosted by higher shipping volume and better pricing after UPS raised rates late last year.UPS’s international business also turned in a strong quarter, with revenue up almost 3 per cent to $3.1bn. Its supply chain and freight delivery unit, meanwhile, saw sales rise to $2.8bn, from the $2.5bn reported in the year-ago period.Despite its comments on currency headwinds, UPS reaffirmed its 2017 guidance. It still sees adjusted diluted EPS guidance to come in at between $5.80 and $6.10, which includes about $400m, or $0.30 a share, of pre-tax currency headwinds.A cautious comment on forward trading also hit Southwest Airlines. The country’s largest low-cost airline saw its shares drop 5 per cent to $56.57 after saying it expects revenue per seat mile flown to grow only about 1 per cent in the third quarter compared with the previous year. That is down from the 1.5 per cent growth recorded during the second quarter.The comment overshadowed Southwest’s solid second quarter performance, with both revenue and net income coming in ahead of Wall Street expectations.Elsewhere, Bristol-Myers Squibb was under pressure, with investors scrutinising its key cancer drug after a trial at rival AstraZeneca suffered a big setback.The group’s shares dropped as much 7 per cent, following a nearly 15 per cent fall in AstraZeneca’s US-listed shares. The stock later trimmed its losses, closing 3.1 per cent lower at $54.24.In the broader market, the S&P 500 slipped 0.1 per cent to 2,475.4, the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.6 per cent to 6,382.2 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 21,796.6.The telecoms sector led the way higher after Verizon Communications rallied 7.7 per cent to $47.81 after it revealed upbeat quarterly results. AT&T rose 3.6 per cent to $39.41.
29;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:05:21+0000;UPS cashes in on Americans’ online shopping addiction;;Americans’ addiction to online shopping continues to be a boon for UPS.The US package delivery and logistics company posted another bumper increase in sales and profits during the second quarter as e-commerce related deliveries surged.For the three months to end of June, revenue jumped 7.7 per cent to $15.75bn, ahead of market expectations for $15.5bn.The bulk of the gains were driven by the US business – by far UPS’s largest. The division reported an 8.1 per cent rise in revenue to $9.7bn, boosted by growing business-to-consumer (B2C) shipments and higher prices after UPS raised rates late last year.UPS’s international business also turned in a strong quarter, with revenue up 2.8 per cent at $3.1bn. Its supply chain and freight delivery unit meanwhile saw sales rise to $2.8bn, from the $2.5bn reported in the prior year period.Net income was 9.1 per cent higher at $1.38bn, or $1.58 per diluted share, easily trouncing analysts forecast for $1.28bn, or $1.46 a share.Still UPS cautioned that the strong growth seen in the first half might be tempered in the second half by currency headwinds and its continued investment into building up its B2C strategy. It reaffirmed 2017 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be between $5.80 and $6.10, which includes about $400 million, or $0.30 per share of pre-tax currency headwinds.Shares in UPS, down 2 per cent so far this year, dipped 0.7 per cent in pre-market trading.
30;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:59:53+0000;UPS cashes in on America’s online shopping addiction;;America’s addiction to online shopping was a boon for US package delivery and logistics company UPS during the first quarter.The company saw revenue climb 6.2 per cent to$15.31bn during the first three months of the year, compared to the prior year period, as it shipped and delivered ever more packages and raised some of its prices to customers to offset higher fuel costs.Net income came in at $1.15bn, or $1.32 a share. Both sales and profits handily beat Wall Street estimates, which had forecast net income of $1.12bn, or $1.28 a share on revenue of $15.18bn.“Revenue came in strong this quarter with all segments adding to the topline,” said David Abney, UPS chairman and CEO. “We are accelerating investments to create the industry’s leading smart global logistics network and value-creating portfolio. UPS customers are benefiting from expanded capacity, choice and improved time-in-transit, while technology solutions continue to deliver efficiencies.”The US business – by far UPS’s largest – reported a 5 per cent jump in revenue to $9.53bn during the quarter as e-commerce related deliveries surged. Average daily package volume in the US was up 2.6 per cent while average revenue per package rose by a similar margin after UPS raised rates late last year, adding among other things higher surcharges for large packages.UPS’s international business also turned in a strong quarter, with revenue up 5 per cent to $3.05bn amid increased demand for cross-border shipments. Its supply chain and freight delivery unit saw sales rise to $2.72bn, from the $2.42bn reported in the prior year period.The company reiterated its guidance for the 2017. It expects adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $5.80 and $6.10.
31;UPS;United Parcel Service;2017-03-07T17:30:22Z;UPS achieves hollow victory over blocked TNT deal;Court defeat for EU competition watchdog may open way for damages claims;Europe’s highest court has annulled Brussels’ decision to block the proposed merger between UPS and TNT Express in 2013, in a rare defeat for the EU’s antitrust watchdog that paves the way to possible damages claims.The ruling, which turned on procedural mis-steps, is a hollow victory for UPS, which had agreed to buy Dutch delivery group TNT for €5bn before the commission veto. After the US logistics group had its plans thwarted, its arch-rival FedEx bought TNT.The EU’s general court ruled that the commission “infringed UPS’ rights of defence” by basing its final decision on an econometric analysis that had changed from that discussed with UPS during the process.“This is a significant defeat for the commission,” said Nicholas Levy, an antitrust lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb, noting that it was the first time in more than a decade that the court found that the regulator wrongly blocked a transaction.The setback comes as Margrethe Vestager, competition commissioner, is weighing approvals on three megadeals — Dow Chemical’s $140bn merger with Dupont, ChemChina’s $44bn purchase of Syngenta and Deutsche Börse’s €29bn bid for the London Stock Exchange, which is struggling to win approval.Brussels may appeal the court’s decision, which opens the regulator to potential damages claims from UPS as well as TNT shareholders who lost out when the deal was blocked.However, “the bar for a damages action is significantly higher [than it was for the current ruling]”, said Georg Berrisch, antitrust litigator at Baker Botts, adding potential damages claims from investors are likely ‘an uphill battle’ but are “not without prospect of success”.[The error identified by the court this week] concerns the commission’s handling of evidence and its respect for the merging parties’ rights of defenceThe last time the courts overruled the regulator’s decision to block a deal was in 2002 when the judges annulled three decisions in one year — in the proposed deals of Airtours/First Choice, Schneider/Legrand and Tetra Laval/Sidel.The error identified by the court this week “concerns the commission’s handling of evidence and its respect for the merging parties’ rights of defence, exposing shortcomings that the great package of reforms passed [by then-competition commissioner Mario Monti] in 2003 following a trilogy of similar judgments by the EU Courts were designed to address,” said Mr Levy.Economic models are increasingly important evidence in antitrust regulators’ analysis in Europe, the US and beyond. “Over the past decade, in particularly difficult merger cases, the economic analysis has become more and more important,” said Jonas Koponen competition lawyer at Linklaters.“It is fine to develop new techniques in order to understand and predict the effect of mergers and analyse competitive effects but it’s important also that the investigative process is sufficiently open to the parties in order to test that evidence before the final decisions are made,” added Mr Koponen.Joaquín Almunia, then competition commissioner, blocked the UPS-TNT merger in January 2013, citing concerns that the deal would have drastically reduced choice and would be likely to increase prices for small-parcel delivery in the EU.TNT was subsequently bought by FedEx for €4bn in a deal unconditionally approved in January 2016 by Ms Vestager. The tie-up did not raise concerns “because FedEx and TNT are not particularly close competitors and because the merged entity will continue to face sufficient competition from its rivals in all markets concerned,” said Ms Vestager on the day of approval.She noted that competition authorities replicated the assessment used in the UPS/TNT case to ensure “full consistency with its previous practice”.UPS welcomed Tuesday’s result and said “the most significant aspect of this decision is its impact in helping to preserve a competitive environment in Europe by clarifying the procedure and relevant criteria for merger approval”.The commission will “carefully analyse” the judgment. It said it fully recognised the importance of giving parties the full rights of defence and “strives to give parties ample and sufficient opportunities to comment and respond to the economic and econometric analysis that the commission relies upon in merger cases, notably in its in-depth investigations”.
32;UPS;United Parcel Service;2017-03-07T12:29:31Z;EU court annuls 2013 block of UPS/TNT merger;;The European court has annulled the watchdog’s 2013 decision to block the proposed mail merger between UPS and TNT, the first such defeat in over a decade.American UPS agreed to buy Dutch delivery group TNT Express for €5bn in 2012. After an in-depth probe, then-Competition Commissioner Joaquín Almunia blocked the merger in January 2013, citing concerns the deal would have ‘drastically reduced choice’ and likely increase prices for small-parcel delivery in the EU.But the General Court of the EU has now found that the European Commission “infringed UPS’ rights of defence” by basing its final decision on an econometric analysis that had changed from the one discussed with UPS during the process.“This is a significant defeat for the Commission,” said Nicholas Levy, an antitrust lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb, “not only because the Court has determined that the Commission wrongly annulled a transaction – the first such decision for over a decade – in circumstances where the transaction in question can no longer take place, but also because the error identified by the Court concerns the Commission’s handling of evidence and its respect for the merging parties’ rights of defense, exposing shortcomings that the great package of reforms passed in 2003 following a trilogy of similar judgments by the EU Courts were designed to address.”Mr Almunia said at the time of the decision in January 2013: “We worked hard with UPS on possible remedies until very late in the procedure, but what they offered was simply not enough to address the serious competition problems we identified.”TNT was subsequently bought by FedEx for €4.4bn in a deal unconditionally approved in January 2016 by current commissioner Margrethe Vestager. She stated at the time that the tie-up did not raise concerns “because FedEx and TNT are not particularly close competitors and because the merged entity will continue to face sufficient competition from its rivals in all markets concerned”.Ms Vestager had also noted that they “replicated the same assessment as was undertaken in the UPS/TNT case “ to ensure “full consistency with its previous practice”.UPS welcomed Tuesday’s decision and said: “The most significant [point] of this decision is its impact in helping to preserve a competitive environment in Europe by clarifying the procedure and relevant criteria for merger approval.”Commenting on the decision, the European Commission said:The Court has based its annulment on a procedural ground, namely that the Commission did not communicate to UPS the final version of the econometric model used in the contested decision, infringing the rights of defence of UPS.Today’s judgment focuses on the specific circumstances of the conduct of the administrative procedure in the UPS/TNT Express case of 2013.The Commission fully recognises the importance of giving parties the full rights of defence. The Commission strives to give parties ample and sufficient opportunities to comment and respond to the economic and econometric analysis that the Commission relies upon in merger cases, notably in its in-depth investigations.The Commission will carefully analyse the judgment.
33;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
34;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Dow Transports index breaks 5-day losing streak;;The Dow Transports index ended a five day losing streak — its longest since last April — on Friday, as shares of FedEx, UPS, and Kirby gained renewed momentum.The index’s gains, which coincided with a rise by the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, is closely watched by Dow theorists. Earlier this month, both indices closed at record levels, which is viewed by some investors as a sign of good news to come. The transports are also closely scrutinised as a barometer of broader US economic growth.Shares of Kirby, which operates tank barges, climbed 6 per cent to $68.50, Ryder System gained 2 per cent to $73.54, FedEx rose 2 per cent to $188.54 and UPS advanced 2 per cent to $106.97.Despite the enthusiasm for shipping groups, the same investor appetites did not extend to airline stocks on Friday. The NYSE Arca airline index was barely positive for the day and has lagged of late after climbing to a 15-year year higher earlier this year.The stocks have come under pressure as fuel and labour costs have risen, alongside concern a travel ban implemented by the Trump administration could curtail demand from some international markets.Shares of SkyWest dropped 5 per cent to $35.05 while Allegiant Travel and Alaska Air Group were down less than 1 per cent to $162.20 and $94.25, respectively. An advance of less than 1 per cent by Delta, United and American offset those declines.
35;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:59:53+0000;UPS shares fall as 2017 forecast trails estimates;;A canary in the coal mine for the US economy?Shares in UPS fell more than 4 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday after the US package delivery and logistics company, whose massive footprint makes it a closely watched economic bellwether, issued earnings guidance for the 2017 year that trailed estimates.The company said it expects adjusted diluted earnings per share to come in between $5.80 to $6.10 this year – compared to the average of $6.17 forecast by analysts – as a result of the stronger dollar, which is expected to shave 30 cents off its adjusted EPS and lower the EPS growth rate by some 500 basis points.UPS also issued fourth-quarter sales and earnings that fell short of forecasts.Despite a busy holiday season that helped lift shipping volumes 7.1 per cent during the three months to end of December, revenue rose just 5.4 per cent to $16.93bn, shy of the $17bn the market was expecting.Adjusted net income, which strips out a series of accounting charges for pensions, came in at $1.43bn, or $1.63 per diluted share. Analysts had penned in $1.48bn or $1.69 per diluted share.Including the impact from the mark-to-market pension charges, UPS fell into a net loss of $239m for the quarter.Shares in UPS have jumped as much as 10 per cent since Donald Trump’s election win to hit a record high of $120.44 on December 22. Since then the stock has given back some of its gains and closed at $117.03 on Monday. The shares were off 4.1 per cent in pre-market trading.
36;UPS;United Parcel Service;2016-12-16T05:51:43Z;Start-ups in Chicago find that focus on B2B clients pays off;Innovative apps address real-life needs in the city’s traditional industries;"When Jim Boccarossa met Stephanie Murphy, he did not know anything about the aviation industry. She had spent 10 years in the business, however, brokering spare parts.“We were dating and I found it very interesting that it might be the biggest small industry you’ve never heard of,” he says. He also, he adds, found that the system the aerospace industry used for buying and selling parts “archaic”.The participants included well known groups such as Boeing, Airbus, GE and Honeywell — some of the biggest companies in the world — but they were “buying and selling parts using technology from the 1980s”. Mr Boccarossa had founded a few start-ups and he and Ms Murphy sensed a chance to combine expertise.Two years ago, Ms Murphy launched Air Spares Unlimited — an online brokerage for landing gear, wheels and brakes — and brought in Mr Boccarossa, now her husband, to be its chief executive.The company is one of many that form the core of the technology scene in Chicago, which tends to tilt away from the glamorous social media apps of the US coasts, and toward start-ups serving other businesses or the industries that have deep roots in the region, such as manufacturing and logistics. Even the better-known Chicago-born Groupon, the site which offers daily deals on goods and services to retail customers, has strong connections to the city’s corporate past. It is housed in the former home of Montgomery Ward, the mail-order catalogue giant that was an antecedent to ecommerce.One reason for the Chicago tech scene’s low-key approach, Mr Boccarossa says, is that tech talent in the city has “realistic business expectations”.“They understand that this isn’t building an app so I can take a picture to send to my friends; this is building software so people can buy wheels to land a plane,” he says. “We’re building real B2B technology . . . you have real companies here who look at real revenue streams to solve real-life problems.”If you’re a start-up you need a paying customer, and there’s a lot of them in ChicagoLinda Darragh, who taught Mr Boccarossa at the Innovation and Entrepreneur Initiative at Northwestern University’s Kellogg business school, says the diversity of Chicago’s economy — in which no industry accounts for more than about 15 per cent of city GDP — is a leading driver.“I see Chicago as basically a Petri dish for entrepreneurs to test and build tech-enablement for existing established industries, so you start looking at what industries are in Chicago, it’s all over the place — it’s everything from healthcare to transportation,” she says. “So there’s a lot of opportunity to really get into the ecosystem of an industry and improve upon it.”UI Labs provides those kinds of opportunities. It is a public-private, non-profit “innovation accelerator” that receives funding from major industrial companies such as Caterpillar, GE and Deere, and from the government. One focus, says Caralynn Nowinski Collens who heads the organisation, is manufacturing. UI Labs is running more than 30 industrial projects through its labs and its factory floor.“We have so many legacy strengths in old-line legacy industries — not the sexy ones, but things like construction or manufacturing,” she says.Trend of moving out to the suburbs is now being reversedThe city has bolstered those roots with over 100 entrepreneurial environments, including accelerators, incubators, co-working spaces and innovation hubs, says Mark Tebbe, chair of Chicago Next, a tech-focused group connected to the city’s economic development organisation.The group has created industry-specific incubators for financial technology linked to Chicago’s long history with the futures industry, with water — given the city’s place on the shores of Lake Michigan — and with manufacturing. “You have a diversified base of businesses [and industries] to work with,” says Mr Tebbe, a former tech entrepreneur. “This makes for a strong customer base — if you’re a start-up or a tech company, the one thing you need is a paying customer and there’s a lot of them in Chicago.”Jodi Navta, chief marketing officer for Coyote, the logistics company that last year was sold to UPS for $1.8bn, agrees. “Being the epicentre of the Midwest is good for a lot of reasons: there are a lot of businesses that we can help locally, a lot of carriers that we can build relationships with that are local,” she says.A diversified business landscape gives rise to companies like SMS Assist, which in June raised $150m from Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, giving it a $1bn valuation. SMS manages 25,000 property management subcontractors in over 135,000 client locations. “You wouldn’t think of a maintenance company with 100 to 150 code-writing technologists,” says its chief Mike Rothman.Four Kites is a logistics company founded by Matt Elenjickal, who spent years working in supply chain management. He says one reason such low-glamour companies have taken off in the city is because local venture capital firms are willing to take risks on businesses that may not generate headlines.“There are a lot of VC firms in Chicago who really focus on B2B, who focus on these industries that are not sexy,” he says.*This article has been amended since original publication to clarify SMS Assist’s business operations."
37;UPS;United Parcel Service;2016-10-27T12:08:22Z;UPS sales top estimates despite dollar, fuel drag;;United Parcel Service said changes in fuel surcharges and strength in the US dollar dragged on revenue growth in the third quarter, prompting the US package delivery company and economic bellwether to report sales that were modestly ahead of analysts’ estimates.The Atlanta-based company said profits climbed to $1.27bn or $1.44 a share in line with Wall Street’s estimates in the three months ended in September, compared with $1.26bn or $1.39 a share in the year ago period.Sales rose five per cent to $14.9bn, compared with analysts’ estimates for $14.7bn.Domestic package revenue rose 4.8 per cent in the third quarter from a year ago to $9.3bn, but fuel surcharge rates knocked about 40 basis points off its revenue per package.Meanwhile, international package revenue rose 2.2 per cent to $3bn, while operating profit rose 14 per cent to $576m.UPS bought Coyote Logistics last year to expand into the freight brokerage business and support its operations during peak holiday shopping season. Coyote arranges customers’ freight shipments on available trucks.But news that Jeff Bezos’ e-commerce business Amazon has entered into agreements with Air Transport Services Group to lease air cargo planes to support one and two-day delivery in the US, has raised concerns about the prospects of US couriers like FedEx and UPS.UPS reaffirmed its full-year adjusted earnings outlook of $5.70 to $5.90 a share as it heads into the key holiday and shopping season in the US.Richard Peretz, chief financial officer, said:Through the third quarter we are performing according to our expectations, and we’ve taken the necessary steps to ensure we capitalize on record volume levels during peak season. As a result, we remain confident in achieving our 2016 full-year guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share.UPS shares have gained 13 per cent so far this year.

We reaffirm our guidance for 2016 full-year diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.90.”Investors have been anxious about the threat to US couriers like FedEx and UPS from e-commerce retailer Amazon, which earlier this year announced that it had entered into agreements with Air Transport Services Group to lease 20 air cargo planes to support one and two-day delivery in the US.But business in US remain resilient. Revenue for the US was up 2.4 per cent at $9bn while overseas delivery business saw sales rose 1.1 per cent to $3.07bn during the period.

40;UPS;United Parcel Service;2016-06-16T10:21:08Z;Shares rise after boy band name change for ad group;;"Shares in advertising technology group Blinkx have bucked the trend in a falling market on Thursday, rising after the company changed its name to the decidedly boybandish RhythmOne.Stock in the Aim-quoted company, which is wrestling to move out of the red, rose 1.3 per cent to £1.96 as indices across Europe suffered another sell-off, writes Lucinda Elliott.Losses in the year to March ballooned to $94.2m, nearly four times larger than the $24.8m shortfall recorded in the previous financial year.Throughout 2015 the company rolled together several of its brands under the RhythmOne umbrella, which offers adverts targeted across both mobile and desktop devices.The move was an effort to tap into increased use of mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones to consume content.New and repeat advertisers include Kellogg’s cereal, UPS delivery and JC Penny, the US department store.The name change comes at a “pivotal” time, said chief executive Brian Mukherjee following a “transformational year” for the company that
reaffirmed it’s planned return to profitability by 2017.Questions raised in 2014 by Ben Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, about the legitimacy of the company’s business model has hurt the Blinkx name ever since."
41;UPS;United Parcel Service;2016-05-30T03:00:26Z;Could Amazon’s global delivery vision break Alibaba?;;Speculation is rife that Amazon is soon to establish itself as a global shipping and logistics expert, in a move coined internally as project ‘Dragon Boat’.While this bold strategy has the potential to significantly increase margins and position Amazon as Chinese businesses’ gateway to the West, a considered and phased implementation is essential if the firm is to gain share of the cross-border e-commerce market from industry leader Alibaba.Leaked documents suggest that the wheels are already in motion, with Amazon having begun leasing planes as well as registering itself as an ocean freight booking business. In consolidating the supply chain to provide a holistic delivery solution, the firm will in effect create a network which controls the flow of goods from factories in China to consumer’s homes in the US and Europe.While pitting itself in direct competition with the likes of FedEx and UPS, Amazon will also aim to facilitate a route to the international marketplace for smaller manufacturers ahead of Alibaba, the leading force in Chinese e-commerce.Amazon’s strategy is a shrewd one. The majority of online transactions are largely price-driven – product sales yield small margins and much of the additional margin is extracted from the shipping and delivery of goods.It is likely that Amazon will build its logistics offering from the ground up, acting as a market disruptor by automating the ordering, shipping and delivery process. To do so, the firm must ensure that it develops a keen understanding of how to efficiently navigate customs, pack consignments to balance weight-volume ratios and ensure all required paperwork is complete and accounted for.Once Amazon has found its feet in providing a global shipping and freight delivery provision, its key differentiator is the ability to tap into, and apply, its existing automated warehouse, sorting and distribution model. In taking control of first and last mile delivery, from a Chinese factory to a sorting centre or port, and from a western logistics hub direct to the consumer, it can consolidate the entire supply chain, driving cost savings as a result.While there are immediate monetary benefits from muscling in on the multi-billion dollar international logistics market already trading on Amazon deliveries, passing on a proportion of these savings to Chinese suppliers will incentivise a multitude of new entrants to export to overseas buyers.However, there are significant risks associated with this aggressive growth strategy and Amazon must learn from Alibaba’s shortcomings. Described by some as the “world’s biggest marketplace for fakes”, Alibaba’s effort to stem the flow of counterfeit products is widely regarded by anti-counterfeit groups as insufficient and the firm has been the subject of numerous legal challenges as a result.Just this month, Alibaba’s member status was suspended by the Washington DC-based International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC) due to the discovery of an undisclosed conflict of interest. In retaliation, the firm’s CEO Jack Ma pulled out from his scheduled slot as a speaker at the Coalition’s annual conference.These events have caused Alibaba considerable reputational damage and Amazon will be eager to ensure it does not suffer the same fate. To avoid this, clear, swift and enforceable anti-counterfeiting regulations must be enforced by Amazon, facilitating the timely removal of products suspected to breach intellectual property legislation. Furthermore, opening the floodgates to a high volume of new products supplied by Chinese manufacturers could easily lead to a dip in product quality, which in turn could cause consumer dissatisfaction.While in practice, employing a team of on-the-ground quality assurance professionals who are on hand to examine product specifications and audit supplier factories would be the most comprehensive solution, this is unlikely to prove achievable or cost-effective for an operation of this vast scale.In reality, it is likely that Amazon will turn to its online community as quality controller, gathering customer feedback and approaching suppliers whose products are evidenced to be dangerous, ineffective or of a poor standard.Amazon’s transition to becoming an international logistics provider will be a staged process, beginning with its establishment as a shipping and freight specialist, with bolt on first and last mile services then added to encourage new market entrants.However, the installation of this far-reaching network could eventually facilitate the opposite flow of goods, providing the means for Western firms to engage with Chinese consumers. Here, the scope for product demand is somewhat more limited, with luxury goods, designer products and highly personalised items most likely to attract buyers.In launching its quest for global logistics dominance and establishing a consolidated and automated supply chain, Amazon is well-placed to challenge Alibaba for an increased share of the international e-commerce market. Ensuring that quality, legal and operational risks are identified at the offset is essential if the firm is to maintain the integrity and increase the profitability of its brand.Dominic Jephcott is CEO at global procurement and supply chain specialist Vendigital.Back to beyondbrics
42;UPS;United Parcel Service;2016-05-06T00:32:48Z;Amazon deal doubles size of air cargo fleet;Group leases 20 Boeing 767 jets from Atlas Air Worldwide as it attempts to keep up with growth;Amazon has signed a new leasing deal for cargo jets, doubling the size of its fleet and underscoring its ambitions to grow its air transport network.The news comes as Amazon has been investing heavily in its logistics network and taking more logistics operations in-house. The retailer has experienced rapid growth in sales and in units shipped — which rose 28 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively, last quarter— and executives say they have had to take control over more logistics operations to keep up with growth.Under the new deal, Amazon will lease 20 Boeing 767 cargo jets from Atlas Air Worldwide, an aviation company based in New York state, for seven years. Amazon will also have the option to purchase up to 30 per cent of Atlas Air Worldwide at a predetermined price of $37.50 per share, a slight discount to Wednesday’s closing price.Amazon has previously said that its cargo fleet will be used to support the growth of Prime membership in the US, which includes two-day shipping. Analysts said the planes would probably be used to transport goods between Amazon warehouses.“I am a little surprised at the number of aircraft,” said David Vernon, analyst at Bernstein. “Going from zero to 20 was a lot, and now they’ve doubled that. It seems like they have this pressing need for expedited transport of inventory.”Amazon’s moves have raised questions about whether the company, which loses more than $1bn each quarter on shipping, may be trying to lessen its dependence on its traditional logistics partnerships such as FedEx and UPS.“It doesn’t appear to me that they are re-creating the UPS or the FedEx parcel network,” Mr Vernon said, pointing out that Amazon does not currently use UPS or FedEx for the type of rapid warehouse transport that the new fleet will provide. “It is hard to know because it is an entirely new development — we have never seen a supply chain like this built before.”Amazon said during earnings last week that it would keep investing in logistics. “We continue to add logistics capacity really to supplement our other carriers,” said Brian Olsavksy, chief financial officer. “The main driver here is to be able to handle faster and faster delivery speeds.”The deal with Atlas is similar in structure to Amazon’s first leasing agreement, in which it leased 20 jets from Air Transportation Services Group and had the option to acquire up to 20 per cent of the company.Also on Thursday, Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and chief executive, sold $670m in Amazon shares, his biggest disposal ever by value. The sale of one million shares was part of a scheduled transaction — Mr Bezos also sold 1m shares last year and in the previous year. He remains Amazon’s largest shareholder, owning 17 per cent of the company.
43;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:59:53+0000;UPS rises as Q1 profits beat estimates;;Perhaps some good news for the US economy.UPS, an economic bellwether and US package delivery company, reported better-than-expected first quarter profits aided by strength in its home market.The Atlanta based-company said profits climbed to $1.27 a share in the first three months of the year, compared with $1.12 a share in the year ago period. That topped analysts’ estimates for $1.22 a share. US domestic operating profit rose 7.6 per cent to $1.1bn.Revenue in the US climbed 3.1 per cent year-on-year in the first three months of the year, to $9.1bn, driven in part by high demand from e-commerce shippers. Overseas revenue slid 1.9 per cent, however, stripping out currency, sales were flat from a year ago.That helped overall sales rise 3 per cent to $14.4bn, compared with analysts estimates for $14.6bn.UPS shares, that have advanced nearly 11 per cent so far this year, climbed about 1 per cent in pre-market trading.

It now forecasts a range of $10.70 to $10.90, against a previous range of $10.40 to $10.90.Fred Smith, chief executive, hailed the “strong financial performance”, saying it had been driven by increasing demand for the “broad portfolio” of FedEx business solutions.“We sincerely appreciate the peak season efforts of our FedEx team members who delivered great service despite the challenges of stronger than expected shipping demand, driven by the growth in ecommerce,” he said.The improved profitability derived mainly from a 51 per cent jump, to $595m, in operating income at the core FedEx Express air express business, on revenue down 1 per cent to $6.56bn. The business benefited from higher yields, growing US volumes and falling costs, while revenue fell as a result of the end in fuel-cost surcharges after the sharp decline in the price of oil.At FedEx Ground, operating income fell marginally, to $557m from $559m in the same quarter last year, on revenue up 30 per cent to $4.41bn. Revenues benefited from a change in accounting for revenues of the low-cost FedEx SmartPost business and the acquisition of Genco. Inclusion of both operations reduced margins.FedEx said the narrowed forecast assumed moderate economic growth and excluded pension adjustments, legal matters and any costs related to TNT Express, which FedEx is in the course of taking over.“We now expect our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings to be up 20 per cent to 22 per cent over last year, as we continue to benefit from our execution of the profit improvement programme,” Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said. “Our positive financial momentum should continue into our upcoming fiscal 2017, where we expect solid growth in earnings and cash flow.”The December to February figures would have been substantially different without adjustments for legal issues and the TNT acquisition. Two legal disputes together reduced net income by $169m, while TNT costs reduced net income by $15m. Those effects meant unadjusted net income fell 19 per cent to $507m, while earnings per share fell 16 per cent to $1.84.Like UPS, its main rival, FedEx is adjusting to delivering a far higher proportion of its traffic to residential customers of online retailers, instead of the business customers that previously dominated. The company was forced in December to seek volunteers to deliver packages on Christmas Day after its networks became congested. But it reported no effects from those problems in its results.FedEx’s shares had reached $153.70 in after-hours trade.
45;UPS;United Parcel Service;2016-03-09T17:43:35Z;Amazon leases 20 Boeing 767 freight jets for air cargo programme;Deal has potential to disrupt FedEx and UPS in the $400bn global logistics market;Amazon is taking its ambitions to the skies with a new agreement to lease 20 cargo jets in its boldest step yet to control its own logistics operations.Amazon has been expanding its reach into logistics operations over the past year, with truck trailers, shipping licences, new delivery fleets and now aircraft.The company will lease 20 Boeing 767 jets from Air Transportation Services Group, an air cargo company based in Wilmington, Ohio, that is the world’s largest owner of converted Boeing 767 freight aircraft.The new deal, under which the jets will be leased for five to seven years, marks the first time Amazon has publicly confirmed its secretive air cargo programme. The company reported $1.8bn in shipping losses last year, its worst shipping losses ever, and analysts said the move could help cut costs.The agreement raises the question of how Amazon’s move will affect other logistics providers such as FedEx and UPS, which have generally avoided commenting on Amazon’s moves towards handling its own goods. Amazon is a large client of both companies, and about 4 per cent of UPS’s volume is tied to Amazon.Amazon discovered the potential downside of relying on other companies’ delivery networks over the 2013 Christmas season in North America. UPS’s network became severely congested in December, meaning that many customers received Christmas deliveries only after December 25.Amazon has been expanding not only its cargo networks but also its last-mile delivery services, which could also prove disruptive to other logistics companies. With the introduction of Prime Now, Amazon’s two-hour delivery service, the company has started using fleets of its own drivers to take packages directly to the customer’s door.The ecommerce company has also obtained a freight forwarding licence in China, a potential step toward providing large-scale shipping services to companies that sell on Amazon.com.An Amazon spokeswoman said that the planes would be used in the US and would support growth rather than replacing existing logistics partners. “These planes provide critical capacity expansion to support the growth of Prime in the US,” spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said. “At our scale, supporting growth requires adding some of our own logistics capabilities.”However, a spokesman for ATSG said the leased jets had the ability to fly internationally as well. “It’s up to them how they want to use it,” he said.Colin Sebastian, analyst at RW Baird, said the jets would initially be used to move goods between Amazon warehouses, and between suppliers and warehouses. But he expected Amazon might eventually offer cargo services to other companies, capturing a share of the $400bn global logistics market.Amazon started testing the possibility of freight operations last autumn, leasing two planes from ATSG in September, and expanding its fleet to five planes in November.Amazon’s move into air cargo comes at a time when global air cargo growth has slowed, as market uncertainty has pushed shippers towards a cheaper alternative: shipping by sea. Prices for cargo aircraft have plummeted since the 2008 financial crisis, which will have sharply cut the cost of undertaking this change.In addition to leasing the jets, Amazon also has the option to buy one-fifth of the shares in ATSG over the next five years, at a price of $9.73 per share. Shares in ATSG jumped 19 per cent on the news.
46;UPS;United Parcel Service;2016-02-26T23:44:14Z;Transport delivers hope for equities rebound;Dow barometer records sixth consecutive weekly gain;One of Wall Street’s leading barometers of the US economy suggests a gloomy outlook may be misplaced, bolstering expectations of a stronger rebound for the broad equity market.The Dow Jones Transportation Average achieved its sixth consecutive weekly gain on Friday, repairing a bruising start to the year when the barometer fell some 12 per cent by mid-January.The rebound for the closely watched average, which includes 20 companies such as UPS, railroad Norfolk Southern and Delta Air Lines, is seen as a sign that the broader US equity market can gain further momentum in the coming weeks. Dow Transports have trimmed their loss for the year down to around 1 per cent, leading a recovery being seen in broader measures such as the S&P 500.“We feel as if technically the transportation average appears to have put in a strong bounce and could lead the market up as it did on the way down,” said John Brady, of RJ O’Brien and Associates. “It at least bears watching.”Global stocks were hit hard early in 2016 on concerns about the global economic outlook led by uncertainty over the extent of the slowdown in China. But as March approaches — ahead of crucial central bank meetings in the US and Europe — key market sectors have bounced off their lows recorded earlier this month, fanning hope of a turning point.In the wake of plumbing two-and-a-half-year lows on February 11, global stocks as measured by the FTSE All World index are up 6 per cent, while the S&P 500 is nearly 7 per cent higher.Some, however, are reluctant to call an inflection in market sentiment just yet.“We have had a nice rebound in the industrials, but I think the jury is still out,” said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments.This week, implied volatility as measured by the CBOE’s Vix has traded around a reading of 20, its long-term average, with this closely watched barometer of investor fear well below this month’s peak of 31.“After periods of volatility like we just had, it doesn’t just go away,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “We have to let the volatility play out through the system and that may take us to the beginning of the summer.”He said the financial sector also will be crucial to a market rebound after having fallen sharply this year as expectations for rate hikes diminished with the market turmoil and fears about the European banking sector flared.With a 10.9 per cent drop, financials are the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 so far this year.
47;UPS;United Parcel Service;2016-02-23T19:51:01Z;UPS, FedEx should breath easy over Amazon;;Breath easier, UPS and FedEx. Speculation has been rife that Amazon may be trying to disrupt a new industry: the business of delivering parcels. But analysts at Morgan Stanley reckon the ambitions of founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos are probably far narrower.The Seattle-based company has upended the retail sector by selling a vast array of products online and getting them to customers quickly. It’s also made waves with its lucrative Amazon Web Services division, which allows companies to rent computing power. AWS now powers many big-name brands, such as Netflix.So it’s little surprise that reports indicating Amazon has been in discussions to lease cargo aircraft and buy its own trucks have left investors wondering if the company plans to take on package delivery companies, like UPS and FedEx.But Brian Nowak, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, argues Amazon’s ambitions are far less dramatic. Creating a fully-fledged delivery company would require a “large” investment and returns on that investment would be “uncertain,” he says.[Amazon's] management’s recent comments on delivery, that they are looking to “supplement our existing partners…not…replace them”, aforementioned subscale unit delivery economics, and questions about whether traditional retailers would trust [Amazon] with their package delivery make us skeptical [Amazon] is building a full fledged competitor against the parcel companies.It’s also far-fetched, Mr Nowak argues, that Amazon plans on delivering its own packages on a large scale, despite having spent about $11.5bn last year to ship an estimated 2.2bn packages. The company would not be able to reach critical mass of around 100 packages per driver per day to make such a move economically viable, he says.For perspective, UPS, the biggest US package delivery company, delivers about 220-300 residential packages per driver per day in urban areas. So what, then, does Amazon have up its sleeve?Mr Nowak says it makes sense for Amazon to make its own deliveries in certain densely-populated urban areas (think New York). He estimates there are around 10m members of Amazon’s Prime service, which charges an annual fee for unlimited free two-day delivery, across the 10 biggest US metro areas.Assuming the members order one package a month, that translates into about 380,000 packages delivered per day across the areas.“This would likely be enough density to support in-house delivery and drive long-term cost savings,” Mr Nowak wrote, adding that if Amazon could deliver 150 packages per driver per day in these areas, it would drive $220m in total annual savings.Still, Mr Nowak notes that an sort of Amazon delivery service may still be far off:While the mathematics work, we note that there is still investment required (trucks, loading docks, logistics technologies, hiring/training thousands of drivers,etc.) before [Amazon] could start to meaningfully perform its own delivery.

Hopes of a production cut by members of Opec and other producers that helped drive oil higher last week also dimmed.Oil exploration and production company Marathon Oil was one of the worst performers, falling 10.27 per cent to $8.74 by the close. Transocean, an oil rig operator, slid 7.56 per cent to $9.05.ExxonMobil, an oil major, dropped 2.23 per cent to $74.59 despite reporting a slimmer than expected decline in quarterly profits. Fellow integrated energy company Chevron fell 4.75 per cent to $81.24.Financial companies also faced heavy selling as expectations for when the Federal Reserve may next raise interest rates were pushed back amid the turmoil in global financial markets. Futures markets were pointing to the next rate rise in December — previously expected as early as March just a month ago — according to Bloomberg data. Banks benefit from higher rates since it enables them to earn more on loans.Worries have also risen over banks’ loan exposure to the energy sector.JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, dropped 3.11 per cent to $57.03, extending its year-to-date decline to 13.7 per cent. Bank of America fell 5.23 per cent to $13.23 and Citigroup fell 4.85 per cent to $40.42.Elsewhere, traders bid up Michael Kors after the US fashion accessories retailer posted stronger than expected holiday-quarter sales.The company said sales jumped 6.3 per cent in its fiscal third quarter to $1.4bn, beating expectations of $1.35bn. Net income fell nearly 3 per cent to $294.6m after the company ramped up investment in new store openings and ecommerce. However, the drop was smaller than analysts had forecast.Michael Kors shares surged 23.91 per cent to $50.11, trimming the company’s 12-month loss to around 32 per cent.Eager shoppers also boosted sales and profits at UPS. The US package delivery and logistics company’s net income more than doubled to $1.3bn in the fourth quarter on a 1 per cent rise in sales to $16.1bn, as it reaped the benefit of a surge in online shopping. The shares traded 0.65 per cent higher to $94.69 on the better than expected results.Meanwhile, shares in Axovant, a small biotech pursuing the first approval for a new Alzheimer’s drug in more than a decade, plunged 17.96 per cent to $13.66 after Pfizer pulled the plug on a similar medicine.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.87 per cent to 1,903.01, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 1.80 per cent to 16,154.67 and the Nasdaq Composite had declined around 2 per cent to 4,517.33.
49;UPS;United Parcel Service;2016-02-02T15:55:45Z;UPS boosted by rising ecommerce shipments;Express parcel service forecasts 5%-9% rise in 2016 earnings;Big rises in ecommerce shipments helped UPS to overcome the effects of a strong dollar and falling fuel surcharges to report fourth-quarter results ahead of analysts’ expectations.The express parcel service, which struggled in the fourth quarter in 2013 and 2014, also forecast that 2016 earnings per share would be between 5 and 9 per cent higher than 2015.Net income for the quarter nearly tripled to $1.33bn, from $453m in the fourth quarter of 2014, on revenue up 1 per cent to $16.1bn. The change mainly reflected a series of accounting charges for pensions and US healthcare, including a fall in mark-to-market pension losses to $118m, from $1.06bn in 2014. Excluding the effect of those changes, net income rose 23 per cent to $1.41bn.Diluted earnings per share rose from 49 cents in 2014’s last quarter to $1.48, ahead of analysts’ consensus forecast of $1.43.David Abney, chief executive, said the results built on UPS’s strategy to deliver improved shareholder value.“Our flexible integrated network, close collaboration with customers and the extraordinary efforts of UPSers enabled us to achieve great service and record financial performance this quarter,” Mr Abney said.Much the strongest performance was in the core US domestic package business, which benefited most from rising ecommerce over the peak, pre-Christmas delivery season. Average daily shipments were up 2.4 per cent year-on-year, boosted by a 15 per cent rise in deferred air shipments and a 10 per cent increase in next-day air. Ground shipments grew only 0.4 per cent.UPS and FedEx, its main rival, have benefited from rising ecommerce but sometimes struggled to handle the growing volumes and the increased complexity of delivering more to consumers, rather than businesses.Quarterly operating profit for the US division rose from $444m to $1.28bn, thanks to its share of the accounting charges. Excluding those, operating profit rose 18 per cent to $1.35bn, on revenue up 2.6 per cent to $10.3bn.The international package unit was held back by the dollar’s strength. Quarterly operating profit rose from $335m to $580m, on revenues down 7.3 per cent to $3.18bn. Without the accounting effects, operating profits would have been 16 per cent higher at $624m.In the supply chain and freight logistics business, operating profits excluding the accounting charges were up 11 per cent at $199m, on revenues up 6 per cent at $2.61bn.Richard Peretz, chief financial officer, said the final quarter was UPS’s fourth consecutive quarter of beating financial expectations. “While we face uncertain macroeconomic conditions, we are continuing to invest for profitable growth,” he said.He forecast full-year diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.90, an increase of between 5 and 9 per cent against the $5.43 figure for the whole of 2015, excluding the accounting charges. Full-year earnings per share for 2015, including the various charges, were $5.35.
50;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:59:53+0000;UPS delivers earnings jump, shares gain;;"UPS continued to deliver the goods to investors during the fourth quarter.The US package delivery and logistics company, whose massive footprint makes it a closely-watched economic bellwether, reported a rise in sales and profits as it reaped the benefit of a surge in online shopping.For the December quarter, sales rose 1 per cent to $16.1bn, led by gains in its US domestic package division and its freight businesses. Net income more than doubled to $1.3bn from the $453m reported in the prior year period.“Strong demand from ecommerce shippers contributed to a 2.4% increase in
average daily shipments [in the US]“, UPS said.The strong results stand in sharp contrast to the previous two fourth quarters. In 2013, a last-minute pre-Christmas surge in goods ordered online caught the company off guard, and last year it misjudged demand and overspent in a bid to avoid the problems from the previous year.Despite the uncertain outlook over global growth, UPS said it expects diluted earnings to come in at between $5.70 to $5.90 per share for 2016 – an increase of 5 per cent to 9 per cent over adjusted results for 2015.Shares in UPS, down 5 per cent over the past 12 months, rose 2.6 per cent in pre-market trading."
51;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:05:21+0000;Online orders boost UK parcel market;Sector worth almost £9bn but competition means carriers receive less for deliveries;Shoppers’ preference for ordering online has helped boost the size of the UK parcel market to almost £9bn, but fierce competition means carriers are receiving less for deliveries.Revenues in the sector, dominated by the likes of Royal Mail, UPS, Hermes and DHL, increased 6 per cent in 2015, according to research by consultancy Apex Insight.This was underpinned by the continued surge of items sent by businesses to consumers, now the single largest portion of the market, even as the historically larger business-to-business segment declines.“As home internet shopping inevitably matures, [parcels] growth will be slower in future but there’s still a good way to go,” said Frank Proud of Apex Insight.UK logistics companies have been investing heavily in expanding delivery networks, vehicle fleet and technology in order to grab a greater slice of the parcels industry, which has expanded by about one-third to £8.9bn since 2011.DPD last year opened Europe’s largest parcel sorting hub, a £100m site in Leicestershire, while Royal Mail is introducing automated machines to sort and label packages.Robust preparations enabled parcel carriers to cope better with the discount bonanza of Black Friday in November. This kicked off the peak delivery season with a record-breaking day of £1.1bn of internet sales, according to Experian-IMRG.A higher proportion of orders were delivered on time compared with the previous year when many companies were caught out, data from technology platform MetaPack showed.Other developments include lockers, shops where customers can pick up and drop off packages, and narrowed time slots for home deliveries and the rollout of same-day services by Argos and Amazon.Yet the sum of these bulked-up parcel operations — coupled with Amazon’s decision to build its own delivery network — is an increasingly crowded marketplace.Royal Mail has said there is around 20 per cent spare capacity in the parcels industry, while data from Ofcom, the postal regulator, implied a 1 per cent fall in prices in the last financial year.International groups have continued to gain share at the expense of UK-only players, Apex Insight also found.These pressures have squeezed earnings at some companies. In November, the chief executive of UK Mail, a smaller operator, resigned after two profit warnings. Former rival City Link collapsed into administration on Christmas Eve in 2014.Mark McVicar, analyst at Barclays, predicted a “rebalancing” of the parcel market. “The shipper and consumer . . . eventually will be prepared to pay a bit more for a good quality delivery. Perhaps you will see some M&A activity or alliances between smaller and regional carriers and there are bound to be some that go to the wall,” he said.
52;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-12-30T17:58:17Z;Christmas woes for FedEx amid ecommerce surge;Company forced to seek volunteers to help with deliveries on December 25;FedEx has become the latest of the US’s big parcel delivery companies to suffer a troubled holiday shopping season after it was forced to seek volunteers to deliver packages on Christmas Day.The problems for FedEx follow two successive holiday seasons of problems for UPS, the US’s biggest express parcel service. The company’s network became seriously congested in 2013 before it then overcompensated and had excess costs for the 2014 holiday shipping period.Both companies are struggling to adapt to the rapid growth and unpredictable patterns of consumers’ ecommerce purchases in the run-up to Christmas. IHS, the forecasting company, predicts that US ecommerce sales will have increased 11.7 per cent in November and December against the same months last year, on retail sales up just 3.4 per cent.FedEx said in a statement that its 340,000 staff had handled a “record peak holiday season”, including volunteers who made deliveries on Christmas Day.“FedEx Express expanded delivery operations on the Saturday following Christmas, delivering delayed shipments along with our normal Saturday volume, and resumed normal pickup and delivery services on Monday,” the company said.FedEx declined to give details of how many packages were delayed or of any financial effect that the situation might have. UPS in January 2014 was forced to warn that its fourth-quarter 2013 profits would be 14 per cent lower than expected after its problems handling Christmas deliveries. The delays prompted Amazon, one of the biggest customers for UPS and FedEx, to issue $20 gift cards to affected customers.Chris Christopher, IHS’s director of US macro economics, said many logistics companies had suffered glitches over the holiday period, possibly because of an under-appreciation of the volumes they would be handling.Amazon, Mr Christopher added, had opened a number of warehouses closer to centres of consumer demand, changing traffic patterns compared with previous years. “That can be another complication,” he said.Both the big package delivery companies have faced challenges adapting their networks— which traditionally handled mainly goods moving to and from offices in commercial areas — to handle more deliveries to consumers. Costs for delivering to consumers are higher than for delivering to businesses.“It’s becoming complicated,” Mr Christopher said of online ordering patterns. “There’s more dispersion [between delivery points] but also more people doing it.”UPS said that it had benefited from a “strong partnership” with customers on forecasting traffic levels and drawing up plans.“The company carefully managed demand for incoming shipping volume with maintaining full capability to deliver on time,” it said.UPS had completed its pre-Christmas deliveries on December 24 and had continued to deliver between 97 and 98 per cent of packages on time — just below normal levels — in the week of Christmas and the week before.FedEx’s shares fell 2 per cent on Christmas Eve and were little changed on Wednesday at $149.18 by markets close in New York. UPS’s shares held steady over the festive period but were down 0.7 per cent at $97.08 on Wednesday.
53;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-12-24T17:07:27Z;FedEx operating with ‘slight delays’;;US package delivery company FedEx said it was running with “slight delays” on Thursday after severe weather affected its operations the day before.The Memphis, Tennessee-based company said it was “continuing to make adjustments and do everything [it] can to minimise impact on our customers.” FedEx Express service will be running operations on Christmas Day in some markets to deliver any shipments that couldn’t be delivered ahead of the holiday.Customer counters at its locations across the US will also be open for part of the day on Christmas.FedEx shares dipped 0.9 per cent in holiday-thinned trading on Thursday.Rival UPS faced issues gauging demand in 2013 and 2014. In 2013, the company had to deliver some packages after Christmas after a late spike in online orders clogged its network. The following year, it misjudged demand and overspent in a bid to avoid the problems from the year prior.
54;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-12-17T15:45:39Z;FedEx shares jump as profits surprise;;FedEx shares flew higher on Thursday after the package delivery company posted a bigger-than-expected increase in quarterly profits despite weakness in parts of the global economy.The Memphis, Tennessee-based company said its net profit climbed 4.2 per cent from the year prior to $691m in the three months through November 30. Sales increased to $12.5bn from $11.9bn, topping estimates of $12.4bn.Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.58 a share, beating estimates by eight cents.FedEx is also seeing a “record number of holiday shipments” flowing through its system, “fueled by the steady rise of e-commerce,” said Frederick Smith, the company’s chief executive officer.The company also confirmed its 2016 outlook despite what it described as sluggishness in the industrial sector.FedEx shares rose 3.9 per cent to $154.75 on Thursday, cutting their year-to-date loss to 10.9 per cent. Fellow shipping company United Parcel Service advanced 0.7 per cent to $101.25 on the news.
55;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-12-16T23:25:50Z;FedEx surges on upbeat earnings outlook;Robust results expected as ecommerce and parcel fees improve;Shares in FedEx rose in after-market trading after the express parcel service said it expected “solid earnings growth” over the next six months after recording robust results for the three months ended November.The fortunes of FedEx and UPS are often seen as closely linked to the health of the US and world economy, because they reflect business’s need to send packages to each other and deliver ecommerce products to consumers.Strong profit growth at the core FedEx Express air parcel business and at the FedEx Ground road delivery operation boosted group net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) by 4.2 per cent to $691m. Revenue rose 4 per cent to $12.5bn. Adjusted net income — excluding the effect of one-off changes such as a tax revision — rose 17 per cent to $729m.The company reiterated its forecast that it would earn between $10.40 and $10.90 per share before mark-to-market pension adjustments over the year to the end of May.However, it sounded far more bullish about prospects than when it last announced results in September, when it cut the expected figure.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the improved profitability resulted from “better revenue quality”, or improved revenue per parcel, as well as ecommerce growth and cost-cutting.“We expect our solid earnings growth to continue in the second half of our fiscal year despite weakness in industrial production,” Mr Graf said.FedEx’s shares rose 5.5 per cent to $156.27 in after- hours trading following announcement of the results, adding to gains of almost 3 per cent during the day. GAAP earnings per share rose 5.6 per cent to $2.44, although that was short of analysts’ consensus expectation of $2.54.Fred Smith, chief executive, said the company increased margins, earnings per share, cash flows, and returns on invested capital.“These basic trends should continue well into the future barring major events or macroeconomic factors,” he said.Both FedEx and UPS have been wrestling with the challenges of handling growing volumes of ecommerce deliveries to consumers — whom it is typically more expensive to serve — at a time when traditional business deliveries are weak.Operating income at the FedEx Express air parcel business rose 26 per cent to $622m as the company raised prices and felt the benefit of its cost-cutting initiatives. Revenue fell 6 per cent to $6.59bn as fuel surcharge income fell and currency movements worked against the company.At FedEx Ground, which has been a particular beneficiary of rising ecommerce, operating income rose 13 per cent to $526m, on revenue up 32 per cent to $4.05bn.FedEx is in the course of the €4.4bn purchase of the Netherlands’ TNT Express, intended to turn the company into a far more powerful competitor in Europe.Mr Smith said that, providing the offer for TNT Express receives regulatory approval, the acquisition would “quickly broaden” FedEx’s “portfolio of solutions,” particularly in Europe.“Despite contraction of US exports due to high US dollar and low world GDP and trade growth, the overall market for international door-to-door express continues to increase, also driven by ecommerce,” Mr Smith said.
56;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-11-18T06:19:58Z;Indian carriers fined for fuel surcharge collusion;IndiGo, Jet and SpiceJet penalised $40m for ‘acting in parallel’ on cargo fuel surcharges;India’s competition watchdog has imposed $40m in fines on three of the country’s private airlines after complaints from courier companies including FedEx and DHL that the carriers colluded to fix fuel surcharges for freight.Wednesday’s ruling against IndiGo, Jet Airways and SpiceJet by the Competition Commission of India is the first of its kind against the country’s airlines, though politicians have previously expressed anger at private carriers for sharp increases in fares during peak holiday travel seasons.The competition watchdog said the carriers’ imposition of fuel surcharges on freight in May 2008 — and subsequent near-simultaneous increases of the fees — “undermines the economic development of the country”.However, the CCI said it had considered “the precarious financial position of the airlines” in levying its penalty, which it set at 1 per cent of each carrier’s average turnover for the past three years.The CCI said it found no direct proof that airlines had deliberately colluded, but said they “acted in parallel” in setting the same fuel surcharges at the same time and “the only plausible reason . . . was collusion”.The competition watchdog cleared state-owned Air India and small private carrier Go Air, both also accused in the initial complaint, of any wrongdoing.The CCI was acting on a 2013 complaint filed by the Express Council of India, which represents 29 international and Indian delivery companies including FedEx, DHL, BlueDart and UPS.IndiGo said it was studying the decision, and would “take legal steps to challenge the order in the appropriate forum”. The carrier, which debuted on the Bombay Stock Exchange last month after raising $458m in an initial public offering, said it had been advised by its lawyers that “it is not in contravention” of India’s 2002 competition act.Jet, which is partly owned by UAE-based Etihad, said it was “not in contravention” of anti-cartel rules and would “pursue all available legal steps to defend its position”. SpiceJet is also expected to appeal.Kapil Kaul, South Asia chief executive for the Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation, said he did not believe India’s airlines — bitter rivals in a notoriously tough market — had actively conferred with each other, but that they do typically quickly match any pricing changes by rivals.“Knowing these guys well, I don’t think they talk to each other,” Mr Kaul said. “But it’s a fact that if one airline hikes or raises a fare, everybody follows. Nobody wants to lose the upside or take the hit on the downside if somebody raises fares and they stay the same . . . If that’s cartelisation, it’s been going on for years.”India’s air freight business has expanded rapidly in recent years, driven by the boom in online shopping led by ecommerce companies such as Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal.In May 2008, IndiGo, SpiceJet and Jet imposed a Rs5-per-kg fuel surcharge on freight as global oil prices spiked to $140 per barrel that summer.The Express Council called the fuel surcharge “an act of cartelisation” and noted it had since been increased by the airlines — virtually in tandem and by the same amount — even as fuel prices plummeted.The carriers denied the allegations, saying fuel charges were adjusted in response to changing market conditions, and were also sometimes reduced or even withdrawn.In addition to the fine, the CCI ordered the carriers to “cease and desist” from their “anti-competitive behaviour”.
57;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-07-28T16:26:47Z;Bad day for Baidu as earnings disappoint;Shares fall 15% as Chinese search engine also projects lacklustre Q3 sales;Baidu suffered its largest one-day decline in more than five years after the Chinese search engine listed on the Nasdaq missed earnings expectations and projected lacklustre third quarter sales.The 15 per cent decline in the company’s shares to $168.03, which triggered short sales restrictions because of intense selling pressures, wiped more than $10bn off Baidu’s market valuation.Baidu said sales in its current quarter would rise between 34.4 per cent and 37.4 per cent, falling short of analyst expectations for a 39.2 per cent gain to Rmb18.8bn ($3.03bn).Earnings in its fiscal second quarter also disappointed. Excluding share-based expenses, Baidu earned $1.81 per share, shy of the $1.88 consensus projection.The company’s expenses jumped more than 55 per cent as it invested heavily in its online to offline business, where customers use mobile phones to buy movie tickets and search for goods before completing the purchase at a store nearby.“We expect the share price to remain under pressure unless Baidu can show accelerated market share gain for its [online to offline] initiative and successfully reduce spending with a resulting margin rebound towards the end of 2016,” Alicia Yap, an analyst with Barclays, said.The company nonetheless characterised the results as “solid” with “ample runway ahead”. Sales in the second quarter climbed 38 per cent to Rmb16.58bn ($2.67bn).Shares of Alibaba, another China-based, US listed company, declined 0.9 per cent to $80.65.Yelp shares shed as much as 4 per cent after analysts with Deutsche Bank downgraded the company from ‘buy’ to ‘hold’, as the investment bank loses confidence in its strategy.“Local online advertising has turned out to be harder to monetise than we anticipated,” Lloyd Walmsley, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said. “We think this is fixable but could require a shift in strategy, a heavy investment in ad product and/or co-operation with/ownership by a scale player.”Yelp shares pared back losses to 0.7 per cent at $33.48 by close of trading in New York.Eastman Chemical climbed 6.8 per cent to $77.02 following better than expected second-quarter earnings. The Tennessee-based company said sales rose 3 per cent from a year earlier to $2.5bn, while profits advanced 2 per cent to $297m ahead of forecasts for $272m.Tighter cost controls lifted UPS profits above analyst expectations. The company reported earnings of $1.35 a share, eclipsing analyst forecasts for $1.26, for the three months to the end of June.The shipping behemoth said net income climbed 10 per cent from a year earlier to $1.23bn when adjusting last year’s results for contributions to healthcare plans. Revenues fell 1 per cent to $14.1bn, reflecting currency movements. Shares in the company rose 5 per cent to $99.93.Nielsen shares advanced 5.2 per cent to $47.18 after the company known for its television ratings reported adjusted earnings of 66 cents a share, 2 cents ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Overall, US equities climbed, following stock markets in Europe broadly higher. Volatility moderated following gyrations in Chinese markets, which weighed on developed equity indices on Monday.The S&P 500 climbed 1.2 per cent to 2,093.25, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 17,630.27. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 1 per cent to 5,089.21.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
58;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;DHL braced for home turf fight with FedEx after TNT deal;US group’s acquisition of Dutch company should strengthen its delivery network in Europe;Each night, by the time most people in Leipzig are asleep, about 60 aircraft in DHL’s distinctive canary yellow livery come in to land at the city’s airport.From mobile phones to refrigerated vaccines, goods are transferred between jets for onward journeys to distant airports such as Bahrain and Singapore, or sorted for transport by road or rail within Europe.DHL’s hub at Leipzig, where about 100,000 parcels and documents are processed each hour, highlights the vast scale and reach of the German logistics group – one of four companies that dominate the fast delivery of packages around the world.But the four may soon become three, if regulators approve the €4.4bn takeover of Netherlands-based TNT Express by the US logistics giant FedEx. TNT reports second-quarter results on Monday.The deal poses a formidable challenge to DHL in Europe, where it is market leader, by combining the US company’s global reach with TNT’s road network in the EU, according to analysts.FedEx intends to gain European market share from both DHL and UPS by winning contracts from multinational business clients that it already serves on other continents, say Credit Suisse analysts. FedEx is also seeking to gain share in the fast-growing ecommerce market from smaller European competitors.“A key premise of the planned merger is to reduce FedEx delivery costs within Europe,” says Robert Salmon, analyst at Deutsche Bank. “Right now FedEx is uncompetitive [within Europe], they have a high relative cost to move a package as they don't have a footprint on the continent.”The TNT deal should fix this problem because the Dutch company’s network of delivery depots and lorries is expected to reduce pickup and drop-off costs for the US group in Europe.In ecommerce, these first and last-mile costs are often disproportionately high for logistics providers, and this expense has been exacerbated by the rising number of people living alone because often packages cannot be delivered at the first attempt.Though DHL, part of Deutsche Post, would remain the market leader, with 19 per cent of Europe’s courier express parcel market, the enlarged FedEx group involving TNT would have 17 per cent, based on 2013 figures from TNT.But analysts do not expect a combined FedEx/TNT to try and close the gap on DHL through a price war. After DHL lost nearly $10bn in five years in a failed attempt to enter the US domestic market, abandoned in 2008, its competitors are unlikely to pursue a price-cutting strategy on the German company’s home turf.Instead, analysts expect FedEx will aim to compete on superior quality of service.Furthermore, the threat to DHL posed by an enlarged FedEx is not likely to be an immediate one. Integrating TNT into FedEx will take time, and rivals will be quick to exploit any blunders.In an interview with the Financial Times, Deutche Post DHL chief executive Frank Appel says the company is looking forward to picking up customers.“Uncertainty is always good for the companies who are not looking for M&A,” he adds. “Of course customers are concerned [about] what it means for the service in particular for this area . . . any service disruption has significant impact.”Mr Appel also points out that while the impact of FedEx’s takeover of TNT will be felt principally in Europe, DHL is also the market leader for express courier services in Asia and Africa.Analysts agree there is probably a short-term advantage for DHL as companies that already have contracts with both TNT and FedEx are expected to seek an alternative logistics provider, to avoid concentrating such work in the hands of one group.FedEx will need to make a substantial investment in the combined business.TNT has been reeling since the European Commission blocked UPS’s €5.16bn takeover of the Dutch company two years ago.TNT lost market share to DHL and UPS during and after the failed takeover, and its net loss widened from €122m in 2013 to €195m last year. The company is cutting costs and upgrading information technology systems as it seeks to compete more effectively.TNT is geared towards business-to-business logistics rather than residential parcel delivery — a market dominated by DHL and UPS in Europe. Business-to-business delivery is more profitable, but the rise of ecommerce means logistics companies are looking to residential deliveries for sales growth.Joel Ray, analyst at Transport Intelligence, a consultancy, says: “FedEx would have to spend a lot of money on new depots if they want to reorient the business in Europe towards ecommerce.”TNT Express may have its headquarters just outside Amsterdam, but the future of the business will be decided 150 miles away — in Brussels.Officials at the European Commission are looking closely at FedEx’s proposed takeover of TNT. They have until August 3 to decide whether to approve the deal or launch an in-depth investigation.The decision is complicated by the recent history of TNT Express. In 2013, the commission blocked a €5.2bn bid by UPS for the Dutch company.This deal was nixed because it would have reduced the number of large logistics groups in many markets across the EU, which — the commission argued — might have led to increased prices for consumers.Some competition lawyers argue that applying the same logic to the FedEx/TNT deal would trigger the same result: a blocked transaction.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s combative competition commissioner, has repeatedly warned companies that she sees it as part of her role to protect consumers from the highest costs — and that she would block mergers that led to this, no matter how large or politically sensitive.On top of this, the commission has taken an unusually close interest in the workings of the delivery industry in recent months.Lowering the cost of delivery for consumers has been one of the main aims of the so-called digital single market — a package of reforms launched by the commission, aimed in part at boosting ecommerce across the bloc.A spokesperson for the European Commission declined to comment on the FedEx/TNT deal.

60;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:07:59+0000;FedEx amends rules to keep Fred Smith in top job;US delivery company’s quarterly earnings miss analysts’ forecasts;FedEx has changed its corporate governance rules to allow Fred Smith, its founder and chief executive, to remain at the head of the US delivery company for another three years.The company said on Wednesday that its board had approved a change in its corporate governance guidelines to raise the mandatory retirement age for directors from 72 to 75.Mr Smith, who started FedEx in 1973, will turn 71 in August.David Steiner, lead independent director, said the change in the rules was “consistent with the market trend of increasing the mandatory retirement age for board members”.The announcement came as FedEx reported earnings slightly below expectations for the three months to May, but predicted strong growth for the year ahead with a rise in earnings of about 21 per cent.The company, which is often seen as an indicator of the health of the US economy, reported volume growth of 2 per cent for express packages and 5 per cent for ground deliveries, driven by online shopping.Michael Glenn, executive vice-president for market development, said on a call with analysts that the company expected “moderate” growth in the world economy, with US gross domestic product rising 2.3 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent in 2016.Earnings per share, excluding pensions charges and some other costs, were $2.66 for quarter to May 31, the last of the company’s fiscal year. That was 4.7 per cent higher than in the equivalent period of 2014, but a little below the average analysts’ forecast of $2.69.Revenues for the quarter were also weaker than expected at $12.1bn, up 2.5 per cent on the year but below the average forecast of about $12.3bn.FedEx shares dropped 3.2 per cent to $176.43 in early trading in New York.Higher volumes for express and ground deliveries, and the benefits of cost-cutting initiatives, were offset by higher incentive pay for staff and unfavourable net impacts from fuel costs and the weather.Mr Smith said 2014-15 had been a transformative year, including acquisitions that “promise to strengthen our portfolio of services and change what’s possible for customers”.In April, FedEx agreed a €4.4bn deal to buy TNT Express of the Netherlands, a move that will give it a much greater presence in Europe, where it has lagged behind rivals DHL and UPS.For the year to May 2015, FedEx’s adjusted earnings per share were $8.95, up 27 per cent on 2013-14.For the coming year, the company indicated it expected EPS of $10.60-$11.10, an increase of 18-24 per cent. Those numbers exclude charges for the mark-to-market valuation of FedEx’s pension assets, which is volatile from quarter to quarter, and in the company’s view distorts the picture of the performance of its businesses.Reported adjusted earnings also excluded other costs including $276m in the fourth quarter for the retirement of 15 aircraft and accelerated plans to retire 23 more. Including those charges, the company reported EPS of $3.65 for the year, down 51 per cent from 2013-14.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the operating performance “significantly improved” in 2014-15, as the company “focused on revenue quality and executed on our profit improvement programme initiatives”.A drop in revenue at the core express delivery business because of lower fuel charges was offset by growth in volumes, including a 2 per cent increase for US domestic packages in the fourth quarter.

• 4CAST Economic CalendarDiary commentary from FT reporters; data and company announcements, unless otherwise stated, from Thomson Reuters. Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.When Majestic Wine bought Naked Wines in April for £70m in cash and shares, it not only acquired a fast-growing online business, but also Rowan Gormley, its founder, and now boss of the combined group.Mr Gormley will lay out his plans for Majestic Wine and the market will be looking for signs his expertise in online retailing can help revitalise the struggling chain of 210 wine shops.Pressure from discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl has squeezed Majestic, which was forced to cut prices during the tough Christmas trading period, hitting margins. It has also been trying to fend off Waitrose at the upper end of the market.Former chief executive Steve Lewis stepped down in February, a month after shares dropped 17 per cent in a single day in January following downgrades to market forecasts.Analysts will be looking for Mr Gormley to ask tough questions about Majestic’s store target of 330 sites, its pricing and its minimum purchase policy, which requires customers to buy at least six bottles in-store.

Majestic Wine FY 25.73p (26.60p)The ground keeps shifting for Ashtead, the British group that rents construction equipment mainly to businesses in the US, as it reports full-year results.In March it raised its full-year financial forecasts amid balmy conditions in the UK and US construction markets. But twice last month the group, which rents out diggers, cherry pickers and generators, tumbled to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after United Rentals, a US rival, talked down activity in the sector given the drop in demand from oil and gas customers.Ashtead, which has a market capitalisation of £5.7bn, rebounded, proving that it still had the support of the City. A clutch of analysts have reiterated “buy” ratings for the stock, pointing to the group’s aggressive growth strategy as it looks to increase its clout in the sector.Its American business, Sunbelt, provides more than 90 per cent of group profit and the shares are valued for growth because the US has been slower to adopt equipment rental than mature markets such as the UK and Japan.

Ashtead FY 61.75p (46.30p)When FedEx, the express parcel-delivery service, reports results for the year to May 31, it will be under pressure to show that it is managing to grow while keeping costs and capacity under control.Careful management of its costs has enabled it over the past year to beat analysts’ expectations repeatedly while also avoiding some of the operational problems that have befallen UPS, its larger rival. UPS suffered severe congestion in much of its network over Christmas 2013 after underestimating traffic levels. It then overspent the following Christmas after overestimating traffic.FedEx continued its cost-cutting efforts on June 1 when it announced that it was accelerating the retirement of 15 fuel-hungry aircraft.Analysts forecast net income adjusted for one-off items up 1.6 per cent to $2.57bn, on revenue 4.6 per cent higher at $47.7bn. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise 2.4 per cent to $8.93.In common with other logistics companies, FedEx faces upheaval as its business shifts towards deliveries of ecommerce purchases to homes. Express parcel services previously concentrated on handling larger bundles of packages to business addresses, which are easier to serve. The shift has encouraged a move away from higher-value, fast services and towards slower deliveries, often by ground.Although FedEx remains smaller in most markets than UPS, it is set to grow significantly in Europe and some other important geographies if its planned €4.4bn takeover of the Netherlands’ TNT Express, announced in April, goes through. FedEx, which has only a 5 per cent share in the European market, is expected to face far fewer barriers to buying TNT — which has 12 per cent of the European market — than UPS did to its €5.4bn bid for the company in 2012.UPS, which has 16 per cent of the European market, abandoned its offer because of opposition by European competition regulators.
Robert Wright● The strong US dollar is likely to have hit results at Oracle hard, with lower revenues expected.Last year the currency impact weighed heavily on the US business software company, but it is expected to take an even bigger toll in the all-important fiscal fourth quarter to the end of May, when it typically records its strongest sales.Oracle has set a modest target for the quarter, with revenues growing between 1 per cent and 6 per cent in constant-currency terms.With overall results under pressure, Oracle executives are expected to direct the spotlight again on the small but fast-growing cloud business, a focus of recent earnings announcements though still representing less than 6 per cent of revenues.Disappointing quarterly results two weeks ago from Workday, a human resources company, were seen on Wall Street as a sign that Oracle had intensified cloud business competition.Analysts expect the group to report lower sales than a year ago, with revenues of $11bn, from $11.3bn last time. Pro-forma earnings per share are expected to be 87 cents, down from 92 cents.
Richard Waters● Betfair’s full-year results will serve to cement the online betting exchange’s position as the frontrunner in the gambling industry after a strong 12 months during which its shares have more than doubled in value.Analysts are expecting the company to report strong revenue growth of 20 per cent to £472.2m and an even bigger rise in pre-tax profits, which are forecast to grow 49 per cent to £91.5m, according to consensus estimates from Bloomberg.The high expectations come despite the absence of a World Cup this year and the introduction of regulations, in particular a point-of-consumption tax in December, which means gambling companies have to pay duty on bets placed by UK customers even if they are booked overseas.Betfair, which floated at a £1.3bn valuation in 2010, has spent much of its time as a public company beneath its float price of £13.The shares, which finally came back up above water in November last year, were boosted by a profit upgrade in March and are trading at more than £25.However, analysts at Numis warned this month that the share price had “got ahead of itself”, arguing that because of competition in the online gambling space Betfair deserved a lower rating and share price of £21.

62;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-04-28T14:01:07Z;UPS rebounds to beat forecasts despite tough holiday season;Increased volume and revenue per package drives enlarged profits;"UPS, the parcel delivery service, recovered from a difficult last quarter of 2014 to report first-quarter net income up 12.6 per cent on the same period last year, to $1.03bn.Diluted earnings per share — up 14 per cent to $1.12 — exceeded analysts’ $1.09 consensus forecast for the quarter. Operating profit in the core US domestic package business increased 11 per cent to $1bn on revenue up 3.8 per cent to $8.8bn. Package volume rose 2.4 per cent and revenue per package grew 1.3 per cent.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said the quarter had been a “good, solid quarter, with progress on all business fronts”.“We’re moving in the right direction,” he said. “We’re seeing growth across all the businesses.”The company reaffirmed its guidance for full-year earnings of between $5.05 and $5.30 per share.“The global economy is continuing to strengthen, although gradually,” Mr Kuehn said. “I feel good about the economic outlook, but there are still some clouds here and there.”The company’s shares rose 3.4 per cent by close of trading in New York, to $100.77.The first-quarter figures for UPS come after a second successive year of problems over the pre-Christmas delivery rush. Having underestimated likely volumes before Christmas 2013, the company overinvested last year and had expensive idle capacity.This year’s first-quarter results compare with a first quarter of 2014 when UPS, like other transport and logistics businesses, suffered heavily amid severe winter weather in North America.Mr Kuehn accepted last year’s comparable period had been relatively easy but insisted the company had still shown “good, steady growth” and that profits had improved materially.In its international package operations, operating profit grew 13.7 per cent to $498m but revenue declined 5 per cent to $2.97bn. The revenue decline reflected the increased strength of the US dollar, the company said. Without currency movements, revenue would have increased 2.4 per cent.In supply chain and freight, operating profit increased 3 per cent to $151m, on revenue up 1.3 per cent to $2.19bn. Freight forwarding revenue had suffered from the dollar’s strength, the company said. But the “flexibility of the UPS portfolio” had meant it was able to help customers during the quarter circumvent severe disruption at US West Coast ports.Mr Kuehn said the dispute had been a “mild positive” for the company. It had encouraged some shift of seaborne goods to air, helping to fill the company’s international flights. But delays to sea freight had hurt parts of the logistics business.UPS, like FedEx, its main competitor in the US, is grappling with both challenges and opportunities as a result of the rise of ecommerce. The growing business is producing significant extra volumes. But traffic flows are growing harder to predict; much of the traffic uses lower yielding, slower services and there are high costs from delivering to individual consumers’ homes, rather than in bulk to businesses."
63;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;European M&A will test the soaring dollar;Bankers in the City of London sound more upbeat than they have for years, writes Patrick Jenkins;"Fred Smith, boss of FedEx of the US, said last week he would pay $4.8bn for Dutch courier TNT Express. That is 30 per cent less than the dollar amount that US rival UPS was prepared to stump up for TNT three years ago (before regulators got in the way).But the Dutch company’s shareholders have good reason to bite Mr Smith’s hand off.TNT’s earnings and share price have been weak for some time. In addition, this is a better offer than the dollar valuation would suggest. In euro terms, investors will receive only 15 per cent less than they would have done from UPS, thanks to the alchemy of the exchange rate. One dollar back in early 2012 was worth only 75 euro cents; now it buys more like 93 cents.Sure enough, Mr Smith cited the dollar’s appreciation against the euro as a primary driver of the deal. The broader question is whether a 12-year high in the dollar’s buying power will make 2015 a peak year for European mergers and acquisitions by US companies.M&A activity is clearly resurgent in general. The FedEx-TNT deal was dwarfed within hours by Royal Dutch Shell’s £47bn planned takeover of the UK’s BG — a transaction with little or no currency driver. And in the US, another giant pharmaceuticals acquisition was unveiled, with a bid for Perrigo by Mylan for $29bn.Until now, the M&A boom has left Europe behind. In the first three months of the year, M&A transactions in the US were up 30 per cent to $399bn — accounting for nearly half of all dealmaking — while volumes in Europe fell 4 per cent to $168bn, according to data from Thomson Reuters.But those numbers hide an interesting sub-theme in Europe. The value of inward bound deals from the US more than doubled over the 12 months to the end of March, hitting an eight-year high.Separate research from Deloitte, a consultancy, suggests that more than a quarter of all European deals last year were inbound acquisitions by US or Asian buyers — the highest proportion in more than a decade. The weak euro not only drew American buyers but many from China, too.Bankers in the City of London, where many of these European takeovers are masterminded, certainly sound more upbeat than they have for years. For them, the strong dollar is just the cherry on an already appetising cake.European targets, they argue, are fundamentally attractive because the worst of the eurozone crisis is over and a growth rebound is imminent. In addition, so their bullish pitch to potential buyers goes, cash resources are plentiful after years of steady profit accumulation and limited dealmaking. For a prospective US buyer, the M&A argument is all the more compelling because many such companies are sitting on cash piles outside the US that, for tax reasons, it makes no sense to repatriate.The low oil price is another spur. It is already prompting the kind of defensive opportunism evident in the Shell-BG deal. More broadly it makes any company with significant exposure to oil and energy prices, such as TNT, look that much more attractive.But there is a fine line between being bullish and being reckless. Mr Smith is perhaps best known for saving FedEx from bankruptcy years ago by betting the company’s last few thousand dollars on a game of Las Vegas blackjack. If the TNT deal is really rooted in a currency punt, that should worry investors.There are, after all, plenty of uncertainties hanging over Europe, undermining prospects for good M&A. The threat of Grexit and broader eurozone chaos, though mitigated, is firmly back on the agenda. A lot of European companies look expensive, too. Stock markets in Europe are not as inflated as those in more obviously thriving parts of the world, but they have still hit record highs in recent months.Electoral uncertainties in seven European countries this year, most significantly the UK and Spain, should be an additional deterrent, particularly for potential buyers in highly regulated sectors such as utilities and media. To see off all the dangers hanging over European M&A, the power of the dollar will need to be truly Herculean.The writer is the FT’s financial editor"

But it was not his Frenchness that won him the job this week as the first chief executive of the merging French and Swiss cement groups — Lafarge and Holcim — quite the opposite.Continue readingMr Dimon has been known as one of the few bank chief executives willing to challenge the regulatory architecture put in place since the 2008 crisis. Some of the individual warnings have been aired before but never woven into a Dimon crisis scenario.He said that, unlike in 2008 when JPMorgan attracted $100bn of deposits from weaker competitors, it was “unlikely that we would want to accept new deposits the next time around”.He wrote that while investors would traditionally flock to safe-haven securities in a storm, there would be “a greatly reduced supply of Treasuries to go around — in effect, there may be a shortage of all forms of good collateral” because of new liquidity requirements tying up safe assets at banks.Noting that banks underwrote stock offerings to help shore up other banks during the last crisis, he said they “might be reluctant to do this again”.● Related video: Dimon warns of volatility in next crisis
● Related FT Alphaville blog: A simpler JPMorganMylan’s $28.9bn offer takes Perrigo board by surpriseOne of the world’s largest generic drugmakers proposed buying a purveyor of cold remedies and hay fever medicines for $28.9bn, the latest in a string of takeover attempts in a pharmaceuticals industry gripped by deals fever, writes David Crow.Mylan’s unsolicited cash-and-stock proposal valued Perrigo at $205 a share, according to a letter sent on Monday to the chief executive of the Dublin-based company, which makes store-brand versions of paracetamol and decongestants.Mylan, which has a market capitalisation of $34bn, said it had discussed a combination with Perrigo’s management on a number of occasions in recent years, but the timing of its proposal appeared to take the target company by surprise.‘Eat or be eaten’ mindset to drive more deals as groups try to replace sales lost when patents expireContinue readingPerrigo said its board would meet to discuss the proposal, though few in the industry think Mylan will be able to secure an agreed deal without increasing its offer, pitched at a 25 per cent premium to Perrigo’s closing price on Friday.Some analysts suggested Mylan had moved quickly because it was itself a takeover target, possibly for Israel-based Teva, the world’s largest generic drugmaker.Earlier this month, Mylan introduced a so-called “poison pill”, a mechanism that would dilute the ownership of existing shareholders and help it fend off a hostile takeover offer.The takeover saga is the latest sign of deal activity in the healthcare industry, as companies take advantage of cheap debt to consolidate.In the first three months of 2015, the total value of healthcare deals reached $95.3bn, a 70 per cent increase on the same period a year ago, according to data from Thomson Reuters.FedEx moves to wrap up €4.4bn deal for ailing TNTWhen UPS launched a €5.2bn bid for the Netherlands’ TNT Express in 2012, FedEx, UPS’s arch-rival in the express parcel sector, sat by, writes Robert Wright.Reports suggested it was waiting for the Dutch company to come back on the market at a lower price.That happened this week. European competition regulators barred the UPS bid because it would have given the combined company such a large market share and TNT continued to struggle, recording a €195m net loss for 2014. FedEx on Tuesday announced it had agreed a €4.4bn takeover of the company.Antony Burgmans, TNT’s chairman, attributed the lower price to the reduced synergies that the FedEx deal is expected to realise compared with the UPS deal. FedEx has only about 5 per cent of the cross-border intra-European express and economy parcels business, against 16 per cent for UPS and 12 per cent for TNT.The limited synergies mean that FedEx is far more likely to succeed in completing its deal than UPS was in its attempted takeover. The European Commission blocked the UPS deal because it would have substantially weakened the competition to DHL, the European market leader.For FedEx, meanwhile, the deal will bring significant economies of scale, allowing it to feed far greater volumes of transatlantic express parcels into its vast US network.The outstanding question is whether the company can manage the integration without plunging the combined network into the kind of chaos that has characterised some past logistics mergers.● Related Lex note: Deal is a bet on strong recoveryVivendi pays extra dividend to appease shareholderVivendi this week agreed to pay out an additional dividend as the price for making peace with a minority shareholder whic was demanding that the media and content group pay out €9bn to investors this year, writes Adam Thomson.The Paris-based group said that it would pay €2 per share — to be distributed in two separate payments at the end of this year and the beginning of next — in addition to the €1 per share dividend it had earmarked for each of the next three years.The decision, which brings promised payouts to €6.75bn, averted what was shaping up to be a head-on fight with US minority shareholder P. Schoenfeld Asset Management (PSAM) at next week’s annual general meeting.As part of the agreement, PSAM said it would vote against another minority shareholder demanding that Vivendi exempt itself from a new French law that would give longer-term shareholders — such as Vivendi chairman Vincent Bolloré — twice as many votes as new investors.All of this relieves the pressure that was building on Mr Bolloré to present shareholders with a clear vision for the group following Vivendi’s sale of telecoms and other assets over the past two years for more than €35bn.Mr Bolloré, who on Thursday increased his stake in Vivendi for the fourth time in just over a month to 14.5 per cent from 5 per cent earlier, has said that he wants to turn Vivendi into a French-style Bertelsmann, the German media group.This week, he took one small step in that direction, announcing that Vivendi had entered into exclusive negotiations with French telecoms operator Orange to buy 80 per cent of its Dailymotion video-sharing platform for €217m.● Related news article: Vivendi eyes ‘transformational’ dealsAnd finally …the lighter side of the news● With great power comes great responsibility and, one would hope, a decent pay packet.

65;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-04-07T18:09:43Z;FedEx seeks global scale with TNT Express deal;Deal is far more likely to gain approval than UPS’s failed bid for TNT in 2012;It is a feature of contemporary urban life so ubiquitous that it is easy to take for granted. In New York, London, Brussels, Hong Kong and every other big city, the distinctively-coloured delivery vans of the international parcel-delivery companies pull up outside offices and homes, a driver jumps out and a package —— which often started its journey on the other side of the world — is handed over.Yet Tuesday’s announcement that FedEx of the US is planning a €4.4bn takeover of the Netherlands’ TNT Express highlights the delicate economics behind such operations. Both FedEx and UPS have struggled with the shift from focusing on serving mainly clusters of high-volume corporate customers to delivering ecommerce packages to widely dispersed consumers. These challenges pushed TNT Express, despite it controlling 12 per cent of the European economy and express parcel markets, to a €195m net loss for 2014.FedEx hopes by building scale in Europe to benefit from feeding extra parcel volume into facilities such as TNT’s air cargo hub in Liege, Belgium.“Undoubtedly, the biggest opportunity here is in Europe in a reduced pick-up and delivery cost that FedEx will enjoy as a result of TNT’s network,” Alan Graf, Fedex’s chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call. “I feel very comfortable that we are going to achieve cost benefits across the board.”The deal is also far more likely to gain approval than UPS’s failed €5.2bn bid for TNT, tabled in 2012. That deal foundered because the European Commission was concerned that it would have left only two or three significant competitors in many European delivery markets. FedEx currently holds a market share of only about 5 per cent in economy and air express deliveries in the EU, against 12 per cent for TNT, 16 per cent for UPS and 19 per cent for DHL, owned by Deutsche Post.Alan Braithwaite, a UK-based logistics consultant, said the difference between the barred UPS transaction and the planned FedEx deal is the ultimate purpose. UPS was seeking to increase its already substantial scale in the European market. FedEx will be aiming to use TNT Express’s scale to benefit its wider world market.“The geographic fit will be much better with FedEx than it would have been with UPS,” Mr Braithwaite said. “For this deal, it’s not driving scale within a market. It’s driving global scale and presence.”Many of the benefits of that increased global scale will be felt, if the deal goes through, at Liege airport, FedEx’s hub in Memphis, Tennessee, and other big sorting centres.The costs of building such facilities — filled with automated sorting equipment — are high. The costs of running them, however, vary relatively little according to whether they handle only a few packages or are operating at full capacity. They are far more profitable, consequently, when running nearly full.Package delivery operators refer to more fully-utilised networks as being “denser”.“This is not a redundancy play,” Mr Graf said, referring to the TNT deal. “This is productivity and density, and combining two powerful networks on a global basis.”The challenges of managing such networks — keeping them busy but not letting them become congested — are growing as couriers increasingly handle ecommerce deliveries to individual homes. In both the US and Europe, operators have struggled to gear their networks up to handle pre-Christmas peaks in ecommerce deliveries that have surprised many operators with their size and timing.In the US, UPS has struggled with the past two Christmases. Its network grew severely congested in 2013, while in 2014 it overcompensated and spent too much preparing for peak volumes that largely failed to materialise. It was a shift into business to consumer (B2C) deliveries, rather than traditional business to business (B2B) deliveries, that helped to push City Link, a UK courier, into insolvency on Christmas Eve last year.“If you try to build B2C on to a B2B network, that has been a real headache,” Mr Braithwaite said. “They don’t sit comfortably in the same operation unless you get to a particular scale and you charge a premium.”The challenge for FedEx will be to achieve that scale without causing the kind of disruption for customers that has often bedevilled previous logistics mergers. Tuesday’s 2.9 per cent rise in FedEx’s share price — to $171.49 — suggests investors are confident the company can avoid those pitfalls. TNT’s shares increased 28.1 per cent to €7.69.However, Mr Graf was careful to caution investors that there would be high costs and a long timeframe. “That will require more upfront cost than would normally be the case,” Mr Graf said of the company’s “aggressive” integration plan. “But having said that, I think the integration is going to take three or four years.”In 1946, an Australian second world war veteran called Ken Thomas bought a five-ton truck with his demobilisation money, writes Duncan Robinson.This decision by the 33-year-old from Harden in New South Wales marked the birth of K W Thomas — the forerunner of TNT Express — and the start of a corporate journey that is now set to end with the takeover of the Dutch company by FedEx of the US.During the years after the second world war, K W Thomas ballooned in size from a one truck company into a national road-and-rail freight operation. In 1961, the company — by now known as Thomas Nationwide Transport — listed on the Sydney stock exchange.A wave of acquisitions in the 1970s and 1980s turned the company into a global business, with operations in Europe and South America, as well as Australasia.TNT turned Dutch only in the 1996, when KPN — the former post-and-telecoms monopoly in the Netherlands — launched a takeover of the Australian company. TNT Post Group, the predecessor of TNT Express, was spun out two years later.UPS of the US launched a bid for TNT Express in 2012, but European regulators blocked the proposed takeover because competition concerns.The Dutch company was left an independent entity mired in a sector-wide price war involving larger rival DHL and former suitor UPS.Competition, coupled with rising costs, hit TNT Express hard. Tex Gunning, chief executive, warned investors last October of a long, tough road ahead following a profit warning — but on Tuesday, FedEx offered a short-cut.
66;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;FedEx agrees to buy TNT Express for €4.4bn;Acquisition of Dutch rival will ramp up US parcel delivery group’s presence in Europe;FedEx struck a €4.4bn deal for struggling competitor TNT Express in a bet that it can expand its presence in Europe and avoid the regulatory concerns that prevented rival UPS from pulling off the same transaction.The takeover would combine the number three and four delivery groups in Europe by market share, expanding FedEx’s foothold in a region where the US group has struggled to gain traction against leaders DHL and UPS.Fred Smith, FedEx’s chairman and chief executive, said the timing of the deal with the Netherlands-based company was influenced by the strength of the US dollar as well as signs that lower oil prices and the European Central Bank’s monetary stimulus were delivering a boost to Europe’s economy.An agreed combination came together in less than seven weeks, people familiar with the discussions said, with talks having kicked off just after TNT warned of further restructuring due to poor conditions in its core western European markets.FedEx will pay €8 a share for TNT under the terms of the all-cash deal, which values the Dutch company at €4.4bn. It represents a 33 per cent premium to TNT’s closing share price before the long Easter weekend.Both sides on Tuesday attempted to convince investors that the deal would overcome any regulatory scrutiny in Europe. UPS abandoned a €5.2bn takeover attempt of TNT in early 2013 as it faced stiff opposition from Europe’s then antitrust chief.“This is a much simpler deal than the UPS deal,” said Antony Burgmans, chairman of TNT. “The overlap [with UPS] was significant. This means the [cost-saving] synergies will be less, which is reflected in the price, but the strategic fit is better.”Christine Richards, general counsel at FedEx, said: “We are very confident that we will be able to obtain EU approval, but we will have to go through the process.”DHL, which is owned by Deutsche Post, had a 19 per cent market share in Europe, based on 2013 industry data, compared with UPS on 16 per cent, TNT on 12 per cent and FedEx on 5 per cent, according to Allan Smylie, an analyst at Davy.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said that the two companies should be able to complete the deal by the first half of 2016 as planned, given that they have prior knowledge of antitrust hurdles and the unlikely prospects of a counterbid.A break fee of €200m will be payable to TNT if FedEx does not receive regulatory clearance or walks away from the deal. TNT must pay €45m to FedEx in the event it receives and accepts a better offer.Shares in FedEx climbed 2.9 per cent to $171.55 by midday in New York, while TNT rose 28.1 per cent to €7.69 in Amsterdam trading.As part of the deal, the two companies would need to sell TNT’s airline operations. FedEx, which has more than 660 aircraft in its global fleet, said that TNT’s European road network — which connects more than 40 countries through 19 road hubs and over 550 delivery depots — would be “highly complementary”.The deal comes as international couriers struggle to adapt to the rise of ecommerce, which has put pressure on their delivery systems.TNT has struggled since European regulators blocked the proposed takeover by UPS. It reported a €137m net loss for the final quarter of 2014, which it blamed on mounting restructuring costs. Nearly 10 per cent of TNT’s shares were on loan to short sellers — investors betting against a rise in a company’s share price — according to data from Markit.FedEx delivers about 10.5m shipments globally every day, compared with TNT’s 1m. The US group has been expanding in Europe, opening about 100 delivery stations across 11 countries since 2011.FedEx was advised by JPMorgan Chase. TNT Express was advised by Goldman Sachs and Lazard.Additional reporting by Jennifer Thompson and Christian Oliver
67;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-04-07T12:43:44Z;FedEx and TNT Express: colouring;The deal is a bet on a strong European recovery;"When purple and orange paint are mixed, the result is an unremarkable brown. FedEx, the US delivery company with a “purple promise” to customers, announced on Tuesday that it would like to blend with the “orange spirit” of Netherlands-based TNT Express. The new company would challenge US rival UPS, known for its brown vans and uniforms, for the number two position among European delivery companies. TNT Express shares jumped more than 30 per cent.FedEx has bid €8 per share in cash for a company worth a tenth of its own $47bn market value. That works out to an enterprise value of more than nine times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Though well above FedEx’s six times multiple, it sits in line with the average valuation for European logistic companies, and about the same as that of UPS. Given cheap financing, the deal will probably add to earnings per share immediately, even without accounting for cost cuts.FedEx has confidence that it can get the deal past European competition authorities; it has offered a €200m break-up fee to TNT. Why? It has promised it will sell off TNT Express’s air cargo unit. FedEx already has plenty of capacity in air freight, while TNT Express has top share in European road haulage. UPS’s attempt to buy TNT Express three years ago failed due to European regulators’ fears that the combination would have emerged as the number one delivery company, well ahead of DHL. The FedEx-TNT Express combination would mean the three largest couriers would have roughly half the European market, with none having more than a fifth.Given the euro’s weakness against the dollar, FedEx has decided the timing is right. But really it has bet on a strong European economic recovery pushing TNT’s ebitda back up towards its 2008 peak of €550m, about a third above this year’s estimates. Without an economic rebound, this deal might turn a dreary colour indeed.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
68;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-03-26T19:04:46Z;Dow Transports puts shadow on US equities;Barometer of economy and overall sentiment lags broader market;Investors are shunning US transport stocks and this barometer of the economy and overall equity sentiment on Thursday continued lagging the broad market.Investors have turned cold on transport equities since the start of the year, discouraged by weakening economic reports that have forced economists to downgrade their forecasts for the world’s biggest economy.The shift by investors accompanies spotty performance for some of the sector’s biggest companies after bumper returns in 2013 and 2014. Shares of UPS, Avis and Kansas City Southern have all fallen more than 10 per cent, while two-thirds of the Dow Jones Transportation Average members have declined since the start of the year.The Dow Transports retreat casts a cloud over the broader equity market as a bullish or bearish trend is flagged whenever the benchmark rallies or declines sharply. This is based on the notion that transport stocks reflect the underlying economy far better than the average company and thus foreshadow prospects for economic growth.Analysts with JPMorgan said a stronger dollar has crimped export activity, which is a key component of the rail business. Credit Suisse, which remains bullish on the rail industry, noted that a slide in energy prices has weighed on deliveries of coal and crude oil products.“We have witnessed the impact in the past few weeks during which CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern have each experienced notable year-over-year declines in coal,” said Allison Landry, an analyst with Credit Suisse.She added: “This, in conjunction with a step down in shale-related volumes relative to the beginning of the quarter, potentially leading to extra costs related to a mismatch in the resource-to-demand equation, will likely result in downward first-quarter earnings revisions.”That left Dow Transports on course for lagging its namesake counterpart for a fifth consecutive day on Thursday. The benchmark has registered a fall of almost 5 per cent this year, reflecting in part investors increasing bearish or so-called short positions in transport companies after two years of double-digit gains.Shares of SPDR S&P Transport ETF constituents, which includes CSX, FedEx and Avis Budget, on loan to short the underlying stock have climbed 33 basis points from a low touched in January. At 3.4 per cent, the figure was the highest since the middle of November, according to data provider Markit.The case for transport stocks rests largely on wider US and global activity as the rail and shipping behemoths depend on increases in trade to fill rail cars and cargo holds.Retailers have warned that port disputes on the US West Coast have stunted supply chains, prompting companies including Union Pacific to forecast first-quarter volumes that will be flat to slightly down as it takes weeks to clear inventory backlogs.The strength of the dollar is also weighing on export-heavy industries, including semiconductors, as big corporations put systems upgrades on hold.“Foreign demand should be cut as long as [the] dollar stays in this area,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “Until we have consistent strength in the economy, domestic companies may say, ‘Let’s hold off a little bit’.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
69;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-03-18T13:10:04Z;FedEx profits rise on falling fuel costs;Parcel delivery service is handling ecommerce challenge better than rival UPS;Strong growth in ground shipments and falling fuel prices helped FedEx, the parcel delivery service, lift net income by a better than expected 53 per cent to $580m for the December to February quarter.The figures suggest FedEx is continuing to handle the growth in ecommerce deliveries better than UPS, its rival. UPS reported a second successive trouble-hit Christmas peak in a profits warning in January.However, FedEx’s shares fell 1.4 per cent by close of trading to $173.30 after it narrowed the band of its forecast for earnings per share to an $8.80 to $8.95 range for the year to May 31 rather than raising it. The company had previously forecast an $8.50 to $9.00 range.“We had a very successful peak season as volumes grew across all transportation segments, and our profit improvement programmes are moving ahead as scheduled,” Fred Smith, chief executive, said.The quarter’s strongest growth was in FedEx Ground, which has benefited most from strong growth in ecommerce shipments in recent years.Operating income grew 14 per cent to $558m, on revenue up 12 per cent to $3.39bn. Revenue grew faster than volumes — at only 7 per cent — because the company increased some rates and because of a higher proportion of larger packages.In the core FedEx Express air parcel business, meanwhile, operating income for the quarter more than doubled to $384m against $168m, on revenue down marginally to $6.66bn, from $6.67bn in the same quarter last year.US domestic package volumes and FedEx International Economy volumes both grew 4 per cent, while FedEx International Priority volumes were flat. The higher volumes failed to produce revenue growth because of the ending of previous fuel price surcharges and currency effects.Profitability improved because of a “significant” boost from lower fuel prices, less difficult winter weather in North America and the company’s profit improvement initiatives.Operating income at FedEx Freight grew to $68m, from $35m last time, on revenue up 6 per cent to $1.43bn.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the company expected its results for the March to May quarter and for the year to May would both be records. Earnings per share for the December to February quarter were up 63 per cent to $2.01, growing faster than net income thanks to share repurchases.“We expect continued revenue and earnings growth this year, driven by ongoing improvements in all of our transportation segments,” Mr Graf said.FedEx’s profitable growth during the pre-Christmas peak contrasts sharply with performance at UPS, which was forced to issue a profit warning in January after it overspent on preparations for the peak period. The excessive spending was an overcorrection for the 2013 peak when UPS’s networks became badly congested after it underestimated the volume of traffic it would face.
70;UPS;United Parcel Service;2015-02-03T18:07:27Z;UPS: the shipping blues;Ecommerce is great only if the packages show up on time;Being Santa’s little helper is not as merry as it is made out to be. During the Christmas season of 2013, United Parcel Service was not able to meet late season demand in the US and delivered some packages after December 25. St Nick was livid. In 2014, UPS executed better for its customers — but at a cost to shareholders. The investments it made to ensure smooth holiday deliveries led to excessive costs across the period. It announced in late January, and confirmed in Tuesday’s earnings announcement, that fourth-quarter earnings would be 15 per cent below the market’s expectations. Ecommerce sales should be a boon to UPS. But only if it can find a way to better match its capacity investments with customer demand.The growth in online shopping has created challenges for physical retail chains but a big opportunity for UPS. “Business-to-consumer” packages, as UPS calls them, once represented a fifth of US volume. By 2019, UPS expects them to make up half of its deliveries. The company is investing heavily in analytics and technology (capital spending is a sturdy 5 per cent of revenue) so it can reduce driver idleness and wasted travel, reducing per package delivery cost. The company expects new Orion routing software to yield $300m to $400m in annual savings by 2017. While UPS believes revenue will only grow in single-digits, it aims for operating profits that grow at nearly twice that pace.UPS is the largest global “integrated” logistics company offering both ground shipping and air express service. It historically trades at 20 times earnings, and the premium to the market is understandable. Its return on capital approaches 20 per cent and it, in effect, returns all of its net income to shareholders in dividends and buybacks. After the recent retreat in share price, it is tempting to buy, hoping for a rebound. But its valuation is unmoved and it remains unclear if this year’s Christmas gifts will arrive either on time or on budget.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

DreamWorks added that it would lower production to two films a year, down from three.Analysts at Cowen & Co and Janney Montgomery Scott downgraded the shares and cut their price targets.Doug Creutz at Cowen said that two years ago the company laid off 350 employees and its “film performance deteriorated over the next two years”.“In our experience significant downsizing at content companies rarely works, as the disruption to culture caused by lay-offs interferes with the creative process, with the result being further declines in revenue,” he said.“With an already-stretched balance sheet, we believe DWA faces an uncertain future.”Cowen cut the stock to “underperform” from “marketperform” and lowered its price target to $14 from $21.Analysts at Janney Montgomery Scott cut the stock to “sell” from “neutral” and lowered the price target to $18 from $27.Shares of DWA fell as much as 14 per cent to $18.30 but later pared losses and closed down 8 per cent. In the past year, DWA shares have fallen 43 per cent.Starbucks’ shares gained 7 per cent to $88.22, after the US coffee chain reported an 82 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.The company reported net income of $983.1m, or $1.30 a share, in the three months ending December 28 from a year earlier. Total sales rose 13 per cent to $4.8bn, while same-store sales climbed 5 per cent in the period, slightly ahead of forecasts of a 4.7 per cent gain.“Remarks suggested the momentum has carried over into the second quarter, supported by strong Starbucks card redemptions (after record holiday sales) and beverage innovation (launch of Flat White),” said David Tarantino at Baird, lifting the price target on the stock to $104 from $88.UPS was the worst-performing stock on the US benchmark, after the parcel delivery service warned that 2014 profits would fall short. The Atlanta, Georgia-based company said it expected full year adjusted earnings of $4.75 a share, lower than its previous forecasts in the range of $4.90-$5 a share and short of Wall Street forecasts for $4.96 a share.The company also forecast fourth-quarter earnings of $1.25 a share, below estimates and said that 2015 earnings per share growth would be “slightly” less than its 9-13 per cent target. UPS shares fell nearly 10 per cent to $102.93.E-Trade Financial advanced nearly 9 per cent to $24.56, after the company topped fourth-quarter sales estimates. The company also said it received regulatory approval to move its broker-dealers, E*Trade Securities and E*Trade Clearing, out from under E*Trade Bank. The approval also lets it distribute $430m of excess capital to its parent in the first quarter.Consumer staples and materials stocks weighed on the US benchmark.The S&P 500 slid 0.6 per cent to 2,051.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8 per cent to 17,672.60.

72;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:07:59+0000;UPS misses the mark again during Christmas;Express parcel company warns on 2014 and 2015 earnings;UPS shares tumbled on Friday after the express parcel service admitted it had misjudged peak Christmas demand for a second successive year, overspending on efforts to avoid the congestion that delayed many parcel deliveries in late 2013.The company warned the overspending meant full-year profits — which the company will announce on February 3 — would fall short of its previous forecasts. The shares were down 9.9 per cent by the close of trading at $102.93.The express parcel company forecast earnings per share, adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges, of $4.75, down from previous guidance of $4.90-$5.00. It also warned that 2015 earnings growth was likely to be below its 9 to 13 per cent annual growth target.At the start of 2014, UPS warned that many of its systems had been overwhelmed during the 2013 Christmas peak shipping season, when volumes were higher than expected, and that profits would fall short as a result.UPS took on extra staff, started investment in greater automation of its facilities and bought new, more flexible mobile sorting equipment to cope with sudden unexpected rushes to ensure there was no repeat of the late 2013 crisis.However, the company said that, while the investment had proved worthwhile for December 22 and Cyber Monday — the Monday after Thanksgiving — demand had been less than expected on other days.“This resulted in a sub-optimised network during peak season,” it said. “A decline in productivity, increased contract carrier rates, as well as costs associated with overtime and training hours contributed to the excess cost.”The company also blamed the effects of the slowdown at US west coast ports for exacerbating its problems.David Abney, chief executive, said the company’s performance during the quarter — including its handling of the surge the company calls “peak” — had clearly been disappointing.“UPS invested heavily to ensure we would provide excellent service during peak when deliveries more than double,” he said. “Though customers enjoyed high quality service, it came at a cost to UPS.”The company would reduce operating costs in future and would introduce new pricing strategies during peak season, Mr Abney added.UPS and FedEx, its main US rival, have been buoyed by increasing volumes of ecommerce deliveries but have wrestled with the complexities of handling an increasing number of small deliveries to individual homes. UPS in November floated the idea of bundling consumers’ packages from multiple retailers into single deliveries to rein in the rise in costs resulting from increased deliveries of ecommerce purchases to homes.Unadjusted full-year earnings per share would be $3.28, the company said. The $1.47 difference with the adjusted figure reflects a $670m non-cash charge for a change in the discount rate on certain pension liabilities. It also reflects a $22m non-cash charge for the transfer of some pension liabilities.The company attributed the expected shortfall in full-year 2015 results to a $180m increase in pension costs because of changes in discount rates and $50m in expected extra costs because of currency changes.
73;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-12-26T14:32:55Z;Ecommerce model proves difficult to drive;Delivery groups’ shares look low yield and expensive;“Well, in those days, one had to telephone a room inside a building and hope that, at the very same moment, the person with whom one wished to converse might be found therein.”As British comedian Eddie Izzard once observed — if not in those exact words — the concept of landline telephony must sound ridiculous to the youth of today.But, as many households will have discovered over the holiday season, the 21st century concept of ecommerce is barely any more intelligent. While it may be increasingly app driven on mobile devices, it still involves goods being driven in delivery vans — in the vague hope that, in an unknowable number of days, they will arrive at a building at the very moment when one may be found therein.Even some of the solutions to these challenges appear daft. Earlier this year, Volvo, the carmaker, announced an initiative to avoid the “first-time delivery failures” that cost companies “an estimated €1bn”: it will arrange for an operative to drive to where one’s Volvo is parked and place purchased goods therein. Anywhere. Even a shopping centre car park.However, with a global value of €172bn — according to the dubiously named Transport Intelligence — ecommerce delivery is not a business that investors can ignore.It offers revenue growth: analysts at Transport Intelligence forecast a rate of 9.8 per cent a year until 2017. It offers cash flows: Ofcom estimates that Britons pump £1,968 per person through ecommerce channels every year, followed by US consumers who spend £1,171 each. It offers more predictability: research group ComScore says online sales growth on Cyber Monday, after Thanksgiving, has slowed because consumers now spread out their purchases.Delivery companies, though, seem stuck at the wrong end of the value chain. In the UK, private equity-owned delivery business City Link went into administration on Christmas Eve, claiming it was unable to handle any more parcels because of the “continued substantial losses it would incur”. Earlier this year, the privatised Royal Mail reported a 21 per cent drop in first-half operating profits, from £353m to £279m, in the face of greater competition. In the same period, UK Mail’s margins were such that it made just £4.9m of pre-tax profit on revenues of £241.4m. In the US, FedEx and UPS have at times found the ecommerce model more costly than lucrative. UPS warned on profit in early 2014 after a failure to deliver thousands of parcels cut quarterly earnings by 14 per cent.Far from proving the telecoms-like income plays that their activities suggest, all these companies’ shares look low yield and expensive. FedEx offers a dividend yield of 0.5 per cent, and trades on 19.7 2015 earnings — well ahead of the S&P 500. UPS shares yield 2.39 per cent but trade on 19.9 times forward earnings. Not exactly a utility.Royal Mail currently yields more than 4 per cent but also trades on an earnings multiple closer to higher margin FTSE 100 companies.Where, then, is the value? Ironically, some of the most attractive yields in ecommerce now come from bricks and mortar. According to IPD, the European warehouses from whence all those vans set off yielded 8 per cent in the 12 months to end September. As one fund manager told the Financial Times last week: “It’s a very defensive asset class to invest in.” He believes ecommerce property is not just for Christmas — rather like those missing parcels you might receive in coming days.matthew.vincent@ft.com

• 4CAST Economic CalendarDiary commentary from FT reporters; data and company announcements, unless otherwise stated, from Thomson Reuters. Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.● It has been a difficult few years for Carpetright, Europe’s leading carpet seller. As well as a string of profit warnings, it has been forced to endure the sudden departure of its chief executive last year and the continued fall of its share price, which is down 40 per cent this year alone.The carpet specialist’s interim results will be a chance to try and persuade investors that it can turn its fortunes around. The results are new chief executive Wilf Walsh’s first and with Carpetright’s founder, Lord Harris, having retired as chairman in October, analysts will be looking for him to stamp his authority on the struggling company’s strategy.More than half of the company’s 460 stores in the UK have been modernised and like-for-like sales are up, but with discounting helping to drive sales, margins are down.In Europe, where Carpetright has 142 stores in Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, the company is expected to report a profit in the period after reducing the rate of sales decline and better cost control.

Sales are expected to be $12bn, up 9 per cent from last year’s $11bn.Both FedEx and United Parcel Service, its main rival in the critical US domestic market, are benefiting from growing ecommerce deliveries to consumers. However, FedEx has so far avoided the kind of significant problems that dogged UPS last Christmas, when its systems became overwhelmed and it delivered many packages after December 25. Robert Wright● Oracle’s announcement of quarterly earnings will provide the latest chance to assess how well the giants of the IT industry are managing the transition to cloud computing.Like its main rivals, the database software maker has sought to put a spotlight on its fast-growing cloud efforts by disclosing revenues separately this year, even though the numbers remain small overall.Only around 5 per cent of its $8.6bn in sales in its most recent quarter came from selling cloud services, though the business was up 32 per cent, compared to overall growth of only 3 per cent.While the cloud growth rate will get disproportionate attention from investors, it will be sales of Oracle’s traditional software, including the latest release of its 12C database, that will underpin its business in the latest period.Wall Street is expecting revenues to rise around 3 per cent for the second quarter running, to $9.52bn. Pro forma earnings per share are expected to be down slightly from a year ago, at 68 cents, in the middle of the company’s guidance range of 66-70 cents. Richard WatersThe City of London will be looking to Dixons Carphone for a take on Black Friday trading and the outlook for Christmas when it reports its half-year results.After a flurry of sales at British retailers at the end of November, investors and analysts will be looking to see if this delivered incremental business or just brought forward sales that would have happened anyway.Other key talking points will be the outlook for Christmas as retailers are in the midst of the crucial holiday trading period and the delivery disruptions that have beset some retailers including CurrysThe results will be the first since the £3.7bn merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse in May, and the City will also be keen to know how the integration of the two businesses is progressing.

Time to test the waters.” That is how analysts at Wells Fargo characterise the state of play at BlackBerry, the pioneering smartphone maker that is in the throes of a difficult turnround.John Chen, installed as chief executive just over a year ago, has steadied the ship by cutting costs and dramatically slowing the rate at which the company burns cash. However, the bigger challenge — returning the group to growth — is as yet unmet. This week investors will see the first signs of whether Mr Chen’s plan to win back business customers is working.On Wednesday, the group will unveil its new BlackBerry Classic, the company’s fourth smartphone launch of the year, after the Passport, the Z10 and a Porsche-branded handset. Today it releases earnings for its fiscal third quarter, which are expected to show patchy progress.James Faucette, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, last month downgraded his forecasts due to his belief that the company will have made a larger chunk of its revenue from low-margin device sales rather than the more lucrative fees it charges customers to use its infrastructure.This “service revenue” has been steadily declining ever since Mr Chen joined the company, from $632m in the three months to the end of November 2013 to $424m in its most recent quarter. It now accounts for less than half of revenue.Mr Faucette estimates that BlackBerry has either been breaking even or losing money on sales of new handsets, prompting him to predict an adjusted loss per share of 5 cents.That, according to data from Bloomberg, is in line with the majority of analysts, who are pencilling in revenues of $956m for the quarter.

75;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-11-13T23:23:47Z;UPS plans bundled deliveries to cut costs;Parcel company to combat increased demand by combining orders from multiple retailers;UPS has outlined bold plans to boost the profitability of its fast-growing ecommerce business, intending to bundle together customers’ purchases from multiple retailers to reduce the express parcel company’s costs.The initiatives are intended to rein in the growth of costs per package that ran at 2.3 per cent annually over the decade from 2000 to 2010, as growing ecommerce traffic increased the number of expensive deliveries to consumers’ homes.UPS said at an investor day in New York that it expected the volume of business-to-consumer packages it handled in its US domestic business over the next five years to increase 30 per cent and to account for 51 per cent of domestic packages by 2019. Ecommerce accounts for the vast bulk of business-to-consumer packages.Increased costs from ecommerce deliveries – as well as disappointing international traffic thanks to the European recession – have produced a succession of disappointing results from the company since the third quarter last year.The company projected that it would increase its worldwide revenue by between 5 and 9 per cent annually over the five years to 2019, and that operating profits would grow between 8 and 11 per cent, with earnings per share rising 9 to 13 per cent.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, blamed developments over the past year for the company having missed targets set at its previous investor day in 2011. UPS suffered a particularly bad Christmas shipping period in 2013 as an unexpectedly sharp spike in ecommerce deliveries overwhelmed its systems and forced it to deliver some packages after Christmas.“During the last four quarters, we’ve clearly had some challenges,” Mr Kuehn told the event. “The plans you’ve heard today are helping us to get on track.”Under the most eye-catching plan – known as Synchronised Delivery Solution – a package due to be delivered to a given address will wait for others coming from other sources, which will then be delivered with it.“We want to combine deliveries and drive margins higher,” Mr Kuehn said.The company will also encourage more consumers to pick up and drop off packages at local shops offering the UPS Access Point pick-up and drop-off service.“Many of the things you heard today, including UPS Access Points, will help improve costs,” Mr Kuehn said.The company expects to reduce annual costs by between $300m to $400m from 2017 by expanding use of its Orion route-planning software to all its US drivers, from about 40 per cent at present. The system has cut an average of seven to eight miles daily from existing users’ routes.Further investments will be made in automating sorting hubs, cutting the number of staff needed to handle packages. The company runs the world’s largest fully-automated sorting facility at its WorldPort Hub in Louisville, Kentucky, which can handle up to 5m packages daily on hundreds of incoming and outgoing flights.The company announced it expected earnings per share for 2015 of between $5.45 and $5.70, up between 10 and 15 per cent on the expected figure for the current year.UPS’s shares closed down 0.15 per cent at $107.79.
76;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-10-28T18:11:49Z;Google case casts shadow over competition chief Almunia’s legacy;Battle with US tech giant may define the legacy of Europe’s outgoing antitrust enforcer;As Europe’s competition chief, Joaquín Almunia slapped record cartel fines on rate-rigging banks, led an assault on cosy anti-competitive tax deals, and vetoed empire-building mergers by the likes of UPS, NYSE Euronext and Ryanair.Now, in the twilight of his five years in office, this veteran Spanish socialist – once dubbed “the mule” by lawyers frustrated by his inflexibility – is being plagued by a torturous case that may well define his legacy: Google.His valedictory message to critics is that he never bought the hype, or succumbed to political pressure from Germany or elsewhere. “The autonomy of antitrust enforcement is an important issue and a serious one and from my point of view a reality,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times.His frustrations over the public portrayal of the Google investigation are clear in a 90-minute parting interview, which is notably disciplined, lawyerly and cautious for an outgoing enforcer known for his political nous and sharp tongue.Mr Almunia wants his time remembered for other achievements. On the finance front, it is for pushing the frontiers of antitrust enforcement, and acting as Europe’s main bank resolution authority at the height of the eurozone crisis. On technology, it is for his interventions on ebooks and the attempt to disarm the smartphone patent wars. On state aid, it is for streamlining enforcement and challenging tax deals with the likes of Apple, Amazon and Starbucks.Yet the shadow of Google is hard to avoid. The US search giant’s tangle with Mr Almunia ran to three draft settlement attempts and generated more noise, outrage and lawyer fees than perhaps any European Commission probe since Microsoft almost a decade ago. And, unlike that battle, the Google to-and-fro has proved troublesome for the commission’s reputation as a tough, impartial authority.I remember at this very table some conversations with important chief executives. I asked: why are you spending all this money on PR? It is completely uselessMr Almunia denies having any regrets and says calls from German and French ministers for tougher action played no role in convincing him to reject the third settlement.“It had no influence on the Google investigation. It is like that. It is not that it should be like that – it is like that. What mattered were the arguments put down by Google, the complainants and the stakeholders – particularly the complainants. No other people influenced me.”“Some lawyers living in this city are very political lawyers. I can give you names!” he adds with a laugh as he throws a barb at a legal community often quick to gripe about the Almunia era. “I remember at this very table some conversations with important chief executives. I asked: why are you spending all this money on PR? It is completely useless.”This theme of his political independence is paramount, including on issues such as Gazprom allegedly overcharging in eastern Europe – a probe that has been frozen by the Ukraine crisis.Before Ukraine, Mr Almunia said his initial talks with the Russian gas group in some respects “looked positive”. “But for both sides this did not continue when the crisis started. I told the commission services to prepare a draft [formal charges] and we are there,” he said.Asked about the danger of retaliation, Mr Almunia said: “The Gazprom investigation should not be interpreted as a political weapon. It is antitrust. Our investigations need to be isolated from other considerations and that is what I tried to do and recommend we do.”Both the Google and Gazprom cases will be some of the toughest facing Mr Almunia’s successor Margrethe Vestager, a former Danish economy minister with a steely reputation. For now, she is embracing Mr Almunia’s tax legacy with more relish.Mr Almunia sees the tax cases are more than just economics, there is a “moral” responsibility to address anti-competitive ways governments apply their own tax rules.He smiles at the mention of Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, phasing out the so-called “double Irish” tax avoidance scheme, partly because of pressure from Brussels. “What I read about the speech sounds quite good,” Mr Almunia said. “A step forward.”Although he hit banks with record fines of €1.8bn for collusion over rigging of interest rate benchmarks such Libor and Euribor, he is cautious about whether the sector has turned the corner. He says “strong efforts” are still needed to contain markets with heady incentives and little transparency. “I mean the bonuses,” he adds.I’ve spent more time with chief executives in other investigations. I can’t advance in important investigations without meeting the people responsible for the company. I am not a blind commissionerIn style, at least, commission officials are expecting quite a change with Ms Vestager. Mr Almunia often worked late hours burrowing into the fine print of decisions, sometimes to emerge with different conclusions than his official advice.He sees this as a strength. A commissioner’s responsibility is “to master the detail, not to only get a superficial view of the issues”, he said. “We are here to decide, not to ask the fonctionnaires [civil servants] what they decided,” he adds.Mr Almunia also bristles over “mythical” claims he had a close texting relationship with Google’s Eric Schmidt. “I’ve spent more time with chief executives in other investigations. I can’t advance in important investigations without meeting the people responsible for the company. I am not a blind commissioner. This is a myth created by the Brussels environment around this building,” he said.What advice would Mr Almunia offer Ms Vestager? “What I learnt many years ago is that you should not give advice to successors unless your successor asks,” he said. “I will answer that question only to Ms Vestager, if she asks me.”
77;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Bellwether UPS rises on ecommerce hopes;US equities extend strong weeks of gains;Investors liked what they heard from parcel delivery company and US economic bellwether UPS, which beat third-quarter earnings expectations.It reported profits of $1.2bn, or $1.32 a share, in the three months ended September from $1.1bn or $1.16 a share a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.28 a share.Sales climbed nearly 6 per cent to $14.3bn, modestly ahead of estimates for $14.2bn.The company forecast that the volume of deliveries made in December would be about 11 per cent higher than last year.A surge in online demand last year overwhelmed the company, which had to take on additional staff to fulfil orders, which in turn triggered a profit warning.“So far, comments about the peak shipping season have surprised to the upside with strong demand expected from ecommerce,” said Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Co. She expects ecommerce to drive most of the growth in the peak season.But “the shipment growth is a little misleading as last year’s peak shipping season was difficult for UPS” so the year-on-year comparison was “relatively easy”, Ms Becker added.UPS reaffirmed full-year diluted earnings a share in the range of $4.90 to $5.00. The company repurchased 20.6m shares for about $2.1bn in the third quarter.The shares rose as much as 1 per cent to $101.29, but the stock price pared gains to close little changed on the day. UPS shares were down nearly 4 per cent so far this year.Shares of Procter & Gamble climbed 2 per cent to $85.16 after it announced it would exit its Duracell battery business.It said no decision had been made on the form of exit but it would prefer to spin it off into a standalone company.Pandora shares fell 13 per cent to $20.00 after it said active listeners climbed 5.2 per cent in the third quarter, slower than the 7.5 per cent growth seen the previous quarter.Sales climbed 42 per cent to $239.6m against expectations for $238.5m.“While we remain optimistic that Pandora can eventually drive advertising revenues to reflect its listening hour share of the US radio market, longer term cost uncertainty from upcoming consumer marketing efforts, as well as the pending Copyright Royalty Board rate reset, hold us back from a more favourable stance at this time,” said Stephen Ju, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Pfizer shares gained 2 per cent to $29.11 after the US pharmaceutical company announced an $11bn share buyback plan. This comes on top of the $1.3bn left under its existing buyback plan.Amazon shares fell 8 per cent to $287.06 after the ecommerce giant reported a loss of $437m, or 95 cents a share, in the three months to the end of September. Wall Street analysts were looking for a loss of 75 cents a share.Sales climbed 20 per cent to $20.58bn, short of expectations.Forecasts for fourth-quarter revenue growth in the range of $27.3bn and $30.3bn also missed expectations for $30.9bn.The S&P 500 extended a strong recent run to stand up 3.9 per cent on the week, on track for its best weekly performance since January 2013.The benchmark gained 0.7 per cent to 1,964.58 on Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.8 per cent to 16,805.41.

78;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-09-29T16:44:32Z;FedEx climbs on market share gain hopes;Shipping company is expected to continue stealing market share from UPS, analysts said;US shipping behemoth FedEx climbed on Monday after brokerage Cowen & Company lifted its rating on the company on the view it will gain market share from rival UPS in the pivotal holiday sales season.Analysts with the bank raised their rating to ‘outperform’ from ‘market perform’ and increased their target price to $210 from $155 ahead of the holiday sales rush.“We expect a strong, albeit compressed, peak shipping season as FedEx is likely to continue stealing market share from UPS given that company’s network issues,” Helane Becker, an analyst with Cowen, said.UPS warned earlier this year that its profits would be lower than it expected as it staffs up for the holiday season and deploys new software. The company’s capacities were swamped by a surge in demand in the US in the run-up to Christmas last year, forcing several retailers to apologise to customers after they failed to deliver packages on time as promised.Ms Becker said she expected margins to improve and for the company to surpass its announced fiscal 2015 forecast of earnings of $8.50 to $9 per share.“We are encouraged by recent comments about a stronger year-on-year peak shipping season and improving International Priority volumes,” Ms Becker added. “We believe the current guidance range is conservative implying opportunity for upward revisions.”FedEx shares advanced 2 per cent to $162.18, taking its gain this year to 13 per cent, while UPS fell less than 1 per cent to $97.34.Shares of Athlon Energy rose 25 per cent to $58.35 after Canadian energy producer Encana, run by former BP executive Doug Suttles, agreed to buy the company for $7.1bn.Under the terms of the deal, Encana will take on $1.15bn of Athlon’s debt and pay the latter’s shareholders $58.50 a share in cash.The investment offers Encana access to about 140,000 acres in the Midland Basin, a sprawling area in Texas.Mr Suttles, who has been offloading assets as Encana tries to reshape its portfolio, said: “This transformative acquisition further accelerates our strategy and provides us with a prime position in what is widely acknowledged as one of North America’s top oil plays.”Encana shares trading in New York rose 2 per cent to $21.59.DreamWorks Animation shares climbed 26 per cent to $28.18 as reports surfaced the movie studio had entered talks with Japan’s SoftBank over a sale of the company.Shares of Tibco, a US maker of software that allows companies to keep real-time track of inventories, soared 21 per cent to $23.65 after the company announced it would be acquired by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $4.3bn.The deal, which includes the assumption of Tibco’s debt, will hand the company’s investors $24 a share in cash.The sale comes less than two months after Praesidium Investment Management, the software maker’s sixth-largest shareholder, called for the sale of the company.Overall, US equity markets declined moderately, following bourses in Asia and Europe lower.The S&P 500 declined 0.3 per cent to 1,977.80 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 17,071.22.

79;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-09-24T16:27:15Z;TNT: Sorry we missed you;Suspending 2015 guidance: a bad news delivery;If a parcel delivery company changed its name from ‘Delivery!’ to ‘Outlook’, business would tail off. The latter just lacks urgency. TNT Express does not seem to mind though. In February, the Dutch company changed the name of its strategy to Outlook. Seven months on, the view is not so great. On Wednesday, TNT said that it would not hit its previous 2015 guidance of 8 per cent operating margins in Europe and America. No new guidance has been given. For that, shareholders will have to wait until next February. On top of all that TNT will take a €50m provision in this quarter to cover a pending settlement with French competition authorities.It is hardly surprising that Maarten Jan de Vries, the new chief financial officer, has made changes. The previous target for profit margins, and sales growth of per cent, depended upon solid economic growth in Europe starting this year. And that looks unlikely.More importantly, management now wants to invest more in the business. Since TNT Express demerged from PostNL, the Dutch post office, in 2011, the company has invested an average of €120m, or roughly 1.7 per cent of annual sales. Now it plans to double that percentage, to the equivalent of what rival UPS invests. TNT promises to improve its road and air transport hubs, though primarily the former. It wants to shift as much on to roads as possible for distances under 800km as it targets higher margin orders from smaller European companies.This sound like a plan, but Wednesday’s announcement leaves everyone waiting five months for the final package. Meanwhile, this quarter’s provision for the French anti-monopoly settlement wipes a third off the previous consensus net income 2014 estimates. Hence the 12 per cent drop in Wednesday’s share price. After more downgrades, TNT’s price to forward earnings multiple will still trade near UPS’ 19 times. Prepare to wait a while longer for news of a delivery.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
80;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:59:53+0000;UPS to hire up to 95,000 temporary workers;;UPS plans to hire up to 40,000 more staff for this year’s end-of-year rush, in the latest indication of the express parcel service’s determination to avoid the severe congestion that last year delayed some holiday season deliveries .The company said on Tuesday that it planned to recruit between 90,000 and 95,000 workers for the seasonal rush, up from 55,000 last year, and that many of the temporary staff would have the opportunity to be employed full-time.The hiring surge comes after chaos in UPS’s delivery system last Christmas delayed many deliveries, particularly those from Amazon, the online retailer, and prompted a profit warning. The company cut its forecast results for the year again in July as a result of its increased capital spending designed to avoid a repeat of its Christmas problems.Ecommerce during the end-of-year holiday season has grown rapidly in many parts of the word.In the UK, Royal Mail has also started Christmas recruitment. The London-listed delivery group said is expected to announce next week plans to hire up to 20,000 people, in line or slightly down on last year.On last year’s so-called Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving and the US’s busiest online shopping day of the year, merchants that listed products for sale on Amazon experienced a 50 per cent jump in orders from the previous year. More than 13m orders that day were placed with merchants, who account for about 40 per cent of all goods sold on the site.UPS’s extra hiring is part of a package of measures, including closer collaboration with key customers on likely volumes, investment in new, more flexible processing capacity and better information technology.Ecommerce is transforming the business of UPS, FedEx, its main US rival, and other express delivery companies by increasing the share of deliveries to consumers at the expense of easier-to-manage deliveries to businesses.John McDevitt, UPS’s senior manager of human resources and labour relations, said the company had initial volume forecasts from its customers and was starting the hiring process for its temporary peak season jobs.“We have needs throughout the United States and anticipate more applicants this year than in 2013,” Mr McDevitt said. “Individuals who begin employment at UPS during the holiday season have the opportunity to pursue a permanent position.”The company gave no indication of how much extra traffic it expected to handle this year compared with last but said it was “gearing up” for a further increase in deliveries. Conditions were exacerbated in 2013 by the unusually short gap between US Thanksgiving – the traditional start of the end-of-year shopping season – and Christmas, as well as severe weather across much of the US.The extra staff would join UPS’s 333,000 permanent staff in the US.FedEx– which adopted advanced sorting technologies earlier than UPS in many of its hubs and configures its networks differently – suffered far fewer problems last year than UPS. It declined to comment in advance of its latest quarterly results on Wednesday.UPS expects to make its temporary staff more effective in future by equipping them with better technology for finding addresses, choosing routes and making other decisions that previously only permanent staff were well-placed to make.UPS’s shares were down 0.1 per cent to $97.52 in early New York trading.Additional reporting by Sarah Mishkin and Gill Plimmer
81;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-09-02T15:51:26Z;Google’s remote drone deliveries point to fast-track niche;Google explores opportunities for new technology in remote places;“Could I order some dog food, please?” Neil Parfitt, a farmer outside Warwick, in Queensland, Australia, says into a phone. Minutes later, the dog treats arrive – but by an unusual method. A small, unmanned aircraft arrives over Mr Parfitt’s homestead, flips into vertical, hovering flight and gently lowers a package of treats for his eager animals.Mr Parfitt’s experience is captured in a video by Google’s experimental X Lab about its operations in the rural area around Warwick in delivering goods by unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). It is a technology that even X Lab engineers admit is years from maturity and aviation regulators worldwide are still very cautious about licensing.However, the Google deliveries – and approval from the US’s Federal Aviation Administration for some drone operations in Alaska’s remote North Slope – suggest drones are likely to emerge more quickly in a few niche areas than the wider economy.Remote areas suffer from few safety worries about drones’ propensity to crash into buildings or other aircraft, according to Michael Toscano, chief executive of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International.“If you look at the low-hanging fruit, it’s some farming, energy industry, pipelines, where there are not a whole lot of people,” Mr Toscano says.Alan Braithwaite, a UK-based logistics consultant, says that while drones are unlikely in the foreseeable future to have a “large-scale application”, using them to cover the long distances of sparsely populated areas is “quite sensible”.“I’ve been in the outback with an emergency that needed snake antivenin,” Mr Braithwaite says. “That’s the sort of thing that’s entirely possible [as an application of the technology].”At the heart of the questions surrounding experiments such as Google’s are questions of safety and economics. The safety issues have been highlighted in an FAA inquiry into the use of drones by New York area estate agents to film properties prompted by concerns over the risks of uncontrolled drone operations around tall buildings and low-flying aircraft.The FAA is in the course of drawing up safety rules for the industry but has so far not published its proposals. “What is limiting us for the moment is: what is the risk that we’re willing to accept?” Mr Toscano says.However, the ultimate factor in whether drones become widespread will be whether they can make deliveries more efficiently and cost-effectively than existing transport modes.Established logistics companies have long sounded sceptical about how quickly unmanned aerial vehicles can compete with well-established rivals such as freight aircraft and delivery vans.But David Abney, incoming chief executive of UPS, the parcel delivery company, said in July that the company believed that “at some point” drones might be useful for some high-value deliveries, although not in the near future.“We’ve looked at that technology for a long time,” he told a meeting in Atlanta. “It may be very time-urgent, time-sensitive, expensive shipments or things like that.”Google’s publicity for its experimental technology highlights the potential of an economically viable niche in covering long distances with urgent packages in hard-to-access areas such as disaster zones. The experiments around Warwick moved some medicines and other goods that farmers said they often needed in a hurry.Mr Toscano says the industry is only a small technical breakthrough away from developing systems that will be able to overcome safety concerns.“This is what I call I revolutionary technology currently going at an evolutionary pace,” Mr Toscano says of the slow progress.Mr Braithwaite is more sceptical about whether deliveries such as Mr Parfitt’s will become a common sight, citing the high costs of carrying deliveries into the air, rather than keeping them on the ground.“Goodness knows what the cost is,” he says.However, even Mr Braithwaite accepts that, eventually, Google or another new entrant to the industry may hit upon a new, so far unimagined application of drone technology that could transform the concept’s prospects.“When these technologies emerge, there’s always the unexpected in terms of how they’ll come to be applied,” he says. “It’s difficult to see it, but we could see that something will pop out.”
82;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-08-21T00:04:10Z;UPS hit by cyber attack;Data from more than 100,000 transactions exposed at franchises;United Parcel Service is among a new wave of retailers that have been targeted by cyber criminals, with data from more than 100,000 transactions exposed at franchises across the US.UPS said a breach of its computer systems could have led to the theft of customers’ credit or debit card details, names, postal addresses and email addresses at more than 50 branches between January 20 and August 11.The delivery company began investigating whether its computers could have been infected with malicious software after the US Department for Homeland Security warned earlier this month that a new family of malware was being used to target retailers.The ‘Back off’ malware has affected more than 600 businesses according to Trustwave, a cyber security company that worked with law enforcement agencies on the investigation.Tim Davis, president of UPS Store, said it had “fully contained” the incident.“I understand this type of incident can be disruptive and cause frustration. I apologise for any anxiety this may have caused our customers. At the UPS Store the trust of our customers is of utmost importance,” he said.The company added it had no evidence that the details had been used for fraud. It is providing free identity protection and credit monitoring services to customers whose information may have been compromised.The UPS announcement came on the same day that Target, another US retailer, slashed its full year profit outlook, partly blaming battered consumer confidence following the largest known theft of customer information in a cyber attack at the end of last year.The Target attack reverberated round international boardrooms after the chief executive resigned, highlighting the potential impact of a security breach on those at the top. Until then, many attacks had little impact on the share price or senior management.It also followed a claim earlier this week from Community Health Systems, the US hospital operator, that Chinese hackers had stolen the private information of about 4.5m of its patients, in what would be the largest breach in the healthcare industry in terms of number of people affected.TrustedSec, a cyber security company, reported that the “heartbleed” vulnerability in the most widely used security software on the web was to blame for the incident. The flaw was exposed earlier this year, prompting companies to rush to update their software. Community Health Systems did not respond to a request for comment.
83;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-08-12T13:26:30Z;UPS and FedEx invest in technology to meet soaring demand;;On the ground floor of United Parcel Service’s $2.2bn Worldport Hub, workers are stuffing into huge airfreight containers some of the roughly 1.1m packages that the centre in Louisville, Kentucky, handles every night.Most of the containers have sped through Worldport’s maze of whirring conveyor belts and been reloaded in less than four hours. At 2.30am, some of the 100 or so flights that will carry the packages around the US and the world are starting to leave.Amid the dazzling efficiency, however, is evidence of the significant challenge that UPS and FedEx, its main US rival, are facing. Many of the boxes bear the logo of Zappos.com, the internet footwear retailer. Another box contains frozen artificial skin for use in surgery, while one bears the simple legend, “Live Tropical Fish”.Online retailing and business-to-business ordering are driving up traffic volumes for both UPS and FedEx but also making flows harder to predict.The question for both companies is whether management changes and technology investments can help them to avoid a repeat of the chaos that engulfed UPS last Christmas, when demand surged more than anticipated. Volumes on its busiest day, December 23, were 13 per cent up on 2012’s peak and the network was clogged. Many packages were delivered after December 25.The problems reflect the behaviour of the individual consumers who increasingly drive big operators’ deliveries worldwide, according to Alan Braithwaite, a UK-based logistics consultant. They are more likely than logistics operators’ corporate customers to order at the last minute.“The peaks are getting even peakier,” he says.Fewer goods are being delivered in bulk via single stops on vehicles’ routes to retail outlets, according to Henry Maier, chief executive of FedEx Ground, the company’s road-delivery division.“Now those individual items get boxed up and sent to somebody’s house, so that creates a stop,” Mr Maier says. “The challenge across the industry is managing the stops.”Supply chain business is separate from the flagship express parcel operations of UPS, FedEx and other logistics operators but adds a vital extra dimension to the services they can offer companies.Read moreUPS is improving its management systems and investing $500m in extra capital spending this year to boost capacity, according to Kurt Kuehn, the group’s chief financial officer.“We’re very focused on expanding capabilities and capacity to meet the current growth, not to mention the peak season,” Mr Kuehn says. “We have what is in many ways an enviable problem.”One of UPS’s efficiency-boosting investments is on display at the Louisville Centennial Hub, a base for UPS’s ground operations near Worldport. Jerry Durham, a driver, each morning consults a bank of computers running Orion, a new computer system, to work out the most efficient route between his scheduled drop-offs.The technology has raised the average number of drop-offs per mile from 1.9 when drivers devised their own routes to 2.2 now, says Roger Hicks, UPS’s business manager for Louisville East.The system has overcome his initial scepticism, according to Mr Durham.“I’ve gotten to like it a lot more,” he says.Mr Maier praises new handheld scanners for boosting FedEx’s efficiency. The scanners know the GPS co-ordinates of every address in the US and will alert drivers if they appear to be delivering in the wrong place. Such technology helps to cut down worker errors, especially among temporary staff taken on for the peak season.“It makes our temporary resources much more effective,” Mr Maier says.An innovation at Centennial typifies UPS’s approach. In the past year, sorters have been given technology that scans package labels and tells them into which delivery bag they should post them. The technology has cut down on wasteful “mis-sorts”.We’re very focused on expanding capabilities and capacity to meet the current growth, not to mention the peak season. We have what is in many ways an enviable problemMr Kuehn says most investments are focused on such local hubs, rather than the efficient Worldport, and predominantly into computer systems.Yet, for UPS, last Christmas’s biggest failing may have been in communication rather than in technology. UPS failed to spot its customers’ higher than expected order volumes in time. Much of the short-term effort has focused on ensuring future volume forecasts and communications with customers are better than last year’s. FedEx says that such forecasting also plays a key role in its peak-season planning.“We’re working with some large customers to get enhanced visibility,” Mr Kuehn says.In the long run, meanwhile, both companies expect to overcome the challenges partly through making more of their facilities operate like Worldport.FedEx already operates all 33 of its ground network’s hubs in the US on Worldport’s highly automated model, with minimal handling by humans. Mr Maier says it expects to start introducing such advanced technology in still more, smaller facilities.For UPS, meanwhile, Worldport, the world’s biggest fully automated package-handling facility, remains noticeably more advanced than smaller hubs such as Centennial, where much sorting is still by hand.As the company adapts to the challenges of handling more shoes, medical supplies and fish, that will have to change, Mr Kuehn says.“[Worldport is] a highly automated, incredible asset, driven by technology,” he says. “There are several other generations of buildings around the country that we’re going to be renovating to look more like Louisville.”Catering to supply chain demandsIn the middle of a warehouse near the end of Louisville Airport’s runway stands a line of heavy-duty freezers, an electronic stopwatch sitting on the lid of one. The stopwatch is intended to protect the delicate sheets of artificially-grown skin inside the freezers, used to treat diabetics’ foot ulcers. Supervisors time how long each freezer is open when stocks are being retrieved, to ensure the temperature stays low enough.The business in the warehouse illustrates how thoroughly UPS and other logistics companies have involved themselves in some customers’ operations. Next to the skin freezers, workers are preparing to ship batches of influenza vaccine. In another section of the building, workers are putting together packages of mobile telephones for Sprint, the mobile telecoms company. They customise devices for customers with special requirements, including government departments that want employees’ phone cameras disabled.Such supply chain business is separate from the flagship express parcel operations of UPS, FedEx and other logistics operators but adds a vital extra dimension to the services they can offer companies. According to Rich Shaver, division manager for healthcare in UPS’s Americas Central District, the growing popularity of outsourcing reflects the increasing pressure on healthcare companies to save money and compete more effectively.“The customers have to have a competitive advantage,” he says. “The only way they can have a competitive advantage is if they have a very nimble, flexible supply chain that at the same time is looking for what regulations and changes are coming.”The healthcare business, unlike high technology, remains relatively conservative and goods are shipped mostly to retail outlets, hospitals and other corporate customers.However, the Louisville warehouse already employs pharmacists to handle prescriptions for some goods heading direct to customers. The company is receiving increasing numbers of requests to suggest ways that customers can deliver more healthcare products direct to consumers, according to Mr Shaver.“Most times, it’s going to be a progressive, step-by-step process,” he says.
84;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
85;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-07-29T17:01:20Z;Windstream soars on Reit spin-off plan;;The US telecoms sector climbed on Tuesday after a small wireline network announced plans to spin off part of its business into a real estate investment trust, establishing a new way for rivals to derive value from assets.Windstream, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, said it would turn its existing fibre and copper network, as well as other fixed real estate assets, into a publicly traded Reit, allowing the new company to avoid federal income taxes.The approach has been tried by cellular tower operators like American Tower, but not by a larger cable or fibre optic network owner.Windstream said its board of directors had received a favourable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, although it will still require regulatory approval.“Given the IRS approval, we expect other companies may explore the possibility of spinning off their wireline assets into a similar structure,” Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said.Analysts with Credit Suisse said AT&T and Verizon were likely evaluating a similar strategy, but would “have the advantage of waiting to see how the Windstream transition plays out”.The conversion to a Reit comes as many companies, particularly those in the pharmaceutical sector, evaluate means to reduce taxes. Several, including AbbVie, are hoping to redomicile overseas to reduce their tax bill.The news sent shares of S&P 500 listed telecom operators broadly higher. Windstream soared 12 per cent to $11.83, AT&T rose 3 per cent to $36.59, Verizon advanced 1 per cent to $51.97 and Telephone & Data Systems increased 5 per cent to $25.92.UPS was under pressure after the company, which together with FedEx and Deutsche Post’s DHL dominates the business of shipping parcels around the world, cut its profit forecast for the year as it invests in its business.The company said it would expand operations on the day after Thanksgiving in the US as part of a $175m increase in operating expenses. UPS executives hope to avoid a surge in demand last year that left it incapable of meeting delivery targets.Earnings per share will now be between $4.90 and $5.00 this year, UPS said, compared to a previous forecast of $5.05 to $5.30 a share.Shares of UPS are among the worst performing on the Dow Jones transport index this year. The company declined 4 per cent on Tuesday to $98.86 while rival FedEx dropped 2 per cent to $147.14.A 17 per cent slide in second-quarter profits and tepid third-quarter earnings guidance from Herbalife sent its shares 14 per cent lower to $58.35.Net income at the nutrition supplement company declined to $120m, or $1.31 per share, shy of Wall Street expectations. Sales climbed 7 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn.Herbalife has sought to keep shareholders on board amid its battle with Mr Ackman, the founder of the Pershing Square hedge fund who claims the company is a pyramid scheme.The company, which denies Mr Ackman’s allegations, accelerated its $1.5bn share buyback plan earlier this year.Both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched a probe into the allegations.Darden shares rose 4 per cent to $46.88 after the company said Clarence Otis, who has served as Darden’s chief executive for nearly a decade, would step down at the end of the year amid an ongoing tussle with activist investor Starboard Value.The shake-up within Darden’s executive suite came as the company entered settlement discussions with Starboard regarding the firm’s proxy contest.Darden, which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, said it would trim the list of nominees to its board of directors to ensure at least three Starboard nominees are elected at the company’s annual general meeting in September.Overall, US equity markets trended lower despite rising consumer confidence figures. The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,969.95 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 16,912.11. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 4,442.70.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
86;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-07-29T13:09:07Z;UPS cuts forecast as it boosts spending;;UPS, the express parcel delivery service, cut its full-year forecast despite a 7.2 per cent rise in package volumes in the second quarter as it prepared to increase capital spending to avoid a repeat of Christmas delivery delays.The company said it expected full-year earnings per share of between $4.90 and $5.00, against the $5.05 to $5.30 range it previously forecast. It said in April when announcing first-quarter results that it expected the full-year figures to be towards the bottom of the projected range.Shares fell 4 per cent to $98.86 by close of trading in New York.UPS suffered severe operational problems during last year’s US post-Thanksgiving peak season after higher than expected volumes of ecommerce orders overwhelmed its systems, leading it to deliver many parcels – including many for Amazon – after Christmas.Net income for the second quarter fell 58 per cent to $454m, on revenue up 5.6 per cent to $14.3bn. The decline resulted from a $665m after-tax charge for changes to some US employees’ healthcare plans. Excluding the effects of the healthcare change and one-off charges in last year’s second quarter, net income would have increased 4.5 per cent to $1.12bn.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said the company was “thrilled” with the “incredible” demand the company was seeing for its services.“We’re investing heavily to handle those volumes, and it did suppress earnings a bit,” he said. “But we think that’s a great problem to have.”Explaining the downgrade, the company said it would incur an extra $175m in expenses this year on projects related to its ability to handle the peak season between the Thanksgiving holiday and Christmas. It would expand its operations on the day after Thanksgiving, accelerate the introduction of route-finding software, improve its information technology, introduce more sorting capacity at its hubs and develop further means of bringing in temporary capacity when needed.The spending would improve performance throughout the year as well as at peak times, the company said.“We’re very focused on expanding capabilities and capacity to meet the current growth not to mention the peak season,” Mr Kuehn said.On a pre-tax level, $957m of the healthcare charge was allocated to the US domestic package business, $27m to international packages and $82m to supply chain and freight.As a result of the charge, US domestic package operating profits fell 81 per cent to $209m, on revenue up 5.2 per cent to $8.67bn. International package operating profits fell 1.6 per cent to $444m on revenue up 6.2 per cent to $3.25bn, and supply chain and freight operating profits fell 41 per cent to $94m, on revenue up 6.5 per cent to $2.35bn.Earnings per share for the quarter fell 57 per cent to 49 cents, Excluding the effects of the healthcare charge and other one-offs, they would have increased 7.1 per cent to $1.21.
87;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-06-18T14:26:32Z;Strong quarter boosts FedEx’s full-year income;;Shares in FedEx, the parcel delivery company, surged in early trading in New York after it published better than expected results for the year to May 31 and announced a bullish forecast for the current financial year.Full-year net income rose 35 per cent to $2.1bn, while earnings per share rose 37 per cent to $6.75. Excluding the effects of a $496m one-off business realignment charge last year and a $100m impairment charge for declining aircraft values, net income rose 6 per cent and earnings per share rose 8.3 per cent. Analysts had expected earnings of about $6.68.Fred Smith, chief executive, said an “outstanding” fourth quarter had helped the company to post “solid” results for the year.“We believe we are well positioned for a strong fiscal 2015,” he added.The company projected earnings per share for the year to May 31 next year of $8.50 to $9.00.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the company’s results in the current financial year should benefit from base performance improvement and the continuing profit improvement initiatives at the core FedEx Express business.“Fiscal 2014 was a good year for FedEx and we expect fiscal 2015 to be even better,” Mr Graf said.The shares rose 4.5 per cent after the New York market opened, to $146.61.Both FedEx and UPS, its main rival, have struggled over the past two years with a combination of slow trade growth and customers’ shift towards lower-cost deferred air and ground forms of transport, as well as global air freight overcapacity.Fourth-quarter operating income at FedEx Express rose 3 per cent to $475m compared with last year’s figure, excluding the one-off charges, while revenue rose slightly to $7bn from $6.98bn.FedEx attributed the improved profits to higher rates per package, increased volumes and lower pension expenses, which more than offset the effect of reduced fuel surcharges and lower revenue from carrying air freight.FedEx Ground enjoyed fourth-quarter operating income up 5 per cent from last year’s adjusted figure to $586m, on revenue up 8 per cent to $3.01bn.Compared with last year’s adjusted results, fourth-quarter operating income for FedEx Freight, the company’s freight forwarding business, increased 51 per cent to $122m, on revenue up 12 per cent to $1.55bn.FedEx has been under pressure from shareholders – including Dan Loeb, the activist investor– to improve results.Mr Graf said the company remained committed to improving “earnings, cash flows, returns on invested capital and returns to shareholders”.He pointed to an increase in the quarterly divided from 15 to 20 cents, announced on June 9, as the latest example of its efforts.
88;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-06-06T22:41:49Z;New UPS CEO looks overseas for growth;;"International expansion remains the “number one goal” for UPS, its incoming chief executive said on Friday as the express parcel service said his predecessor would become non-executive chairman.David Abney is due to step up from his current role as chief operating officer on September 1 to take over from Scott Davis, who has been chief executive since 2008.Mr Davis, 62, sought a significant international expansion in 2012 through a €5.2bn takeover of the Netherlands' TNT Express, which the European Commission subsequently blocked. The TNT deal would have increased UPS’s reach not only in Europe but also in China and Brazil, two countries where UPS is keen to expand.“Our number one goal is to grow our international business,” Mr Abney said. “We’re going to make investments, whether it be from an organic standpoint or an acquisition standpoint.”The acquisitions might not be on the same scale as the attempted TNT takeover, Mr Abney said, but he added: “We’ll certainly make the decisions that are appropriate to continue to grow our business.”UPS’s shares were flat at $103.59 in New York.Mr Abney will take office as UPS faces the challenge of increasing capacity in its core North American market to avoid a repetition of its problems last Christmas with an unexpected surge in traffic. The company delivered presents that many customers had ordered from Amazon, the internet retailer, after Christmas day.Mr Davis said the Christmas crisis had “absolutely not” played a part in his decision to stand down and that the move was part of a “smooth and flawless” transition.Mr Abney said the company was working in several areas to improve its handling of this year’s Thanksgiving to Christmas peak season for traffic. It was working with customers to improve their forecasts of likely traffic; investing in new capacity such as new sorting facilities and investing in systems to track shipments and communicate with customers better.“We began our peak season planning for 2014 on December 26 last year,” Mr Abney said. “We took a good look at the circumstances and then our focus ever since then became, ‘What do we need to do?’”However, Mr Abney played down the significance of some customers’ apparent shift from high-value, premium air express shipping to lower-value deferred products, sometimes via ground rather than air. The shift has hit some recent results from both UPS and FedEx, its arch-rival.Mr Abney attributed the recent shift to weak economic growth in the US and Europe.“I would not jump to the conclusion that [preference for] deferred modes of transportation is always going to be the case,” Mr Abney said."
89;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-05-07T04:18:00Z;Alibaba: what we now know (and what we still don’t);;Alibaba on Tuesday submitted the first filing for its upcoming initial public offering in New York. Unusually for a private company, prospective investors already knew some of its key financial details, since Yahoo, its major shareholder, reports them as part of its quarterly results.So what did we learn from the new filings?What we knew …- Alibaba’s 2013 revenues were $7.9bn (less than Amazon and Ebay) and its net profits were $3.56bn (more than Amazon and Ebay)- Softbank is Alibaba’s biggest shareholder, with 34.4 per cent. Yahoo holds 22.6 per cent, while founder Jack Ma has 8.9 per cent and vice-president Joseph Tsai has 3.6 per cent.What we found out …- Alibaba values itself at between $96.9bn and $121bn, according to calculations based on the number of shares and its own valuation per share in April. This is more conservative than the up to $200bn IPO valuation expected by some analysts.- 231m annual active buyers last year traded $248bn worth of goods on Alibaba’s various retail platforms. This is equivalent to 3% of China’s GDP.- Some 1m people working in Alibaba’s logistics network shipped 5bn packages to 100,000 delivery stations in China last year. By comparison, UPS delivered 4.3bn packages.- Alibaba still has net cash of $1.4bn, despite having already made more than $6bn worth of acquisitions in the last year- Alibaba’s unusual “partnership” structure involves a self-perpetuating 28-member team that will have the right to appoint a majority of the board of directors.What do we not yet know?- Final valuation and amount the company will raise. Alibaba says in the filing it will raise $1bn, but that is a placeholder figure and sources familiar with the deal say it could be more than $15bn.2) The identity of new board members. After its listing, the company will have nine directors. Now it has four – founder Jack Ma, executive vice-chairman Joe Tsai, SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son, and Yahoo’s chief development officer Jacqueline Reses. Ms Reses will resign after the listing, leaving the identities of the new six a secret for now.3) Nasdaq or NYSE, and what stock symbol Alibaba will trade under
90;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-04-24T16:29:18Z;UPS profits hit by harsh US winter;;UPS, the express parcel delivery service, has suffered a second consecutive quarter of operational problems after it was hit “awfully hard” by a harsh North American winter that reduced operating profits by $200m.The tough conditions depressed net income 12 per cent to $911m against last year’s first quarter, on revenue up 2.6 per cent to $13.8bn. The company also warned that the disruption meant its full-year earnings per share were likely to be at the low end of its projected $5.05 to $5.30 range.The year-on-year decline comes after the company reported results for the fourth quarter last year that was severely affected by the challenges of delivering unexpectedly high volumes of goods in the peak season around Christmas. UPS struggled to deliver some goods for Amazon, the online retailer, in time and had to take on extra staff to cope.“We were clearly hit awfully hard in the US by the weather,” Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said. “But we feel the US economy is moving. We also feel very good about the core underlying business.”Operating profits in the core US domestic package business declined 14.6 per cent to $927m, on revenues up 2.6 per cent to $8.5bn. In addition to the weather disruptions, operating margins suffered from online retailers’ increased use of slower, cheaper services to serve customers. Revenue per package was down 1.5 per cent from the same period last year.Mr Kuehn said it was not necessarily a “big problem” that margins on shipments were decreasing in the face of the “incredible growth” in business to consumer shipments the company was experiencing.“We’re offering products that are slower and, in some cases, use the US Post Office [rather than UPS’s dedicated delivery drivers],” Mr Kuehn said.The company was investing to avoid a repetition of the problems at the end of last year, Mr Kuehn added.“We’re adding some capacity,” he said. “In general, that will help us during peak season.”The company was also buying processing equipment that could be moved from place to place to cope with unexpected traffic surges.International package operating profits rose 24 per cent to $348m against last year’s first quarter, when profits were hit by a $39m charge for the abortive takeover of the Netherlands’ TNT Express.Excluding the charge’s effect, operating profits would have been up 12 per cent. Revenues increased 5 per cent to $3.13bn. Export shipments climbed 7.7 per cent, driven by 15 per cent growth in Europe and “modest gains” in Asia and the Americas.Operating profits for supply chain and freight rose 3.5 per cent to $148m, on revenue down 1 per cent to $2.16bn.The shares were down 19 cents at noon in New York, at $99.05.
91;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-03-25T14:16:02Z;Big data sparks cultural changes;The amount of information a company has will not count for much if it is not ready for the revolution ahead;It only takes a quick internet search of the terms “UPS” and “telematics” to understand why the promised benefits of big data are likely to take longer to arrive than many have been led to believe.Among the links to technology information sites and Teamsters Union web pages is a comment from a blogger known as Denverbrown.Addressing drivers for the US parcel delivery service UPS, it sums up the mood of workers who sometimes find themselves at the sharp end of new technologies like this: “The system should be known as Harassamatics. They tell you it’s about safety, and seat belts . . . It’s all about stealing your break time for their profit, and harassing you into a heightened state of frenzy about your job.”Big data is facing its human moment. Many companies have ambitious plans to use data to make operations more efficient, build stronger relationships with customers or develop new revenue streams. But it will not count for much if they are not ready for the revolution ahead.Five years after it started installing sensors to monitor its vehicles and using GPS to track their movements, UPS launched one of its most ambitious technology projects: a system capable of handling the massively complex task of optimising the routes taken by its tens of thousands of drivers. No matter how impressive the technology, it is only as good as the people who use it.“For the first time in their 100-year history, they can make real-time routing decisions about picking something up and dropping it off,” says Tom Davenport, a US management expert and author, most recently, of Big Data at Work. He adds: “It takes a lot of autonomy out of the job [for drivers]. UPS people say that change management is the biggest issue.”As often happens with technologies that promise sweeping changes to the way business works, the benefits are easy to comprehend in the abstract but take longer to achieve in practice.Business processes have to adapt to accommodate new approaches. Yawning skills gaps must be bridged. Above all, corporate cultures and personal working styles have to be overhauled – starting at the top.Managers accustomed to making gut decisions have to learn the humility that comes from being led by the data.All of this points to the inevitable disappointment that lies ahead for many chief executives who have demanded big data strategies. “While big data is at the top of many companies’ agendas, few of them are getting value out of it today,” says Travis Pearson, a partner at consulting firm Bain. “The expectations are very high, so there will inevitably be disappointments.”Big data’s teething troubles can be identified in a number of areas, starting with business processes. Becoming a data-driven company means bringing a new scientific method to decision-making.“Maybe Google began that way, but everyone else has been through a revolution,” says Hugh Williams, who worked at Microsoft and eBay, as each sought to adopt data-driven management in parts of their operations. “The big internet companies have done that: now it has to happen in other companies.”Driving this approach to management is constant experimentation, as ideas are tested and retested before being widely used.“You build out a framework where you can run tens or hundreds of experiments,” says Mr Williams, now head of research and development at Pivotal, which builds technology platforms for companies using cloud computing.Making use of the results of these tests – or of the other signals sent out by data – represents another challenge, as companies learn to adapt their decision-making processes.That is particularly true of real-time sentiment analysis, which many companies undertake by studying social media, says Mr Davenport. The perceptions move all the time, leaving many executives paralysed as they watch shifts in mood without knowing how to react in a fast and effective way.Then there is culture. It is not only UPS truck drivers who have to get used to the idea of giving up some autonomy, so their company can reap the rewards of the big data age. Senior business executives are also facing changes that many are likely to find unsettling.Managers accustomed to taking decisions based on instinctive responses to situations are about to have their beliefs challenged.“You have to be open to the idea that the answers are in the data,” says Mr Williams. This represents a big shift in how managers view their role. “People are used to having an idea, building a process and getting it done,” Mr Williams says. “To be told by a relatively junior person that’s not right is a big change.”For workers in many industries, the result is likely to be disorienting.Precision agriculture, for instance, is bringing a scientific rigour to farming by using GPS to guide tractors more accurately or coming up with more precise methods for fertilising and irrigating fields.In the process, automation is making deeper inroads into human labour and decision making. “What is the farmer’s role then?” asks Mr Davenport. “We’re facing that issue in a lot of industries.”The next hurdle is the skills gap. The lack of data scientists has been widely noted. When it comes to the problems that stand in the way of companies benefiting from the data they are collecting, the talent shortage is “the biggest gap, and the hardest to close”, says Mr Pearson.Yet educational institutions have been moving fast to deal with the problem. More than 100 specialised courses for data scientists have been started by US universities and other institutions, says Mr Davenport.In addition, companies that offer massive open online courses have raced to fill the gap. Coursera, for one, has begun a data science “curriculum”, packaging a number of courses together to give online students a grasp of the range of subjects they need to master.Finally there is the technology. “Most companies hold the data in 10 places,” says Mr Williams at Pivotal. “That fragmentation leaves them well short of achieving the ideal: a data “lake” for all their information, organised and tagged in a coherent way to make it available to managers across the organisation for their particular needs.”There is more to this than a difficult technology transition. Storing data in a single location amounts to a sea-change in how data are viewed in a company.No longer just seen by individual business mangers for their own immediate needs, it becomes a true long-term asset of the business, says Mr Williams.“People are only just working out how to store and manage the data,” says Peter Levine, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, whose investments include data-storage company Actifio.The technology companies that will emerge to help businesses make full use of all the information “haven’t been built yet”, he says.
92;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-03-19T18:25:36Z;Harsh winter hits FedEx profits;;FedEx, the express parcels delivery service, on Wednesday became the latest North American transport company to produce disappointing quarterly results and cut forecasts because of the continent’s severe winter weather.FedEx slashed its earnings forecast for the full year to a range of $6.55 to $6.80 per share, down from a previous forecast suggesting earnings of around $6.97, after announcing third-quarter net income of $378m, well short of analysts’ $471m forecasts.The company said “unusually severe winter storms” throughout the quarter had disrupted operations, reducing volumes and increasing costs. The quarter’s $641m operating income had been reduced by around $125m.A range of companies – including carmakers, who have said customers have been reluctant to buy cars from freezing, snow-covered dealers’ lots and transport operators – have blamed bad results on the harsh weather.CSX, the biggest railway in the eastern US, last week warned that the harsh winter would severely affect its first-quarter profits and hold back its profit growth for the full year. The Canadian government has ordered Canadian National and Canadian Pacific, the rail operators, to move grain faster after bad weather held up movements of last autumn’s record harvest.“Historically severe winter weather significantly affected our third-quarter earnings,” Fred Smith, chief executive, said.On days when the weather was closer to normal seasonal conditions, volumes had been solid and service levels high, Mr Smith added. The company’s distinctive strategy of maintaining separate ground and air express networks and running multiple hubs had proved an advantage in the difficult conditions, he went on.FedEx’s results come after UPS, its rival, produced disappointing figures for its September to December quarter after unexpectedly high volumes of pre-Christmas e-commerce overwhelmed its network.Both companies are widely seen as barometers of the health of the US and world economies.FedEx’s figures for the December to February quarter compared with figures for the same period last year that were hit by a $47m charge for voluntary redundancy for some senior executives.Net income for the quarter was up 5 per cent on last year, to $378m, on revenue up 3 per cent to $11.3bn. Diluted earnings per share – which benefited from FedEx’s share repurchase programme – rose 9 per cent to $1.23.The company’s operating results reflected the continuing shift from high-value premium air express services to lower-yielding products that has dogged the company over the past two years.Operating income in FedEx Express – the core parcels service – rose 14 per cent to $135m, on revenue down marginally from $6.7bn to $6.67bn. Average daily international priority package volumes declined 5 per cent, in line with the move downmarket, while international economy volumes grew 8 per cent.Operating income for FedEx Ground grew 2 per cent to $477m, on revenues up 10 per cent to $3.03bn.For FedEx Freight, the freight forwarder, operating income rose from $4m to $29m, on revenues up 9 per cent to $1.35bn.Alan Graf, FedEx’s chief financial officer, said the weather’s effect on the company’s performance had been “significantly more pronounced” this year than previous years. The company’s plan outlined in 2012 to improve FedEx Express’s profits remained on track, however, he insisted.In premarket trading, shares held steady at $138.50.

Lewis Hamilton, now with the Mercedes team, is ahead of Vettel, as is Brazilian Felipe Massa, who has moved to Williams this year after eight seasons with Ferrari.Alonso was known by 71 per cent of people questioned in the poll. In Spain that number rises to 98 per cent. As well as his work with Ferrari’s main sponsors – Shell, UPS and Santander – Alonso has personal deals with fashion and eyewear group Oakley, watchmaker Viceroy and car rental company Europcar.Britain’s Hamilton, meanwhile, has a global awareness score of 64 per cent, based on the survey of 6,500 people in 13 countries. The survey measured the sportsmen against eight metrics, including endorsements, influence, appeal, trust and the aspiration of respondents to be like them.In the UK, however, Hamilton is behind former teammate Jenson Button, whose high appeal and influence scores, as well the large number of people who would aspire to his lifestyle, are considered to make him a better endorser of products. Button, who has 82 per cent awareness in the UK, has a high profile in marketing campaigns for TAG Heuer watches, Santander UK and ExxonMobil.“It may be a surprise to some that globally, Sebastian Vettel does not score as highly in terms of public opinion as the likes of Alonso, Hamilton and Massa,” says Nigel Geach, senior vice-president of motorsport at Repucom.“Alonso’s dominance in the rankings is due, in large part, to his international deals and association with the Ferrari brand. Despite Red Bull’s recent successes, globally, 59 per cent of F1 fans have an interest in the Ferrari team, representing the highest levels of interest in any F1 team.“With races screened across 160 global markets to a cumulative global TV audience of 1.8bn, one can see the importance this can have on perception.”Organisers hope this F1 season will help to revive global TV audiences for the sport, which have dropped because of Vettel’s dominance with the Red Bull Racing Renault.However, a change of technical regulations towards more environmentally friendly hybrid turbo engines is likely to set up a change of the established order, with Renault struggling with reliability while Hamilton’s Mercedes team seems the favourite to take pole position, based on preseason testing.After the first event in Australia, the remaining 18 races in the calendar will take place in Asia, Europe, North America and the Middle East. The final race takes place in Abu Dhabi in November.
94;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-01-30T16:03:30Z;UPS to invest to avoid delivery problems;Parcel service expects lift in 2014 earnings above 10%;UPS, the express parcel service, is to boost capital spending by 25 per cent this year to enhance its US domestic capacity after snarl-ups in online shopping deliveries over the holiday season hit fourth-quarter profits.Scott Davis, chief executive, announced the $500m in accelerated investments after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.25, in line with figures foreshadowed in a January 17 profit warning following its Christmas delivery problems across the US.The earnings were 7 cents lower than the previous corresponding quarter, excluding a $3bn pension charge in that quarter. Fourth-quarter net income declined 8.5 per cent to $1.17bn, on sales up 2.8 per cent to $15bn.The company nevertheless said it expected 2014 diluted earnings per share of between $5.05 and $5.30, up about 12 per cent from the $4.61 for 2013. The accelerated investment will bring capital expenditure for the year to $2.5bn.“We’re going to address the gaps that showed up as we stress-tested the business in December,” said Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer. “We know what the challenges are and we’re going to make the appropriate investments to grow the business.”UPS was forced to hire significant extra numbers of staff and lease extra equipment after it encountered far higher-than-expected volumes of parcels in the run-up to Christmas, amid one of the most severe US winters in recent years.Much of the extra traffic came from Amazon, the online retailer, which had to offer $20 gift vouchers to customers whose Christmas gifts were delivered after December 25.Global daily deliveries were 20 per cent up on last December, and there were 10 days when total deliveries surpassed all previous records. The company had to employ 85,000 temporary workers – 30,000 more than it had planned.Mr Kuehn said customers had been “disappointed” by the problems.“What customers have been saying to us is, ‘We want you to understand that we rely on you and that you will be making the investments that are needed to meet this demand’,” Mr Kuehn said. “We’re putting our money where our mouth is and working with customers to better anticipate their demand.”An improving world economy would also help the business this year, Mr Kuehn said.The operational problems reduced fourth-quarter operating profits in the core US domestic package operation to $1.2bn, 13 per cent down on last year’s figure excluding the pensions charge, on revenue up 4.2 per cent to $9.3bn.In the international packages operations, fourth-quarter operating profits rose 7.6 per cent against last year’s figure excluding the pensions effect, to $537m, on revenue up 5.3 per cent to $3.4bn.UPS’s shares were up 0.79 per cent at midday in New York, at $96.08.
95;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-01-24T17:50:10Z;Russia customs rules hit online retailers;;Western online retailers are hitting a fresh roadblock in their push into Russia, one of the world’s fastest-growing ecommerce markets, as new customs regulations hinder courier deliveries to private customers in the country.DHL and FedEx said they had suspended express deliveries from abroad to individuals in Russia because of stricter customs procedures that require lots of extra paperwork on all parcels for personal use except for documents, regardless of the shipment value.“This impacts mostly shipments for business-to-consumer ecommerce for customers such as Amazon and Net-A-Porter,” said Daniel McGrath, spokesman for DHL Express. “That is a minor part of our business, but it is a fast-growing market.”UPS has not suspended services yet but said: “We have told our customers that we’ve experienced significant delays in clearance and deliveries as a result of the change in customs procedures.”With close to 70m internet users, roughly half of its population, Russia is Europe’s largest internet market by users.Currently just 2 per cent of Russian retail sales are conducted online, but that is expected to rise to 5 per cent, more than tripling the size of the online retail market by 2015, according to Morgan Stanley.That has driven several foreign ecommerce companies to try to break domestic players’ near-total dominance of the market. Both Ebay and AliExpress, an arm of China’s Alibaba, set up Russian-language sites last year.Some boutique outlets such as the London-based online fashion retailer Net-A-Porter have also expanded in the country. Amazon offers shipping for some of its articles to Russia, but not books. Amazon, Ebay and Net-A-Porter were not available for comment.The foreign online retailers are up against Ozon, the market leader, whose business model resembles Amazon, as well as smaller and more specialised Russian companies. Shipping and payment are cited as the most common hurdles to market entry.DHL said it had suspended express delivery services to individual customers in Russia in 2010 when customs first introduced tighter restrictions, but later resumed services for some ecommerce customers. But the latest changes required the submission of some original documents and credit card payment records at customs. “Those services we just can’t provide,” Mr McGrath said.Investors frequently cite cumbersome customs clearance as one of the most serious hurdles to doing business in Russia, and the government has been focusing on simplifying procedures in its quest to improve the country’s ranking in international investment climate surveys.The latest changes are believed to be aimed at preventing consumers from dodging import tax by underreporting the value of goods for personal use.Ecommerce industry executives fear that this push could eventually lead to a lowering of the tax-free threshold, a move that would hurt foreign online retailers even more.Delivery services through the state-owned Russian Post continue unchanged. Russian Customs declined to comment.
96;UPS;United Parcel Service;2014-01-17T17:54:56Z;Amex hits all-time high on profit leap;Credit card provider boosted by improved credit quality;American Express raced to an all-time high, lifting its market capitalisation to almost $100bn, after reporting fourth-quarter profits had doubled from a year earlier.The credit card provider after-market on Thursday said profits rose 105 per cent to $1.3bn, or $1.21 a share, as card holders, particularly those in the US, increased spending during the final months of 2013. The company said earnings benefited from improved credit quality and lower write-offs.“Credit quality indicators are at historically strong levels and, while many consumers are still cautious about taking on additional debt, we again saw a modest increase in card member loans this quarter,” chief executive Kenneth Chenault said.Analysts at Susquehanna Financial and Buckingham Research upgraded the company’s rating to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’ following its results. Shares climbed as much as 5 per cent to $92.41 on Friday before closing up 3 per cent.Bank of New York Mellon shares lost 3.6 per cent to $32.70 after the custody bank suffered an 18 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings. The bank lost $115m on its investment in ConvergEx, the Wall Street broker that was accused by US regulators over its subsidiary “fleecing” clients through hidden fees.BNY Mellon has shed jobs and cut costs to deal with continued low interest rates which eat into the profits that custodian banks can earn from their bread-and-butter business of safeguarding billions of dollars-worth of customer assets. The bank has also suffered from an industry-wide spike in litigation costs.Morgan Stanley investors shrugged off a 78 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits, mainly on litigation costs, sending the investment bank’s shares almost 5 per cent higher to close at $33.40.Legal costs and weakness in the company’s fixed-income unit were a drag on Morgan Stanley’s profits, which at $192m, or 7 cents a share, missed analyst expectations. The company set aside $1.2bn in additional legal reserves for litigation related to residential mortgage-backed securities and the credit crisis.Shares in video game maker Electronic Arts led the S&P 500 higher, rising 12 per cent to $24.10, after analysts at CRT Capital initiated research coverage of the company with a ‘buy’ rating.The broker said it expected rising digital sales and a strong video game catalogue to lift the company’s results.“Video game stocks trade on game slates, and we believe that EA has one of the most highly anticipated games coming out at the end of March,” analyst Neil Doshi says. “And with 2014 being a World Cup year, we expect this to be a strong year for EA’s Fifa franchise.”General Electric shares fell at the fastest pace in nearly seven months after its profit margins missed goals set by chief executive Jeff Immelt.GE fell 3 per cent to $26.58. Fourth-quarter profits grew 5 per cent to $4.2bn on a 3 per cent rise in revenues to $40.4bn. Infrastructure orders in the period rose 8 per cent to $30.7bn.Mr Immelt has targeted a 70 basis point improvement in the company’s manufacturing unit’s profit margins. Margins increased 66 basis points from a year earlier.A profit warning from UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, sent the company’s stock as much as 4 per cent lower before recovering to close down 0.6 per cent at $99.91.UPS said it expected fourth-quarter and full-year earnings to be below previous expectations as it struggled to cope with a surge of last minute orders and a shortened holiday shopping season.The shipping giant said it hired 30,000 more temporary employees than planned in an effort to process the rise in shipments, weighing on profitability. Several retailers in the US were forced to apologise to customers after UPS and FedEx failed to deliver packages on time for Christmas as promised.Intel also weighed on the benchmark S&P 500, falling 2.6 per cent to $25.85 after reporting quarterly results short of Wall Street expectations.The Silicon Valley company said that sales at its PC division were $8.6bn, flat compared to the same quarter in 2012 but 2 per cent higher than the third. Investors have been awaiting stronger revenue growth as the company moves further away from computers. On Friday it also announced job cuts of 5 per cent of staff, affecting about 5,000 employees.The S&P 500 was marginally higher for the week, after falling 0.4 per cent to 1,838.70 on Friday. The index, which had earlier this week erased some of its losses, remains lower since the year began.The index struggled for direction on Friday, after a preliminary reading of consumer confidence in the US showed a decline. The report, by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters, showed a divergence in economic expectations between middle- and high-income households.Economists at Barclays noted the expiration of unemployment benefits may have been responsible for the drop in sentiment.“Opinions of government economic policy soured, though, as only 9 per cent of respondents thought the government was doing a good job,” economist Cooper Howes said. “This matches the level seen during the government shutdown in October.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 16,458.56 while the Nasdaq was down 0.5 per cent at 4197.58 on Friday.
97;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;UPS warns on profit after gift delivery chaos;;A chaotic peak gift-giving season that led thousands of customers to receive their parcels late will knock almost 14 per cent from United Parcel Service’s fourth-quarter 2013 earnings.UPS issued the warning after Amazon, the online retailer, was forced to offer thousands of customers $20 gift cards because parcels arrived after Christmas day. The company subsequently said it was reviewing the performance of its delivery companies.UPS said its North American results were “negatively impacted” by the challenges of the “compressed peak season”.The Thanksgiving holiday – which traditionally marks the start of the holiday shopping season – was unusually late, falling on November 28, meaning that Christmas shopping took place over a shorter-than-usual period.The company also suffered from an “unprecedented level of online shopping” that included a “surge of last-minute orders”, it said.The announcement is a particular blow to UPS because it has prided itself on its prowess in managing fast-growing demand from online retailers more efficiently than its rivals. The shares fell as much as 4 per cent on the news before recovering slightly to be down about 0.58 per cent at $99.91.The company is expecting 2013 diluted earnings per share of $4.57, against its previous guidance of a range of $4.65 to $4.85, after adjustment for one-off items such as merger fees.Fourth-quarter earnings per share were expected to be about $1.25, about 13.6 per cent down from the $1.32 to $1.52 range that the previous forecast had implied. Unadjusted diluted earnings per share would be about $4.61, the company said.The cut to 2013 profit forecasts is UPS’s second in six months after it reduced its previous prediction of $4.80 to $5.06 adjusted diluted earnings per share in July, blaming the slowing US economy and worldwide airfreight overcapacity.UPS said that, “in an effort to maintain service standards and commitments”, it had taken “extraordinary measures” ahead of the holiday period.“For example, the company utilised 85,000 temporary employees, 30,000 more than planned,” it said.Unusually harsh winter weather across the US before Christmas had also “weighed on results”, the company said.UPS said that, despite the fourth-quarter problems, it was confident in its 2014 forecast.It expected earnings to grow “in line with its long-term growth targets” of 10 to 15 per cent compared with adjusted 2013 results. The company reports full-year results on January 30.Both UPS and FedEx, its main rival, have been grappling with a customer shift away from their highest value, premium air services towards lower-cost slower air services and ground services.
98;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Letter from Lex: Beam me up;A big M&A deal and the latest results from US banks;"Readers,The week has ended with a small flurry of mildly dreary reports from major companies. At Shell, a new CEO informed the market that both the exploration and the refining business had struggled in the fourth quarter, and earnings would be well lower than analysts hoped. Intel saw decent sales growth in the quarter, but profits were a disappointment. The company sees no sales growth this year. UPS blamed bad numbers on bad weather and a short Thanksgiving to Christmas shopping season.The weather excuse always looks like humbug. More generally, though, Lex is wondering whether the recovery we are seeing in economic data in the US, China, and Europe is going to start to show up in company reports. Consider this wildly unscientific survey of the issues Lex looked at this week:• Good earnings numbers from JPMorgan – but where’s the loan growth?• Goldman and Citigroup’s fixed-income trading businesses continue to struggle. It will be interesting to see if their fortunes improve now that a decision on tapering has been taken by the US Fed.• The wealth management businesses at Bank of America, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley did quite well – but this is a reflection of the elevated stock market more than the economy.• News that GM would pay a dividend is an encouraging expression of confidence for that company, as is its beefy investment plan – but not much growth is expected in 2014.No terrible news; nothing really buoyant, either. For optimists, however, there was one major piece of exuberance that outweighs all this moaning. Suntory ponied up $14bn in cash to buy whiskey maker Beam – 20 times the target’s operating cash flow. Japan Inc is on the prowl.It’s Friday. How about a drink?Robert Armstrong, Head of Lex"
99;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:51:47+0000;Amazon reviews shippers after hold-ups;;Amazon is looking at the performance of delivery companies handling its orders after packages were left stranded in distribution centres instead of being placed under Christmas trees.The online retailer pointed the finger at others for the failure, saying it had processed orders in time and was “reviewing the performance of the delivery carriers”.It added that it had limited the number of new customers for Prime, its service that provides free shipping and other benefits in return for a $79 annual membership fee. The move came before reports spread of a rash of delays to ecommerce deliveries in the US in the run-up to Christmas.UPS, which is estimated to handle around 45 per cent of package deliveries in the US, blamed severe weather in parts of the country and a surge in ecommerce for a backlog that overwhelmed its air delivery network, leaving an unspecified number of packages stuck in its logistics centres this week.Amazon said it had held back the growth of its Prime service “during peak periods to ensure service to current members was not impacted by the surge in new membership”.Despite that, it said that it had signed up more than 1m new customers during the third week of December, leaving it with “tens of millions” of customers for the service.The comment, pointing to a Prime membership of more than 20m, was the closest Amazon has come to revealing how many people use the service, which provides free two-day delivery as well as access to Amazon’s streaming video and ebook lending services.Amazon said it had given $20 gift cards to its own customers who had failed to get gifts they ordered.UPS said that an unexpected flood of packages had left it struggling to keep up in the final days before Christmas. “The volume we received was more than forecast,” a spokeswoman said on Thursday.The holiday shopping season was compressed by Thanksgiving falling later in November than usual, the delivery company said, while ice storms in the western US had caused backlogs at Dallas/Fort Worth airport that reverberated through its system.The shift towards online shopping this year was also bigger than some forecasts had projected, with IBM reporting that online sales jumped by 21 per cent on Cyber Monday, traditionally the busiest day in the US ecommerce calendar. UPS said it expected to clear its Christmas backlog by the end of Friday.
100;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;FedEx earnings disappoint as customers seek cheaper options;;Earnings for FedEx, the express parcels delivery service, improved less than expected in the three months to the end of November as the late US shopping season squeezed margins in its ground operations.Net income grew 14 per cent to $500m, on revenues up 3 per cent to $11.4bn, compared with the same quarter last year, when Superstorm Sandy affected the company’s results. Earnings per diluted share rose 13 per cent to $1.57.However, analysts had been expecting results around $1.63 per share and, although the company increased its forecast earnings per share forecast for the year to May 31 marginally, it attributed the growth to share buybacks, rather than net income growth. It lifted its EPS growth forecast to 8 to 14 per cent above last year’s adjusted results, compared with 7-13 per cent previously.The shares were up 0.5 per cent in New York on Wednesday, at $139.72.Fred Smith, chief executive, said the earnings – for the second quarter of FedEx’s financial year – had been “solid” and said the profit improvement plan for the key FedEx Express parcel service continued to “gain momentum”.“Overall, we believe our strategy is working well and we’ll achieve our goals,” Mr Smith said.Both FedEx and UPS, its main rival, have been struggling to counteract a shift by customers away from their premium time-guaranteed delivery services and from air shipments to ground.In October last year, FedEx announced plans to cut costs in its air operations and expand ground capacity to adjust to the shift. However, it was still forced in March to cut its forecasts for the year to May 31 and ground some aircraft because of a “radically changed” international trading situation.Operating income at FedEx Express, the air parcel delivery segment, grew 42 per cent to $326m, although revenues declined marginally from $6.86bn to $6.84bn. The decline resulted from falling fuel surcharge rates and express freight volumes – international priority package volumes fell 5 per cent – but were mostly offset by increased yields per package.Operating income at FedEx ground grew 3 per cent to $424m, on revenue up 10 per cent to $2.85bn. The company attributed the decline in operating margin to a later-than-normal start to the US holiday shopping season, which began in December after the quarter ended.Operating income at FedEx freight grew 1 per cent to $77m, on revenue up 4 per cent to $1.43bn.Last month Dan Loeb, the activist investor, disclosed that his Third Point fund had taken a stake in FedEx– whose size he did not disclose – and that he had met Mr Smith to discuss ways to improve the company’s performance.
101;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;Business salutes trade deal as WTO ‘delivers’;;Business leaders have welcomed the first global trade deal in the WTO’s 18-year history as a boost to the bottom line and the global economy.The “trade facilitation” deal approved by the World Trade Organisation’s 159 member countries at the weekend is meant to streamline customs procedures and ease the flow of goods around the world.To help developing economies in Africa and elsewhere meet requirements of the agreement as early as January, donors including the EU, the World Bank and the OECD have promised to fund aid programs to train customs officials and develop infrastructure.Paperwork and delays at borders have long been nominated as among the “most costly and least predictable non-tariff barriers to trade” by companies, said Roberto Azevêdo, the WTO’s head. “For the first time in its history the WTO has delivered.”Scott Davis, the chairman and chief executive of UPS, the logistics company, hailed a “giant step forward for businesses large and small in expediting the movement of goods globally and reducing unnecessary paperwork”.Walmart, the US retailer, said the agreement would “significantly reduce the costs of customs clearances, logistics, border measures and other inefficiencies [and] enhance our ability to deliver the right product at the right time and price”.It would also, said Doug Oberhelman, chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar, provide “momentum” to other negotiations, including the EU-US trade negotiations and those now underway to conclude a Pacific Rim pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Christian Verschueren, director-general of Euro-Commerce, which represents European retailers and wholesalers, said: “This is a good day for Europe and the world economy. We will now see quicker and more simplified border procedures, acting as a catalyst for trade, growth and jobs. The Trade Facilitation Agreement is a win-win-win deal.”The International Chamber of Commerce estimates that the deal, which is expected to take two years to enact, would cut the cost of shipping goods by 10-15 per cent worldwide and boost global output by up to $1tn.The agreement requires the removal of obstacles such as the mandatory requirement of customs brokers and sets up an international trade facilitation committee to keep pushing for the streamlining of bureaucracy.Under WTO rules the deal will take effect once it is ratified by two-thirds of the 159 member states. The Obama administration believes the accord does not need Congressional approval but has not yet decided whether to seek a vote on Capitol Hill, according to Michael Punke, the US ambassador to the WTO. The EU’s approval process is expected to culminate in a vote by the European Parliament.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson and Ed Crooks in New York
102;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:51:47+0000;UPS sticks to full-year results forecast;;UPS, the express parcel delivery service, announced that third-quarter earnings more than doubled and reiterated its forecast for full-year results well above last year’s, betting that growing ecommerce volumes would outweigh economic concerns.The company – which is closely watched for signs of the health of US and global business – announced net income rose to $1.1bn from $469m, on revenue up 3.4 per cent to $13.5bn. Profit would have been 6.7 per cent up from last year excluding the net effect on 2012’s figures of a $559m one-off charge to restructure some US employees’ pension liabilities.Diluted earnings per share rose from 48 cents to $1.17. Excluding the pensions charge, they would have grown 9.4 per cent.The US domestic package business performed particularly strongly, benefiting from the continuing growth of ground services, which are winning out as customers switch from more expensive air delivery. Domestic ground revenue increased 6.6 per cent to $5.87bn, while US domestic package revenue overall grew 5 per cent to $8.25bn. Operating profits for the business, excluding the pension write-off, rose 16 per cent to $1.19bn.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said the third-quarter results had been strong and in line with the company’s expectations. While some retailers were expressing caution about the holidays, he added, they still expected robust sales online – which increases package volume for UPS.“There has been this continual trend of more and more shopping done online,” Mr Kuehn said. “What we’ve seen is that UPS gets a significant amount of that during the holidays. So even a modest overall spend in the retail sector can be magnified into a stronger peak season for us.”The late timing of this year’s Thanksgiving in the US meant the peak holiday shipping season would be “compressed”, which presented some “operating challenges”, he added.“Nonetheless, we are confident in UPS’s ability to successfully deliver the holidays,” he said.Mr Kuehn reiterated the company’s guidance for the full year of diluted earnings per share adjusted for items like the one-off pension write-off of $4.65 to $4.85, between 3 and 7 per cent up on last year.The company had cut its forecasts in July, citing economic worries.Both UPS and FedEx, its main rival, have been grappling with a drift by customers away from high-margin guaranteed next-day delivery air express parcels towards lower-cost services, including truck, rail and sea shipping.In international packages, the company provided further evidence that Europe is starting to recover, saying daily export shipments from Europe were 10 per cent up on the same period last year, while shipments from Asia were flat. Operating profits for the business, however, fell 7.1 per cent because of currency and fuel price movements to $417m, on revenue up 2.5 per cent to $3.02bn.Supply chain and freight operating profits grew 6.9 per cent to $201m, on revenue down 0.7 per cent to $2.25bn.The shares rose 1.2 per cent to close at $95.61.

104;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Cheaper shipping choices hamper performance at UPS;Parcel delivery group pledges to adapt to leaner conditions;UPS, the express parcel delivery group, promised to adapt to tough market conditions after reporting what it admitted was a “disappointing” second-quarter performance.The Atlanta-based company that is considered one of the bellwethers for the US economy suffered from a tough economic climate as customers chose cheaper shipping services, causing a 4 per cent decline in net income to $1.07bn for the three months ended June 30, compared with $1.12bn the same period a year ago.This month the company’s shares tumbled after it warned investors earnings would fall short of expectations and lowered its full-year profit outlook.UPS blamed customers’ increasing willingness to use slower, less expensive, delivery methods, as well as overcapacity in the worldwide air freight business, and slowdown in the US industrial sector.As foreshadowed, diluted earnings per share fell to $1.13 from $1.15 a year ago. The company cut its full-year forecast by 4 per cent to a range of $4.65 to $4.85.Total revenue rose 1.2 per cent to $13.51bn, falling short of expectations of $13.59bn.“Market conditions and shipper preferences clearly impacted on our freight forwarding and International business,” said Scott Davis, chief executive. “UPS is adapting to these conditions to ensure we deliver a solid second half.”In the international-package business, revenue rose 1.6 per cent while profit slipped 0.7 per cent.The shares were slightly lower on opening in New York, down 0.42 per cent to $87.24.
105;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;Kuehne & Nagel: shipping forecast;World’s largest sea freight forwarder gives clues about state of global economy;Economies expand. Goods move. Shippers make money. It’s a simple equation – and the modest 3 per cent rise in first half 2013 sales and gross profits at Kuehne & Nagel, the world’s largest sea freight forwarder and number two player in air freight, says a lot. Growth has not disappeared. But, as US delivery group UPS warned last week, it is very patchy. Customers are seeking cheaper shipping options – avoiding premium air freight, for example. That is putting pressure on prices in markets where there is too much capacity. It is also making good cost management essential.Against this ho-hum backdrop, Kuehne’s performance could fairly be described as creditable, causing shares in the Swiss group – which have yo-yoed around the SwF110 level for two years – to gain more than 3 per cent on Monday. On the sea freight side (about half of group revenues) Kuehne managed a 3 per cent volume increase in the first six months, outstripping more sluggish 1-2 per cent growth in the market overall. Rates are still volatile, but margins were held. Air freight did slightly better – volume growth near 4 per cent, suggesting market share gains – but the road business remained poor. A small first half operating loss was notched up, although Kuehne says the second quarter was profitable.After more than a century in the freight business, Kuehne is no stranger to the ebbs and flows of international trade. Like other freight forwarders, it benefits from not having money tied up in capital assets (unlike delivery companies,). The balance sheet is conservative, with net cash increasing slightly, year on year, to SwF815m. But these strengths are already reflected in the share rating: using 2013 consensus estimates the price-earnings multiple is 22 times, compared with a historic average of 19. Given the state of the global economy, that seems high.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
106;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-07-12T13:25:43Z;UPS cuts result forecasts on economic worries;Package delivery group blames US backdrop and freight overcapacity;The slowing of the US economy and worldwide air freight overcapacity prompted UPS, the express parcel delivery service, to cut its full-year earnings forecast and warn on the outlook for second-quarter profits and revenues.The warning from UPS – which said second-quarter diluted earnings per share would be $1.13 against $1.15 for the same period in 2012 – follows similar warnings in recent months by FedEx, the company’s main rival.UPS cut forecast full-year 2013 profits from the previous $4.80-$5.06 range to $4.65-$4.85, or about 4 per cent.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said the anticipated full-year figure would still represent a 3-7 per cent increase over 2012’s profits and that the company still anticipated “solid profit growth” in the second half.He added: “We expect the second-quarter market trends to persist and UPS is adapting to meet these conditions.”The company had not previously given a forecast for the second-quarter results.Both UPS and FedEx are often seen as bellwethers for the world economy, given their important role connecting businesses.FedEx warned as long ago as September that it was suffering from customers’ growing preference for its cheaper FedEx Ground services over its more expensive air offerings and for slower delivery of air packages. FedEx said on June 19, when it announced its results for the year to May 31, that it was planning further capacity cuts on top of a series of accelerated retirements of aircraft announced in early June. UPS’s statement on Friday was strikingly similar.“Overcapacity in the global air freight market, increasing customer preference for lower-yielding shipping solutions, and a slowing US industrial economy drove revenue and operating profit below expectations,” it said. “In addition, UPS experienced some slowing in package volume growth as a result of labour negotiations.”While express parcel and logistics operators such as UPS and FedEx are vulnerable to swings in world economic demand, they are also exposed to changes in air cargo capacity. Air cargo rates have been depressed by significant deliveries of pure air cargo aircraft such as the new Boeing 747-8F freighter, as well as the expansion of capacity in the cargo holds of new, long-haul twin aisle jets such as Boeing’s 787 and Airbus’s A380.UPS gave no indication how it planned to cut capacity to reflect the slower-than-expected demand growth.UPS shares lost about 5 per cent of their value on opening in New York, trading at around $87 each.
107;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-07-11T18:28:24Z;Negotiators pin hopes on early customs deal;;US and EU trade negotiators are grappling with ways to smooth customs procedures across the Atlantic, with an early agreement on such measures potentially spurring multilateral negotiations on border clearance at the World Trade Organisation.“Trade facilitation” – code for an array of provisions designed to reduce the bottlenecks of packages at customs – was one of several items on Thursday’s agenda at the first round of transatlantic trade talks in Washington.Some see this as one area where US and EU officials could find common ground within a few rounds of negotiations since it is less controversial than agriculture, privacy, procurement, and financial regulation, where there are deeper divisions.“On trade facilitation there is strong interest on both sides – and among the stakeholders – and you do not have the sensitivities that you have on other issues. There could be tangible benefits and not insurmountable differences in terms of approach,” said one EU official involved in the talks.Companies cheering on a deal on customs streamlining include some of the big logistics groups – such as DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS – which are optimistic that a compromise can be forged between the US and the EU relatively quickly. While the EU and US trade talks are not expected to strike a final deal before the end of 2014, some chapters of the discussions may be completed sooner.“I think the signs we have received from people is that they are all very gung-ho on trade facilitation. They think it is an area of great promise,” says Penelope Naas, a senior UPS executive in Brussels, noting that she would expect it to “close pretty early”.Some people observing the EU-US talks caution that trade facilitation may not necessarily proceed on a swifter timeline than other areas, but early progress could help energise multilateral trade negotiations ahead of a crucial summit of ministers in Bali in December. Easing the cost and red tape at borders is a core element of what is left from the near-defunct decade-old Doha round of multilateral trade talks, and even on that WTO members have been struggling to reach an agreement.“Because US and EU negotiators are working so closely together over the next five months before Bali it is a great opportunity to co-ordinate and push common objectives in the WTO,” says Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think-tank.To be sure, the EU and the US are looking to go deeper on trade facilitation in their bilateral deal than they will in a Bali package, which has been clouded by divisions over food security measures pushed by some developing countries such as India. But a unified position forged bilaterally could help set a standard for the rest of the world – which is a goal for the EU and the US in other areas as well.Business groups say that an EU-US deal on trade facilitation should include a “single window” for customs clearance in both the US and the EU, arguing it would be more efficient and lower costs. They are also demanding more co-ordinated inspection activities among US government agencies and EU member states, a higher minimum threshold for taxes and duties set at $800, the payment of customs taxes in arrears, rather than in advance, and the harmonisation of air cargo security measures across the Atlantic.“We are pushing it because we think it is an area where every company benefits but in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, we think it is a very important issue,” Ms Naas of UPS says.Also on the agenda of the US and EU talks on Thursday were agricultural market access and sanitary issues, investment and dispute settlement, the environment, financial services, competition, labour and state-owned enterprises. The top negotiators for both sides are expected to hold a closing press conference today.
108;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-06-12T23:07:52Z;Industrial process;The drive towards greater flexibility and reduction of waste continues, writes Robert Wright;Within a year of Henry Ford’s introduction of the first modern assembly line at his factory near Detroit in 1913, the system had slashed the time to build a Model T Ford from 12.5 man hours to just 93 minutes.A century later, industrial engineers are still trying to reduce the inflexibility in Ford’s system. The most eye-catching innovation is 3D printing, which could eventually make products as varied as Ford’s Model Ts were identical. But even now information technology is cutting waste and boosting flexibility in many forms of manufacturing.General Motors’ Orion assembly plant, 30km north of Ford’s old Model T plant, was redesigned to maximise its efficiency. Workers installing wiring, pipes and other small parts now receive individual, tailored component kits just as the relevant car body arrives, providing far more flexibility to vary output.The plant also encapsulates some less obvious innovations borrowed from the lean manufacturing philosophy developed by Toyota of Japan. The assembly line is shorter, reducing the capital tied up in it, with the freed-up space used to bring in many parts suppliers, reflecting the shortening of supply chains in other manufacturing processes.Orion has also brought back to the US work that had been done overseas – a nascent trend that also reduces concerns heightened since the 2011 tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand.The tsunami knocked out plants that were the sole source of some products. In an irony that might have amused Henry Ford – whose Model Ts were famously always the same colour – some black paints supplied to Ford were among the supplies affected.——————————————-Containerisation and global supply chainsIt was in 1937, when waiting to drop off a load of wool at port in Hoboken, New Jersey, that Malcolm McLean is said to have conceived an idea that transformed the transport of goods, writes Robert Wright.McLean, a lifelong entrepreneur, had to wait most of the day to deliver the wool bales in his truck. He sat watching stevedores unloading trucks, putting bales into slings and hoisting them piece by piece on to vessels.It would be much simpler, he reasoned, to take off the rear half of his truck and put that on the ship. “It struck me that I was looking at a lot of wasted time and money,” he recalled later.The epiphany prompted McLean to found Sea-Land, the world’s first container shipping line, to carry boxes by sea without loading or unloading them at port. The first ship, the Ideal X, set off in April 1956, carrying 58 containers and a load of oil from Port Elizabeth, New Jersey, to Houston, Texas. According to industry legend, the heavy regulation of the trucking sector meant the trip cost the same as driving a single truck to Houston.The effects would transform the business of moving manufactured and semi-finished goods. Ships could load and unload within hours rather than days or weeks. Quicker loading made larger ships possible but required bigger ports downriver from city centres.However, the technology’s most lasting legacy stems from Sea-Land’s contract to containerise US military logistics during the Vietnam war. Sea-Land took to dropping off empty containers in Japan on the way back across the Pacific. The resulting opening-up of the US electronics market to cheap, Japanese-made goods was a key step towards the integration of Asian manufacturers into a globalised world economy.Yet it is only now that shipping lines are achieving the full efficiency benefits of McLean’s innovation. This year, Denmark’s Maersk Line will take delivery of the first of 20 ships capable of carrying 18,000 containers – more than twice as many as the largest ships 10 years ago.Last decade’s Asian export boom led to overordering of ships and a slump in vessel earnings, but those conditions show no sign of halting the wider adoption of McLean’s simple but world-transforming idea.…Outsourcing/ value chain deconstructionThe vast container ships that sail into the ports of most developed countries are often thought to be full of cheap electronics, toys and other finished goods, bound for shop shelves, writes Robert Wright. The truth is more complicated, however. Many of the containers bring components, chemicals and other semi-finished parts for industrial processes.Those components are moving along production lines that stretch around the world. The question is how fundamentally the vast changes in the world economy following the 2008 financial crisis – and a series of shocks to supply chains following recent natural disasters – will reshape the system.Many companies have started to carry less stock, concerned that they might again be left with significant unsold inventory in a downturn. That has further increased the pressure on shippers to deliver goods to a tight schedule.“We’re in a just-in-time world,” says Scott Davis, chief executive of UPS, the parcel and logistics company, a major beneficiary of the outsourcing trend.Many manufacturers, facing rising wages in China and struggling to make quick changes to their product lines, have moved some operations to Mexico, Turkey and other countries nearer the world’s biggest consumer economies.High oil prices are also a factor. Less time-critical goods that once went by air often move by ship or truck instead. And overall growth in freight movements is no longer outpacing economic growth to the same degree as it did for much of the past decade.Many of the essentials of the international supply chain remain much as they were during the outsourcing boom of the 2000s, but are focused on serving consumers in a wider range of markets. Logistics operators are scrambling to acquire or set up better delivery operations in emerging markets.“With projections that they will add 1m people a week for the next 30 years, we’re going to see cross-border trade stay very strong for years to come,” Davis says.…Process innovationThe history of the control of industrial processes has been tied inextricably to the evolution of the computer, writes Peter Marsh.In the early days of large-scale industrial production, the control of processes, for making products from chocolate to cement, was done by humans. A person would set in motion a series of manufacturing steps – for example, adding ingredients to a mixture to make an end-product such as a foodstuff or an industrial chemical.On the basis of set factors, such as the time normally regarded as the optimum for a specific process, the human controller would either stop the process or alter it – adding another set of raw materials or increasing the temperature of the reaction, for example.Over time, mechanical or electronic systems have replaced the human element in this procedure. The biggest changes have come about as a result of the growing sophistication of small, cheap electronic computers – a development that gathered pace from the 1950s – followed by the advent of devices called programmable logic controllers (PLCs), devised in the late 1960s. These are computing systems that take in information from input devices, such as industrial sensors, and process data according to sets of software.As a result of the processing, instructions are provided to output devices or actuators – gears, levers and control valves, for instance – to change the conditions of a specific reaction or set of processes. In this way, increasingly smaller, cheaper and more sophisticated computers can be used to monitor and adjust the way products are made across a huge range of industrial processes.The “father” of the PLC is normally regarded as Dick Morley, an engineer who worked in the US for a small company called Bedford Associates. In 1968 an engineering team run by Morley drew up what is considered the first set of blueprints for how a PLC would work.The initial customer for the devices was General Motors, the US automotive group, which used the systems to control parts of some production lines.Modern PLCs use much the same principles to these early devices, but they rely on appreciably faster and smarter computing devices linked sometimes to hundreds if not thousands of sensors and actuators.Such PLCs can control not just the production of discrete products, such as car parts, but also the entire operation of production lines making items such as steel or plastics through “continuous flow” procedures.As a result, the degree of accuracy that can be achieved is many times greater than in the days when humans by themselves were in charge.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
110;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-04-29T10:05:32Z;TNT Express revenues fall as global operations scale down;;TNT Express announced revenues fell 4.5 per cent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, as the Dutch express delivery group scales back its global operations to concentrate on its core European market.The company’s operating earnings rose sharply to €231m, but that was mainly due to a €200m termination fee paid by UPS after the US express delivery group was forced to give up its takeover bid in January. The takeover was blocked by the European Commission over competition concerns.The results were difficult to compare with earlier quarters as TNT Express stopped including revenues from its Brazilian operations, which it is in the process of selling.But the revenues of €1.67bn were well below analysts’ consensus expectations of €1.8bn, even after adding the €71m in revenues from Brazil. Disregarding one-offs and currency effects, operating earnings fell to €38m from €54m in the same quarter last year.Bernard Bot, interim chief executive, told journalists that the poor results were largely due to “the general weak economic environment”, particularly in Europe, where TNT Express competes with Germany’s DHL for the top market share.“If there’s less demand and there’s still supply, you can figure it out, there’s pressure on prices,” Mr Bot said.One bright spot was a 7 per cent increase in consignments per day in Europe, the Mideast and Africa. But the weight per consignment fell and customers continued to shift away from air and towards cheaper road-based delivery, leading to an overall revenue decline.Mr Bot said TNT Express’s cost-cutting programme, which it calls “Deliver!”, would begin providing results in the second half of the year. The programme targets annual savings of €220m, with 10-15 per cent later this year and the rest to follow in 2014 and 2015.The results were “a bit weaker than expected, but that’s mostly in the share price already”, said Maarten Bakker, an analyst at ABN Amro. “People are looking ahead to 2014, that’s when the results of the cost-cutting programmes will start coming in.”Shares were up 0.5 per cent at €5.89 in morning trading on the Amsterdam exchange, against a 0.4 per cent rise in the AEX index.
111;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-04-25T16:17:29Z;UPS benefits from rise in post-Christmas returns;;A rise in returns of online purchases after Christmas helped UPS, the express parcel delivery service, offset weak international package demand and improve first-quarter net income by 6.9 per cent to $1.04bn.The buoyant e-commerce demand, which UPS said was “very strong” in January, partly because of use of its returns service, boosted operating profits at the core US domestic package business by 9 per cent to $1.08bn, on sales up 3.3 per cent to $8.27bn, compared with a year ago.Overall revenue rose 2.3 per cent to $13.4bn, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter rose 8 per cent to $1.08. The company reaffirmed its guidance that full-year adjusted earnings per share would be $4.80 to $5.06.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said that January had started strongly, thanks to the strong post-holiday season.“We know that there’s a big increase in deliveries direct to consumers,” Mr Kuehn said. “We don’t know exactly the source of each sender that generates a delivery for us. But the preponderance of it is happening over the internet.”UPS reported a similar demand pattern to FedEx, its worldwide rival in the express package business, with cheaper, slower parcel delivery services performing strongly and US domestic business doing better than international.Revenue per package in the US domestic business grew only 0.4 per cent as revenue at UPS Ground – a cheaper alternative to the core air express business – outpaced the wider business’s growth, up 5 per cent year on year. Revenue at the premium next day air service grew only 1.8 per cent, while cheaper deferred delivery air services grew 3.7 per cent.Mr Kuehn said UPS strove to offer a “full suite of solutions” to customers. “We find that with the different economic cycles customers make use of different services,” he said. “It’s something we’re very used to.”The international package business suffered more from moves to cheaper options and lighter packages. International package revenue grew 0.4 per cent to $2.98bn, while operating profits fell 13.7 per cent to $352m.The segment’s profits suffered from a $56m charge for the aborted attempted takeover of TNT Express, the Netherlands-based express package company. At a group level, the company reported a net $36m gain from the aborted TNT takeover. UPS is now appealing against the European Commission barring the deal.Exports were strongest from Asia, growing 8 per cent, the company said, while European exports grew 3 per cent and US exports expanded “slightly”.Yield – revenue per package – declined 2.5 per cent over the same quarter last year, after stripping out the effects of currency fluctuations.Mr Kuehn said there had been higher growth in deferred services in international markets than the premium express services. “That does impact the top line,” he said.Operating profit at supply chain and freight, the company’s freight forwarding business, was 13.9 per cent down to $143m, on revenue up 0.9 per cent to $2.18bn. The company blamed the decline on overcapacity on routes from Asia, where both air cargo and container shipping rates have fallen thanks to excess aircraft and ship deliveries.UPS shares rose 2.3 per cent to $85.42.
112;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;UPS contests block on TNT Express merger;;UPS has appealed against the European Commission’s January decision to block its merger with TNT Express, saying it fears the Commission’s reasoning could hinder its efforts to expand through acquisitions in Europe.The European competition commissioner barred the US delivery group’s proposed €5.2bn takeover of its Dutch peer after a nine-month investigation, saying it would result in too much concentration in the European express delivery market.The appeal to the European General Court in Luxembourg is likely to last years. A UPS spokesperson said the company was not seeking to renew its bid for TNT Express, but wanted to ensure that the commission’s decision “couldn’t be used as a precedent for decisions on future acquisitions”.UPS has said since the failure of the TNT Express takeover that it still plans to expand in Europe, in part by acquiring other companies. The company said the filing of the appeal last week was prompted by a legal deadline to challenge the ruling.In rejecting the merger, the commission found that UPS and TNT Express were both so-called “integrators”, combining extensive air and ground capabilities. It separately examined whether the merger would lead to reduced competition in each European national market, an approach that could present problems for any future efforts by UPS to acquire companies with a significant market share in an individual country.TNT Express said it “has taken note” of the appeal but did not expect a renewal of the takeover offer.The failure of the merger was a severe blow to the Dutch group, which has been forced to revisit its strategy as a standalone company with its shares hovering 40 per cent below UPS’s €9.50 offer. TNT Express announced this month that it had sold its Chinese domestic delivery operations, and plans to divest its Brazilian operations in order to refocus on Europe, where it competes with Germany’s DHL for the leading market share.
113;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;TNT Express: quick delivery needed;Dutch group’s detailed strategy seems similar to the old one;Life alone can take some getting used to – especially when a warm embrace had seemed to be on offer. But needs must, so TNT Express is cracking on with its independent existence. Just two months after European antitrust officials blocked a proposed €5.2bn bid from US delivery giant UPS, the Dutch group has a new chief executive and, as of Monday, a detailed business plan. At €5.64, TNT shares are well below UPS’s €9.50 a share bid price. But they have recovered to within hailing distance of the 2012 level reached before Big Brown arrived.This is somewhat surprising. Monday’s plan contained few surprises: in fact, by focusing on TNT’s European assets and divesting domestic operations elsewhere, it reverted to the strategy envisaged before the UPS offer. But the hard detail, in terms of numbers and timing, included good news and bad. On the plus side, disposals seem to be moving forward: news on the Chinese front is “imminent” and moves to hive off the lossmaking Brazilian business are formally under way. Profitable Australian operations will be kept. On the minus front, executives now admit that operating margin progress in the core European business (two-thirds of 2012 sales) will be slower as market overcapacity and aggressive pricing take their toll. A year ago, TNT was talking of a 10-11 per cent margin, medium-term. Now, having seen that figure fall from over 8 per cent in 2011 to 6.3 per cent last year, the revised 2015 target is 8 per cent.That, moreover, is after a comprehensive overhaul and 11 per cent staff cut, designed to take €220m a year out of operating costs by mid-decade. TNT shares, on a pricey 21 times 2013 consensus earnings, are obviously looking well beyond the current difficulties. Come 2015, matters may, indeed, be brighter. But, as the company admits, it is all down to the delivery.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
114;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;TNT Express unveils post-UPS strategy;;TNT Express said the sale of its Chinese business is expected “imminently” and reiterated its intent to sell its Brazilian arm in a strategy update two months after the collapse of a planned takeover by UPS.The Dutch express delivery group fleshed out plans announced with its results last month to divest its global operations and refocus on its core European market. Investors had been awaiting the company’s strategy as a standalone company after UPS’s takeover bid was blocked by European competition authorities.TNT Express said it expected to cut 4,000 jobs over the next three years and reduce annual costs by €220m by 2015. It said it was exploring options for further reducing its fleet of aircraft, which it expanded in an attempt to compete globally with FedEx, DHL and UPS.Bernard Bot, interim chief executive, declined to give any details of the prospective buyer of the company’s Chinese business but said “an announcement is expected imminently”. It was unclear how much the sale might fetch, as the Chinese arm recorded a net loss of €13m on €260m revenue in 2012.TNT Express’s Brazilian business is also unprofitable but Mr Bot said the first two months of 2013 showed a substantial reduction in losses.Mr Bot will return to his previous position as chief financial officer when Tex Gunning takes over as chief executive in June.In a statement, Mr Bot said TNT Express “faces difficult market conditions and strategic challenges” but cited the company’s “unrivalled European network”. TNT Express and DHL vie for the largest share of the European delivery market, with the leading company varying depending on how the market is measured. But TNT Express’s truck fleet and road hub network is larger than DHL’s, allowing it to offer express delivery by road, including delivery of heavier freight than is possible by air.“Our air network in Europe is [comparable to DHL’s] but then we have the combination with road, which nobody else can offer,” Mr Bot said.The company said it targeted an operating margin in Europe, the Middle East and Africa of 8 per cent by 2015, up from 6.3 per cent last year, assuming a return to 2 per cent gross domestic product growth in Europe.The 4,000 job cuts will involve attrition and a reduction in the numbers of outside consultants as well as terminations, Mr Bot said. The company expects to spend €150m on redundancy and other payments.In a note, Maarten Bakker of ABN Amro said the new strategy “likely fails to inspire investors” as it mainly reiterated earlier statements.Shares closed down 4.5 per cent at €5.64 in Amsterdam on Monday.
115;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;FedEx cuts forecasts and Asia capacity;;FedEx plans to cut trans-Pacific capacity and push traffic towards lower-cost transport modes after a “radically changed” international trading situation prompted the package delivery operator to cut its full-year forecasts.Fred Smith, chief executive, said the company had experienced “very challenging” conditions in the quarter to February 28, with net income down 31 per cent down on last year.He blamed continuing poor air freight markets, overcapacity in package delivery and customers’ continued shift towards lower-cost transport modes.Net income for the quarter was $361m, on revenue up 4 per cent to $11bn. Earnings per share fell 32 per cent to $1.13.The earnings per share forecast for the year to May 31 – which had stood at a range of $6.20 to $6.60 per share excluding the cost of a voluntary buyout programme for employees – fell to $6.00 to $6.20 on the same basis.Mr Smith said the company would decrease flights between North America and Asia starting on April 1. It would also “aggressively manage” traffic flows to place lower-yielding business in lower-cost networks. The company was assessing how those moves might allow FedEx to retire some older, less efficient aircraft.“Policy decisions and the cost of fuel have radically changed the international trading situation,” Mr Smith told investors on a conference call.Significant new capacity had also come into the international air freight market, Mr Smith added – capacity has grown both because of the introduction of new wide-body passenger aircraft and dedicated freighters.The company planned to cut back on capacity to focus on moving the highest-value international packages, Mr Smith said.“The bottom line is we got a little bit ahead of our skis and we had more capacity out there into the heavier, more cost-sensitive air freight market,” he said.Investors often view FedEx and UPS, its main rival in the express package delivery business, as barometers of the state of the US and wider world economy, because of their role in facilitating business-to-business transactions.FedEx has been warning since September that shippers have been increasingly opting for lower-cost options such as truck or ship movements of goods over higher-cost air services. It had previously expressed more concern about domestic US demand than the international position.The company in October announced a restructuring to cut some air services and strengthen its ground operations.Net income in FedEx’s previous quarter– to November 30 – was 12 per cent down on the same quarter the previous year, although the company attributed part of that drop to the impact of superstorm Sandy in the US northeast.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said international revenues had fallen $100m short of expectations. Aircraft groundings could result in future impairment charges, he warned.The shift towards lower-cost transport modes pushed operating income at the core FedEx Express segment down 66 per cent to $118m, on revenue up 2 per cent to $6.7bn. Operating income at FedEx Ground grew from $465m to $467m, on revenue up 11 per cent to $2.75bn. FedEx Freight reported a $4m operating profit, against a $1m loss, on revenue up from $1.23bn to $1.24bn.The company said it expected its voluntary buyout programme for employees, whose costs were excluded from its forecasts, to total between $450m and $550m in the year to May, depending on acceptance levels. That will reduce earnings per share by between $0.89 and $1.09.
116;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Sponsorship: Brands beat a path to F1’s door despite drop in TV viewers;Rush of close-season deals constitutes substantial investment;There have been mixed messages emanating from Formula One of late about the sport’s financial health.Some of the smaller teams have claimed F1 is undergoing something of a funding crisis, while others have pointed to falling numbers of television viewers in recent years – a trend that is likely to continue as F1 moves towards more of a pay-television model in several European markets, including the UK.Countering such pessimism is the entry of five leading brands to the sport since the cars last competed in November, which would constitute substantial investments for any sport.First to jump on board was Rolex, the Switzerland-based luxury watchmaker, which struck a global partnership deal with F1 brokered by long-time Rolex brand ambassador Sir Jackie Stewart together with Bernie Ecclestone, the sport’s commercial chief.Then came BlackBerry, the smartphone manufacturer, which signed a partnership deal with the Mercedes team.Ecclestone did it again by negotiating a lucrative five-year global partner deal worth an estimated $200m with Emirates, the airline.UPS, the logistics company, joined forces with the Ferrari team in a deal brokered by JMI, the sponsorship agency, and Williams unveiled a new FTSE 100 partner in Experian, the credit-scoring specialist.What are these companies hoping to gain from pouring money into F1, and why are they doing it now?Rolex has been involved in sport sponsorship for decades, notably of the Wimbledon tennis tournament and the Open golf championship, but it had never sponsored F1. This changed in December when it signed a $30m-a-year deal to be the sport’s official timekeeper and timepiece.Gian Riccardo Marini, Rolex chief executive, highlights a shared interest in technology and reliability, and emphasises the “strong symbolic value [of F1] and its global reach” as the key reason for signing a five-year deal.In return for its investment, Rolex will get prominent positioning for timekeeping and branding around the circuits, as well as a chance to entertain clients in the VIP areas.Dubai-based Emirates has a host of sponsorship deals in football, rugby and tennis, notably the stadium-naming rights of Arsenal football club. It was last involved in F1 in 2006 when it sponsored the McLaren team, but the deal lasted only a year.The return of the airline, led by chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, adds to the significant Gulf money already invested in F1, notably that spent building Grand Prix circuits in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain. The Bahrain sovereign wealth fund also has a stake in McLaren, while Ferrari has a theme park in Abu Dhabi.Ever since CVC Capital Partners acquired Ecclestone’s Formula One Management business in 2006 it has pushed hard to increase the number of global partners – an area the private equity owner felt had been underexploited. FOM owns the commercial rights to F1 for 100 years, from 2011.The arrival of Rolex and Emirates alongside the likes of UBS, the bank, LG Electronics, GH Mumm champagne and Tata Communications, the Indian group that provides information technology services to the sport, shows this objective is being steadily fulfilled.Reach is key to F1’s success. Yet for a business built on mass-market TV, audience figures are not as high as they once were, and deals with European pay-TV broadcasters are also likely to result in further falls in viewer numbers.That said, the sport still pulls in a race audience of more than 45m on a Sunday, and there are still few better ways for a global brand to reach a wealthier audience via televised sport.For BlackBerry, the move into F1 is part of its fightback against rival smartphone makers after a disastrous few years.The company failed to respond to a shift in the market that began with the launch of Apple’s iPhone in 2007. BlackBerry’s share of the smartphone market has fallen from a peak of roughly 20 per cent in 2009 to about 6 per cent today.The timing of the move was tied to the launch of the BlackBerry 10 operating system and handsets. According to Frank Boulben, the company’s chief marketing officer, the $12m annual deal with Mercedes hinged on F1’s reach in emerging markets such as India and Brazil.“That was the first consideration. We are a completely global brand,” Boulben says.He also points to F1’s strengthening presence in North America, where a second Grand Prix is expected to be added next year. “Now, it is an ideal global platform. For the audience we want to touch, [F1] is a unique platform in the world of sports,” Boulben says.The return to the US was also crucial for UPS, which has entered the sport for the first time in a partnership with Ferrari, F1’s most prestigious team.Christine Owens, UPS senior vice-president for communications and brand management, says the F1 deal is different to sponsorship of the Olympic Games.“[F1] is global and the racing season lasts for 10 months. That helps you to stay more ‘top of the mind’, whereas the Olympics is every four years,” Owens says.Despite the influx of deals, sponsorship accounts for only 15 per cent of F1’s $1.5bn annual turnover. The real money is still in race-sanctioning fees, which account for 34 per cent, with broadcasting rights totalling 32 per cent.
117;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-03-05T16:04:53Z;Deutsche Post: delivering the goods;German logistics group is a company of two halves;"When a company’s shares double in 18 months, the inevitable question arises: can they keep up the pace? The market had doubts about Germany’s Deutsche Post earlier this year, when its stock price stalled. But solid 2012 results and reassuring guidance for the current year, in spite of the difficult economic environment, seemed to put matters back on track on Tuesday; the shares rose 5 per cent.In truth, this is a group of two halves. The German postal business is a mixed bag, with letter mail in structural decline, but parcels volumes picking up as online shopping expands. These trends roughly balance each other. As a result, both revenue and underlying earnings before interest and tax on the postal side were flat last year, at €14bn and €1bn-plus respectively. Expect little change ahead.The more exciting part of Deutsche Post, however, remains its DHL unit, which encompasses express delivery, freight forwarding and logistics. Here, revenues rose 7 per cent in 2012, while ebit advanced by one-fifth to over €2bn. DHL Express remains the star, now taking a third of its revenues from Asia, compared with a quarter in 2009, although there were margin improvements in the forwarding and supply chain units too. The collapse of the TNT-UPS merger, which could have created a powerful competitor, will not hurt.So with Deutsche Post’s 2015 ebit goal of €3.4bn-€3.6bn increasingly credible, the shares do not look expensive in spite of their gains. The enterprise value to 2013 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio is well below 6 times, compared with almost 9 times at UPS. For income-minded investors, there is also a 4 per cent dividend yield – and, while one-off items pushed net debt to €2bn last year, underlying free cash flow covers this. There is every reason to think the stock will continue to travel.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
118;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;TNT Express appoints new chief;;TNT Express has appointed a new chief executive as the Dutch delivery company seeks to chart a new course after its failed takeover by UPS.Tex Gunning, 62, takes the helm at Europe’s second-largest express delivery company by revenues as it struggles to find a new raison d’être, having abandoned its former ambitions to compete on a global scale with rivals UPS, DHL and Federal Express.Last week, when annual results showed a net loss for 2012 of €81m on revenues of €7.3bn, TNT Express said it would seek to sell its international arms in China and Brazil and refocus on its core European markets. The move out of China, where TNT Express was a minor player, had been expected.But some analysts were wrongfooted by the decision to withdraw from Brazil, a growing economy where TNT Express had acquired a 20 per cent market share by buying two local companies, in 2007 and 2009, but struggled for years to make them profitable.The moves underlined a sombre strategy announced last week by interim chief executive Bernard Bot, who said the company would seek further efficiencies on top of the €100m per year in cost cuts detailed previously.Mr Gunning, who arrives after three years as head of the decorative paints division at Dutch coatings and chemicals company Akzo Nobel, was seen by some as a caretaker appointment.Andre Mulder of Kempen Securities wrote in a note: “The strategic changes proposed last week would be better made by a new CEO with industry experience.”But Mr Mulder and others said Mr Gunning was in many ways suited to the job of transforming TNT Express. He was in charge of the successful integration of ICI, which Akzo acquired in 2008, and guided Akzo’s US decorative paints business through a turnround before selling it to PPG in December.He also served as chief executive of Dutch recruiter Vedior, guiding it to its takeover by Randstad in 2008.“He’s a very inspirational guy with a great vision for brands,” said a person with long working experience with Mr Gunning. “So if a company like TNT is lacking self-confidence and needs someone to make people feel proud again, it’s a good decision.”“But don’t ask him to fix the output of a factory. He needs a couple of good operational people around him – that’s not his biggest strength,” the person added.Antony Burgmans, chairman of TNT Express’s board of supervisors – of which Mr Gunning is already a member – said the new chief executive’s “extensive business experience and track record in successfully turning round businesses” made him the “ideal candidate” for the job.Mr Burgmans and Mr Gunning both began their careers at Unilever, where Mr Burgmans eventually became co-chief executive.Mr Bot will return to his previous job as chief financial officer. He stepped in to head TNT Express in October after the abrupt departure of Marie-Christine Lombard, who left without warning to take a job at French logistics company Geodis while the takeover offer from UPS was still pending. European regulators last month blocked the deal.TNT Express is suing Ms Lombard, claiming she violated the non-competition clause of her contract.The contretemps is symbolic of the chaos that has reigned at TNT Express since UPS announced its takeover offer last year.The Dutch group split from its domestic-mail sister company PostNL in 2011 with an eye towards such a takeover, which activist shareholders believed would unlock value.Management at first resisted UPS’s offer, but ultimately accepted. Much of the company’s attention over the past year has been focused on measures that would have been needed to fuse the two companies.
119;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-02-18T18:51:12Z;TNT results dragged down by €75m writedown;;TNT Express, the Dutch delivery company, whose $7bn takeover by United Parcel Service collapsed last month, said a €75m writedown on a Chinese business it is hoping to sell dragged on its financial performance last year.The company’s full-year losses narrowed to €81m from €272m a year earlier, helped by fewer impairments and revenues that inched up to €7.3bn compared with €7.2bn a year earlier.“The rate of profit deterioration vis a vis the revenues lessened, suggesting either that the cost saving programme is working or the quality of the additional business is higher,” said Damian Brewer, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.But Europe’s second-biggest delivery company by sales still recorded nearly €300m in impairments, mostly on businesses it is seeking to exit. On top of the Chinese write-off – made as TNT Express puts the division on the block – was a €19m impairment on its Indian domestic division.The company warned that trading conditions were set to remain challenging this year, with “related continued negative development of operating results” in Europe and the Middle East, where operating profits fell by nearly a fifth last year. It said it would outline a “comprehensive profit improvement plan” at the end of March.TNT Express was spun out of TNT in 2011 with an eye to a takeover by one of the big US groups, but UPS withdrew its €5.2bn offer last month after it learnt European regulators were planning to block the deal on competition grounds.“Investors still wait in anticipation of a fully fleshed out strategy,” said Mr Brewer on Monday.
120;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;TNT Express: delivery failure;Dutch express delivery group acutely in need of a go-it-alone strategy;"Do jilted brides go on to have happy independent lives? Sometimes – but rarely without a bit of suffering. TNT Express is a case in point. Marriage to UPS has been frustrated; its shares have dived 40 per cent below UPS’s cash terms and its chief executive has departed. There is a small plus in the €200m break fee paid over by UPS last week, which adds to TNT’s end-2012 net cash of €140m. But that pales alongside the acute need for a go-it-alone strategy.Which, of course, is what TNT had just unveiled a year ago, when UPS’s offer arrived. Now the current acting management appears to be reverting to that plan – focus on Europe and exit domestic operations in the likes of Brazil and China. More details are expected next month. But the intervening 12 months have not improved the operating backdrop, and time has been lost in terms of cost-cutting plans. As Monday’s 2012 results showed, TNT faces pricing pressures in Europe (which accounts for two-thirds of group sales): underlying operating margins there fell from 8.4 per cent in 2011 to just above 6 per cent last year. Elsewhere, TNT is making little money overall.In short, the company’s board needs to act fast. First job, provide management certainty, if only by confirming acting executives in their positions. Next, decide on how broad and speedy divestments should be. China is well under way, but Brazil’s losses are declining and there is also a profitable Australasian business to be considered. Costs in Europe still need attacking. Strong partnership arrangements would help elsewhere. TNT had previously targeted a 10 per cent-plus operating margin, but in current market conditions, that could be stretch. The shares now trade on an enterprise value to 2013 earnings multiple of under 6 times – compared with 9 at UPS and 6 at FedEx. Given the task ahead – and barring a new suitor – that seems high enough.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
121;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T05:58:35+0000;Brussels to bar Ryanair’s Aer Lingus bid;;"Ryanair has lashed out at Brussels’ “political” move to block its takeover of Aer Lingus, as the EU once again stymied chief executive Michael O’Leary’s eight-year quest to buy the Irish flag carrier.The European Commission on Tuesday told Ryanair, Europe’s largest low-cost carrier by revenue, that it intends to veto a tie-up on the grounds that it would likely raise prices for consumers.The final decision, which is issued next month, is largely a formality and will make history as the first time Brussels has vetoed a proposed merger twice.Competition investigators found that the merger would leave the combined company dominating around 85 per cent of seats on short-haul flights in and out of Ireland - a share that fell to just under 70 per cent under Ryanair’s proposed competition remedies.Ryanair insisted it had metantitrustt concerns raised by the commission, and has “instructed its lawyers to appeal any prohibition decision to the European courts”.Mr O’Leary failed in overturning the commission’s 2007 decision to block his takeover bid for Aer Lingus; a second offer was withdrawn in 2009 after the Irish government opposed it.With Dublin also opposing the latest bid, Robin Kiely, a Ryanair spokesman, said: “This decision [by Brussels] is clearly a political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law.”The commission declined to comment.Mr O’Leary put forward a “revolutionary” package of competition remedies – involving the de facto break-up of Aer Lingus– in an attempt to assuage Brussels’ deep-setantitrustt objections.While the concessions went well beyond anything offered in the past to win EU clearance for an airline merger, the commission still concluded the tie-up raised serious competition problems.One central concern with Ryanair’s remedies is the viability of its offer to hand Flybe, thelossmakingg UK regional airline, the right to operate about 40 per cent of Aer Lingus’s short-haul routes out of Ireland.Even though Ryanair proposed giving Flybe’s Irish business at least nine aircraft and €100m in cash, rivals questioned whether it would have the financial clout or assets to compete effectively with the low-cost carrier in its home market.The Irish government was concerned about a second Ryanair remedy proposal that might have led to most of Aer Lingus’ valuable take-off and landing slots at London’s Heathrow airport being handed to British Airways.Aer Lingus’ shares closed down 4.3 per cent at €1.28. Flybe shares were down 11.8 per cent at 50.25p. Ryanair shares were up 0.8 per cent at €5.71.Mr O’Leary’s floundering pursuit of Aer Lingus is the one notable blemish on his record at Ryanair - although the attempted merger is consistent with his relentless search for profits.Neil Glynn, analyst at Credit Suisse, estimated that merging Ryanair and Aer Lingus could generate synergies that would boost the combined company’s net income by €50m per year - representing almost 10 per cent of the low-cost carrier’s estimated profit after tax in the year to March 2013.Mr O’Leary thought he had a better chance of securing the commission’s clearance after Brussels last year approved British Airways’ merger with BMI British Midland - which combined the two largest airlines at Heathrow.But BMI was running up losses, and facing possible closure, whereas Aer Lingus is a profitable airline that rejected Ryanair’s bid.Moreover, Aer Lingus accused Ryanair of launching the bid to halt a UK regulatory investigation into its near 30 per cent stake in the Irish flag carrier.The bid was made just days after the Competition Commission was handed the task of probing whether Ryanair’s stake served to weaken Aer Lingus as a competitor.The regulator has powers to potentially force Ryanair to sell its stake - although the company’s willingness to litigate means it could take several years to reach this point.Aer Lingus has already been a painful financial experience for Ryanair. It spent €407m to become Aer Lingus’ largest shareholder, but has written down the value of that stake to €80m.Still, Ryanair is one of the most profitable airlines in the world - and pays dividends, unlike many of its rivals.“The pursuit of Aer Lingus is Mr O’Leary’s Achilles heel, his weakness, his blind spot, but shareholders are happy to indulge him because it has not broadly distracted from the main effort of creating value for shareholders,” said Edward Stanford, analyst at Oriel Securities."
122;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-02-10T00:12:02Z;Cold comfort for Valentine’s gift retailers;Snow disrupts peak shopping period for stores;Shopping came to a snowbound halt in parts of the US northeast on the weekend as a fierce blizzard disrupted the peak shopping period of the week for retailers and the biggest buying opportunity for Valentine’s gifts.Stores and malls across Massachusetts and Connecticut stayed shut on Saturday as the states imposed travel bans, while in parts of Long Island many residents chose to avoid slippery roads even where shops were open.Walmart – whose Valentine’s day gift selection includes stuffed animals, chocolates and lingerie – had as many as 132 stores closed due to the travel bans on Saturday. By 5pm eastern time, 58 stores remained shut.Retailers on Long Island were “having some trouble” said Ted Potrikus, executive vice-president of the Retail Council of New York State, a trade group.“Their numbers today are certainly going to be slower and lower simply because people don’t want to go out unless they absolutely have to. It’s good for the officials who need to clear the roads, but awful for retailers.”He said the loss of Valentine’s day shoppers was a particular concern for small gift stores, which had reason to worry that customers would opt to buy online instead.“If people can’t get out, where do they go now? They go to the computer. If I’m an enterprising guy who doesn’t feel like going out in snow, I’m going to gamble that the weather will clear enough for the UPS guy to make it to my sweetheart in time.”Roosevelt Field, a giant Long Island mall, opened later than usual at midday on Saturday, while an employee who answered the telephone at Macy’s said she did not see a lot of shoppers. But a staff member at Gap said: “It’s kind of busy considering what happened yesterday.”In Massachusetts, including the state capital of Boston, retail activity had been “very limited” until 4pm on Saturday, when the travel ban was lifted, said Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts.“Certainly gas stations were allowed to be open, and pharmacies and convenience stores, primarily to service some of the emergency personnel and snow plough people,” he said. “But by and large everyone abided by the governor’s directive.”Store employees who needed to get to work to reopen after 4pm on Saturday had been exempted from the ban, he said. Although roads had been cleared, however, many consumers would remain stranded because of the continued closure of public transport systems.Many hardware stores were exempt from the travel ban also, but Home Depot said a “few dozen” of its stores were closed on Saturday morning because “[the snow] was just so deep they couldn’t open”. By late afternoon only one was still shut.As shopper numbers began to rise in the afternoon and evening, the company said it was seeing strong demand for power generators, batteries and shovels.In Danbury, Connecticut, the Danbury Fair mall remained closed throughout Saturday, but an employee said it would reopen on Sunday: “Absolutely . . . The roads are clear. I don’t think there’s any problem.”Even though Connecticut’s travel ban was lifted at 4pm on Saturday, Joe Wrinn, a real estate agent with Goodfellow Ashmore, remained stranded in the small town of Oxford, where roads were closed until midday Sunday.“I’m not consuming anything today other than what I have,” he said. But he had not joined the panic buyers who had stocked up on emergency provisions on Friday.“They almost think it’s Armageddon. Maybe they want to feel that way. It’s fun to hunker down . . . But I suspect by Monday we’ll be back to normal.”
123;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:08:50+0000;Creating a global operation;Separate strategies for different areas of business;"The story. Co-founded in 1982 by Fadi Ghandour, Jordan-based Aramex started out by delivering packages across the Middle East on behalf of global express delivery and logistics companies. Aramex thrived by aggregating the bigger companies’ small volumes of business in the region and by providing a superior service thanks to its detailed local knowledge.It also developed two other lines. First, it sent express packages out of the region to be delivered by partners, many of which were in an alliance formed by Aramex and Airborne Express. Second, it offered freight forwarding and domestic distribution services to Middle Eastern clients as well as logistics and customs clearance.Between 2000 and 2005, Aramex had annual revenue growth of more than 16 per cent and net income growth of 29 per cent.First challenge and strategic responseIn 2003, Airborne was acquired by DHL. This meant dissolving the alliance and ending the tracking and tracing system used by alliance partners to co-ordinate the network. How could a medium-sized regional business compete globally without a strong overseas network?Mr Ghandour organised 40 or so of Aramex’s peers worldwide into the Global Distribution Alliance, which could collectively compete with big operators. Aramex developed tracking and billing systems that allowed members to act as a global network. The alliance model minimised the need for big capital investments in several countries.By mid-2005 GDA was operating smoothly, outbound traffic was strong and its logistics and transport business in the Middle East was booming.Second challenge and strategyIn 2005, Lynx Express, GDA’s UK member, was acquired by global operator UPS. GDA members would be unable to send or receive packages to or from the UK on the favourable terms they were used to. This showed Mr Ghandour the fragility of
a pure alliance strategy. Investment might be low and returns high, but if a member drops out, the entire network is weakened.Recognising that its core competence was providing a superior service in emerging markets, Aramex set out to become the first-choice logistics company in the Middle East and north Africa by investing in infrastructure and people. It also moved to replicate its strategy in other emerging economies in Africa and southeast Asia.In more competitive or more regulated emerging markets, such as China, Aramex moved cautiously. It invested in a “gateway” operation – staffed by Aramex managers – that ran a partnership with a Chinese logistics and transportation leader. This provided local presence and knowledge but minimised capital investments.As for the global network, Aramex realised it could not compete directly with the big operators in the developed world. But it had to expand its role as GDA co-ordinator to take on responsibility for plugging any holes in the network that might occur as a result of financial distress or acquisition. In the US and Europe, Aramex avoided making big direct investments. Instead, it set up gateway operations at major hub airports, where its staff managed local partners and were responsible for back-up plans if a partnership failed.The resultsRevenues rose from $125m in 2005 to nearly $845m in 2012, with profits rising to an expected $66m in 2012.Key lessonsAramex really grew once it realised it had two areas of business, each needing a different strategy. The first was delivery, sourcing, logistics and value-added services in emerging markets: wherever Aramex was a first mover, few rivals could hope to catch up.The second was managing a global alliance that enabled it to operate internationally thanks to its agility and its ability to manage partners and fill in when gaps in the network occurred. This “asset-light” strategy kept it out of an investment race with bigger rivals, but if a problem did occur, its local contacts meant it could act quickly.The writer is executive director of the William Davidson Institute and a professor of business administration at the Ross School of Business, University of MichiganA full version of this case can be accessed via GlobaLens.com, the publishing division of the William Davidson Institute"
124;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Slower holiday season dents UPS growth;;A slow US holiday season and the effects of October’s superstorm Sandy produced lower-than-expected net income growth at UPS, the express package delivery service, despite growth in online retailing.Full-year adjusted net income rose 1.8 per cent to $4.39bn, on revenue up 1.9 per cent to $54.1bn, while adjusted net income for the September to December quarter rose 1.8 per cent to $1.28bn, on revenue up 2.9 per cent to $14.6bn.The company also projected a further 6 to 12 per cent growth in adjusted earnings per share from 2012’s $4.53 to a range of $4.80 to $5.06, as it presses ahead following its abandonment this month of its bid for the Netherlands’ TNT Express. Fourth-quarter adjusted EPS was $1.32, against consensus estimates of $1.38.Kurt Kuehn, finance director, said the main element in the shortfall against expectations had been the impact of superstorm Sandy, which the company said reduced adjusted EPS by 5 cents.“It was a fairly substantial impact on our results,” Mr Kuehn said of the storm. “In addition, we did have some challenges in our global freight forwarding group.”Freight rates – the price shippers can charge per unit – had fallen in some markets, reducing margins, Mr Kuehn said.Mr Kuehn nevertheless pointed to UPS’s full-year adjusted operating profits – which rose 6.4 per cent to $4.53bn, on revenues up 3.6 per cent to $32.9bn – as a bright spot. Volumes for the “Next Day Air” service, which benefits most from growth in online retailing, were up 7.7 per cent on the same quarter of 2011, at 1.4bn parcels.“That’s really enabled business to consumer customers to facilitate superior service,” Mr Kuehn said of the Next Day Air service.The adjusted figures all excluded the substantial effect of a net $3.58bn in non-cash charge for marking pension assets to their market value and other pension accounting issues. The charges were $507m in 2011. On an unadjusted basis, net income for the year fell 79 per cent to $807m.Mr Kuehn expressed disappointment over the European Commission’s blocking of its planned €5.2bn takeover of the Netherlands’ TNT Express, which UPS abandoned on January 14. But he said the company would now restart some initiatives that had been on hold during the TNT bid and pursue organic growth and smaller acquisitions.“We’re now working on some small and medium-sized opportunities,” Mr Kuehn said.For the current year, Scott Davis, chief executive, said he had spoken to several customers and it was clear the US fiscal uncertainty continued to erode business confidence and growth prospects.But he said there had been a “surprisingly strong” start to January in the US and that conditions in Europe were more stable.“UPS is confident in our ability to achieve our long-term targets,” he said.The shares fell 2.1 per cent to $79.56.
125;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-01-30T22:04:09Z;Brussels blocks UPS takeover of TNT;;Brussels formally blocked UPS’s aborted takeover of TNT Express on Wednesday, while expressing “surprise” that the US delivery group abandoned efforts to win approval before its negotiating time was up.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition commissioner, s aid the €5.2bn proposed tie-up with the Dutch delivery group would have “drastically reduced choice” and probably raised prices in express delivery services in 15 European countries, even after taking account of efficiency gains.UPS offered to sell TNT assets covering 17 member states to France’s DPD, but could not convince the commission either that the measures were sufficient to address the competition concerns or that they were achievable before the regulatory deadline.Mr Almunia said he told UPS at a relatively early stage that he would likely require an “upfront buyer” for the package of TNT assets – meaning he would only give EU merger clearance once a binding agreement was reached with DPD.UPS found this condition to be unacceptable and two weeks ago announced that it saw no realistic prospect of the deal being cleared, triggering sharp falls in TNT shares.Mr Almnuia said he was “a little bit surprised” by the decision to effectively pull out given “we still had time to continue negotiations”. He said UPS “clearly was not ready or was not in favour or was not prepared to explore” agreeing a deal with a buyer until it was “much too late for it to materialise”.UPS said that it “proposed significant and tangible remedies designed to address the [European Commission’s] concerns”, adding that the deal would have “been transformative for the logistics industry”.The Commission identified FedEx as the lone so-called “global integrator” – combining air and land transport – that could have purchased the TNT assets without causing competition problems.But Mr Almunia said FedEx, the arch-rival of UPS, showed “no interest” in buying the assets. The collapse of the UPS deal though has renewed speculation over a FedEx attempt to buy TNT.It concluded that France’s DPD, an interested buyer that did not own an airline, would lack the incentive, capacity or the will to maintain an expand express operations across Europe. Other perceived shortcomings included concerns about its long-term access to air transport.
126;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-01-22T10:23:45Z;Russian Post to Kremlin: send investment;;"By Ben Aris of bneThanks to non-stop rising incomes, Russians are becoming increasingly more generous. Which means more presents – and more mail. And the Russian postal service has warned that, without investment, it may not be able to cope next year.Russian Post was expecting twice the volume over the holiday period from a year earlier – and had to cope with 3m registered letters and delivered several million more unregistered letters. Alexander Kiselev, chief executive, says: “This year’s New Year’s Eve may be the last without failure and collapse.”As Russia follows the Julian calendar, the birth of Christ is celebrated on January 7, so December 25 is a normal workday. All the present-giving happens on New Year’s Eve instead.Kiselev (pictured left) warns that if the volumes continue to rise Russian Post will not be able to cope next year. Russian Post is one of the few Soviet-era institutions that continue to be essential to life in a sprawling country that spans nine time zones. The company has 42,000 branch offices (about twice as many as retailing bank behemoth Sberbank) covering the entire Russian Federation.In August 2011 Russian Post submitted its proposals for modernisation to the ministry of telecommunications, which is drawing up a 2012-2016 plan with the assistance of consulting firm Boston Consulting Group.There is already a draft bill in front of the Duma to remove the ban on the sales of shares in the company, as well as creating two types of postal companies: a universal mail provider and courier services companies similar to America’s UPS and Germany’s DHL.Kiselev estimates the total investment needed to modernise the power office is Rbs220bn ($7.3bn) and proposed in August the government contribute Rbs75.4bn ($2.5bn) in the first phase with another Rbs37.6bn from the company’s own resources.The government has already agreed in principle to match the company’s investment rouble-for-rouble, but Kiselev points out that a 2011 government-approved 10-year plan to develop the information society has no post office allocation. In times of austerity, it looks like the post office will have to survive on its own resources.“The most expensive part of the plan is the construction of a network of automated sorting centres. Today there are only two in the country and one more under construction with another two in the works. We need at least 36,” says Kiselev.Russia had a 150 such sorting centres in Soviet times, but all disappeared after 1991 and until 2009 all mail in Russia was sorted by hand. Two automated sorting centres in Moscow and St Petersburg have since been set up that handle about a third of all Russia’s mail, but Kiselev says that the plan is to eventually increase the automated capacity to about 90 to 95 per cent.Investment is needed across the board. The US postal service operates over 260,000 postal vans; Russian Post has 18,000. “The distances we have to cover a three times longer than those in America and we need to completely replace our fleet, buying at least another 30,000 vehicles,” says Kiselev.Russian Post has also been upgrading up to 800 branches each year, but with a workforce numbering millions resources are stretched thin.Still, Russian Post is profitable, with postal services accounting for 45 per cent of the revenues and financial services another 38 per cent, with the sales of goods and services making up the rest.It has also started to tap the domestic debt market for investment capital. At the end of last year Fitch awarded Russian Post a BBB rating, an “investment grade” rating, which makes it one of the top four best-rated companies in Russia – on a par with gas behemoth Gazprom, Russian Railways and state-owned oil major Rosneft.Fitch expects the company to increase its debt by up to Rbs24.5bn by 2014, which still leaves it with, “a conservative net debt/ Ebidta below two-times in 2012-2014,” says Fitch. The bulk of the company’s debt is long-term with no refinancing risks until 2014 when the original bondholders have a put option on the Rbs7bn debut bonds issued in May 2011.“Most of the modernisation was designed to happen in 2012-2016,” says Kiselev. “However, we are already running behind schedule. But we hope that by 2016-2017 the key changes will have been implemented and a fundamental transformation of postal service will probably be completed by the year 2020.”Related reading:

The banks started US earnings season in earnest. The big boys of Wall Street – JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs – recorded very big fourth-quarter profits while Citigroup’s new chief executive got the bad news out of the way in the hope of reporting better numbers later this year.

128;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-01-14T21:36:05Z;US equities mixed ahead of earnings;;Apple shares were hit on Monday after reports that the company has cut orders for parts for the Phone 5 because of weaker demand than anticipated.The heaviest weighted stock on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6 per cent to $501.75 and is at its lowest level in 11 months, having lost nearly a third of its market value since peaking last September.The iPhone maker is set to report its results next week.“The latest report about Apple’s order cuts may be linked to its distribution strategy. The iPhone 5 seemed to take a very long time to come to market and it is likely that consumers, especially the younger generation, found the Samsung Galaxy as a fashionable alternative,” said Darren Hayes, chairman of the computer information systems department at Pace University in New York.“In the long-term, its strategy to limit US carriers as well as its hefty price may be damaging to the group, especially with other smartphones able to compete so well.”The rest of the US equity markets edged lower as investors focused their attention on fourth-quarter corporate earnings set for release this week, as well as a batch of economic data.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished 0.1 per cent lower at 1,470.68, a few points away from fresh five-year highs reached on Friday following rallies in the first two weeks of the new year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in and out of negative territory but finished 0.1 per cent higher at 13,507.32, while the technology heavy Nasdaq Composite index shed 0.3 per cent to 3,117.50 dragged by Apple losses.“Investors are waiting ahead of a number of results this week, which will ascertain the strength of global economic recovery as well as US demand,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.“We already know the third quarter was difficult, so all attention will be on guidance from companies such as Capital One, US Bankcorp, and bellwethers GE and Lennar.”This week, a number of major banks are set to report their results and are expected to show double-digit earnings growth, according to consensus analysts’ forecasts.Wells Fargo, which was the first of the major banks to announce results last week, set the tone for the rest of the industry reporting a 24 per cent increase in net income, driven by its retail banking business. However, investors were disappointed by the sharper fall in the net interest margin, as rates remained ultra low.

129;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;UPS’s Europe strategy upended by EU;;"When UPS bid to take over TNT Express last February, following years of on-off courtship, it represented a bold bet to bolster the US delivery group’s position in Europe and outflank its arch-rival FedEx. UPS expected regulators to pose no hurdle to the €5.2bn ($6.9bn) deal.Brussels, in the event, proved the deal-breaker. Far from giving its early blessing, the European Commission raised deep-set antitrust concerns over the express delivery market, concerns UPS was struggling to overcome. On Monday morning, the world’s biggest delivery group gave up trying.The announcement – which puts paid to hopes of the deal going through even before Brussels formally vetoed the takeover – stunned not just the gaggle of hedge funds betting on every twist and turn of this deal. Even the commission was surprised to see UPS in effect pull out. TNT shares almost halved in value.But the warning signs were flashing for some time, arguably as far back as when the takeover was being plotted. A few weeks before UPS launched its first TNT bid, Brussels flexed its muscles and halted the Deutsche Börse-NYSE exchanges tie-up in its tracks. It was perhaps an inauspicious moment for another US corporate champion to gamble at winning over Europe’s top competition authority.The collapse of the deal has clear implications for the world’s four big delivery companies – the so-called integrators – not least in upending UPS’s strategy in Europe, forcing TNT into another commercial struggle to survive and leaving FedEx with new incentives to expand.But it may have wider resonance, giving another regulatory check to the ambitions of US dealmakers in Europe. Given that the takeover was hatched during the eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis – as investor confidence in Europe plumbed new lows – there was naturally some bafflement from the UPS-TNT side.As one participant put it as the deal began to hit trouble: “It is hard to understand why they wouldn’t want our money.”Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, was blunt about his concerns: that the elimination of TNT would leave just two or three so-called integrators – combining land and air transport – in many European national markets, which risked hurting consumers through higher prices and less choice.UPS attempted to address this by offering France’s DPD a host of assets and space on its aircraft to allow it to fill the commercial gap. But shortcomings in DPD’s capabilities – most notably in having to rely on buying space on the UPS airline – were a serious worry for Brussels. Mr Almunia memorably said global delivery companies could not rely on “horses”.The final straw came on Friday when UPS was told there was unlikely to be an extension for it to find agreement with DPD, an agreement that would be a condition of closing the TNT merger.UPS was warned months ago that finding a solution to the competition issues would be difficult, according to people involved in the talks. At first the strategy was to broaden the commission’s relatively narrow view of the express delivery market; then it moved to selling assets to create a new competitor in DPD.“There wasn’t really anything else that they could easily offer,” said one person close to the talks. Others question whether UPS adapted early enough to the reality in Brussels; its concessions were submitted at the last possible point in the process, squeezing the amount of time it had to find a buyer.Failing to win approval to purchase the prized assets of TNT means UPS has been robbed of an opportunity to expand rapidly in the world’s second-biggest delivery market. David Vernon of Bernstein Research said that while the acquisition was a “unique opportunity”, it will represent only a “modest negative” for UPS.While UPS will be forced to trim its ambitions and lose its aggressive growth options in Europe, shareholders may see the upside. Some had worried about the integration risks of melding together the UPS and TNT networks. The decision also frees up cash. “That would now be available for shareholders, one would think,” said Mr Vernon.As ever, there will be concern in UPS’s Atlanta headquarters over its nemesis FedEx benefiting from the decision and swooping in to seize TNT assets for a song. Indeed, FedEx’s strong objections over the harm to competition from the UPS-TNT deal was a factor in UPS’s Brussels woes.But while FedEx has long eyed TNT, there are some indications that it may not be interested; FedEx never offered a counterbid for TNT, its financial position is not as strong as UPS’s and it turned down opportunities to pick up TNT assets during the merger clearance process.As well as FedEx, some speculate that DPD could also return as a potential buyer. But TNT is not holding its breath. “FedEx has not expressed an interest” in an acquisition, said Bernard Bot, TNT Express’s acting chief executive. “We are focusing on executing our standalone strategy.”Hedge fund managers who backed a clearance will also be licking their wounds. Many piled into the Dutch logistics company over the past year, underestimating the level of resistance in Brussels. One described the result as a “disaster”.Another person close to the deal said that with no other big deals to arbitrage besides Glencore-Xstrata in Europe, the hedge funds “went nuts for” TNT-UPS, hiring many law firms and even one that went as far as “posting a lot of packages to achieve …I don't know what.”Additional reporting by Chris Bryant in Frankfurt"
130;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;TNT falls after UPS deal fails to deliver;;A foiled €5.2bn deal between TNT Express and UPS sent the Dutch group’s shares into freefall on Monday.News that the planned takeover of TNT Express had collapsed after the European Commission indicated it would block the deal sent the Dutch group’s shares tumbling 41.3 per cent to €4.84.The move helped to drag Amsterdam’s AEX blue-chip index down 2.8 per cent to 347.34.More widely markets were subdued with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 down 0.3 per cent at 1,159.76.Comments from Fiat and Chrysler chief executive Sergio Marchionne that the two companies will eventually be merged even if Chrysler does an initial public offering prompted a rally in Fiat shares. Last week a minority shareholder in the US’s third-largest carmaker demanded the company register a 16.6 per cent stake for public listing.The shares gained 6.3 per cent to €4.38 against a 0.6 per cent fall on the FTSE MIB to 17,391.24A decision by Swatch to buy the luxury jewellery arm of Harry Winston for $1bn was met with a vote of confidence from investors. The Swiss group will pay $750m in cash and take on $250m in debt. The group’s SMI-listed shares rose 4.5 per cent to SFr88.80 on the news.Analysts at Citi called the acquisition “a real foray into high-end jewellery for Swatch Group”, adding that the group previously owned low-end jewellery brands Swatch Bijoux and Calvin Klein.The benchmark SMI index was up 0.2 per cent at 7,202.52.In Paris, utility EDF announced the French government had agreed to repay it for a €4.9bn shortfall in renewable subsidies.

131;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-01-14T15:14:38Z;TNT Express begins rebuilding broken image;Express delivery group’s future unclear after talks collapse;TNT Express was created as takeover bait in 2011, when activist shareholders forced the former TNT to split its regular and express delivery arms in the belief that the express business would be attractive to larger rivals UPS and Federal Express.Now, with the European commission set to block UPS’s takeover offer, TNT Express’s original raison d’être appears to have collapsed, and its future prospects are unclear.Management’s attention has been focused on the merger since last March. The company’s latest strategic plan, unveiled just before the approach from UPS, is widely viewed as a flimsy placeholder.“We are going to take the time to work on updating our strategy and come back in due course,” said Bernard Bot, TNT Express’s acting chief executive.The failed merger means UPS must pay TNT Express a €200m break fee but leaves the company uncertain of its direction. However, many analysts say TNT Express’s chaotic image belies a fundamentally sound business.While the company fell short of its ambition to become a global rival to the “big three” of UPS, FedEx and DHL, it has a strong and profitable presence throughout Europe, where it is the second-largest delivery company by sales after DHL.“They have a strong position in Europe, there’s nothing wrong with that in itself,” said Philip Scholte of Rabobank. “Just the fact that the EU is blocking the merger shows that TNT Express has something that’s difficult to copy.”TNT Express’s Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) operations brought in nearly two-thirds of the company’s total €7.2bn revenues for 2011, with the company holding 17 per cent of the internal European express market.But the company’s major emerging-market operations in China and Brazil are in a different situation. TNT Express has already indicated it would like to trim its global ambitions to focus on Europe.“In China they are just a drop in the ocean, they lack the size and position to defend themselves,” said Maarten Bakker of ABN Amro. “It’s better for them to say goodbye to China.”In Brazil, Mr Bakker said, TNT Express is better positioned, with a market share comparable to that in Europe. The division remains lossmaking due to botching the integration of a couple of takeovers in 2010 but the company has said it should reach break-even in the last quarter of 2012.In the meantime, the company hardest hit by the failure of the merger with UPS may not be TNT Express but its sister company PostNL, the regular-mail company that emerged from the demerger of TNT.With the value of its 30 per cent stake in TNT Express collapsing, PostNL will likely be stuck with negative equity for years to come, according to an ABN Amro report.
132;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-01-14T12:55:48Z;UPS and TNT: delivery failure;Few silver linings for postal companies after €5.2bn deal is abandoned;Ouch, that hurts. TNT Express shares fell 42 per cent on Monday after UPS’s proposed €5.2bn deal to buy the company collapsed in the face of opposition from EU competition authorities. At €4.74, TNT’s shares are 25 per cent below the undisturbed price before the deal was announced last March. At least investors can stop arguing about what sort of a bid premium was in the price before the deal. TNT’s enterprise value is now six times its forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, in line with FedEx but a discount to UPS, on nine times.It is tempting to see the collapse as a masterstroke by FedEx. Lacking the firepower to compete with UPS (its enterprise value is a little more than a third of UPS’s), it declined to enter a bidding war last year. But FedEx also refused to buy the parts of TNT the EU wanted UPS to sell and, in doing so, contributed to the deal’s collapse. With its biggest competitor for the assets out of the way, FedEx can consider making an approach of its own.But TNT shareholders should not hold their breath. True, its 18 per cent market share in Europe is attractive to FedEx, with only 4 per cent. But that lack of overlap also means it would not be able to squeeze out anything like the €400m to €550m of cost savings that UPS promised, so it would not be able to offer as much. Even if FedEx decides it wants TNT, there is no reason to rush into things.So TNT shareholders (including, no doubt, some furious merger arbs) will have to nurse their wounds for a while. They can console themselves with a €200m break fee and decent earnings growth for the next couple of years, but also have to cope with strategic uncertainty, especially over its businesses in China and Brazil. FedEx, on the same rating but with a clearer plan of action, looks better placed to deliver for investors.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
133;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-01-14T12:31:19Z;UPS abandons €5.2bn TNT Express takeover;;UPS has abandoned its €5.2bn bid for Dutch delivery group TNT Express in the face of stiff opposition from Europe’s antitrust chief, who is preparing to block the second big tie-up involving a US company in just a year.The decision to give up on attempts to win clearance from Brussels sent shares in TNT tumbling by as much as 49 per cent and marked a grim start to the year for M&A bankers and for hedge funds who were betting on the deal being completed.However people close to the deal are already speculating about the prospects of a separate bid for TNT from FedEx, the main rival to UPS. It would need to pay less than UPS and would face fewer competition obstacles.Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, believed the takeover left many European markets with just two or three “integrators” – companies that combine air and road delivery capacities – leading to a poor choice for customers and the threat of higher prices.UPS had been scrambling to put in place a last-minute package of remedies to win approval, which involved selling a portfolio of assets across Europe to France’s DPD and giving it rights to buy space on the UPS airline.However, the remedy was extremely complex and involved many uncertainties, such as whether DPD had the ability or inclination to challenge the likes of DHL and UPS in express delivery over the long term.The European Commission’s decision to block UPS’s €5bn acquisition of Dutch rival TNT Express is a timely reminder of how the fate of dealmaking can often lie with regulators, writes Lina Saigol.Few can forget the spate of large mergers which were blocked by the EU antitrust regulator during the technology, media and telecoms boom of 2000.It was then that the EU commission prevented the $45bn blockbuster deal between US companies General Electric and Honeywell in 2001 from going ahead on competition concerns.Although US competition authorities had given their stamp of approval to the deal, the EU argued that the integration of Honeywell’s avionics division and GE’s strength in jet engines could lead to dominance of the market.The move prompted US regulators to accuse their European counterparts of protectionist and anti-business behaviour.In 2001, the commission also stopped the €5.4bn merger between French electrical equipment makers Schneider Electric and Legrand.But a year later, a court found that the commission’s economic reasoning for blocking that deal was flawed – and annulled the ruling, causing huge embarrassment for the then-commission head Mario Monti and led to it paying compensation to Schneider.The lesson was particularly bitter for the Brussels bureaucrats who had been more accustomed to cashing in on the hefty fines imposed on companies breaching competition rules rather than the reverse.Commission officials told UPS that they were preparing a prohibition decision on those grounds and – crucially – declined to extend the deadline to give it more time to agree terms with DPD. Scott Davis, UPS chief executive, said he was “extremely disappointed”.EU officials dismissed any suggestion that the tough line, which comes less than a year after Mr Almunia blocked the merger of Deutsche Börse with the New York Stock Exchange, will cause a rift with the US.But one shareholder in UPS questioned the “heavy hand” of Brussels “meddling” with a successful US company’s ambitions. “It is problematic. It sounds to me like TNT is impaired on its own. So how is competition going to be improved in Europe?” said Richard Platte, a portfolio manager for Ave Maria mutual funds.Although UPS sees no “realistic prospect” of the deal being cleared, a formal termination of its agreement with TNT will occur once Brussels has officially blocked the deal. A commission spokesperson said: “The commission will take its decision by February 5.”Brussels has only blocked 22 mergers and acquisitions deals since the introduction of merger control rules in 1989. Almunia requires the approval of the college of EU commissioners to block the UPS-TNT deal, but it is extremely rare for a draft prohibition decision to be overturned.The failure of the deal is a blow to UPS’s ambitions to gain a stronger foothold in the European market. It agreed to pay TNT a €200m break-fee if the deal fell through on competition grounds.It leaves TNT Express, the world’s fourth-largest parcel group, without a clear strategy. The company was demerged from its former parent company TNT in 2011 with ta view to making a merger with UPS or FedEx attractive.Bernard Bot, TNT Express’s acting chief executive, said the company would “focus on executing our existing strategy” and that the company would release a new strategic review “in due course”.The collapse is yet another blow for dealmakers. According to data provider Thomson Reuters, the advisers would have been on track to earn around $55m, with an estimated $25.4m for the target advisers and $29.6m for the acquirer advisers. Goldman Sachs advised TNT and Lazard advised its advisory board, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS advised UPS.With the deal failing, the financial advisers typically will only take home around 10 per cent of that. Globally investment banking fees in 2012 fell 3 per cent to $74.8bn, the slowest period since the 2009, while in Europe bankers fees fell to an eight-year low.
134;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
135;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:51:47+0000;UPS move on TNT poses concern;;UPS’s attempted takeover of TNT Express poses serious competition problems that are “not easy” to resolve, the EU competition chief has said, while leaving open the door to an 11th-hour solution to save the deal from being blocked.The US delivery group is trying to sell France’s DPD a swath of TNT assets that are sufficient in quality and scope to convince Brussels that competition in the express delivery market is maintained.The proposed remedies are still being reviewed by the European Commission. But Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner, made plain the difficulties of compensating for the takeover of one of Europe’s four integrators, which combine ground and air transport.“The elimination of competitors such as TNT, that is an integrator, requires . . . an alternative integrator or someone who will play the same role from the competition point of view with equivalent competitive pressure,” Mr Almunia said in an interview with the Financial Times.He added that finding such a remedy was “not easy”, particularly given DPD has no air transport of its own. However by noting that the creation of an “equivalent competitive pressure” – rather than a full-blown global integrator – could be sufficient, Mr Almunia appears to be keeping his counsel on a DPD option.“What I have told UPS, what you have to present is an equivalent. Everybody who knows this market is convinced today DPD is not an equivalent,” he said. “It depends how this situation can be changed but it will not change just for saying I want to change. We need to receive assurances.”“To be express delivery you cannot go with horses, you need also to have not only capacity in the point of delivery of the sender of the parcel but delivery close to the receiver,” he added, with reference to air capability.The commission sees a potential sale to FedEx as a simpler option, because the US group has its own airline and a more developed network in Europe. But UPS has told the commission FedEx are unwilling to discuss buying the assets it is willing to sell.Mr Almunia is shortly to pass judgment on the terms of the provisional deal with DPD. His decision remains in the balance and it is possible that the UPS-TNT deal will be blocked.DPD is being asked to provide assurances to the commission on how it plans to use the TNT assets and on its long-term plans to challenge the likes of UPS and DHL in express delivery.UPS has offered to sell TNT subsidiaries in at least 16 countries, as well as providing DPD with space on its aircraft at competitive rates for five years. Mr Almunia’s comments indicate potential commission concerns about whether this would leave gaps in the DPD network that would undermine its ability to compete.An option under consideration is to “stop the clock” for a few weeks to give more time to UPS to agree terms with DPD, before the commission gives its official approval.But some people involved in the talks say that the risk of the DPD transaction not being completed after approval make this option unlikely. The commission could instead withhold full regulatory approval – and stop UPS closing its deal – until a binding agreement is signed with a buyer.
136;UPS;United Parcel Service;2013-01-07T18:39:13Z;FedEx rebuffs UPS over TNT Express assets;;FedEx has rebuffed informal approaches from its arch-rival UPS to buy a package of TNT Express assets, further complicating UPS’s last-ditch efforts to win EU approval for its takeover of the Dutch delivery group.The cold shoulder from FedEx, which would not engage in serious talks without it covering a bigger slice of the TNT business, has raised the stakes for UPS as it enters a potentially decisive fortnight in the Brussels merger clearance process.According to several people involved in the clearance talks, France’s DPD is currently the lone contender to buy the assets, which were recently sweetened by UPS to cover entire TNT subsidiaries in at least 16 EU countries, including Spain and Portugal.But the European Commission, which has serious concerns about the harmful competitive effects of the UPS-TNT tie-up, is demanding clear assurances that DPD will be a strong rival with a long-term commitment to the express parcel delivery business.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, is cautious about a sale to the French group because it does not have an air network and would rely on buying space in aircraft from its rivals – a shortcoming that has raised doubts about its long-term commitment to challenging the likes of DHL and UPS.The commission decision remains in the balance and time is running short. The February 5 deadline means that the commission will soon need to prepare a draft decision on whether to block the deal or clear it with conditions.One option being considered – if DPD is seen as a viable competitor and can give Brussels some assurances on its long-term business plan – is to extend the effective deadline to the end of February on the condition that the sale of assets is agreed. Yet even this rare extension may force DPD to scramble to complete the deal.The simplest solution for the commission would be a sale to FedEx, which already owns an airline. But UPS has told the commission FedEx is not engaging in talks. It made fruitless informal approaches to FedEx, including in December, to test its interest in a smaller bundle of assets than that offered to the less established DPD.UPS fear that identifying FedEx as the only viable buyer would trigger a fire-sale, especially given FedEx’s hard-bargaining. But UPS critics question whether it is willing to make a serious offer to its main commercial rival. In its package of concessions, UPS stipulated that TNT assets in certain countries could not be sold to FedEx or DHL.The takeover reduces the number of global “integrators” – combining ground and air transport – from four to three in the express delivery field: UPS, DHL and FedEx.The commission’s investigation, however, found FedEx’s network to be patchy, meaning that the merger would leave a harmful duopoly in many markets.DPD does not own an airline but UPS has offered space in its aircraft at competitive rates for a period of five years. DPD is submitting to the commission a plan of how it intends to use the TNT assets and whether it has any prospect of buying or leasing an airline.FedEx and the European Commission declined to comment. UPS said it was working hard to address the commission’s concerns.
137;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;UPS submits new TNT Express concessions;;UPS, one of the world’s largest package delivery companies by revenues, has sent a new offer to the European Commission to try to win EU regulatory approval for its planned €5.2bn acquisition of TNT Express, people close to the matter said.The US company has offered fresh concessions as part of a planned sale of its European assets and has guaranteed competitors access to the air transport market in its latest bid to overcome the commission’s objection to its take over of its Dutch rival.“We made our offer over the weekend and we are hopeful that it will provide the remedies necessary to move the deal forward,” said a person close to the matter.People familiar with the negotiations said that UPS was ready to dispose of substantially more assets – predominantly in eastern Europe – than the 12 previously offered.However, despite the new concessions, UPS will have to convince Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s antitrust chief, that enough safeguards have been put in place to maintain an acceptable level of competition throughout Europe.“It still remains to be seen whether appropriate solutions will ultimately address our concerns for express-parcel deliveries in Europe,” Mr Almunia said earlier this month.Brussels is concerned that UPS’s takeover of TNT would reduce the number of key players capable of the full range of parcel delivery services across the continent to only three, making Deutsche Post’s DHL and the US’s FedEx the main competitors in the Europe to US route.The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, and UPS declined to comment.TNT shares rose as much as 4.3 per cent to €8.27, trading below the €9.50 per share offer made by UPS.
138;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Hurdles remain for UPS on TNT deal;;UPS is making progress in its quest to win EU approval for its €5.2bn takeover of TNT Express but still faces a big challenge in convincing Brussels that it has a credible buyer for a swath of assets across eastern Europe.The US delivery group recently made headway in narrowing the European Commission’s strong antitrust concerns and reduced the number of problem countries from 29 to about 15, said people involved with the process.But even after reluctantly offering to sell some or all TNT assets in these problematic countries, it faces a fight to convince the commission that the buyer will be strong enough to maintain competition levels.These potential hitches threaten to leave the US delivery group with a short timeframe to sell-up and a narrow field of buyers – raising the prospect for UPS of having to offer the assets at fire sale prices to FedEx, its arch US rival.UPS is actively courting other delivery groups, such as France’s DPD. In its submission it proposed to start the formal sale process only after it wins a regulatory green light from Brussels, said people familiar with the offer.But the commission is indicating to UPS that the purchaser’s capabilities will be critical to its decision. This would depend on the buyer taking over a viable business with ownership or access to an air network, which the commission sees as essential for the express delivery market.The takeover reduces the number of global “integrators” – combining ground and air transport – from four to three in the express delivery field.The commission’s investigation, however, found FedEx’s network to be patchy, meaning that the merger would leave a harmful duopoly in many markets. DPD does not own an airline.On Tuesday, Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition chief, said he would not allow a deal leaving some European markets “only with two integrators”. “We want to give way for another integrator,” he said. “It still remains to be seen whether appropriate solutions will ultimately address our concerns for express-parcel deliveries in Europe,” he added.UPS offered to sell entire TNT subsidiaries in 12 countries and promised some asset sales in three other states. Rivals have recently been providing feedback on the package. Most of the assets are in eastern Europe and the package excludes businesses in France, Italy, the UK, and Spain.The commission dropped its initial objections to the deal in some markets after taking account of UPS arguments on the strength of FedEx and potential efficiency benefits from the deal.UPS is promising the buyer space in its aircraft at competitive prices for the next three years. However, as a rule, the commission is cautious about such so-called “access remedies”, which can be complex and hard to enforce.The simplest solution for Brussels would be a sale to FedEx, which owns its own airline. But Mr Almunia has not ruled out the option of a deal to create a new integrator if UPS can show it would not be undermined by relying on another group’s air network.

It also said shareholders had reached an agreement on a new capital structure.The stock gained 2.5 per cent to €27.23 during the day. The French CAC 40 rallied 0.3 per cent to 3,590.50.“I’m very pleased that they can do 15 per cent because it essentially sweeps up any overhang,” said Zafar Khan, an analyst at Société Générale. “It’s actually a much, much better outcome than I had expected.”Hopes for a Nokia comeback were reignited when the Finnish handset maker agreed to sell its smartphones through China Mobile.The Chinese group is the world’s largest mobile operator by subscribers and the only one that does not have a contract to sell iPhones.The news sent Nokia’s shares surging 9.7 per cent to €2.77.Comments from European competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia prompted investors to buy into TNT Express. In October, he expressed concern that a proposed takeover of the Dutch express delivery company by UPS could harm competition.On Wednesday, Mr Almunia said a market test of concessions proposed by UPS to allay regulatory worries showed that competitors and third parties were not satisfied with the offer. He added that the commission had yet to make a decision.“There are two ways to read it [Almunia’s comments],” said Damian Brewer, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “A) there are still concerns; and b) they are still talking to the company. Whether it is a buy or sell is unclear. You are in a field of deep conjecture.”The shares nevertheless rallied 4 per cent to €7.64. The Netherlands’ AEX index rose 0.4 per cent to 338.85.The FTSE Eurofirst gained 0.3 per cent to 1,124.07."
140;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;UPS submits assets sales plan to Brussels;;Express delivery company UPS has submitted to the European Commission an offer to sell assets and guarantee competitors access to air transport in order to overcome the commission’s objections to its proposed takeover of Dutch rival TNT Express.The companies offered no details on which business activities or assets they planned to sell to address the commission’s concerns that the merger would harm competition in many European markets.In a joint statement, they said they remained “fully committed to the merger” and would work with the commission to gain approval in early 2013.People familiar with the negotiations have indicated that UPS is offering to dispose of assets in about 10 European countries, and to pledge that competitors can use the combined group’s air freight network.The UPS offer of remedies is the company’s answer to official objections made by Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, in October. An in-depth investigation by the commission found that the takeover would mean that in many European markets UPS and Germany’s DHL would be the only two “integrators”, or delivery companies offering the full range of both road and air freight services.The intent of UPS’s proposed remedies is to reduce its own share in those markets and to enlarge the capacities of smaller peers to create greater competition.Other delivery companies with lesser capacity and market share include France’s DPD, US-based Global Logistics Solutions, and the other global integrator, Federal Express, which the commission found had just a scattered presence in Europe.The companies’ statement said the remedies also included “granting access to air capabilities”. But the commission is known to prefer actual sales of assets as remedies, rather than contracts or promises of behaviour, which may be subject to change at a later date.In arguing during the review process that smaller companies already compete with integrators, UPS has pointed out that delivery companies routinely buy space on each others’ airlines, raising the question of how much guarantees of air access would change the situation.The groups stressed that the initial proposal of remedies is not final, and could change during negotiations with the commission. The commission is to render a final decision by February 5.
141;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-11-29T23:07:12Z;UPS looks to clear TNT Express deal;;UPS is promising to sell assets across Europe and guarantee access to its air freight network in an attempt to assuage Brussels’ concerns about its takeover of TNT Express.The US delivery group was set a deadline of midnight Thursday to submit a package of remedies to be considered by the European Commission before it agrees to clear the €5.2bn takeover bid for TNT Express.The package proposes business and asset sales in about 10 countries as well as measures to open the combined groups’ air freight network, said people familiar with the situation. The plan is to sell TNT Express’s assets in certain countries to reduce its market share.It was not clear how many competitors would have access to the network, one of the people said.UPS remained fully committed to the merger, the people said, and confident of getting clearance by early 2013.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, has made clear that he expects “substantial” concessions to be made to win his approval.An in-depth commission investigation concluded that the combined group would damage competition in cross-border express parcel deliveries in almost all European countries. TNT Express and UPS are two of four global “integrators” in the express delivery field, which combine ground and air transport.The commission analysis finds that Federal Express, the US delivery company, has a relatively patchy presence in Europe, meaning the merger would leave UPS competing only with Germany’s DHL in many countries.By offering access to its air network, UPS will attempt to show that it will face competition from rivals, even when they do not own an airline.However, the commission is usually wary of so-called access remedies, particularly if the terms would potentially involve the UPS pledges to be monitored or for prices to be regulated. Generally its preference is for cleaner asset sales, rather than promises to change behaviour.The breadth of concerns could convince Mr Almunia to press for sell-offs covering a large number of countries, which is difficult in such networked businesses and could undermine the rationale of the deal for UPS.The submission of remedies will extend the deadline for a decision into February.
142;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-11-19T17:40:52Z;Corporate tales to boost sales;;"The customers camping outside an Apple store the night before a product launch are clearly interested in more than just the latest iPad: they are fans with a passion for everything the brand stands for. Consumers often make buying choices based on a brand’s values and culture, whether riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle or flying Virgin Atlantic. Now companies that sell to other businesses rather than consumers are also exploiting their thinking and values to stand out from the crowd.In marketing jargon this process is called “thought leadership marketing” – where businesses market their ideas, expertise, values and philosophy instead of merely their products. In contrast to traditional consumer brand marketing, this tactic aims to wrap up a company’s “big ideas” via a multitude of content using various channels both to engage and to educate its target audience.Creating content for customers is a key part of the strategy, with online information – from blog posts to downloadable reports – helping to build a long-term relationship between buyer and seller. The shipping company UPS, for example, created “the new logistics”, a website showing businesses how to use logistics to expand, covering considerations from customer service through to money-saving ideas.Ann Handley, chief content officer of MarketingProfs.com, an online resource for marketers, and author of Content Rules, recently published research showing that 91 per cent of business-to-business companies are incorporating content into their marketing. This content is not only
published online but also includes conferences and seminars where industry experts are brought together to discuss new ideas.“I think it’s more than a trend. I believe this will be a critical aspect of doing business for B2B,” says Jesse Noyes, managing editor at Eloqua. The marketing automation software company – clients include Siemens and Johnson & Johnson – hired Mr Noyes, a former business journalist, to create and deliver a series of marketing manuals and online content that is shared with clients. The Social Media ProBook, for example, is a
42-page ebook containing data, expertise, tips and opinion. When publications are such a hit, they are shared online by the marketing industry and grab attention in a noisy marketplace. Some of Eloqua’s ebooks have been viewed 90,000 times.●Make the most of your in-house experts. “Hire content producers and ‘brand journalists’ who are essentially embedded in your company – pulling those stories out, and crafting them for a larger audience,” says Ann Handley of MarketingProfs.com.●Put your customers first. “How can you help them shoulder their burdens, ease their pain? Your content should grow out of that – in other words, stop talking about yourself!” says Ms Handley.●Produce content that addresses the right questions. “Content is often about sharing what you know, not what you sell,” says Jesse Noyes, at Eloqua. Start a blog, a Facebook group, use question and answer forums.●Use social media to engage with your audience. Do not just tweet out links to your content. “Social media is about conversation, not a new bully pulpit. If you’re going to be part of the conversation, you need to bring something of value,” says Mr Noyes.Mr Noyes says content is helpful because business-to-business purchases often require a lot of research before a decision is made. “The buyer wants more than product specs and pricing data. They want to know the people they’re buying from know their space, understand their customers’ needs and jobs,” he says. Creating content “is the best way to position yourself as a smart group of people ready with an answer to clients’ most burning questions”.This is not new for consultants and professional services firms. For example, McKinsey Quarterly is the consultant’s business journal, which looks at management trends and ideas using content provided by its consultants and clients. Boston Consulting Group, meanwhile, has the online portal BCG Perspectives and Booz & Co publishes Strategy + Business magazine, its own quarterly.Similarly, Open View Venture Partners, a venture capital firm in Boston, recently created a website called Open View Labs as a resource to help entrepreneurs.Peter O’Neill, vice-president and principal analyst of B2B technology marketing at Forrester Research, says content and idea creation is an especially relevant marketing tool for technology companies. This is because many services such as cloud computing and marketing automation software can be difficult to grasp for executives. “It is a way to stand out from the competition, create interest and earn the trust of potential buyers early in their problem-solving process. This makes them more likely to seek that firm when they enter the actual buying cycle,” he says.American Express’s Open, the small-business division of the credit card company, publishes an online hub providing advice and networking opportunities. Not only does the site try to build long-term relationships with clients by producing content the small businesses are unlikely to find elsewhere, but that information is then shared among the community via social media. The forum has 193,000 Twitter followers.Using content to establish deeper relationships with customers is ultimately a way of reframing the sales process. Because business-to-business deals can take a long time to close, vendors need to start building the relationship by sharing expertise; selling the features and benefits can come later.“In the B2B world, you are often talking about a long-term complex sale – 18 to 24 months is not uncommon. So at the awareness phase, it is less effective to talk about benefits and price because (quite often) you are talking through a buyer’s pain points,” says Ms Handley.Producing content is a way to demonstrate empathy with the challenges faced by clients. “Buyers want to be convinced that their suppliers understand their business and their issues,” says Mr O’Neill. “Even if the products are commodities, they care about other factors like reliability, quality and relationship.”In her book, Ms Handley tells the story of Hubspot, a supplier of marketing software, which published a video online called Dude, cold calling is for losers in 2008. The video risked alienating those in their audience who use cold-calling; but in taking such a provocative stance the video amassed more than 66,000 views on YouTube and many comments on the company blog.“Thought leadership really just means acting as a resource to your prospects and customers,” says Ms Handley. “In other words, you solve problems for them, you share resources with them – all with an eye toward helping. And not purely ‘selling’.”Another benefit is that, unlike business-to-consumer relationships, where customers can usually switch from one supplier to another, long, fixed contracts mean it is often difficult to break business-to-business relationships.“When you decide as a company to embrace marketing automation, you need to think long-term. It’s not a one-shot decision with minor impact,” says Alexandre Papillaud, marketing operations manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at McAfee, the cyber security company and one of Eloqua’s customers. “You need to trust your vendor, not only the product, but also their thinking. How do they see marketing in future, how can they be innovative for me so I can beat the competition?”Of course, he adds, a business cannot hide a poor product behind a good idea. “Thinking is great but me and my team need something that works, is easy to use and efficient. Thinking is not what will make my business run,” he says."
143;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:08:50+0000;Hedge funds face losses over UPS-TNT deal;;"Hedge fund managers stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if the merger of UPS and TNT Express, one of the largest European deals this year, falls apart after unexpected extensive competition objections from the European Commission.So-called merger arbitrage funds piled into Dutch logistics company TNT this year, expecting to pick up healthy profits as the deal neared completion at a premium to the company’s share price.For the past week the market has been giving the deal just a 50:50 chance of success. With those odds, some merger arbitrage funds have thrown in the towel – but others stand to lose even more money if the deal collapses.“There is no analysis you can do on this,” said one arb specialist. “You are in uncharted territory. I’ve seen a lot of legal work show one result and the same in-depth analysis shows a different outcome.”Investors’ trades are not made public so it is not known which funds hold large positions or might face big losses, though many of the hedge fund industry’s biggest names have been closely following the transaction.The strength of the commission’s objections to the UPS-TNT tie-up have surprised investors and the company’s executives, who had confidently predicted that the EU would grant approval in August after a fast-track investigation.Brussels instead opened a full antitrust probe and concluded that the deal damaged competition in the cross-border express parcel market in 29 European Economic Area countries. Only in Liechtenstein was the combined group’s presence not harmful, according to people familiar with the Commission’s formal objections.The fate of the deal rests on whether UPS can overturn some of Brussels’ key arguments – most importantly on the definition of the market – and shape a package of asset sell-offs that will address remaining concerns. Those people involved in the process do not expect the Commission’s analysis to change dramatically.Several factors have driven interest from merger arbitrage hedge funds in the deal: the widely held view that UPS would win fast EU regulatory clearance, or at worst be asked to make piecemeal asset sales; UPS’s pledge to pay TNT a €200m termination fee if the deal fell through; and the relative scarcity of other mergers to speculate on."
144;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-11-16T17:35:22Z;ASL to acquire TNT Express’s airlines;;"Ireland’s ASL Aviation Group has agreed to buy TNT Express's two airlines for an undisclosed sum, provided that UPS's €5.2bn acquisition of the Dutch logistics company goes through.TNT Express was required to find a buyer for the airlines because EU rules make it prohibitively difficult for a foreign entity, such as the US’s UPS, to own a European-registered airline.""It was clear from the start they would have to do this,"" said Arun Rambocus of Kempen Securities. “The fact that TNT Express is moving forward assuming the deal will go through doesn't really say anything.”The airline disposal does nothing to resolve the European Commission’s concerns that UPS’s acquisition of TNT Express would lead to too much market concentration.UPS’s takeover of TNT was announced in March but has grown increasingly uncertain because of objections by the European competition commissioner.In an official statement of objections last month, the European competition commission said that because FedEx has limited presence in Europe, the merger would leave just two integrators on many routes.TNT Express and UPS are two of four global “integrators” in the express delivery field, which combine ground and air transport capability. The others are Germany’s DHL and the US’s FedEx.Brussels is considering UPS’s counter-arguments, and is expected to render a judgment by January.A statement by the companies yesterday said that ASL will purchase TNT Express’s two airlines, TNT Airways and Pan Air Lineas Aeréas, immediately before settlement of UPS’s acquisition of TNT Express, if EU approval comes through.Dublin-based ASL Aviation owns five small cargo and passenger charter airlines with a total of 90 aircraft and 1,200 employees. It had revenues of €410m in 2011ASL Aviation commits to continue supplying TNT Express’s air freight needs after a merger while its integration with UPS is under way. ASL also commits to maintain TNT Airways’ headquarters in Liège and take on its workers there.Liège also houses TNT Express's major sorting-centre hub. As part of the agreement UPS says that it “will develop longer-term plans for the hub, with involvement of employees’ representatives, the Walloon Region and Liège Airport”.The commitments may allay concerns that TNT Express’s unions could block the merger over fears of subsequent lay-offs.“Labour unrest in Liège delaying the disposal and thus the merger progress was a risk that appears to have been mitigated by this sale,” Gert Steens of SNS Securities said in a note."
145;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:08:50+0000;UPS faces uphill fight over TNT Express;;Europe’s top antitrust watchdog has issued strong and deep-rooted objections to UPS’s proposed takeover of smaller Dutch rival TNT Express, leaving the US delivery group with an uphill challenge to save the deal from being blocked.People familiar with the European Commission’s “statement of objections”, which runs to hundreds of pages, say it concludes that the tie-up will undermine competition in express small parcel delivery in almost every European national market, which would likely raise prices and restrict choice for customers.The charge-sheet rejects UPS’s arguments that the combination of two of the world’s four largest delivery companies would leave the European market highly competitive due to a plethora of smaller operators.Instead, the commission used a narrow market definition restricted to so-called “integrators”, companies with their own aircraft which are thus highly competitive in express delivery.The commission is concerned that because US delivery company Federal Express has a weak presence in Europe, a merger would leave UPS competing only with Germany’s DHL in many countries.The commission, however, accepted UPS’s argument that the takeover would pose no competition problems for routes from Europe to outside destinations.A commission spokesman would not comment on the details of the statement of objections, which remain confidential.UPS will respond in writing to the commission in coming days and put its case at a formal hearing, within the next fortnight. A final judgment is expected in January.While the statement of objections does not prejudge the outcome, the commission rarely changes its core market definition once a statement of objections is issued.If they are unable to broaden the fundamental market definition, it could prove difficult for UPS or TNT Express to find remedies that would allow the deal to go through. As well as the difficulties of selling off part of a delivery network, UPS would need to demonstrate any buyer would be a strong enough “integrator” to counteract any reduction in competition in specific national markets.Both companies declined to respond to details of the statement of objections, but said they remained committed to the merger and expected it to be approved early next year.Their executives argue that whether or not they own their aircraft, smaller delivery companies routinely rent space on planes owned by others, including UPS itself.They point to midsize operators such as GLS as well as numerous freight forwarders and smaller local players. UPS also argues that an expected €450m-€500m in annual synergies from the merger would ultimately be passed on to customers.But the commission statement of objections rejects these arguments as insufficient to balance the anti-competitive effect of the deal. The commission is concerned that if the merger leads Europe to follow the model of the US, where the departure of DHL in 2008 left UPS and Federal Express as the only integrators, it could give the remaining players unhealthy pricing power.In addition to resolving the commission’s objections, TNT Express must sell its airline before the settlement date of the acquisition because EU rules prohibit a non-European company such as UPS from owning a European-based airline. TNT Express says talks on selling the airline are at an advanced stage.TNT Express’s management agreed to the €5.2bn offer from UPS in March after initially resisting the takeover. On Wednesday the Dutch financial markets authority granted UPS an extension to February 28 of its offer for TNT Express’s shares.
146;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-10-29T10:27:34Z;TNT Express quarterly income falls 12%;;TNT Express reported a fall in revenues and organic earnings in the third quarter as the Dutch delivery company awaited criteria from the European competition authorities for approving its acquisition by American peer UPS.The group’s performance improved in Asia-Pacific and the Americas, but declined in recession-hit Europe as customers traded down to slower, lower-margin delivery products.Bernard Bot, acting chief executive, said: “Unfortunately trading conditions were more challenging than we would have liked. However, we made the necessary cost savings to support profitability.”TNT Express revenues were €1.12bn – up 2.1 per cent year on year in nominal terms, but down 1.9 per cent after accounting for exchange rates. After accounting for exchange rates and exceptional items, operating profit was €38m, down 12 per cent year on year.Earlier this month the European Commission officially objected to UPS’s €5.2bn offer to acquire TNT Express. TNT Express management accepted UPS’s offer of €9.50 per share in March, but Joaquín Almunia, European competition commissioner, has said the merged entity would be too dominant in express delivery services on some routes.UPS is seeking to benefit from TNT Express’s big market share in the European market.Mr Bot said the merger with UPS was moving forward and would be completed in 2013, though no details would be forthcoming until the commission specifies what remedies it would need to approve the deal. The company hopes for an announcement from the commission by December.In addition to whatever remedies the commission specifies, TNT Express is negotiating to sell its airline, which UPS cannot acquire because of EU rules barring non-European companies from owning Europe-based airlines.The results had little effect on TNT Express’s share price, which largely depends on investors’ expectations about whether the EU will approve the merger deal. Shares were up 0.5 per cent were to €8.19 in late afternoon trading on the Amsterdam exchange, against a 0.5 per cent drop in the AEX index.
147;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-10-28T17:55:07Z;CEOs speak up as US heads for fiscal cliff;Industry leaders want action on the structural problems of the budget;As Republicans and Democrats in the US Congress race towards the “ fiscal cliff” like James Dean and Corey Allen in Rebel Without a Cause – daring each other to chicken out first – the country’s chief executives are trying to stamp on the brake.The “cliff” they are fast approaching is the economically dangerous concurrence of two events: the scheduled expiration of tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and public spending reductions agreed as part of a deal to raise the legal ceiling for the US national debt. Both will take effect at the beginning of January unless Congress can agree a plan to prevent them.But while the politicians argue over directions, more than 80 CEOs – including the leaders of companies such as Microsoft, UPS, JPMorgan Chase and General Electric – came out last week as public supporters of the “Campaign to Fix the Debt”, a lobby group calling for a long-term plan to curb US government borrowing.The CEOs want action on the structural problems of the US budget, of which the most serious is rising healthcare costs. Their motivation for speaking up now, though, is the threat over the next few months, rather than coming decades. Their success or failure will decide the outlook for US business next year.If the cliff is not avoided, the lower spending and higher taxes would have an immediate impact on government borrowing, cutting it by 3.7 per cent of gross domestic product, according to the London School of Economics. This would also almost certainly tip the country back into recession.The National Association of Manufacturers, an industry group, says uncertainty over the issue is already deterring hiring and investment, and will cut 0.6 percentage points from US GDP this year. If the US goes over the cliff, it adds, “the effects will be far worse”.Several CEOs, including Jeff Immelt of GE, say they expect Congress to pull back from the brink because the consequences of failing to do so would be so serious.Dave Cote of Honeywell, one of the debt campaign’s leading figures, said that if politicians were playing with fire last year when they dragged their feet over raising the debt ceiling, “this time they’re playing with nitroglycerine”.If Congress cannot reach a budget deal, he added, “we could have a recession in my view that is significantly greater than [anyone] is forecasting today, because it’s an indictment of our ability to govern”.While CEOs are working for a deal, they are also planning for what will happen if they fail.Whether the country does go into recession will depend on how long Congress goes on without reaching agreement. Although the tax increases and spending cuts formally start on January 1 and 2 respectively, the full impact will not be felt immediately.Bob Stevens, chief executive of Lockheed Martin, the largest US defence contractor, said last week he had been told by the Pentagon that its contracts were not likely to be affected for three months. If, as many in Washington expect, a deal is done early in the new year, the worst effects could be forestalled.However, there is one consequence that could hit very quickly: turbulence in financial markets. If taxes rise and spending is cut, interest rates on Treasury bonds are likely to fall as a result of the reduction in the budget deficit and the heightened threat of recession.On the other hand, a short-term deal that avoids the cliff while showing no signs of tackling long-term budget problems could push rates up, according to economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Prolonged political wrangling is also likely to raise corporate debt spreads. The US Federal Reserve found investors’ appetite for risk declined last summer during the argument over the debt ceiling, and the impact from disagreement over the fiscal cliff may be worse.If a recession looks a real possibility, the effect will be even greater. Even the largest US industrial groups still make about half their revenues in their home market, according to Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. In a world where Europe has been predictably weak and China has disappointed, the health of US demand is critical for corporate earnings.A budget deal that averts the short-term danger while offering some reassurance about the long-term position could give a significant boost to US business. In Mr Cote’s words, “we can provide a stimulus to the world”. The fear is that Congress may take a while to see it that way.Explaining GE’s recent move to refinance $5bn of debt maturing in February, Keith Sherin, GE’s chief financial officer, said financial markets might be “choppy”.He sounded like a driver preparing passengers for what could be a bone-shaking ride.Ed Crooks is the Financial Times’ US industry and energy editored.crooks@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
148;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-10-23T21:57:27Z;UPS reaffirms guidance in tough market;;"United Parcel Service, the express package operator, stuck with its guidance for fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday in what it said was a mark of confidence in its ability to operate successfully amid the worldwide economic slowdown.The company narrowed the range of its guidance for diluted earnings per share for 2012 to $4.55 to $4.65 from $4.50 to $4.70 previously. Kurt Kuehn, finance director, said the narrowing was a sign that the company had more confidence and clarity about where it was heading. Most Wall Street analysts had pitched their forecasts towards the lower end of the old range, he said.“It’s perceived, I think, as a sign of confidence that will manifest itself in full-year results somewhere between 5 and 7 per cent above 2011,” Mr Kuehn said.The revised guidance numbers announced alongside UPS’s third-quarter figures sent the company’s shares up 3 per cent to $73.73.Net earnings for the quarter were down 56 per cent to $469m, on revenue up 1.2 per cent to $7.86bn. Net income would have been down only 4 per cent to $1.03bn excluding a $559m non-cash, after-tax charge for restructuring of its US pension liabilities.FedEx, UPS’s main rival in the US express parcel market, cut its forecast for earnings for the year to May 31 in September when it announced its earnings for the quarter to August 31.Scott Davis, chief executive, said UPS’s strong results had been achieved in an environment of slowing global trade and changing market dynamics.“This not only highlights the flexibility of our business model; it illustrates the breadth of the UPS product portfolio in meeting the needs of customers,” he said.FedEx had said when it announced its figures that, as world economic growth slowed, customers were switching from moving goods by fast but expensive modes such as Fedex’s express parcel business to slower modes such as truck and sea. FedEx has since announced a shift to focus more on those modes.Mr Kuehn said UPS had seen some customers make similar switches to slower modes. But a more important shift for UPS was away from movements of large quantities of packages moving between businesses towards handling movements of one or two packages at a time between businesses and consumers.“It puts greater pressure on our routing, our optimisation and our networks,” Mr Kuehn said. “It’s an area that creates new constraints [on the business’ operations].”US domestic package revenue rose 1.4 per cent to $7.86bn on package volumes up 4 per cent to 13.2m. Operating profits fell to $129m from $1.05bn in last year’s third quarter but would have been $1.02bn without the $896m effect of the pension restructuring before tax rebates.International package revenues fell 3.7 per cent to $2.94bn, on flat volumes of 2.3m. Operating profits rose 7.7 per cent to $449m."
149;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-10-23T19:22:14Z;US results raise fresh fears for economy;;US companies have warned of weaker global demand and are cutting jobs, raising fresh fears about the health of the world economy and sending shares tumbling.DuPont, Xerox, UPS and 3M were among the companies that warned of difficult trading conditions, including faltering demand in some Asian markets and Europe’s continuing crisis.Ursula Burns, chief executive of Xerox, said the printing and business services company had been hit by “widespread economic uncertainty, especially in the United States”, and warned: “Economic challenges will continue putting additional pressure on the business.”Scott Davis, chief executive of UPS, said the freight company was operating in “an environment of slowing global trade”.Dow Chemical, the US chemicals group, said after the market close it was cutting 2,400 jobs, 5 per cent of its global workforce, and shutting 20 plants to save $500m per year, and cutting capital spending by a further $500m.It identified seven larger plants being closed: four in Europe, two in the US and one in Japan.Andrew Liveris, Dow’s chief executive, said: “We are operating in a slow-growth environment in the near-term”.Signs of further difficulties in the global outlook are a blow to President Barack Obama’s attempt to show that the US economy is on an improving trend. With only two weeks before the US election, the health of the US economy remains at the centre of the campaign.US equities fell sharply on Tuesday, with investors alarmed by the downbeat reports.The S&P 500 initially dropped 1.8 per cent, pressed by companies in the materials, energy and financials sectors. The index later clawed back some ground to be down 1.4 per cent by the close.The recent losses in the US stock market benchmark have wiped out its gains since the Federal Reserve, which ends a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, launched a third round of bond purchases last month.US corporate earnings have so far been in line with forecasts that quarterly profits and revenues will fall for the first time since 2009.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said: “I give more weight to fundamentals than liquidity from the Fed. The fact that we are seeing a 2 per cent drop in profits for the first time since 2009 . . . represents a directional change in the market.”DuPont, the largest US chemical group by market capitalisation swung into loss at its continuing operations for the third quarter, and warned of weaker-than-expected demand for some products. It suffered a particularly sharp drop in sales in the Asia-Pacific region, where volumes dropped 10 per cent and prices fell 5 per cent from the equivalent period of 2011.It also plans job losses, cutting 1,500 worldwide to improve productivity.Other companies also highlighted the impact of the slowdown in China, particularly on businesses reliant on construction and infrastructure spending. Inge Thulin, chief executive of 3M, told analysts: “In China, the year clearly has not played out the way most anticipated.”DuPont closed down 9 per cent, Xerox down 5 per cent, and Dow and 3M down 4 per cent. However, UPS reported relatively strong results in spite of the difficult economic conditions, and its shares closed up 3 per cent.The poor US results, together with weak data out of Spain, also weighed on European equities for a third day in a row. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index of the region’s biggest stocks fell 1.66 per cent, the CAC 40 dropped 2.22 per cent and Xetra Dax ended 2.1 per cent lower.Spain’s 10-year bonds were trading up 13 basis points at 5.62 per cent, while equivalent Italian debt was trading 10bp higher at 4.86 per cent as news of a further contraction in the Spanish economy, worries about its budget deficit target and a ratings downgrade by Moody’s of the debt of five the country’s regions knocked sentiment.Marchel Alexandrovich, European financial economist at Jefferies, said markets were focusing on the fact that a workout of the eurozone was predicated on growth and Spain at some point asking for a bailout.
150;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Brussels objects to UPS and TNT merger;;The European Commission has officially objected to the merger deal between UPS and TNT Express, throwing up a roadblock to the American delivery company’s €5.2bn offer to acquire its smaller Dutch rival, the companies said Friday evening.The EC’s statement of objections had been widely expected since the summer, when Joaquín Almunia, the commissioner for competition, announced the merger would be subjected to an extra stage of review over concerns it would hurt competition.UPS and TNT Express are two of four so-called delivery “integrators” in the world, with air and land networks offering a wide range of services, and the EC contends their merger would leave customers in some parts of Europe with too little choice.The details of the statement of objections have not yet been made public, but lack of competition on routes between Europe’s southern periphery and other peripheral areas is thought to be one concern.The management of TNT Express accepted UPS’s offer of €9.50 per share in March, but its shares have since fallen to €7.88 on fears the deal will not go through.UPS and TNT Express issued a joint press release calling the statement of objections “a normal step” in the EC’s review process which does not predetermine the outcome. The companies contend that many smaller players in the delivery industry provide ample competition, and that the merger would actually enhance competition.“The combined company will help create a more efficient logistics market, thereby improving the competitiveness of Europe and the solutions offered to businesses and consumers,” the companies said.The EC has given no indication of what remedies it might demand to allow the acquisition to go through. Should the commission demand either company divest some assets in order to increase competition, analysts say, the only likely buyer would be the American delivery company Federal Express.UPS says it remains committed to the acquisition, which fulfils its ambition to gain a stronger foothold in Europe. But an EC demand for remedies that leaves the merger with no business rationale could torpedo the deal.Besides any potential remedies, TNT Express must sell its airline before the settlement date of the merger, as EU aviation rules do not allow an American company such as UPS to own a European-based carrier.
151;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-10-12T13:36:42Z;Letter from Lex – popular uprising;A week featuring anti-aircraft and anti-bank weapons;This week resembled a popular uprising featuring anti-aircraft and anti-bank weapons. The German government shot down a deal to create a world-beating European aerospace and defence company leaving EADS’ long-term strategy in tatters. Then Walmart and Amex unveiled their anti-bank weapon, a service providing lower income households with an alternative to debit cards and current accounts. Greek citizens could do with a similar service as their banking sector has been whittled down from six to three players. In the UK, Barclays made another bolt-on acquisition in the form on ING’s lossmaking online bank as regulators simultaneously eased capital requirements in an effort to stimulate lending and the economy. The move came as the IMF estimated that tighter regulation will see European banks’ total assets fall by $2.8tn by the end of next year.Other companies were also feeling the sting of European regulators. Google offered to put clear labels on its own services in an attempt to appease them while UPS may have to offer significant remedies if it is to complete its €5.2bn takeover of TNT Express. Elsewhere the news was about phones, cars and resources.Japanese telecoms company SoftBank is in talks to acquire a $12.8bn stake in the US’ third largest mobile operator. But Chinese telecoms equipment makers Huawei and ZTE may soon be barred from doing business in the US after a Congressional committee said they posed a threat to national security in a move that smacks of protectionism. In the automotive sector, Toyota issued its biggest single vehicle recall to date as European carmakers still showed no signs of reducing the region’s 35 per cent production overcapacity. In the mining sector, the complex web of debt-ridden businesses and governance mishaps that is Bumi looked like it might finally put investors out of their misery. In the oil & gas sector, BP sold its Texas City refinery to Marathon Petroleum for $1.8bn as the CEO of the world’s biggest oil producing company, Rosneft, dangled the keys to the Arctic Ocean and the Kremlin before the eyes of western investors. Scotland may be relying on the oil & gas sector if it achieves independence in its 2014 referendum, but many Scots may be dismayed to discover that any Tartan index would be far more dependent on the financial sector.John Casey, Lex Publisher
152;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;EU set to deal UPS blow over TNT bid;;UPS is to be served with a formal EU complaint over its €5.2bn takeover bid for TNT Express, in a further blow for the US package delivery company’s attempt to win quick regulatory approval for the deal.The European Commission is close to completing its in-depth investigation and will issue a “statement of objections” as soon as next week outlining its serious doubts about the tie-up, according to people involved in the process.Investigators have told UPS that the objections will be delivered unless it offers divestments or commitments to eliminate the antitrust concerns – a formal step the US group will take once it sees Brussels’ full case against the transaction.UPS said both companies “will continue the dialogue with the commission” and were “confident they will receive clearance for the proposed acquisition”, but that it was unable to comment further.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition commissioner, is concerned the deal will leave just three delivery groups capable of the full range of parcel delivery services across the continent, with high concentrations in some markets that would hurt consumers.One particular concern is the provision of overnight parcel services on the southern periphery of Europe to other peripheral areas, which are some of the longest EU delivery routes and would face no competition from road networks.In July, Mr Almunia said such reduced competition would be “to the detriment of direct customers and ultimately of European consumers”.Statements of objections are not uncommon in antitrust reviews and most deals are cleared once adequate “remedies” are offered. However the price to win approval can be high and the decision represents another setback for UPS, which had initially hoped for a green light in July.UPS argues that the commission seriously underestimated the number of competitors it faces, such as from thousands of courier companies across Europe. The tie-up will also bring big efficiency gains, according to UPS, which will be passed on to consumers.Once the complaint is served, UPS will be given the opportunity to challenge the findings, hold a hearing and make a formal offer to eliminate the competition concerns. A final decision is expected in December or January.In a sign that the formal objections are imminent, competition officials are circulating a draft document among Brussels departments and asking UPS’s rivals for non-confidential versions of information submitted to the investigation. The commission declined to comment.The deal would make UPS the market leader in Europe, with a dominant position in several national markets. At the heart of the case against it is the commission’s decision to narrow the market to four so-called “global integrators”, which boast an air and road network that enables them to offer a broad range of services.After the merger, the commission is concerned that competition for express parcel services will only come from two other integrators: DHL, which is owned by Deutsche Post, and FedEx, the US group.TNT Express must sell its air freight branch before the acquisition, because EU rules do not allow foreign companies such as the American UPS to own a European-based airline.The company hopes to spin off the airline and lease back its services so that it can continue to operate during the integration with UPS, which could take years to complete. TNT Express said talks on selling the airline were “fully in progress” but declined to provide further details.Meanwhile analysts say the companies will find it difficult to address objections over competitiveness in particular markets because the integrated nature of the delivery business makes it hard to sell off individual pieces.UPS has already extended its initial offer for TNT Express through to November 9, and is negotiating with Dutch financial authorities for a second extension.The delayed merger has seen the departure of one of its key players, former TNT Express chief executive Marie-Christine Lombard. Ms Lombard resigned unexpectedly last month, foregoing a bonus of some €2.5m which she would have been entitled to had she seen the merger through to completion.
153;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-10-08T21:41:33Z;Global expansion plan lifts UnitedHealth;;UnitedHealth Group’s shares rose after the US health insurer said it would expand its international business by acquiring a 90 per cent stake in Amil Participacoes, a leading Brazilian health insurer and hospital operator, for $4.9bn.The planned takeover, announced on Monday, comes as companies in the US health industry have looked to consolidate or to expand their business outside the country as new regulations from President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform law take hold.UnitedHealth, the largest US insurer by revenues, already operates in Portugal, India and the Middle East through joint ventures. Amil provided health coverage to 5.8m customers in Brazil and had sales of $9.81bn in 2011.Shares in UnitedHealth rose as much as 2 per cent in the morning session before paring early gains to close 0.8 per cent higher at $57.60.Last month, the company replaced Kraft on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to become the only health insurer on the Big Board.Aetna, a rival health insurer, purchased Coventry Health Care for $5.7bn in August, uniting the US providers. Aetna shares gained 1 per cent to $42.08.Edwards Lifesciences tumbled 14 per cent to $92.30 in after-market trading as the maker of cardiovascular equipment said sales for the third quarter would fall short of market expectations.During market hours, the S&P 500 healthcare sector dropped 0.1 per cent as Wall Street braced for the start of what is expected to be the poorest US quarterly earnings period since late 2009.The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.35 per cent to 1,455.88, coming off a week that saw equities rise to their best intraday level for the year.Alcoa shares closed 0.3 per cent higher to $9.12 as the economic bellwether prepared to start the third-quarter reporting season with its results on Tuesday. Its results will be followed by two of the nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, later in the week.Wells Fargo lost 0.1 per cent to $35.81, while JPMorgan Chase fell 0.1 per cent to $41.66. The S&P 500 financial sector declined 0.1 per cent.Analysts have forecast that company earnings for the three-month period to September will register their first negative result in 11 quarters. On Monday, some investors wondered whether the situation could worsen after the third-quarter results have been reported.Sam Stovall, equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said: “The primary focus of participants on company conference calls, in our opinion, will be finding out if third-quarter results will indeed be the trough in this earnings cycle and if forward quarters will exhibit a gradual acceleration in growth.”He added: “The strong performances of the S&P 500 and its sectors since June, in which the [index] gained more than 11 per cent in price, led by the cyclical sectors at the expense of the defensive ones, may be a preamble to the coming turn in the earnings tide.”Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 0.2 per cent to 5,057.055. Two of its constituents, FedEx and UPS, have already warned that their results for the full year will be worse than initially expected. FedEx shares dropped 0.1 per cent to $86.37, while UPS rose 0.9 per cent to $73.76.In what many consider a sign of the macroeconomic difficulties challenging many US companies, the Dow Transports have gained just 0.7 per cent since the start of the year. That compares with a 15.8 per cent rise in the S&P 500 in the same period.The S&P 500’s gains have been bolstered by constituents such as Apple, which is up more than 58 per cent since the start of the year.Apple shares, however, were 2.2 per cent lower at $638.16 as information technology stocks were among the day’s worst performing sector groups and lost 1.1 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.8 per cent to 3,112.35, but Netflix shares continued to gain momentum. It rose 10.5 per cent to $73.52 as analysts at Morgan Stanley said that its shares were undervalued.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 13,583.65.American Express shares rose 0.4 per cent to $58.82. The payment services company said on Monday it would team with Walmart to provide lower-income customers who may not have a bank account with a prepaid debit card. Walmart shares closed 0.2 per cent higher at $75.25.

Westside is a megachurch in Lenaxa, Kansas, home of United Parcel Service and 50,000 people. No tour of the heartland would be complete without a bit of Jesus, so on Sunday I drove out to fill my cup.Foreigners often leave the US with a sense of paradox: how can a country combine religious tolerance with religious intensity? Few others manage it. Charles Dickens, for example, preferred the more open Boston preachers to the stuffy Anglicans back home. Yet he noted the New World’s fervour, too. “Wherever religion is resorted to, as a strong drink, and as an escape from the dull monotonous round of home, those of its ministers who pepper the highest will be the surest to please.”In the last few decades the nature of American belief has changed in subtle and important ways, as documented by the Harvard professor Robert Putnam in his book American Grace. Overall, in the past few decades, church attendance has fallen, though it is still much higher than in Europe. (Incidentally, my favourite fact from the book is that America has a higher per capita attendance of weekly services than Iran.)But significantly, at least in an election year, since 1990 religiosity has dropped off among Democrats and increased among Republicans. “We saw a sharp increase in correlation between your politics and your religion … that, historically, is not normal,” Mr Putnam told the Stanford Daily. In Kansas, this is writ large in state politics. Sam Brownback, the governor, is a poster boy for religious conservatism and the last set of primaries for the state congress saw his acolytes win big.One less remarked aspect of American religion, however, is its capitalistic qualities. The separation of church and state could be considered the federal government’s first and best piece of regulation. Without an established church, the religious market is about as free as it gets. Megachurches such as Westside are a direct consequence of this arrangement: commercially savvy houses of worship that market the word of God in a way that appeals to the lives of modern Americans.Shaun Collins, a South African who married a Kansas gal and found God aged 29 after He saved him from “being such a screw-up, man”, shows me around the vast space. Wrists ringed in friendship bracelets, Mr Collins, one of the nine members of the church’s leadership council, has the demeanour and appearance of a guy who has spent a lot of time on a beach.We see Reef, the pre-school play area with a nautical theme. Upstairs, elementary school children have Rock, a chill-out zone with a craggy façade. Colouring books feature a young girl kneeling next to a bed: “I can follow Jesus by praying to God.” Tweens have their own room. Their theme this month is “individuality”, or “how to find yourself through God and Jesus”. (Irony is in short supply in megachurches.)I grab a cup of Joe at the coffee shop and head into the nave. Inside, it looks like a conference hall or a large modern lecture theatre. There are about 3,000 seats, three cameramen, a sound box, a stage Mick Jagger could happily strut on and two big television screens.I listen to a middle-of-the-road band for a middle-of-the-road crowd in the middle of the country. The congregation is casually dressed, nearly all white. The band’s lead singer begins with a pitch to those “who might be looking for a new church” and asks all those here for the first time to leave their email and telephone details. A basket is circulated for the donation of tithe.The music is solid enough, though the lyrics would shame admirers of the King James Bible – “He is jealous for me; loves like a hurricane and I am a tree.” Once the band departs, Pastor Troy Sutherland takes the stage. Dressed in black trousers and a jalapeno coloured t-shirt, Mr Sutherland paces around as if he is at a TED conference. Self-improvement, another boom industry, is at the heart of the sermon.“We are purpose-driven note takers,” Mr Sutherland says, making a reference to Mr Warren, the Colorado preacher who has written several bestselling self-help books, including The Purpose Driven Life, and who spoke at Barack Obama’s inauguration.I have turned up halfway though a 40-day event, like a tardy animal on Noah’s starboard side. 40 Days In The Word is designed by Mr Warren to help people turn Christian teaching into action. An acrostic pops up on the big TV screens. S.O.A.P: scripture, observation, application and prayer. “The purpose of Bible study is not knowledge. The purpose of Bible study is action,” Mr Sutherland tells us, imploring me to be nicer to my neighbour.After the service, I ask Mr Carroll about the finances of the church. It has an annual budget of $5m, all raised through tithes. “Twenty per cent of the churchgoers donate 80 per cent of the money.” There are 30 full-time members of staff, including the nine-member leadership council (“there isn’t a CEO”) and 40 part-time workers. They are the “prayer ninjas” who go out into the Lenaxa community to run Bible-study groups. However, Mr Carroll scoffs at the idea that the church is geared to expand its “market share”. “We are an aircraft carrier, not a cruise ship”, he says, implying that people should use this house of God to spread the message.He introduces me to Jason Morris, a father of three in his early 30s, who runs the “online church”. The band and Mr Sutherland are live-streamed over the internet to about 1,500 people across the world. Pakistan is the single-biggest source of viewers, Mr Morris says. While the show happens, he is instant-messaging with the virtual congregation. If one wants, one can enter a 1:1 chatroom with a Westfield preacher.Mr Morris explains that the church buys Google adverts next to sinful searches, such as pornography addiction, depression and alcoholism. A team of “Twitter snipers” trolls the social network for locals who can’t quite make the trip to Westside. “So if some guy tweets, ‘dude, I’m so hungover, there’s no way I’ve going to church,’ then we can invite him to the online service.” For all the talk this election season about data mining and targeting, it’s worth remembering that the church does this, too.As an atheist, I find churches – particularly the mega ones – unsettling. The way Westside markets itself to children is cute and clever but it also offers little chance for kids to make up their own minds about belief. Nevertheless, it is impossible to understand America without appreciating the ubiquity of church in heartland life. But if you think the Bible belt is full of mad preachers talking in tongues in wooden shacks, correct your view – Westside is more like it. It has savvy marketing, is data-driven and is tailored to you. Much like the rest of American capitalism.John McDermott, executive comment editor of the FT, is touring the American heartlands for the 2012 US presidential election"
155;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-10-07T16:03:55Z;Slowdown set to take toll on US earnings;;The slowdown in the global economy and anaemic US recovery is expected to result in one of the worst US quarterly earnings seasons since late 2009.Analysts expect earnings for the period ended September to decline, the first negative result after 11 consecutive quarters of gains.Energy and materials companies are tipped to lead the downturn with the financial sector set to be one of the few bright spots.Wall Street analysts expect third-quarter earnings per share for S&P 500 companies will fall 2.7 per cent versus the same quarter a year ago, according to FactSet. Just three months ago analysts had forecast growth of 1.9 per cent.In the past three months, warnings from large companies about reduced full-year profits due to global economic weakness fuelled this pessimistic view.FedEx and UPS, often seen as barometers for world economic health, cut their full-year guidance during their last earnings releases, citing the slowdown in global trade.In August, talking to the Financial Times, the chief executive of Caterpillar, bellwether of the industrial economy, warned of the greater uncertainty about global growth, predicting it could take another five years before Europe’s economy begins to grow.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, said: “We expect corporate profits will be negative and revenues soft, as the global slowdown and below average economic growth in the US has affected companies.”The earnings season starts with Alcoa reporting on Tuesday, followed by JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on Friday.However, downbeat earnings expectations are yet to weigh on the broad market with the S&P 500 up more than 16 per cent so far this year. Stock prices are being supported by the Federal Reserve buying large amounts of bonds, which lowers interest rates and boosts the attractiveness of riskier assets such as equities.“If we see that the markets do not correct even after earnings disappoint and guidance gets worse, then it will be clear that fundamentals have given way to the Fed,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.Equity investors are also looking beyond the most recent quarter toward the final quarter of the year given the expectation that profits will rebound. S&P 500 companies are on course for record cash profits for 2012.That outlook may suffer from downward revisions should companies express caution about their future earnings in their results in the coming weeks.“Even with lowered expectations, earnings could disappoint and place stocks under pressure,” said Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management. “It’s worrying to see the warnings from Fed Ex and other weakness from the transport sector that suggests this will not be a good quarter.”Financials are expected to be one of the few bright spots with analysts expecting earnings growth for the quarter of 10 per cent according to FactSet.Ahead of earnings season, companies tend to downplay expectations and look to surprise the market with better results.“We expect more upside surprises in the third quarter, primarily because consumer health is in a good shape and with 80 per cent of companies tied to consumers their earnings will be better than the consensus estimate,” said Phil Orlando, chief equities strategist at Federated.
156;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-09-24T19:12:01Z;Earnings fears shadow Commerzbank;;Concern over Commerzbank’s earnings outlook prompted investors to sell its shares on Monday.Analysts at Nomura downgraded their rating on the German lender’s shares from “neutral” to “reduce”, lowering their target price from €1.57 to €1.30.The shares fell 3.7 per cent to €1.52, against a 0.5 per cent fall across the wider Xetra Dax index to 7,413.16.“Given our continued negative outlook on earnings trends relative to consensus, and our view that the sector is now only slightly undervalued on fundamentals, we downgrade the stock,” the analysts said.In France, Crédit Agricole lost ground on news that its Greek subsidiary may need another €600m to €700m injection before it can be sold off, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal citing people close to the sales process. In August Jean-Paul Chifflet, chief executive, said the lender had received bids from three Greek banks for its lossmaking Emporiki Bank and speculated that a deal could be done “in a matter of weeks”.The lender is keen to offload its Greek asset that made a loss of €370m in the second quarter, contributing to a 67 per cent fall in net profits year on year.The shares slipped 2.4 per cent to €5.71, while the French CAC 40 index fell 1 per cent to 3,497.22.News that the chief executive of TNT Express, the world’s fourth-largest delivery company, was stepping down prompted selling of its stock.The Dutch express delivery group said Marie-Christine Lombard would leave “to pursue an external career opportunity”, but where she was going was “a complete mystery”.The unexpected move comes amid a Brussels inquiry into a planned €5bn acquisition of the company by UPS. The shares slid 2.6 per cent to €8.21, against a 0.7 per cent fall across the AEX index to 331.84.Reports that Fiat would hold off on its European investment plans until the market recovered appeared to buoy investors, making it one of the best performing stocks across Europe. Sergio Marchionne, chief executive, met with Italian prime minister Mario Monti over the weekend at the request of the government on concerns that the carmaker would move its production outside Italy.The shares rallied 2.5 per cent to €4.60, against a 0.8 per cent fall across the FTSE MIB index to 15,867.07. The wider FTSE Eurofirst 300 slipped 0.3 per cent to 1,115.76.
157;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
158;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-09-24T09:23:57Z;TNT Express chief executive steps down;;The chief executive of Dutch express delivery company TNT Express, Marie-Christine Lombard, is to leave the group as Brussels probes its planned acquisition by UPS, its US rival.TNT Express, the world’s fourth-largest delivery company, accepted a €5bn takeover offer from UPS in March, but the deal has been delayed by a European Commission investigation into whether it would harm competition.The company said Ms Lombard was leaving “to pursue an external career opportunity”, though the exact nature of this was “a complete mystery” and she had not disclosed her new position to anyone inside the company.The group added that it would hold Ms Lombard to the non-compete clause of her contract and that she would not receive a special departure package.Ms Lombard was head of the express division of the former TNT for seven years before becoming chief executive when the unit was spun off as TNT Express in 2011. She has faced criticism for lacking sufficient strategic vision and for slowness in turning around the company’s lossmaking operations in Brazil.Bernard Bot, chief financial officer, will take over as chief executive on an interim basis.Antony Burgmans, chair of TNT Express’s supervisory board, said it was “regrettable that [Ms Lombard] has decided to leave TNT Express now”.The commission’s so-called Phase 2 investigation into whether the UPS takeover damages competition is expected to conclude in December. Uncertainty over the review has driven the TNT Express share price well below UPS’s offer price of €9.50 a share.UPS is acquiring TNT Express largely for its extensive presence in Europe. Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, said in July that the merger could “reduce competition for the provision of the fastest express delivery services”. UPS and TNT Express are two of four so-called “integrators” in Europe, along with Federal Express and DHL, which combine broad air and road delivery networks.Analysts said Ms Lombard’s resignation was inconvenient for TNT Express but indicated nothing about the merger’s chances of approval.“Of course there is uncertainty about the transaction with UPS, but I don’t think the resignation of Marie-Christine Lombard has changed anything about that,” said Maarten Bakker of ABN Amro.But shares in TNT Express fell more than 4.5 per cent to €8.15 in morning trading on the Amsterdam exchange, against a 0.5 per cent drop in the AEX index.
159;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-09-14T20:28:48Z;Georgia on my mind;Atlanta has family homes in the heart of the city, a facet few American cities can boast about;In the 1936 civil war novel Gone With the Wind, author Margaret Mitchell described Atlanta as a town built by “pushy …restless, energetic people”.Today Atlanta, in the US state of Georgia, is a sprawling metropolis. Its skyline is a mix of modern and postmodern buildings, punctuated by impressive skyscrapers, mainly the product of the city’s unprecedented economic growth of the past 15 years. The city hosts many Fortune 500 companies, including UPS, Home Depot, Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines.Known as a “city of neighbourhoods”, there is no true city centre, with many residential areas and business districts having sprung up across the region. Atlanta is divided into 25 areas made up of 242 neighbourhoods. Interstate Highway 285 creates a 64-mile loop around the city, and Atlanta’s geography and real estate are divided between those inside and outside this perimeter. Those living inside trade off more expensive homes and higher taxes for a shorter commute.“Atlanta has lots of space – it just keeps on going,” said Sarah Kenagy, a proposal development co-ordinator at Care USA. “There are very few places in America where you can own a family home right in the heart of a city. Atlanta is one of them.”Kenagy owns a two-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Candler Park, about two miles east of Atlanta’s downtown business district. The neighbourhood, popular with those looking for true in-town living, features quaint bungalows and craftsman-style homes on tree-lined streets.For those who choose to live further out, a car is essential. Payson Schwin, a strategic marketing and business development manager at Ericsson, who lives in the Oakhurst neighbourhood, says: “Traffic is very bad and the metro doesn’t stretch to enough places. There isn’t a transit system that is good enough for the average commuter.”The US census shows that Atlanta’s population jumps 62 per cent during the day thanks to commuters. The Beltline, a 22-mile loop around the city connecting more than 40 neighbourhoods with walking trails, parks and, eventually, by either light rail or streetcars, was expected to improve connections, but the project has been dogged by funding issues that are likely to prolong congestion problems.Schwin chose to move to his four-bedroom, family home in the Atlanta suburb known for its arts scene, coffee shops and speciality stores, and for its good schools – the top priority for Atlantans.“In Atlanta you are limited by school districts,” he says. “You can get cheaper housing in other neighbourhoods, but I would like to have children in the future. Also, property values hold over time in neighbourhoods with good schools,” he said.Atlanta was one of the cities hit hardest during the housing market collapse that accompanied the financial crisis. Home prices are 30 per cent below their 2006 peaks and have only recently shown signs of recovery.Janice Quinn, an estate agent at Coldwell Banker, said: “Prices are stabilising. I deal a lot in the luxury market and while the number of showings I have are not the same as before, the buyers are still out there. Now is definitely the time to buy if you have the money.”Quinn says the highest demand is in Buckhead, Garden Hills and Dunwoody in the north, where there are good schools.Among Coldwell Banker’s listings in the area is 2081 Dellwood Drive, a $599,000 three-bedroom, three- bathroom family home, a short walk from Memorial Park. More expensive properties, such as 508 Peachtree Battle Avenue, a four-bedroom, four-bathroom renovated home with heated pool valued at $2.47m, are also listed.While the north of the city is fairly affluent, and the far east and far west mainly industrial, the south side has many lower-income neighbourhoods and the airport. Founded as a railroad hub in 1837 and originally named Terminus, the city is now an airline nerve centre.Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta international airport has, since 2005, been the world’s busiest airport by passenger traffic and number of landings and take-offs, serving 89m passengers a year. Residents in and around the neighbourhood joke that they have to “hold grandma’s picture from falling off the shelf every time a plane takes off”, which happens once every 10 minutes on average, day and night.The state has offered tax incentives to film, television and digital entertainment companies, which has brought individuals such as Neal Holman, an art director, to the city. Holman, who paid $355,000 for a three-bedroom 2,900 sq ft home in the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, said the city offered an affordable standard of living to its residents and spoke highly of its arts and restaurant scene.East Atlanta offers affordable, spacious homes with big gardens, while neighbouring Grant Park, one of the city’s oldest neighbourhoods, is known for Victorian-era mansions, cottages and early 1900s bungalows. At Keller Williams Realty, 512 Park Avenue, a four-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Grant Park, is listed at $650,000.Until recently Atlanta placed little importance on the preservation of its historic architecture, and many venerable buildings were lost. Few structures survive that are older than the turn of the 20th century, with many buildings in the city’s skyline less than 30 years old. But while the city has antebellum roots, Atlanta looks and feels young and vibrant, a testament to its ability to reinvent itself.Despite the city’s constant upheaval and renewal, segregation between Atlanta’s black and white populations still remains. Atlanta is one of the US’s largest black-majority cities and has played a central role in the cultivation of black wealth, political power, education and culture.Peter Bade, agent at RE/MAX Metro Atlanta Cityside, said the city was still divided along income and colour lines. “Segregation is a hindrance to the city. The mindset of some people and lack of diversity in some neighbourhoods is not a good thing. But this is changing with time,” he said.……………………………………………………………..Buying guidePros● Climate● Relaxed pace of life● A well-connected airline hubCons● Good public-sector schools● Heavy traffic● Lack of diversity in some areasWhat you can buy for …$100,000 A one-bedroom condo$1m A three-bedroom home
160;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;FedEx earnings outlook cut sharply;;FedEx shares fell nearly 3 per cent in after-market trading after the world’s largest express parcel service by revenues sharply cut its guidance on earnings for its just-completed first quarter, citing global economic weakness.FedEx and UPS, its rival express package delivery company, are often seen as barometers for world economic health because of their role in facilitating goods movements worldwide.The company downgraded its guidance for earnings during the quarter to August 31 to $1.37 to $1.43 per diluted share, against its previous guidance of $1.45 to $1.60. Last year’s first-quarter earnings were $1.46.“Earnings during the quarter were lower than originally forecast, as weakness in the global economy constrained revenue growth at FedEx Express more than expected in the earlier guidance,” the company said.The announcement – made after the New York market close on Tuesday – sent the shares down to $84.80 or 3.1 per cent. Shares in UPS also fell by 2 per cent to $72.21.FedEx in June had already sounded pessimistic when announcing its fourth-quarter results– for the three months to May 31. It said then that it was seeking to cut costs after it announced a 1.4 per cent year-on-year fall in quarterly profits and a fall in volumes. It warned that global economic uncertainty – including the eurozone crisis and slowing growth in Asia – could hit its results for the present year.FedEx gave no details as to which area’s weakness had depressed the first-quarter results but most international companies have reported much the biggest slow-down in demand in Europe as a result of the euro crisis. FedEx has around 10 per cent of the European express parcel market, behind DHL, the market leader, and TNT Express, which UPS is in the course of acquiring. FedEx is number two in the Asian express parcel market, behind DHL.FedEx and UPS together are some of the most important forces in the US domestic parcel market.Express parcel operators can be particularly sensitive to any market downturn because of their important role in replenishing the stocks of companies that find inventories suddenly lower. When inventories start to grow during a slowdown, demand for express services to replenish them can fall sharply.FedEx said it had not yet closed its books for the quarter and that it would make further information available on September 18, when it published its quarterly results. In June, FedEx announced net income for the year to May 31 of $2.03bn on $42.7bn revenue.
161;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-08-28T15:47:51Z;Chinese banks step up lending in the US;;China’s top banks are stepping up their lending activities in the US as large US companies diversify their funding sources and seek to penetrate more deeply into the world’s second-largest economy.Chinese banks’ share of US syndicated lending has risen to 6.1 per cent of the total market so far in 2012, up from 5.1 per cent last year, according to data from Dealogic. So far this year, the total value of syndicated loans from Chinese banks into the US has reached $51bn.Liao Qiang, Chinese banking analyst at Standard & Poor’s, said: “Many global banks have been deleveraging as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis and the debt crisis in Europe. Their retreat in lending markets provides opportunities for Chinese banks to deepen relationships with the multinational companies and steadily increase their international presence.”The increased syndicated lending by Chinese banks comes as their balance sheets compare favourably with US counterparts.Standard & Poor’s last year upgraded the long term credit ratings of Bank of China and China Construction Bank from A- to A. The credit rating agency maintained the rating of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) at A. At the same time, the long-term credit ratings of Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were cut to A-.Among the latest deals, Bank of China is involved in a $1.4bn syndicated loan to Zimmer Holdings, the medical device company, and Bank of East Asia is part of a $575m loan syndication to Constellation Brands, the wine and beer group.Industrial and Commercial Bank of China took part in an $11.8bn syndicated loan for Walmart, the US retailer.Bi Mingqiang, general manager of ICBC’s New York branch, said the bank was seeking long-term lending relationships with US companies which had a presence in China and elsewhere. The bank provides credit to United Parcel Service, Pfizer and Dell.UPS said linking with a Chinese bank had made it easier to conduct business in renminbi, while Dell said it had developed relationships with Chinese banks for the same reason.CCB’s clients include General Electric, and the bank has also had discussions with Caterpillar, Walt Disney, Tiffany and Cargill.John Weinshank, head of corporate banking at CCB, added that lending was only a starting point to extend into other businesses, such as deposit and trade finance.CCB’s lending business in the US has risen from $600m in 2009 to $2bn this year, while ICBC, which established a New York branch in 2008, had made more than $1.3bn of loans to US companies at the end of 2011 compared with zero at the start of 2009.Last year, ICBC, Bank of China and China Merchant Bank participated in a $6bn syndicated loan to Duke Energy – the first time the North Carolina-based energy group borrowed money from Chinese banks.“There’s a global relocation of capital from the west to the east. This is an evolution process,” said Mr Weinshank. “Nowadays, the Brics banks [in Brazil, Russia, India and China] have a seat at the table.”He said ratings upgrades of Chinese banks represented a turning point for large US companies to consider Chinese groups as lenders.
162;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-08-26T23:06:44Z;Courier service Shutl shifts up a gear;;The offices of Shutl, a new online courier service based in east London, would do well in a game of start-up bingo. No suits: check. Young, predominantly male staff: check. Small dog running round the office: check.“He’s our fearsome gatekeeper,” says Tom Allason, the founder and chief executive of the group, as he shuts the door on the excitable Hendryks, a two-year-old husky-poodle.Mr Allason is wearing a v-neck T-shirt, jeans with a tear in the thigh and flip-flops. He looks like a college dropout – mainly because he is one. A brief university career at Dartmouth, the Ivy League college in the US, ended after he became embroiled in a fake ID business. “I wasn’t doing anything morally wrong, just helping students drink,” he says.The 31-year-old’s company, which aggregates courier services, is the latest UK start-up to emerge from Silicon Roundabout, the cluster of tech and digital media businesses based in and around London’s Old Street.At Shutl, an algorithm matches orders with potential couriers based on cost, location, the courier’s user-generated rating and when the customer wants the item delivered – whether “ASAP” or during a specific window. The customer is then given a time and a price. Delivery often takes less than 90 minutes. Their record is just under 15 minutes.Since its first delivery in March 2010, Shutl’s growth has been rapid. Turnover is growing at about 50 per cent a month, according to Mr Allason, while annual sales are expected to reach seven figures this year. It is now attracting serious investor interest too.The investment arm of US logistics group UPS this week took a 6 per cent stake in the company, which made it the largest investor in Shutl’s latest $2m fundraising round. The start-up also received a cash injection from La Poste, the French post office, which now holds 6 per cent.UPS will provide advice to Shutl as it launches in the US early next year, helping in particular with client relationships. Dealing with big logistics firms is not constricting for either side, according to Mr Allason. “They don’t see us as competitors – they see us as complimentary,” he says. “We’re software, not logistics.”The prospect of affordable same-day delivery from companies such as eBay and Amazon has been forecast as another nail in the high street’s coffin. Shutl, however, has come to save the high street, rather than bury it.“We give the high street a competitive advantage over the ‘evil’ Amazon,” says Mr Allason, offering a tongue-in-cheek assessment of the US group’s reputation among rival retailers. “The cost of point-to-point [instant delivery] – taking a product from a warehouse in the middle of nowhere to somewhere – is prohibitively high at Amazon.”Shutl has attracted clients including big high street names Argos and Maplin.“Our proposition is brand. If we’re crap, [customers] won’t choose us,” says Mr Allason. All comments, good or bad, from customers are fed through live to the group’s website. It can make for sometimes brutal reading – “Fire bloody everyone involved in this debacle” wrote one aggrieved customer. But the pros outweigh for the cons. “[It] keeps us honest,” says Mr Allason. “It’s the best advertising we can do.”
163;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-08-22T10:07:48Z;UPS extends TNT Express offer;;American express delivery company UPS has extended its takeover offer for Netherlands-based TNT Express by 10 weeks while the European Commission reviews competition issues that could potentially derail the high-profile acquisition.UPS and TNT Express management reached agreement in March on a €5.16bn buyout deal at €9.50 per share. The move extends the closing date on the offer from August 31 to November 9.The Commission announced in July it was launching an in-depth review of the takeover bid, which could delay approval to the end of this year. It said it was concerned the deal would merge two so-called “integrators”, which possess air and road networks that allow them to offer a broad range of services.That would leave UPS, Germany’s DHL and America’s Federal Express as the only integrators in the European market. Joaquín Almunia, the competition commissioner, said the deal could “reduce competition for the provision of the fastest express delivery services, to the detriment of direct customers and ultimately of European consumers”.It is not clear how long the commission will take to complete the so-called Phase 2 review of the deal. A UPS spokesman said the company could not comment on whether the offer would be extended again if regulatory approval is not received before November 8.
164;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-08-10T20:15:02Z;Wearable devices aid UPS;;Growing demand among business customers for ‘real-time’ data that can be used to improve efficiency or help employees make better decisions is fuelling demand for a new class of technology tools – wearable technology.For example, last week UPS, the US parcels and logistics group, rolled out a new type of ‘wearable’ scanning system for employees that speeds up the loading of packages into vehicles and provides more accurate and timely tracking information for its customers.The new device, made by Motorola Solutions, the US electronics group spun off from the old Motorola group at the start of 2011, consists of a Bluetooth-enabled hands-free barcode scanner that is worn on a finger and a small terminal worn on the employee’s wrist or hip.The ‘ring’ imager or scanner, which fits over two fingers, represents a major advance over an earlier system used by UPS because, unlike the earlier equipment that required employees to press a ‘trigger’ in order to capture a barcode image, the new system includes label-sensing technology that automatically scans the barcode. This allows UPS employees to capture and process barcode images more quickly.Once the barcode image is captured, the ring scanner sends each package’s tracking information via Bluetooth to the terminal worn on the wrist or hip. The data are then transmitted over WiFi to the UPS facility network and ultimately to UPS’s global data centres to be stored and processed and made available for customers.“It really is a big improvement,” says Juan Perez, vice-president of information services. The improved technology enables UPS to accelerate the transfer of package tracking data to customers and improves reliability through the system. Internally referred to as ‘link and load’, the scans are key to providing the tracking data that feeds the 32.1m tracking requests viewed daily on UPS.com.Girish Rishi, corporate vice-president and general manager of mobile computing at Motorola Solutions, added: “The ring imager, in combination with our robust wireless network and wearable mobile computer, increases scanning efficiency and streamlines the barcode reading process, ultimately improving worker output and cost efficiencies.”By capturing the service level and destination ZIP codes embedded in a barcode, the system can also verify whether the package is being loaded into the proper trailer or air container. An audible and visible alert identifies any package that is about to be loaded incorrectly to help UPS avoid routing errors.UPS began using the new system based on Motorola’s RS507 Bluetooth ring imager last year and by the fourth quarter of 2013 all of its 1,383 facilities will be equipped with more than 38,000 such devices.IMS Research, a UK-based research firm, published a report this week estimating that 14m wearable devices were shipped last year and that by 2016 the market for wearable technology will be worth at least $6bn. To date, IMS noted there are relatively few wearable tech devices, mostly focused on the healthcare and medical, and fitness and wellness application areas.
165;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-08-05T16:18:48Z;Logistics groups at risk from bribery law;;Half of the world’s biggest logistics companies are putting themselves and customers at risk of prosecution under new UK bribery laws by failing to publish a complete draft of anti-corruption policies, according to data.Research by GoodCorporation, a business ethics consultancy, has found that only two in three big logistics groups have publicly outlined their approach to fighting bribery and half have no statement on illegal “facilitation payments” used to speed deliveries through customs.This is in spite of the sector being particularly exposed to the UK laws, which came into effect in July last year, extending the range of parties vulnerable to prosecution.“You have to do due diligence on partners, and logistics companies often don’t have the very basic documents,” says Michael Littlechild, a founder and director of GoodCorporation.Will Kenyon, a partner in the forensic services group at PwC, agrees: “Risk does not stop at the boundaries of your own organisations, and logistics companies’ raison d'être is to move goods on behalf of others.”He says companies using the likes of DHL, Federal Express and United Parcel Service may now be asking their logistics providers for assurances – including public statements and published policies – that appropriate anti-corruption steps are being taken.The UK has been at the forefront of anti-bribery efforts, with the law particularly strong in relation to facilitation payments. In logistics, however, “the payments are common practice if you don’t want your package sitting on the hot quayside collecting dust”, says Mr Littlechild.“They [logistics companies and their subcontractors] have daily interactions with customs officials, port authorities and individual representatives of government agencies of one sort or another whose influence far outweighs their salaries – and they’re obvious sources of risk,” says Mr Kenyon.Under the UK legislation, company directors may face fees and even prison sentences. Logistics groups are not alone in needing to take particular account of the new laws, but Mr Littlechild believes the sector has been slower to respond than its peers in oil and gas or construction.“I would be astonished if you found even one of the top 30 energy companies that didn’t have a code of ethics,” he said. “Logistics groups are worried about this gumming up their works and so they’re resisting putting them into place.”However, a study by Ernst & Young found the oil and gas industry accounted for 20 per cent of all UK bribery and graft prosecutions over the past four years.
166;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-08-02T17:32:25Z;Eurozone periphery banks lead declines;;European stocks fell after Mario Draghi’s press conference remarks. Banks on the eurozone’s periphery and in France led declines, just as they led the index higher in the wake of the ECB president’s comments last week.Crédit Agricole was off 8.0 per cent to €3.28 in Paris, UniCredit was down 7.3 per cent to €2.57 in Milan and Banco Popular lost 7.9 per cent to €1.41 in Madrid. Commerzbank fell 6.2 per cent to €1.20 in Berlin for the biggest fall on the Dax.The statement sent markets lower because “it signals that it will take some time for the ECB’s action to materialise. In effect the fastest institution in the eurozone has tied itself to one of the slowest,” wrote Nick Kounis of ABN Amro.The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 1.2 per cent to 1,055.34, erasing gains of as much as 1 per cent following Mr Draghi’s comments. Spain’s Ibex was off 5.2 per cent at 6,373.4 and Italy’s FTSE MIB lost 4.6 per cent to 13,282.55.Veolia Environnement was the heaviest faller on the Eurofirst 300 after the French utility missed expectations.The shares fell 11.7 per cent to €8.15 after the French provider of waste, water and energy services said it would be cutting more investment and costs to deal with a worsening economy in Italy and France. The company’s waste and recycling businesses were hit by a slowdown in industrial production.Bank of America downgraded the shares to “neutral”, citing weak trends in underlying earnings and uncertainty over possible writedowns.In Paris the CAC 40 lost 2.7 per cent to 3,232.46 and all its constituents fell. Germany’s Xetra Dax index slid 2.2 per cent to 6,606.09.Rising demand in Asia led Deutsche Post to lift its target for 2012 profit by about €100m.The upbeat note from the provider of DHL services contrasted with more gloomy statements recently from UPS and FedEx. Volume for its most expensive and profitable service, international guaranteed-time delivery, rose 9.1 per cent. The shares gained 2.3 per cent to €15.02.Emerging market demand also lifted Beiersdorf, the German maker of Nivea beauty products. The rise helped mitigate a 4 per cent fall in demand in its main consumer products division from western Europe, a trend seen at rivals Henkel and Unilever. The shares gained 7.6 per cent to €57.17.
167;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-08-01T18:20:55Z;Europe and Asia weakness dents US revenues;;US corporate revenue growth slowed considerably in the second quarter due to weakness in Europe and Asia and a strong dollar.While the US economy is growing at a sluggish 1.5 per cent with unemployment still stuck above 8 per cent, most companies missing revenue estimates blamed Europe’s fiscal crisis and austerity measures as well as stuttering growth in emerging markets, notably Asia and Latin America.The consensus estimate of second-quarter revenue growth had been trimmed from a projected 4.9 per cent at the beginning of the year to 4.7 per cent at the beginning of April. However, as the reporting period has progressed, analysts have revised their estimates further downward to an average 0.9 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters.Less than half of companies to have reported second-quarter numbers performed better than expected. The number of companies beating revenue estimates has dropped below 50 per cent in only four other quarters: the first quarter of 2001, the fourth quarter of 2008, and the first two quarters of 2009.The situation in Europe, which by some estimates accounts for about 15 per cent of all revenues for S&P 500 companies, has not bypassed even Apple. The iPhone-maker’s revenues of $35bn missed analysts’ consensus estimate by $2.15bn, mostly because of poor European sales. The challenges of a global slowdown were compounded by the strong dollar, which has appreciated by 10 per cent against the euro in five months and is within a whisker of a two-year high.The 8 per cent rise in the dollar trade-weighted index is broadly consistent with US exports falling at an annual rate of about 5 per cent, according to Capital Economics.That has hit US companies with large international businesses. Dow Chemical cited a $400m currency effect in their 10 per cent European sales decline. McDonald’s, the largest restaurant chain by sales, also blamed lower revenues on foreign currency translation, which cost the company 7 cents per share.Industrial bellwethers including United Technologies, UPS, Ford, Eaton and Du Pont cut their full-year earnings outlooks. Caterpillar and Honeywell also cut sales outlooks, warning of slow growth ahead, but raised their profit forecasts.The fact that many companies maintained profits while revenues have fallen suggests that they were able to cut costs and reduce inventories. But if the top line continues to fall, cutting costs will not be a panacea.“We want to see these companies coming with both top-line and bottom-line growth,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “You can keep growing through cost cutting and productivity growth for only so long.”Additional reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues
168;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-07-30T14:02:41Z;TNT Express posts improved earnings;;Dutch delivery company TNT Express posted second-quarter earnings and profits that were sharply higher than last year, thanks to better than expected business in Europe and Asia, a turnround at its Brazilian subsidiary and a weaker euro.The results gave shareholders some good news after the announcement this month of a delay to its takeover by US logistics group UPS, which will face added scrutiny by the European competition commission.Earnings before interest and taxes rose 67 per cent on a year earlier to €77m, while net profits jumped from €3m to €39m. Revenues grew 1.7 per cent to €1.83bn in nominal terms, but were 1.8 per cent lower taking exchange rate effects into account.Marie-Christine Lombard, chief executive, said the company had responded to “an increasingly challenging economic environment” with “cost savings and revenue-enhancement initiatives”.TNT Express saw overall volume grow slightly in Europe compared with a year ago, despite the recession. Shipments in Asia declined more than 10 per cent, but the company limited the impact by leasing out several of its aircraft to cut costs.Revenues in the Americas grew 6 per cent after adjusting for exchange rates, but operations there still lost €24m, down from a €32m loss in the second quarter last year. Ms Lombard has promised to turn a profit by the end of 2012 at the company’s troubled Brazilian subsidiary, which has leaked money since a botched acquisition in 2010.The company offered medium-term guidance of increasing revenues in Europe while raising operating margins from 4 per cent to 10-11 per cent.But it offered few details on expectations for its merger deal with UPS, struck in March. The European Commission announced two weeks ago that the merger would face an extended “Phase II” review due to concerns that it might create a dominant player in some markets.TNT Express has scheduled an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting for August 6 to approve the merger, but the two companies now expect the legal delays to prolong the merger until at least the fourth quarter of this year.UPS’s takeover offer of €9 a share has essentially put a ceiling on the price. Shares in TNT Express were steady at €8.83 in morning Amsterdam trading, against a 0.7 per cent rise in the AEX index.
169;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;US equities lower on eurozone concerns;;US equities ended the day significantly lower and the bearish sentiment was compounded after Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the S&P 500 missed analysts’ estimates.Apple shares fell more than 4.5 per cent to $572.08 in after-hours trading after reporting earnings of $9.32 per share against consensus forecast of $10.32.The drastic fall dragged down the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures, pointing to a sharply lower open on Wednesday.US stocks on Tuesday declined for the third day in a row, with the S&P 500 index down 1 per cent to 1,338.32, the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 1 per cent to 12,617.32, and the Nasdaq Composite index 1 per cent lower at 2,862.99DeVry fell the hardest of all US stocks on Tuesday after the for-profit education company revealed higher-than-expected operating costs and weakening student enrolment.The company also reported that it would cut more than 500 jobs, more than 5 per cent of its workforce.The stock, which has already lost nearly 70 per cent of its market capitalisation in the past 12 months, plummeted 24.5 per cent to $20.80 on Tuesday.“DeVry’s negative June quarter earnings pre-announcement serves as further confirmation, as if it were needed, of the ongoing fundamental pressures in the education space,” said Peter Appert, analyst at Piper Jaffray.“Particularly noteworthy was the company’s acknowledgment of increased tuition discounting and significant further margin compression,” he added. “We expect to hear more of the same as industry results are reported over the next several weeks.”Other for-profit education providers also traded lower. Direct rival Apollo Group declined 3.8 per cent to $27.81, while the Washington Post Company, which owns Kaplan, the online degree provider, slid 3.3 per cent to $343.84.Commenting after the latest set of US earnings, Stuart Freeman, chief equities strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said: “While international growth remains soft, we believe a slow recovery in Europe and continuing early signs of a domestic housing recovery have the potential to boost the domestic economy into a late-cycle stage of growth that supports another leg of the current cyclical bull market.”But nervousness on Wall Street was reflected by the CBOE Vix index, a measure of implied volatility, which jumped more than 25 per cent in the past two sessions.All sectors closed in negative territory with losses led by telecommunications, materials and energy stocks.Peabody Energy slumped 11.2 per cent to $20.55 after the company failed to meet expectations and cut back its third-quarter outlook. The coal producer has shed 66 per cent of its market capitalisation over the past 12 months.AT&T, the largest US telecoms company by revenues, reported an 8.7 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings, beating analyst estimates, but the stock fell 2.12 per cent to $34.63.In contrast, wireless provider MetroPCS was among the leaders on Wall Street, rising 5.6 per cent to $6.59.In technology news, investors responded warily to the announcement that VMware, one of the fastest growing software companies, will make a $1.3bn cash and stock purchase of Nicira Networks, a Silicon Valley start-up. The deal has been likened to Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram.“While this is a high price tag for a company with minimal revenues today, we believe this is a very smart strategic move that positions VMware well to gain a major foothold into the fertile software-defined networking area,” said Daniel Ives of FRB Capital Markets who views the purchase favourably.“They paid a lot. It does add some acquisition risk that investors will have to digest,” he added.VMware closed fractionally down at $88.89.Direct rival Cisco Systems dropped 6 per cent to $15.12 after it announced a plan to lay off 1,300 staff – about 2 per cent of its global workforce. Another VMware rival, Juniper Networks, slipped 2.7 per cent to $14.81.Lexmark, the printer manufacturer, fell 12.8 per cent to $16.77 after failing to meet earnings estimates. In the year to date the company is down just shy of 50 per centIn other earnings news, DuPont, one of the world’s largest chemical manufacturers, slipped 2 per cent to $47.74 after it reported decreased profits in the second quarter.Investors responded to the news that the company, which has been hit by global economic woes, might not meet analyst expectations for its full-year earnings.“We think second-quarter 2012 earnings were better than investor expectations, although a more cautious outlook may leave investors less satisfied,” said PJ Juvekar of Citi Research.The response to Altria’s earnings report was muted. Shares in the maker of Marlboro cigarettes traded down 0.2 per cent at $35.57, although the stock price has risen more than 30 per cent over the past 12 months.UPS, an international bellwether, dropped 4.6 per cent to $74.34 after the package delivery company’s second-quarter results missed Wall Street estimates.Netflix shares dropped sharply in after-hours trade, falling more than 14 per cent to $80.39, after the internet video streaming company released its second-quarter results and gave cautious guidance about the third quarter.
170;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;UPS cuts outlook on global slowdown;;UPS, the bellwether package delivery company, has cut its 2012 profit forecast, blaming worries among its customers that the US economy is slowing.The company reported second-quarter results on Tuesday that missed analysts’ estimates largely as a result of weakness in its international operations. However, the concerns over the US outlook prompted the cut to the profit outlook.“Economies around the world are showing signs of weakening and our customers are increasingly nervous,” Scott Davis, chief executive, told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday.He said slowing demand from UPS business customers indicated that expectations for the US economy might still be too bullish.“We think current second-half economic forecasts for the US are too high and that GDP growth will likely be closer to 1 per cent,” he said.Mr Davis said many of UPS’s business customers were concerned about the risks from the “fiscal cliff”– a set of spending cuts and tax increases set to kick in at the end of the year.Analysts and executives have warned that some businesses are holding back on hiring and new investment for fear that demand will drop sharply, all of which would risk sending the US back into recession.“As we get closer to the fiscal cliff, there is more uncertainty out there than ever,” Mr Davis said.The company cut its forecast for full-year earnings about 5 per cent to between $4.50 and $4.70 a share, down from an earlier estimate of $4.75 to $5.00 a share. The new range represents an increase of 3 to 8 per cent over 2011 adjusted results.In the three months ending June 30, net income rose 2.2 per cent to $1.12bn, or $1.15 a share, from $1.09bn, or $1.09 a share, a year ago. That was below Wall Street forecasts of $1.17 a share.UPS stock close down 4.6 per cent at $74.35 on Tuesday in New York.Ben Hartford, analyst at Robert W. Baird, said: “Certainly the weakness that we’re seeing in the domestic US economy is consistent with other transports’ second-quarter reporting. We saw it with FedEx, we saw it with domestic truckers. That’s clearly the near-term headwind that UPS is facing.”Revenue of $13.35bn was 1.2 per cent higher than last year’s $13.19bn but missed analysts’ expectations of $13.7bn.The results showed a sharp divergence between UPS’s domestic and international businesses in the quarter.Revenue from the US package segment rose 4 per cent to $8.1bn as Americans sent more parcels. UPS said most of the improvement was driven by ecommerce businesses shipping to residential customers.However, business-to-business shipping, which makes up about 60 per cent of UPS’s revenues, has been slowing as companies have grown more cautious over the state of the US economy, said Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer.International package revenue dropped 4 per cent to $3bn as growth in intra-European exports was offset by double-digit declines in Asian exports to the US and Europe.UPS’s supply chain and freight business was also hit by slower international demand and by lower prices.
171;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Brussels investigates UPS-TNT deal;;The European Commission has launched an in-depth investigation into UPS’s €5.2bn takeover bid for TNT Express, citing concern about a “very high combined market share” for parcel services.The US package delivery company last week admitted that a deal with its European rival would require a full review from Brussels, which could stretch the clearance process until the end of this year.But the relatively strong Commission statement following its preliminary assessment is a potential setback, raising the spectre of a difficult ride in Brussels to win a regulatory green light.The initial review highlighted that the deal may harm competition in the small parcel delivery service in “numerous member states”, especially in international express services.“The small package delivery sector is of strategic importance for various other industries in Europe,” said Joaquín Almunia, the EU competition commissioner. “The proposed acquisition could in particular reduce competition for the provision of the fastest express delivery services, to the detriment of direct customers and ultimately of European consumers.”UPS and TNT are two out of four so-called “integrators” identified by the commission in Europe, which boast an air and road network that enables them to offer a broad range of services.Competition officials see small package delivery services as a “highly differentiated market” that can be broken into distinct parts, such as delivery times. After the merger, the commission is concerned that competition in some markets will only come from two other integrators: DHL, which is owned by Deutsche Post, and FedEx, the US group.“It appears that other integrators would be the only significant competitive constraint on the merged entity for most express services, especially for the fastest time-commitment deliveries,” the commission found.“As the proposed transaction would reduce the number of integrators competing in [Europe] from four to three, the competitive constraint on the merged entity would be significantly reduced. This would lead in many member states to a highly concentrated market for domestic and, even more so, international express delivery services.”The market definition will be pivotal for approval for a deal in such a networked industry, as strong concerns about a particular segment may be difficult to remedy by selling parts of the business. UPS has expressed confidence that it will win a green light.The Commission said it had until November 28 to decide whether to approve, block or clear the deal with concessions. This date can be extended if concessions are submitted.
172;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-07-18T17:10:08Z;US utilities fear approach of fiscal cliff;;The largest US utilities blitzed Capitol Hill this week to lobby for a deal to avert the effects of the “fiscal cliff” on their industry, warning that increases in tax rates on dividends could damage their normally steady shares and delay investments in the country’s electrical grid.Much of the political attention in the budgetary standoff – which could tip the US into recession at the beginning of next year – has been focused on scheduled hikes in Bush-era individual income tax rates, as well as reductions in the Pentagon budget.The “ fiscal cliff” refers to the simultaneous expiry of tax breaks with the introduction of tax increases and spending cuts at the end of 2012, the cumulation of which could push the US back into recession.Among the fallout – if Congress fails to take any action before December 31 – is a significant increase in taxation on investment income, with tax rates on capital gains increasing from 15 per cent to 20 per cent, and tax rates on dividends rising to 39.6 per cent for top earners.Adding a 3.8 per cent surtax on investment income for the wealthiest Americans – those with adjusted gross income (AGI) of more than $250,000 for joint filers and $200,000 for single filers – was part of the 2010 health reform law and takes effect next year. It means tax rates on capital gains would rise to 23.8 per cent, while those on dividends would increase to 43.4 per cent for the highest earners.That increase in taxes on dividends has alarmed companies with steady cash flows that pay a lot out to shareholders. These include blue-chip companies such as Verizon and UPS, as well as utilities, who have mounted the most aggressive lobbying campaign to stop it happening.Top executives from the electrical sector held meetings with groups of lawmakers from both parties on Tuesday to persuade them to reach an agreement that would keep dividend rates low. “We realised that we need to do a lot more education,” says Brian Wolff of the Edison Electric Institute, the chief lobby group for the industry.The main argument made by the sector is that investors could start dumping their stocks as the deadline approaches – causing volatility and damage to both the stock market value of the companies and the portfolios of retirees who rely on electrical companies as a safe haven in tumultuous markets.They believe there could be a rush to riskier “growth” stocks compared to dividend-paying stocks if the current parity in tax treatment of capital gains and dividends is not maintained.Daniel Ford, a utilities analyst at Barclays, estimated that if dividend tax rates were raised to 25 per cent, it would hit the valuation of the sector’s companies by about 6 per cent.Michael Yackira, chief executive of NV Energy, a Nevada-based electrical company, said that “you’re going to see some roiling” in the sector’s stocks “if there is no clarity going into the election”.But Mr Yackira also makes a broader argument, saying that utilities themselves may have to hold back on capital investments and infrastructure upgrades given the uncertainty over the tax treatment of dividends next year.The alarm in the sector may be exaggerated, since utilities were still investing before the dividend tax cuts, and returns on utility stocks may still be attractive in a low interest rate environment even if tax rates go up.But their efforts seem to be having a modest impact. This week, Senate Democrats agreed to set the dividend rate to 20 per cent – equating it with the rate on capital gains – in their plan to avoid the fiscal cliff.However, there is not much optimism that a bipartisan deal to avoid the worst-case scenario will be reached before the election. Over the past week, the leaderships of both the Republican and Democratic parties in Congress batted away the prospects for an early agreement.Patty Murray, the Democratic senator from Washington, who is in the party’s inner circle, suggested they would hold a tough line on requiring the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, which the Republicans refuse to accept. Ms Murray suggested Democrats would be willing to allow tax cuts to expire for all Americans if Republicans did not agree to more revenue.Meanwhile, John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said limits on tax breaks should not even be considered to offset some of the military cuts – which some members of his party have advocated..And the treatment of investment income is especially politically difficult to solve because the preferential rates on capital gains and dividends are largely what allowed Mitt Romney and Warren Buffett to pay lower income tax rates than some in the middle-class, which Democrats have seized on as unfair and Republicans see as a red herring.But there is definitely concern beginning to creep in, even beyond the utilities. “If you’re one of millions of older Americans who rely on dividends to supplement your income, brace yourself, “ wrote Carole Fleck, on a blog for the AARP, the largest association of retired Americans.
173;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;TNT-UPS deal delay hits PostNL shares;;Shares in Dutch postal company PostNL fell more than 5 per cent in early trading after express delivery firm TNT Express announced that a planned €5.15bn takeover by UPS would be delayed until the fourth quarter until it has passed an extended review by European competition authorities.PostNL owns a 29.9 per cent stake in TNT Express and shareholders had hoped that the UPS acquisition could lead to a near-term cash dividend based on its initial planned closing date of September 7.But TNT Express and UPS announced that they now expect the merger will require a so-called Phase II review by the European Commissioner for Competition, which can last up to 25 weeks. A Phase II review of the deal is likely to be “an unwelcome delay rather than a major risk” to the acquisition, wrote Gert Steens of SNS Securities in a note.UPS and TNT Express did not specify the reasons for the review. Rival express delivery company DHL has insisted that European authorities apply a high level of scrutiny to the merger, which will create a potent competitor for its own services in the European market.Besides the competition issues, UPS and TNT Express face challenges in arranging the handover of TNT Express’s airline when ownership transfers to UPS. The airline operates under a European licence, which as an American company UPS cannot inherit. TNT Express plans to spin the airline off as a separate company and subcontract its services but those plans are not yet finalised.PostNL shares were down 5.1 per cent at €3.21 in Amsterdam trading on Monday morning. TNT Express shares fell 1.76 per cent to €9.04.
174;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Deutsche Post;German mail and parcel company is a group of two halves;Deutsche Post shares have been moving faster than an overnight express package. The stock, which merely tracked the Euro Stoxx index for much of the past five years, began to fly last autumn. Today, the shares are up almost 60 per cent on early-October levels. Solid results have helped, with the German-based mail arm holding steady as internet shopping drives parcel business and the DHL express and logistics division delivering double-digit growth rates. Company forecasts have also been robust: group earnings before tax and interest are expected to reach €2.5bn-€2.6bn in 2012, and €3.4bn-€3.6bn by 2015. Last year, they were €2.4bn.The question for investors is how much of this optimism is now in the price – and what the downside risks may be. Essentially, Deutsche Post is a group of two halves. The German mail division still accounts for a quarter of revenues and has been a weak spot in the past. Europe’s malaise could cast a cloud over volume estimates. But, that said, ebit here has stabilised at over €1bn and the company believes that with more automation – and investment – this level can at least be maintained.The DHL business is more exciting, posting ebit of €1.7bn last year, which is projected to reach €2.7bn-€2.9bn by 2015. On the plus side, DHL is more exposed to Asia-Pacific than rivals such as UPS and FedEx. With new hubs in Shanghai and Hong Kong opening within days, it suggests that a third of revenues could come from this region by 2017 compared with a fifth today. On the minus, DHL’s volumes tend to mirror trends in global trade – so weakness there could hurt. The shares – 30 per cent of which are held by the German government – are now on a forward multiple of 11.5 times, still cheaper than peers’ but pricier than last autumn. They look solid enough medium-term, but perhaps more vulnerable to any disappointments.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
175;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-06-14T20:30:21Z;FedEx: going places;The group looks to be in a weak position but has carved out profitable niches;No wonder UPS’s latest advertising campaign slogan is “We love logistics”. Its pending $6.8bn tie-up with TNT Express will enhance the company at a time when global economic growth appears to be faltering – bad news for the cyclical logistics sector. UPS’s move also asks some awkward questions of rival FedEx, which faces being boxed out of parts of the European market.FedEx looks to be in a weak position. The company reporting its fiscal fourth-quarter 2012 results on Tuesday lacks the scale of its rivals in Europe. FedEx has about a 5 per cent share of the intra-European express market, compared with 18 per cent for TNTE, 14 per cent for UPS, and 16 per cent for DHL.But FedEx has built profitable niches focused on express air networks and intercontinental routes connecting Europe with Asia and the US. And FedEx is growing, opening dozens of pick-up and delivery stations in the region in recent months, and topping up organic growth with two small purchases in Poland and France.Moreover, the focus on Europe distracts investors from opportunities closer to home. The biggest medium-term boost for FedEx may come from restructuring the US portion of its $25bn express package operations, where volumes have declined slowly but steadily as customers have switched to cheaper FedEx services.FedEx has made some progress already. This month, it decided to accelerate the retirement of certain aircraft and analysts expect more detailed announcements, possibly involving headcount reductions and facility closures, in the autumn.The rewards could be substantial. In 2003, restructuring helped FedEx to double express margins as the economy picked up. Today, a revamp could produce about $400m of annual cost savings, or a 10 per cent boost in forecast 2013 earnings per share, according to JPMorgan.

176;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Deutsche Post to pay €516m in back taxes;Payment to end six-year dispute;Deutsche Post, the logistics group, is to pay the German government €516m in back taxes to resolve a six-year dispute about a tax exemption that pitted Berlin against Brussels.The group said the sum covered the period from 1998 until mid-2010, when the German parliament ended a value added tax exemption for postal companies providing a “universal service” – which only Deutsche Post was in fact able to offer.Past provisions for the long-awaited ruling by tax authorities meant the Bonn-based company was able to affirm its aim of posting earnings before interest and tax of €2.5bn-€2.6bn in the current year.But Europe’s largest postal and express-delivery company by revenues said net profit would be reduced by €265m in the third quarter, when it planned to make the payment to the government, which owns 31 per cent of Post.When the government privatised Deutsche Post in the late 1990s, it exempted the company from VAT payments as compensation for maintaining an expensive network to provide all postal services nationwide.But complaints from competitors such as UPS and TNT Express prompted the European Commission from 2006 to put pressure on Germany – and other countries with similar rules, such as the UK and Sweden – to end the exemptions.The previous government put an end to Germany’s VAT exemption three years later, obliging national tax authorities to calculate a repayment for the previous decade.Deutsche Post said: “The financial authorities had retrospectively examined several postal services for tax liability, which were previously exempt from VAT,” adding that it had already “partially” formed reserves for the matter.The group said it had decided to accept the claim by German tax authorities “to establish legal certainty and avoid years of legal battles” even though “different interpretations” of European Union and German law existed.The charge came a week after Deutsche Post said it would have to repay €298m in state aid and interest to comply with a separate EU ruling published this year.Brussels wants the postal group to repay up to €1bn of what it deems illegal state aid to Berlin, a move that underlines the determination of competition regulators to open up the European market.Deutsche Post has launched an appeal against the judgment, which forces it to return German subsidies to pension payments. It says Brussels’ demands stand in “clear contradiction” of other European rulings.French power group EDF on Tuesday won its battle to keep about €1bn in state aid as the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Commission was wrong to deem the payment illegal.In 2003 the Commission said the tax concession strengthened EDF’s competitive position and was improper state aid. It had ordered the group to pay €1.22bn.
177;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;DHL sees opportunity in TNT-UPS merger;;The €5.16bn takeover of TNT Express by UPS creates an opportunity for DHL, the European express parcel leader, to pick up disaffected customers, DHL’s chief executive has said in one of his first responses to the deal.Frank Appel, chief executive of Deutsche Post DHL, also insisted that DHL’s position was so strong in most markets – including fast-growing Asian economies – that it had no need to seek a major acquisition like UPS’s, announced in March.Mr Appel was speaking to the Financial Times during a visit to London where he outlined to investors plans to boost the group’s annual earnings before interest and tax (ebit) by €1bn by 2015.Mr Appel said DHL expected UPS to lose some focus during the complex process of integrating TNT Express.“If a company is integrating another company, that distracts from the service and the customers,” he said. “The people are nervous. We see an opportunity to capture market share – therefore, we’re relaxed overall.”Mr Appel nevertheless urged the European Commission to examine the takeover’s implications carefully. He pointed out in particular that DHL had been forced under international airline ownership rules to sell its US airline. He demanded that similarly strict rules be applied to UPS in Europe.“I don’t know how they want to take over the airline because the airline situation is very clear,” Mr Appel said. “I can only expect that the European Commission looks into that very closely.”Mr Appel insisted, meanwhile, that DHL’s position in most markets was so strong that it had no need to match UPS by undertaking a significant strategic purchase.“We’re not only the strongest player in Europe,” he said. “We’re also by far the strongest player in Asia, the Middle East and Africa and also in a strong position in Latin America.”After a series of acquisitions in the past two to three years, it would now buy only companies that added to its “footprint of skills”, Mr Appel said. DHL was, he went on, far larger than any rival in the global contract logistics business – providing outsourced logistics services for companies. In express freight, TNT Express had been the last readily available major acquisition.“We have no intention and probably only limited possibility to make acquisitions,” Mr Appel said. “So we will focus entirely on organic growth.”The most important gap in DHL’s global portfolio remains in express parcels in the US, where its inability to control its air operations directly and fierce competition from UPS and FedEx forced it to withdraw in 2008. Mr Appel insisted, nevertheless, that UPS’s air express business to and from the US continued to grow strongly – and that other parts of the world were now more important.“Relatively speaking, the importance of the US market is different from 15 years ago, when we started our journey in the US market,” he said. “Asia is much more important than it was at that time.”The projected €1bn growth in annual ebit would take group annual ebit, €2.44bn last year, to between €3.35bn and €3.55bn by 2015. The company is targeting 13 to 15 per cent annual revenue growth in DHL and stabilisation of ebit – currently running at about €1bn annually – at the Deutsche Post mail division.
178;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-05-08T07:43:12Z;Deutsche Post plans US hub expansion;;Deutsche Post is planning to expand “significantly” its DHL Express mail hub in Cincinnati, Ohio, to profit from the rising volume of parcels that US companies and consumers want delivered quickly to South America, Europe or Asia.The German company, which pulled out of the US market in late 2008, singled out volume and revenue growth in the Americas and Asia as the key drivers for a strong first quarter for DHL Express, the fastest growing of its four business units.Deutsche Post’s revenues rose 4.3 per cent to €13.4bn in the first quarter, while earnings before interest and tax grew 9.9 per cent to €691m. Net profit rose 64 per cent to €533m after bottom-line drag from the sale of Postbank in 2011.The investment, pegged at €50m over the next year, comes only weeks after US rival UPS bid for TNT Express, which would allow it to draw closer to market-leader DHL Express in the lucrative European express market.Deutsche Post has held back from any comment on UPS’s move, saying only that it hoped the European Commission would look closely at any effects the proposed takeover would have on competition within the 27-country European market.Frank Appel, Deutsche Post chief executive, said cost cuts and portfolio changes over the past few years had left the German company in an “unmatched position in the world’s growth markets”, which would allow it to meet its forecast for the year.The company said in March that group ebit would rise from €2.4bn last year to between €2.5bn and €2.6bn in 2012, as strong growth in some international fields was expected to help compensate for moderate growth from its traditional German postal service.DHL Express, a bellwether of the global economy, saw revenues rise 9.8 per cent to €3bn in the first quarter, with earnings before interest and tax gaining 7.9 per cent to €409m. DHL’s freight and supply-chain units contributed €178m in ebit.DHL Express operates five hubs around the world, which it serves with a “round-the-world service” linking Cincinnati to Bahrain to Hong Kong, and a new one linking Los Angeles to Leipzig to Hong Kong – key trade routes.In the first quarter, DHL Express carried 562,000 express packages every day, 9.6 per cent more than during the same quarter of 2011. The unit hopes a stronger hub infrastructure will allow it to offer more international next-day services.Deutsche Post’s traditional domestic mail unit profited from strong e-commerce. Parcel delivery helped revenues gain 1.1 per cent to €3.5bn, while ebit rose 5.4 per cent to €393m. Quarterly parcel volumes gained 13.6 per cent to 234m units.
179;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-05-02T13:01:33Z;N Korea jams signals on Seoul flights;;Electronic jamming signals emanating from North Korea have affected hundreds of civilian flights in and out of South Korea, officials in Seoul said on Wednesday, raising fears about further provocations by the communist state following last month’s failed rocket launch.A total of 252 planes flying in and out of Incheon International Airport, Seoul’s main hub, and Gimpo airports have had their global positioning system (GPS) signals jammed since last Saturday, Seoul’s transport ministry said.Flights by nine foreign airlines including Japan Airlines, Thai Airways International and Garuda International have been affected by the signal jamming, in addition to nine domestic airlines.“The GPS jamming signals are coming from North Korea so we believe the North may be related to this,” said Lee Kyung-oh, an official at the Korea Communications Commission, a state agency in charge of telecommunications.International delivery companies such as FedEx and UPS were also affected by the jamming.Pilots and airlines were alerted by the Korean traffic authorities, but the transport ministry said all flights were operating normally.“There is no serious threat to the safety of flights because planes are using other navigation systems,” said Kim Choon-oh, a ministry director.The jamming incidents come amid growing tensions on the Korean peninsula, with North Korea sharpening its rhetoric against the South after the country’s latest long-range rocket disintegrated shortly after blast-off. The North has warned of imminent “special actions” that would reduce Seoul to ashes within minutes, following South Korea’s suggestion that Pyongyang should stop wasting money on weapons.North Korea is also widely believed to be readying another nuclear test to make amends for the failed rocket launch. South Korean officials say that North Korea is fully prepared for the third nuclear test and is only waiting for a political decision to go ahead with it.Mr Kim at the transport ministry said GPS disruptions were usually made during the Korea-US joint military exercises, for example, in August 2010 and March 2011, but the latest disruptions were more large-scale than before. Seoul’s defence ministry said military equipment had not been affected by the signal jamming.“These low-phase provocations cost little, but [are] highly-efficient . . . because it is hard to prove who did it,” said Ahn Cheol-hyun, a former agent at Seoul’s National Intelligence Service who runs the Institute of Crisis Management.“Like a boxer, they will keep giving little jabs at their opponent. Then, they will find a way to deal a bigger blow. Seoul should be prepared for this.”Seoul’s defence ministry has warned that North Korea is capable of disrupting guided weapons, posing a fresh threat to security. Former defence minister Kim Tae-young told parliament that Pyongyang imported Russian equipment, which may have been the cause of intermittent failure of GPS receivers on naval and civilian craft along the west coast in August 2010.
180;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-04-26T14:55:42Z;Strong domestic growth supports UPS;;"United Parcel Service, the global parcel delivery company, reported solid revenue and profit gains on Thursday for the first quarter of 2012 driven by a bump in US ecommerce packages but cautioned that Asia remained a weak spot.“During the quarter, the most positive news has come from the US where indications of economic rebound are evident. Retail sales are growing faster than expected. Employment has improved,” Scott Davis, chief executive of UPS, told analysts.“On the other hand, economies in other parts of the world continue to face challenges: Europe struggles under austerity measures; slowing growth persists out of Asia.”UPS executives added that despite those trends, export volumes were holding up within Europe and Asia and said business from the trade routes between Asia and Europe and Asia and the US would probably rebound later in the year.Investors watch UPS closely for clues about the health of the global economy. The Atlanta-based group delivers to thousands of companies and consumers and at any moment about 2 per cent of world gross domestic product is passing through its networks.UPS said net income for the first three months of the year rose about 6 per cent to $970m, compared with the same period in 2011. Earnings per share rose about 10 per cent to $1, aided by $550m of share buybacks in the period.Those numbers slightly undershot analyst expectations for earnings of about $1.01 a share and in pre-market trading UPS shares, which have gained 9 per cent over the year to date, slipped 3 per cent to $77.20.For the quarter, total revenues climbed 4 per cent to $13.1bn thanks to a solid performance at the company’s US domestic package operations, where revenues rose more than 6 per cent to $8bn as customers ordered more goods online.Package companies round the world have reported volume gains from ecommerce in recent months as more and more people have access to and become comfortable with the internet, although that has been a mixed blessing.At UPS, operating margins at the US unit also rose from 11.7 per cent to 12.4 per cent but the gains were muted because ecommerce packages tend to be lighter weight and lower priced than traditional parcels destined for businesses.The company also made progress at its supply chain and freight segment, where it increased revenues and operating margins in spite of continued excess capacity in the market. UPS said demand for healthcare solutions was a key component.UPS’s international package segment lagged behind, however. During the quarter, revenues climbed about 2 per cent to $3bn but margins slipped from 15.6 per cent to 13.8 per cent as volumes shifted to less lucrative regional routes and lower-cost products.In March UPS moved to purchase TNT Express, the Dutch express parcel delivery company, for $6.8bn and Mr Davis said the company had made initial contact with regulators and remained “confident it will receive all required approvals” for the deal."
181;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-04-09T18:27:56Z;Transport and logistics set for M&A boom;;The transport and logistics sector should enjoy a boom year for deals, given the cash piles companies built up during the recession and eurozone crisis, and the large number of midsized targets in Europe, according to KPMG.UPS’s purchase of TNT Express has already made the value of deals announced in the first quarter steeply higher than in the same period last year, and possible transactions ahead include the UK government’s privatisation of Royal Mail. It is hoping to sell or float the business by autumn 2013.But smaller acquisitions, particularly in Europe, are also set to boost the value of global deals. In logistics, private equity is eyeing niche companies that do not fit into larger networks, including groups that transport time-sensitive material such as fruit, medicines or hazardous products. Meanwhile, trade buyers are looking to take part in consolidation of mainstream package delivery.“After the UPS-TNT Express deal, FedEx needs to do something,” said Steffen Wagner, European head of transport transactions at KPMG. The US company last week announced a deal to buy Opek, a Polish shipping company with about $70m in annual sales.“The European market is mature. There are a large number of midsized players, many of them family owned,” Mr Wagner said. “The availability of targets is very good.”He sees different drivers for deals elsewhere in transport, with shipping groups responding to overcapacity in the sector with distressed sales. In infrastructure, a growing demand from pension funds for steady, inflation-protected investments means privatised assets should be snapped up quickly.Edinburgh airport is being auctioned by its owner, BAA, this month, and Stansted could follow late this year or early next. Meanwhile, many investors hope the Spanish government will move towards privatising airports there.Royal Mail, whose value has been estimated at between £3bn and £4bn, could prove a difficult prospect to sell or float so long as its GLS European parcels arm remains tied to the postal service, said Mr Wagner. The €5bn ($6.6bn) TNT Express deal was made possible when TNT split into a postal company for the Netherlands, PostNL, and the more dynamic TNT Express.That acquisition contributed to $19.7bn in transport and logistics deals announced globally in the first quarter of 2012, according to Thomson Financial data, compared with about $50bn for the whole of last year, when the eurozone crisis curbed dealmaking.The value of completed deals and those announced in the first three months of the year is higher – at $27.9bn – than any quarter in 2011.Still, this year’s prognosis could change if financing remains difficult, said Mr Wagner. “It’s still an issue, particularly for private equity.” Moreover, pricing has not yet fully recovered to pre-credit crisis levels, meaning that if owners are not forced to sell, they may yet wait.
182;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-04-08T18:32:37Z;US union pensions hole deepens to $369bn;;The hole in the pension plans of US labour unions now stands at $369bn Credit Suisse has calculated with the aid of new reporting standards. This raises the prospect of higher pension contributions for employers and deteriorating industrial relations.Multi-employer pension schemes, managed by trade unions on behalf of members working for many different employers, are now just 52 per cent funded, the bank calculates with most of the burden to close this gap likely to fall on small and midsize companies.S&P 500 companies’ share of this obligation is estimated at just $43bn. However Credit Suisse identifies seven large companies in the S&P, including Safeway and UPS, where the pension liability is a significant proportion of their market capitalisation.There is also a “last man standing” risk for companies if other contributors to a fund fail. In 2007 it cost UPS $6.1bn to withdraw entirely from the Central States Pension Fund, capping its liability.More than 10m people are covered by such multi-employer schemes with contribution rates typically set by the collective bargaining agreements that cover pay, benefits and working conditions. Membership of these funds, and the businesses contributing to them, tend to be concentrated in industries with highly unionised workforces, such as construction, transport, retail and hospitality.The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which regulates reporting of US pensions, now requires companies to disclose more details about their involvement with such plans in their annual regulatory filings.Credit Suisse combined these with separate filings from over 1,350 multi-employer plans. “FASB provided the key to unlocking the door”, said David Zion, head of accounting research for the bank.The bank’s findings contrast with the approach used by the plans themselves whereby funding levels are calculated on an actuarial basis which smooths investment returns over several years and discounts the size of future payments to beneficiaries at an expected rate of investment returns of 7.5 per cent annually.Critics argue that this produces an overly optimistic view of assets and liabilities: on this actuarial basis multi-employer plans are 81 per funded, a gap of only $101bn. Safeway last week said that its liability was $1.88bn “on the basis established by the Pension Protection Act of 2006”. Credit Suisse estimates that a fair value for the liability is $7bn, more than the company’s market capitalisation.The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which insures US pension schemes, estimates that at the start of 2009, the most recent figures it has published, multi-employer plans were 48 per cent funded, with $331bn of assets to fund $686bn of liabilities.
183;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-04-04T17:44:58Z;Deutsche Post bullish over rivals’ tie-up;;Deutsche Post DHL, the German mail and express parcel company, expects to pick up customers from rivals UPS and TNT Express once they begin to integrate the two companies as part of their recently announced €5.2bn tie-up.The deal, agreed last month, will create a company with revenues of about $60bn and has raised concerns about market dominance in certain European countries.In an interview with the Financial Times, Lawrence Rosen, chief financial officer of DP, said that he was “pretty relaxed” about the combination given his company’s strong global position in high value sectors, such as the market for time-sensitive packages.UPS has said it expects rapid antitrust approvals, but if European regulators ask it to divest certain assets, Mr Rosen said DP would be likely to examine the pieces, although he added that DP was focused on organic growth.In March, DP reported strong 2011 operating results thanks to a surge in e-commerce packages and solid growth in emerging markets, and forecast an improved performance in 2012 and beyond.On Wednesday Mr Rosen said the first quarter of the year was developing as expected, with economic strength in Asia and the US offsetting weakness in Europe. However he added that air freight markets were sluggish due to inventory adjustments in the technology sector.On the TNTE-UPS deal, he said that “customers like to put their business with more than one provider and so we would expect that on balance we would have a very good position and will be able to pick up more new customers”.At the same time Mr Rosen said the €400m to €550m synergy targets announced by UPS would necessitate a long period of integration, creating “uncertainty” for customers that could make them amenable to switching provider.Large-scale deals in the logistics sector have a mixed record. IT problems following DP’s purchase of US based Airborne Express in 2003 led to late deliveries, billing errors and customer defections. DHL eventually pulled back from the US domestic market in 2008.Last month, David Ross, with Stifel Nicolaus, warned that large-scale network integrations often “start with much more potential benefit than is ever realised”, and flagged up the risk that IT, labour integration issues or management distraction might cause loss of market share to competitors.UPS says it has developed a cautious strategy to avoid those issues. The group expects the deal to complete by the end of the year, subject to regulatory and other approvals, and then plans to spend four years integrating TNTE to ensure that any changes will not affect customer service.Kurt Kuehn, UPS chief financial officer, told investors in March: “If you look at the history of failed mergers in transportation and supply chain, it’s usually a lack of appreciation either of the business or it’s a lack of understanding of the complexity.”
184;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-03-29T19:11:45Z;M&A activity picks up in Europe;;Europe last year was the whipping boy of the global economy and the dealmaking world.The continent’s sovereign debt crisis rattled markets across the world leading to a sharp drop-off in mergers and acquisitions activity in the second half of the year.And the slump has continued into 2012. Dealmaking fell almost 15 per cent from the final quarter of last year, the fifth consecutive quarterly decline.But the moribund European market is twitching. From an abysmally low base at the end of last year, M&A volumes rose about 14 per cent in the first quarter. True, Glencore’s proposed $53bn tie-up with Xstrata helped boost Europe’s numbers.But elsewhere there are signs of life, with Sumitomo spending $7.3bn to snap up the aviation finance business of Royal Bank of Scotland and UPS agreeing a $6.8bn deal with TNT Express of the Netherlands.Advisers argue that the indiscriminate sell-off in European equities created opportunities for those eyeing the market. “Inbound European deals are being driven largely by attractive valuations, reduced levels of uncertainty, and the perception that one has not yet caught up with the other,” says Steve Baronoff, chairman of global M&A at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Other buyers, such as Cisco in its $5bn deal for video software company NDS, are looking for opportunities to deploy overseas cash, which would be taxed if repatriated to the US.“There are US companies who have a lot of cash sitting in Europe, which enables them to tax-efficiently acquire companies that are consistent with their strategic objectives,” says Jacques Brand, co-head of investment-banking coverage and advisory at Deutsche Bank. “There are also European companies that have significant operations in Asia or the emerging markets that are of interest.”Despite a revival in debt markets which has allowed private equity funds to increase the amount of leverage they can use, buyout volumes dropped 36.2 per cent year on year in the first quarter to $41.3bn, writes Anousha Sakoui.“Public to private deals in Europe remain difficult for private equity because of continued differences between buyer and seller price expectations,” says Karen Simon, global co-head of private equity for JPMorgan. “Funds are more focused on the US where it is easier to do public-to-private deals.”The reopening of the IPO market in Europe is giving some funds hope that they will soon be able to float some portfolio companies.“We have started to see an increase in seller-driven activity, as a result of companies reassessing their portfolios, including the potential sale of divisions [and] sponsors considering exits,” says Giuseppe Monarchi, head of Emea M&A at Credit Suisse.But the agreement by Switzerland’s ABB to buy Thomas & Betts in the US for $3.9bn and Roche’s $6bn hostile bid for US diagnostics company Illumina also showed renewed interest from European companies in overseas deals.“We are seeing more Asian and European buyers looking into North America as a platform for growth,” says Chris Ventresca, co-head of North American M&A at JPMorgan. “From more developed overseas markets, growth in North America may look relatively attractive.”The tick-up in Europe is highlighted by a stony silence stateside. The US dominated the first three months of 2011, with seven of the quarter’s top 10 deals an all-American affair. This year, however, only 28 per cent of activity involves the US, down from almost half last year.Some advisers point to a time-lag, arguing the dearth of announcements reflects last year’s European woes. Others suggest that with more businesses coming to the market, a buoyant leveraged finance market and the fading threat of a eurozone meltdown the second half looks promising.“This should be a market in which we see much more robust M&A activity,” says Mr Brand at Deutsche Bank. “Volatility is down, corporates are cash rich, top line growth is slow, therefore mergers that result in expense synergies and opportunities to access new markets inorganically make a lot of sense.”“As confidence broadens, we should see levels picking up further,” says Hermann Prelle, chairman of M&A at UBS. “The M&A market is benefiting from being global. Asian buyers have kept the market going last year and US buyers are increasingly becoming active.”
185;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Freight groups fined €169m for global cartel;;An unpretentious Italian restaurant on the outskirts of London provided the unlikely backdrop for a multimillion-pound international freight cartel that attempted to disguise illegal surcharges by using code words such as “fresh marrow” and “asparagus”.Known as the “gardening club” to its members – who included managers from the logistics groups UPS and DHL – the diners formed one of four distinct cartels fined €169m by the European Commission.Between 2002 and 2007, the four cartels, involving 14 companies, illegally set charges on goods sent on important trade lanes between the US, Europe and Asia.Competition officials broke the cartel after being approached with incriminating information by Deutsche Post – owner of DHL – which was later awarded immunity from fines. “The fact that such deliberate organised illegality can still take place today is shocking,” said Joaquín Almunia, the European Union’s competition commissioner.“We will continue to fight cartels as our number one priority, because they are the most harmful illegal activity breaching our competition rules.” The industry gatherings began as informal get-togethers at the Mamma Mia restaurant, a short walk from DHL’s offices in Staines, a plain market town on the outskirts of west London.But in 2003, soon after the UK introduced electronic declarations for exports, the managers broke the law by conspiring to levy a surcharge for this reporting service. The freight forwarding groups were referred to as “greenhouses” while the cartelists worked under codenames: “Velcro”, “Head Planter”, “Horticulturalist”, “Gardener” and “Catweazle”, after the bedraggled wizard from a 1970s British TV series.Pasquale Romano, the restaurateur behind Mamma Mia, said that he “didn’t have a clue” about the illegal activities on his premises.“If they talk business, we don’t listen. We concentrate on the food. And the only vegetables here are the ones we cook,” he told the Financial Times.Kuehne & Nagel, the Swiss logistics group, was fined €53.7m while Panalpina, another Swiss group, must pay €46.5m.Karl Gernandt, Kuehne & Nagel’s chairman, said that he may appeal because the Commission had “not correctly investigated the facts”.UPS also said that it had “concerns” about the judgment.
186;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-03-27T23:23:36Z;The Dealmaker: Beyond the clouds;M&A has started slowly, but dealmaking could still take off;It is that time when the mergers and acquisitions world picks itself up off its back and tries again – and asks if this will finally be its year. If it is, which is doubtful, it will have been a long time coming.This year M&A has had its slowest start for nearly a decade, with dealmaking stymied by the fallout from the European sovereign debt crisis. Levels have not been this low in January since 2003, when $91.6bn worth of deals were recorded, say analysts at Dealogic, the data provider.Global M&A volume reached $152.3bn in January 2012, the lowest monthly volume since August 2009 ($133.6bn) and down 45 per cent on January 2011, when $268.6bn worth of deals were announced.This is all rather depressing for those who have been trying to hold tight since the last M&A party peaked in 2007. That year there were 46,678 deals done, worth a total of $4.14tn.We all know how the story unfolded. The credit crunch hit, lending dried up, banks went into meltdown and everything was put on hold. M&A slipped way down chief executives’ priority lists. Suddenly it all seemed too risky. And so far it seems that view has not changed dramatically.Nonetheless, a trend of slow recovery is emerging despite the gloom.Last year, worldwide M&A volume rose 7 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters, the information provider. Globally, 41,348 companies were bought or sold, with a value of $2.56tn.There are some reasons to believe this year could see a comeback. A big one is cash: companies have stacks of it. In fact, large companies worldwide hold an estimated $4.2tn in cash, according to Citigroup, the bank.For US businesses, cash as a percentage of short-term liabilities is at its highest since 1955 – and shareholders are not going to let that sit and burn a hole.Cash trapped overseas continues to be a driver behind dealmaking by US corporates – the network equipment company Cisco’s latest $5bn acquisition of NDS, a maker of software for TV set-top boxes, is one example (90 per cent of its $47bn cash is held overseas). But that deal also highlights another reason for more dealmaking. Much of NDS’s business is in India. By buying the UK-headquartered company, Cisco gets access to a fast-growing economy.For European corporates, in particular, the option of buying growth through acquisition will be an important consideration.But companies are not budging. Some bankers say that while there may be some very big deals in the works, many concede that the probability of getting deals done is lower than this time last year.The reason is uncertainty. While Greece may finally have come through its restructuring, doubts remain about the future of the eurozone. Uncertainty and volatility are the enemies of M&A, advisers will tell you.A survey of chief executives published in December by UBS, the Swiss bank, and Boston Consulting Group showed that while there is a stable core of companies intending to do significant deals (one in six – and a third of large caps), others planned to stand back from M&A for the next 12 months.There are some doomsayers who think 2012 could be worse still. Analysts at Barclays bank expect a 10 per cent drop in M&A this year compared with 2011, based on the historical relationship between M&A and S&P 500 performance.A few great deals have come through this year, however. The main one is the proposal to merge Switzerland’s Glencore, the commodities trader, and miner Xstrata to form a $90bn mining behemoth. That deal has long been predicted – but it is not done yet.Bankers say deals are getting harder to do. And there are plenty of examples – check out the attempt by UPS to take over Dutch delivery rival TNT Express. That deal has taken nearly 13 months from conception (13 months and 10 years, according to those who think that UPS’s listing in 1999 was the first step towards such a move).Look at the bidding war over Cove, the UK-listed energy group. Its market capitalisation doubled in recent weeks, when it suddenly became a takeover target for the Dutch, then the Thais, then the Indians. Then before you knew it, the stock was down 10 per cent after Mozambique – where Cove’s oil finds are – said it may impose a tax charge that could slow any sale of the Africa-focused oil explorer.So what of the future? If you think that a dealmaking boom is not coming back, you could be wrong. A quick look at the past 10 years shows that what some might think impossible, the M&A world makes happen – a hostile bid by a UK company for a German rival (Mannesmann/Vodafone), or a €71bn hostile bid for a bank in cash (RBS/ABN). It is a lesson never to underestimate this market. They don’t call it fantasy M&A for nothing.
187;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-03-25T21:17:30Z;UPS plans fresh route after TNT deal;;"The delivery vans and trucks of TNT Express, the Netherlands-based logistics company, will over the next four years undergo a gradual transformation, provided the takeover announced last Monday goes ahead: vehicles in TNT’s orange-and-white corporate colours will disappear, replaced by those in the brown of UPS, the world’s largest logistics company by revenues.Yet, according to UPS’s management, speaking to the Financial Times after the announcement of the agreed €5.16bn takeover, the business going on inside the vehicles will undergo a less obvious but still more important change. Internet shopping together with low worldwide inventory levels is, they say, putting logistics companies in charge of more complex and urgent deliveries, often direct to consumers.Scott Davis, chief executive, contrasts the new approach with the older approach, in which goods such as compact discs would be shipped in bulk to record shops.“There are so many people now who, instead of going to the brick-and-mortar shop, are getting it shipped to other places,” Mr Davis says. “As a company, we are investing heavily in the technology to make our offering more individual for consumers.”Others agree with much of what the UPS executives say. Davy, the Dublin-based stockbroker, last week published a report painting the same picture of higher levels of just-in-time deliveries and lower inventory levels. Companies have reduced stock sharply after many were caught at the start of the financial crisis in 2008 with stock that had to be sold at a loss, Davy and UPS say. Any sudden demand spike consequently demands quick restocking, often by air freight.“If you have reduced inventory levels, you have more need for smaller, more frequent shipments and maybe faster shipments,” says Kurt Kuehn, UPS’s chief financial officer.Nevertheless, not all the signs worldwide point in the direction of UPS’s claims. Trade statistics show that air freight volumes started falling faster and earlier in last year’s world economic slowdown than container shipping volumes and have yet to recover fully.UPS managers say the air freight decline reflects a transfer of lower-value, less urgent items from air to sea as high fuel prices have pushed up air freight costs and slack demand has reduced urgency. There is, they say, still increasing demand for express air services for higher-value goods such as tablet computers.Nevertheless, Mr Davis admits to being puzzled at the failure of Asia-to-US air freight volumes to reverse recent declines.“Consumer sentiment is better,” Mr Davis says. “I would have thought we would see more demand. Those numbers are a little bit better but still negative.”Another trend – the “nearshoring” of some production from Asia to Mexico, north Africa, eastern Europe or other areas near the main consumer economies – offers UPS more unequivocal help. Mr Davis says the trend remains “fairly limited”. But, according to Mr Kuehn, goods travelling from eastern to western Europe or from Mexico to the US are likely to use either UPS’s existing ground-transport services or one of the TNT trucks the company is acquiring, rather than another company’s container ship.“It’s wonderful news,” Mr Kuehn says. “People will spend more on our modes of transportation.”Yet UPS and Davy reserve some of their most optimistic remarks for the potential in exploiting the growing specialisation in the manufacturing of many products. The trend covers a range a changes starting with the increasingly regular updating of some consumer products to the increased customisation of shoes and the development of pharmaceuticals tailored to a patient’s DNA.“Obsolescence happens more quickly now and individuals want customisation,” says Daniel Brutto, UPS’s head of business outside its home US market.According to Mr Brutto, the change brings to an end decades when the most important trend in international goods movements has been the gradual cutting of prices brought about by ever larger, more efficient container ships.“The old model was – ‘drive down transportation costs; try to sell it and we start again next year’,” Mr Brutto says.Apparently simple products such as gym shoes would once have been shipped to shops in a range of colours limited to black and white, according to Mr Brutto. UPS’s challenge is to develop the information and other technology to deliver such goods more efficiently than rivals in the nearly infinite range of styles consumers demand."
188;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-03-25T17:14:27Z;UK-Europe high-speed rail freight plan;;A group aiming to substitute 300kph rail services for some short-haul European air freight flights hopes to launch its first services between the Continent and the UK later this decade, it has announced after bringing a freight-carrying French high-speed train to the UK.François Coart, strategy director of Europorte, an arm of France’s Groupe Eurotunnel that is participating in the Euro Carex project, said the group had identified sites at four mainland European airports and in south-east England as terminals for the service, which it hopes to launch in 2017 or 2018.The impetus for the project had come from increasing airport congestion and restrictions on night flights, as well as concerns about the rising cost of fuel and restrictions on carbon emissions, Mr Coart said. The project would mark one of the first efforts anywhere in the world to move high-value, fast-moving air cargo from the current mixture of air and truck to rail.The project has backing from several express parcel delivery services – including the US’s UPS and FedEx and the Netherlands’ TNT Express – as well as the four airports that could be served – Amsterdam Schipol, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Liège Airport and Lyons Airport. Euro Carex aims to shift to rail both some of the feeder flights that bring parcels and air freight to the express package providers’ main hubs, as well as some of the truck and van movements to and from the aiports.It was “quite easy” to identify a potential market for the service, Mr Coart said. “You have express parcels and that will be supported by auto parts, urgent medicals and courier network deliveries,” he said.The group had identified sites for terminals at all the airports involved, as well as a site by the High Speed 1 line from the Channel tunnel to London as a potential UK terminal, Mr Coart added. He declined to identify the exact site, beyond saying it was on the M20 Folkestone to London motorway and near the M25 London orbital motorway. It is currently impossible to reach London’s Heathrow Airport, a main air freight hub, with a continental-sized high-speed train.It was “not rocket science” to build the relatively simple rail terminals required, Mr Coart said. Each would cost between €30m and €50m to build.Mr Coart was speaking after Euro Carex for the first time brought a French TGV train to London to demonstrate how loading and unloading would work. The train is one of the handful of the 30-year-old first wave of French high-speed trains that has been converted to carry mail for La Poste, France’s post office. The train had called at both Lyons and Charles de Gaulle airports before heading through the Channel tunnel to London.Yanick Paternotte, a deputy in the French national assembly who chairs Euro Carex, said the company had asked both France’s Alstom and Germany’s Siemens – Europe’s two leading high-speed train builders – to draw up designs for a potential express freight high-speed train. Unlike the existing postal service TGVs, these would have doors large enough to accept air cargo containers from aircraft.The train would be able to carry around 120 tonnes of packages, around the same as seven Boeing 737 aircraft or seven articulated trucks.
189;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-03-23T19:02:29Z;UPS reaches deal to buy TNT Express for €5.2bn;;This week, United Parcel Service, the package delivery company, reached an agreement to buy TNT Express, its smaller Dutch rival, for about €5.2bn, wrapping up a deal that has been more than 10 years in the making.The purchase is the biggest in UPS’s 105-year history, and to win out, the company was forced to up its offer and fork out a sizeable sum. The purchase price represents a 54 per cent premium relative to the unaffected share price of TNTE.Still, executives at the Atlanta-based company argue the acquisition is worth every cent, giving it access to an extensive road freight network in Europe, as well as a bigger footprint in countries such as Australia, Brazil and China.In total, UPS expects to achieve between €400m and €550m of annual cost synergies, although achieving them will require €1bn of investment and plenty of time. UPS expects the complex integration process to take four years.Other potential hurdles remain. Earlier this week, FedEx, UPS’s main US competitor, said that it was focused on profitable organic growth within Europe, appearing to scupper the chance of a rival offer, but a counterbid is still possible.And the deal will face scrutiny from regulators, particularly in Europe where the enlarged UPS will end up with a 30 per cent share of the express parcel market. To win approval, the company could be forced to dispose of some assets.However, UPS says it is confident it will succeed. The company expects the offer period to close in the third quarter of the year and has agreed to pay TNTE a termination fee of €200m if the proposal falls foul of regulators.
190;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-03-22T15:08:03Z;FedEx damps talk of TNTE bid;;FedEx, the package delivery company, on Thursday appeared to rule out a move to spoil a proposed tie-up between rivals UPS and TNT Express, insisting that its focus remains on profitable organic growth within Europe.Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, declined to comment directly on the company’s acquisition plans but said that FedEx was happy with its profitable express business in Europe, which was “growing strongly.”“I’m extremely pleased with our operations there and we’re confident in our plans to continue expansion primarily through organic growth,” Mr Smith said. “We believe these plans will continue to improve our competitiveness in Europe.”Earlier this week, UPS, the US logistics group, and TNT Express, the Dutch parcel company, agreed a deal after UPS raised its offer. Combining the two companies will give UPS about a 30 per cent share of the intra-European express parcel market, far ahead of its nearest rival.Analysts worry that the move may box FedEx out of Europe. The company has a strong position delivering express packages between Asia and Europe, and Europe and the US, but operates a smaller intra-European ground network than its peers.FedEx insists that it has ample room to grow in the fragmented European space that is split between specific domestic markets, cross-border air and surface markets and intercontinental markets.Executives said FedEx had been adding intercontinental flights for several years and in the last five months had opened 23 new stations in countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands.“We’ve been expanding at flank speed over the recent past and are going to continue for the foreseeable future to broaden the portfolio that we offer in Europe,” Mr Smith told analysts on a conference call.Mr Smith also questioned the broader economic prospects for Europe, arguing that growth rates in the region are low and will remain low if current policies are sustained, implicitly suggesting that investing in other regions, such as Asia, made more sense.In any event, a successful counterbid could be difficult to achieve. FedEx is already spending heavily on new aircraft and, as part of the UPS deal terms, TNTE can only break the merger protocol if it receives an offer that is 8 per cent higher than UPS’s €9.50 bid.The comments came as FedEx reported a surge in quarterly revenues and profits thanks to higher prices and strong demand during the holiday season and predicted a solid finish to its fiscal year in spite of modest global economic growth and a recession in Europe.In the three months to the end of February, FedEx said net income jumped 126 per cent to $521m, or $1.65 per share, as sales rose 9 per cent to hit $10.6bn. A reversal of a legal reserve and a lower tax rate also boosted earnings.The results blew past both Wall Street expectations and the company’s own estimates. Analysts had forecast that in the third quarter of its 2012 fiscal year the company would earn net income of $427.7m, or $1.35 a share, on sales of $10.6bn.They were also flattered by FedEx’s 2011 performance. During the same quarter a year ago, FedEx undershot expectations and blamed the poor results on a mix of severe winter storms and sharply higher fuel prices that raised costs and hurt sales.FedEx said the momentum would continue and the company forecast earnings of between $1.75 and $2.00 per share in the fourth quarter, broadly in line with analyst estimates, and between $6.43 and $6.68 per share for fiscal 2012.“I think the fourth quarter is still [going to be] very good but what we’re seeing at the moment …is that we just don’t have as strong an economy as we hoped it would be a year ago,” said Alan Graf, chief financial officer at FedEx, adding that high fuel prices were also taking a toll.FedEx shares slipped about 3 per cent to $93.05 in early morning trading in New York on Thursday. Over the year to date the shares have risen by about 12 per cent.
191;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-03-19T23:43:40Z;TNT is vital piece in UPS jigsaw puzzle;;Scott Davis, UPS chief executive, portrayed himself as having completed a tricky jigsaw puzzle on Monday after announcing the takeover of TNT Express.The logistics company would be a vital missing piece for UPS: road freight operations in Europe. TNT Express’s operations in Australia and Brazil would fill in the edges and merging two air freight networks would make everything more efficient.The question is whether Mr Davis can put it all together smoothly, as he has suggested, or whether an unexpected jolt will scatter the pieces.Such jolts could include greater than expected demands from the competition authorities to clear the deal, problems with merging the two operations, or union unhappiness over job losses.There is also the financial impact on UPS of paying the €5.16bn it is offering for TNT’s shares.The extra risks UPS will be assuming were underlined on Monday evening when Moody’s, the rating agency, announced it was putting the Aa3 rating for its senior unsecured debt on review. Moody’s said the $370m debt the company would assume from TNT Express and the extra borrowing to pay for the deal could “result in credit metrics at levels no longer supportive of the Aa3 rating”.One jolt could come if competition authorities in Europe conclude that the deal will substantially reduce competition in a rapidly consolidating sector.Mr Davis rejected as “too simplistic” the idea that he was redrawing the competitive landscape in European logistics, where the big four operators are Germany’s DHL, TNT Express, UPS and the US’s FedEx.“There are a lot of competitors in Europe,” he said. “The [post offices] are major competitors in their own right. There’s a lot more than DHL and FedEx.”UPS was at pains on Monday to portray the deal as the merging of two matching networks, which would enhance organic growth. “We have complimentary products,” Mr Davis said.The merged company would seek to present customers with new products, Mr Davis said. It would also ask if there were opportunities to increase revenue.“Can we expand the business with the same structure and not have to add too much to the structure?” Mr Davis asked.UPS said an important reason for the transaction was the opportunity to make €400m to €550m of pre-tax cost savings annually by the fourth year after completion.The biggest saving would come from an aligning of the two companies’ air operations, said Kurt Kuehn, UPS’s chief financial officer. Other areas – including back office – would follow, he added.Air competition rules will mean UPS has to sell control of TNT Express’s air operations, although it could seek to lease back some of the capacity from the new owner.Daniel Brutto, head of UPS’s international division, hinted that TNT Express’s air hub at Liège in Belgium was likely to see some business shifted to UPS’s existing hub at Cologne, even though Liège’s strategic position was an advantage. “Cologne is the future for our airline business,” he said.Previous logistics mergers – particularly AP Møller-Maersk’s takeover in 2005 of P&O Nedlloyd, the world’s third-largest container shipping line – have shown the potential for integration between logistics operators to fall foul of integration problems. The merged Maersk Line operation after the P&O Nedlloyd takeover suffered severe problems when a new, merged information technology system malfunctioned.Mr Davis insisted that the merger process would be “very deliberate”, and it would take four years and €1bn to ensure that customers continued to receive good service.“This is a customer-first integration,” Mr Davis said.“The challenges of completing the merger – and the current weakness of the European economy – would all, however, pale by comparison with the strategic advantages the new, merged company would enjoy, according to Mr Scott.“We’re not looking at the next just two, three, four years. We’re a company that invests for the next 20 or 30 years.”Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer in New York

The consumer technology company also reported “record activity” over the weekend for sales of its latest iPad tablet.Scott Sutherland, analyst at Wedbush, reiterated his “buy” rating and put a price target of $750 on Apple following Monday’s the announcement. “Apple continues to generate significant free cash flow and will be maintaining a cash war chest to execute on strategic opportunities. We are making some minor earnings per share adjustments in [our financial year] 2013 to reflect dividends but not repurchases,” he said.The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to its highest level since May 2008 at 1,409.75 and is now up more than 12 per cent on the year. US Steel Corporation led the risers on the benchmark US index, up 6.5 per cent to $31.64.Financial stocks propelled the index to cyclical heights to start the day but retreated in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 financial sector index gained as much as 1.2 per cent before finishing the day up 0.5 per cent.Bank of America, the best performing big bank stock for the year to date, crossed the $10 mark for the first time since last August in intraday trading, but finished the day down 2.8 per cent to $9.53 as traders speculated on rumours that the bank was going to raise capital through a share offering.“Contrary to market rumours, Bank of America has no intention of issuing additional equity in a secondary offering,” said a spokesperson at Bank of America. Shares rose 1.9 per cent in after-hours trading.Citigroup climbed 1.3 per cent to $37.17 after it sold its stake in Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, netting an after-tax profit of $349m. Citigroup has risen almost 2 per cent since last Tuesday’s close when it was revealed that it was one of four banks to fail the Federal Reserve’s stress tests.Goldman Sachs was up 1.1 per cent to $124.30 as reports said the bank was considering offering “monoline” insurance to find new ways to expand its business ahead of new financial regulations.Morgan Stanley rose 2.7 per cent to $20.06, while Wells Fargo gained 1.1 per cent to $34.25. Capital One and the Bank of New York Mellon were both up more than 1 per cent at $55.10 and $24.51 respectively.E-Trade Financial, the electronic broker, was up 1.6 per cent and has now risen 41 per cent in the year to date.The Nasdaq Composite index was the best performer out of the three large US indices as technology stocks picked up momentum throughout the day. The index rose 0.8 per cent to 3,078.32 with Apple among the leaders. Close behind was Google, which added 1.4 per cent to $633.98.The day’s biggest loser was Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator by subscribers, which fell by 4.5 per cent to $2.76. The company was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” in a note by Bernstein Research which cited concerns that Sprint does not have sufficient “free-and-clear spectrum” to launch its latest LTE iPhone and maintains its “punishing” commitments to Apple.Craig Moffett, analyst at Bernstein, said: “Unfortunately, at this point we simply don’t believe there is any analytical framework that provides strong conviction as to whether Sprint can or cannot avoid bankruptcy over the next four years or so.“To be clear, we are not predicting a Sprint bankruptcy. We are merely acknowledging that it is a very legitimate risk. And notwithstanding a recent rally in Sprint shares, we believe that risk is rising,” he added.Priceline.com, the online travel booking company, gained 3.2 per cent to $696.93 to hit a 52-week high. Netflix, the home DVD delivery and online streaming company, continued its rally, up nearly 4 per cent to $114.33.Shares in UPS, the US package delivery company, added 3.4 per cent to $81.11. Over the weekend, the company said it would acquire TNT Express, its Dutch rival, as it plans to expand its footprint in Europe and China.Las Vegas Sands, the casino company, rose 4.5 per cent to a 52-week high at $59.12 on reports that its Sands Cotai Central casino in Macao would open next month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 13,239.13. Bank of America led the index for much of the day before softening in afternoon trading to finish as the index’s worst performer. American Express, the world’s third-largest payments network, gained 1.3 per cent to $57.27.Economic data released on Monday showed that US housing market sentiment remained flat in March, with home builder confidence holding steady from last month.
193;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-03-18T22:07:52Z;FedEx/TNT: prudent absence;Staying away from a bidding war with UPS was a good idea;“Aren’t you supposed to be fighting against us?” Kermit the Frog once asked. FedEx could well be on the other end of the question. The US mail group decided not to join the battle for TNT Express with which rival UPS has finalised details for an acquisition probably at €9.50 a share. The only real obstacle in the way now is convincing competition regulators to approve the deal. To many people, Fedex’s lack of interest will have appeared strange. It has only 4 per cent of the European express delivery market and acquiring TNT, which has almost a fifth, would have been an easy way to compete with UPS’s 14 per cent share. FedEx also has basically no net debt, so it could have made a bid of €10.50 a share and retained an investment grade credit rating, reckons JPMorgan.But in spite of there being greater strategic value for FedEx, staying away from a bidding war with UPS was probably a good idea. It has less balance sheet power than larger UPS for starters. The latter’s bigger European profile (it has about three times as many employees on the continent) means that it can find $400m a year in synergies, twice as much as FedEx could generate, estimates JPMorgan. What is more, TNT needs work. Its profits fell by a third last year (excluding one-offs). At a time when FedEx is focused on building its lead over UPS in Asia (its market share of 11 per cent is about half as much again as UPS), justifying an expansion into economically ravaged Europe would have been tough.But there may be one final twist. As much of UPS’s operations overlap with those of TNT, there are some complex competition hurdles still to be jumped. If these prove too high, and the deal is called off, TNT’s share price will probably collapse below its €6.34 undisturbed level allowing FedEx to swoop in for a reasonable price. This may take a year or more, but if FedEx is lucky, it will make UPS, with its current offer at about a 50 per cent premium, look like a muppet.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
194;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-03-18T22:00:09Z;UPS agrees to buy TNT Express for €5bn;;UPS, the US package delivery company, has agreed a deal to buy its European rival TNT Express in a takeover that is likely to value the Dutch delivery company at about €5bn, people familiar with the talks said.The agreement, which was reached on Sunday, could be announced as soon as Monday, with UPS likely to be offering about €9.50 a share for TNT Express, the people said.The deal would bring to an end years of speculation about a tie-up between the two delivery companies. FedEx had also pursued TNT in 2008. A combination with TNT Express would increase UPS’s presence in Europe but would also give the US company a domestic network in China, where it has been keen to expand.A bid of about €9.5 a share would represent a second increase on UPS’s first offer to TNT Express of €8.25 a share, which it made in November last year. The US logistics company, which had started work on the potential bid at the start of last year, increased its offer to €9 on February 11.However the Dutch delivery company rejected that offer. The two have been in talks since. UPS and TNT Express declined to comment.Following UPS’s approach to TNT last month, the Dutch company’s shares soared to more than €10. However, since then they have fallen, trading at €9.35 on Friday.The takeover talks follow pressure on the Dutch deliver company from activist shareholders, led by the US hedge fund Jana Partners.Jana Partners was among the shareholders that pushed for the break-up of the former TNT into TNT Express and the Dutch postal company PostNL in May. PostNL holds a 29.9 per cent stake in TNT Express.The takeover, if finalised, would be the largest in UPS’s history. Despite having a market capitalisation of about $74bn and buying about 30 companies since 1999, the largest deal it has struck was for Overnite, a trucking company, for about $1.3bn in 2005.The Dutch and Belgian unions representing TNT Express workers have demanded that the companies guarantee there will be no forced redundancies in Belgium due to any merger, and that TNT Express retain its headquarters in the Netherlands.TNT Express last month said it suffered a net loss of €173m in the fourth quarter of 2011 and was planning to refocus on its core European operations.Additional reporting by Matthew Steinglass in Amsterdam
195;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-03-15T17:54:39Z;UPS still in takeover talks with rival;;UPS, the US package delivery company, is set to tell investors on Friday that it is still in talks with its Dutch rival TNT Express about a takeover but has not yet agreed a deal, people familiar with the talks said.UPS has until Friday to update the market under Dutch takeover laws about its progress, after having confirmed in February it had made a revised €9 a share offer. That offer was rejected by TNT but the two sides continued talks.While the situation could change, people close to the situation said no revised bid had yet been tabled and that despite the slow progress of talks in recent weeks, a deal could happen over the next few days.UPS’s first offer to TNT Express was €8.25 a share, when it first approached the Dutch delivery company about a takeover in November last year, said people familiar with the negotiations between the companies. The US logistics company, which had started work on the potential bid at the start of 2011, increased its offer to €9 on February 11, valuing TNT at €4.9bn.While it is still unclear what revised price may be tabled by UPS, typically in large takeovers initial offers are increased by 10-15 per cent. UPS described its €9 bid as “a revised, increased and comprehensive proposal to acquire the entire issued share capital”.Following UPS’s approach to TNT last month, the Dutch company’s shares soared over €10. However, since then they have fallen to trade at €9.20 on Thursday.The bid by UPS came last month before TNT announced a net loss of €173m in the fourth quarter of 2011 and plans to retreat from its global ambitions.The takeover, if agreed, would be the largest in UPS’ history. Despite having a market capitalisation of about $74bn and buying about 30 companies since 1999, the largest deal it has struck to date was for Overnite, a trucking company, for about $1.3bn in 2005.If it were successful in its bid, UPS is likely to hold talks with potential buyers, such as FedEx and PostNL, about buying assets it would need to divest to avoid the deal being blocked by the European Commission.UPS and TNT declined to comment.Additional reporting by Matthew Steinglass
196;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;A mixed blessing for parcel companies;;Walk through an apartment block in the US and chances are you will find a series of small yellowing notices stuck on the front door or dotted around the mail room – tell tale signs that UPS or Fedex delivery men have been and gone, having failed to deliver long-awaited packages.For individuals missed deliveries are just one of the many annoyances of modern life but for express parcel companies they are a symptom of a deeper challenge: the rise of e-commerce and with it, pesky residential deliveries.The trend has been a mixed blessing for parcel companies, pushing retail sales that used to go through brick and mortar stores into the mail but also squeezing margins and creating huge operational challenges.Still, after adopting ‘defensive’ measures to offload low-value parcels onto third parties in the early 2000s, leading industry executives in the US and beyond argue that they are finally getting to grips with the phenomenon.In the fourth quarter of 2011, e-commerce drove a surge in volumes at UPS and despite a drop in parcel weights, US revenues rose 7.3 per cent to $8.7bn and adjusted operating profit rose 30 per cent to $1.3bn.“We saw all of these pieces of the puzzle coming together,” Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer of UPS, said of the results at an investor conference last month , pointing to new products and new technology aimed at growing e-commerce demand.“We invested a lot in service in the past few years and the pick up in e-commerce is really falling on fertile ground with us,” Frank Appel, chief executive of Deutsche Post DHL, the German post and package group, told the Financial Times last year.Success has been hard won. At the heart of the problem lies the nature of e-commerce parcels. While traditional orders usually involve large volumes travelling regular routes to densely packed business customers, online orders revolve around deliveries to individual homes.Such deliveries seem almost designed to cause grief. Addresses are spread out, orders are highly seasonal and customers are often not at home. Moreover, lightweight parcels of books and CDs command low prices and competition further depresses yields.In response, logistics companies focused on reducing so called ‘last mile’ delivery costs, which can make up three quarters of overall supply chain costs, by re-aggregating demand at central drop off and pick up points.In the US, Nate Brochmann, of William Blair investment bank, says FedEx was an early mover. In 2004 it acquired a business that dropped off low-weight packages with the US Postal Service for final delivery. In the last quarter, average daily SmartPost volumes grew 17 per cent to 1.7m.Crucially, the deal reduces expenses for FedEx because it can deposit multiple packages at a single post office location. Last year UPS rolled out a comparable US product and in Europe other package delivery groups have tie-ups with their local postal services.Over time logistics companies have developed other responses. UPS My Choice is one example. Launched in October the service sends subscribers an alert before their packages arrive, reducing the number of missed deliveries, increasing driver productivity and improving customer satisfaction.FedEx offers similar options, as well as evening and Saturday deliveries, through its Home Delivery service launched early in the last decade specifically to address the needs of residential deliveries and e-commerce.“Any time we can avoid a re-delivery attempt, that saves Fedex money and also improves the customer experience so it is a win-win for both parties,” says Michael Glenn, executive vice president of market development for FedEx and head of FedEx Services.At UPS, residential deliveries, a rough proxy for e-commerce sales, have jumped from about 20 per cent of US volumes in 2000 to almost 40 per cent in 2011. UPS generates about $32bn of its $53bn revenues from the US each year.Alan Gershenhorn, chief sales, marketing and strategy officer for UPS, says: “Ultimately, our shippers are looking to create a superior experience for their customers and if we can help with that, and we believe UPS My Choice is doing that for them, then that starts to create a preference for UPS.”Jeff Ward, a partner at AT Kearney, argues that the industry is just at the beginning of a broader transformation as companies amass data on consumer preferences and use it as the basis for new tools, such as mobile applications that help better tailor deliveries to individual schedules.“[The impact of e-commerce] is probably one of the most exciting issues in transportation and logistics today,” he says. “There is a lot of innovation and a lot of growth there and it is a cool thing to see develop.”Still, there are many issues to overcome. For one thing, piggybacking on the USPS may not be entirely sustainable. The institution is already considering reducing service to cope with its well-publicised financial problems. Parcel companies say they are closely monitoring the situation.Then too, not all retailers want third parties, however well respected, to manage their interactions with customers. Last year a video of a FedEx delivery man tipping a computer monitor over a fence went viral, highlighting the brand risks involved in outsourcing delivery. FedEx says it strives for “outstanding” customer service and that the incident was an exception.But Mr Kuehn argues that UPS is just hitting its stride. “[With earlier products] we were just trying to find a way to offer lightweight, low value products a lower cost way,” he said in February. “We’ve really changed that philosophy in the last couple of years and instead have embraced [e-commerce] …not as an issue that we have to defend against but as an opportunity.”
197;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;Stepping up UPS’s TNT Express offer;;UPS’s first offer to TNT Express was €8.25 a share, when it first approached the Dutch delivery company about a takeover in November last year, said people familiar with the negotiations between the companies.That offer was rejected in December by TNT Express, the people said. At the time of that offer, the TNT shares were trading at less than €5.The US logistics company, which had started work on the potential bid at the start of 2011, the people said, then increased its offer to €9 on February 11.The US logistics company on Friday described its bid as “revised, increased and comprehensive”.TNT Express on Friday said that it had rejected the offer but was continuing discussions.While the market is pricing in an increase to UPS’s offer, any revision would be final, said one person familiar with the plans.UPS and TNT declined to comment.Typically in large takeovers, initial offers are increased by 10-15 per cent. However, TNT Express shares were trading as high as €10.08 on Tuesday, closing at about €9.89, indicating that shareholders believe a higher than €9 bid will be made.Several analysts, such as those at Credit Suisse and HSBC, lifted their target price for TNT Express to about €10. “We expect a further bid from UPS,” said analysts at Credit Suisse.“The supervisory and executive boards would be compelled to accept a bid of €9.5-€10 per share, representing a premium of 1-6 per cent per cent to the stock’s demerger price.”It demerged at a share price of €9.45.UPS could bid as high as €15 without seeing higher borrowing costs, and US rival FedEx as high as €13, without requiring an issuance of equity, wrote analysts at Wolfe Trahan.If it were successful in its bid, UPS is likely to hold talks with potential buyers, such as FedEx and PostNL, about buying assets it would need to divest to avoid the deal being blocked by the European Commission, two of the people said.“UPS would likely have to divest some assets – to avoid European Commission antitrust issues – in countries like the UK, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, assets which FedEx could acquire, but FedEx would still be boxed out from much of Europe,” said the Wolfe Trahan analysts.Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer and Matthew Steinglass

Intesa Sanpaolo fell 2.4 per cent to €1.53 on an otherwise resilient FTSE MIB. Italy’s blue-chip index edged down 0.1 per cent to 16,710.86.Deutsche Bank slipped 2.1 per cent to €33.85.

Alpha Bank sank 12.2 per cent to €1.59 and National Bank of Greece 9.5 per cent to €2.68.Elsewhere, broker commentary drove market moves. Renault briefly hit an 11-month high after Citigroup became the latest broker to raise its target price on the stock, increasing it to €46 from €35. The French carmaker reversed its gains throughout the session, however, closing down 0.2 per cent at €41.00.Its peer, Peugeot, slipped 1 per cent to €14.39. The CAC 40 index as a whole fell 0.2 per cent to 3,465.24.Belgian supermarket chain Colruyt fell 2.1 per cent to €29.17 after Goldman Sachs downgraded it to “sell” list from “neutral”.In Frankfurt, Thyssen-Krupp sank 2.7 per cent to €20.80 after analysts at UBS cut the stock to “sell” from “neutral” and forecast “another tough year” for the German steelmaker. UBS removed ArcelorMittal from its “key call” list, lowering the steelmaker’s target price to €29 from €33. ArcelorMittal fell 1.2 per cent to €16.64.TNT Express fell 2.9 per cent to €9.89 after it reported below consensus fourth-quarter results. The Dutch mail group is the subject of a takeover bid by United Parcel Service.RBC Capital Markets said results strengthened the case for investors to accept a takeover bid from United Parcel Service or another buyer. “With modest (at best) European growth this year . . . we think shareholders could have a long wait to see the UPS offer (or any other yet to be seen) bettered in a ‘stand alone’ TNT scenario,” the broker said.The stock gained 60.5 per cent in the previous session, following UPS’s bid.
199;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-02-21T17:12:46Z;UPS’s acquisition rationale comes into play;;When United Parcel Service, the logistics company, went public in 1999, top executives gave one overarching rationale for the wrenching change to its conservative, operations-focused corporate culture – large-scale acquisitions.More than a decade later UPS is finally making its move, taking advantage of its greater scale, financial strength and access to capital markets with a €4.9bn offer for TNT Express, the recently spun-off Dutch package delivery company.The bid comes as the leading express parcel groups are enjoying moderate if uneven growth amid the patchy economic recovery and have moved to tap into international trade flows and build out their global networks through a combination of capital investments and acquisitions.In 2005, for example DHL of Germany took over the UK’s Exel in a deal worth about €5.9bn, but for the most part deals have been smaller in size as logistics companies have filled in specific service and geographical gaps.For UPS the move has been a long time coming. Despite having a market capitalisation of about $74bn and buying about 30 companies since 1999, the largest deal it has struck to date was for Overnite, a trucking company, for about $1.3bn in 2005.In part the step by step approach of UPS reflects a deep strand of circumspection that runs through the corporate culture of the Atlanta-based business. In its entire 105 year history the company has had just 10 chief executives.Caution is warranted. Large scale deals in the package delivery sector have a mixed record. Deutsche Post DHL’s acquisition of US based Airborne Express in 2003 went poorly. IT problems led to late shipments, billing errors and customer defections. DHL eventually pulled back from the US.At the same time, until the spinoff last year, the combination of TNT’s express business and Dutch mail business was a significant stumbling block, tying an attractive parcel delivery business to a shrinking national mail service.TNT has long been seen as the most likely target for the company. “UPS went public in 1999 with one deal in mind,” says one person familiar with the company’s thinking. “That was TNT’s express business.”In the first place TNT Express has a substantial presence in Europe that compliments, and in some cases overlaps, UPS’s network. A deal would make UPS the biggest express carrier in Europe and could generate about $450m in synergies.Doug Caldwell, with AFMS Logistics Management Group, says that the company has a strong relationship with European multinationals, a valuable long haul road network and an outsourced operating model that gives it a very flexible cost base.By the numbers, TNT boasts a presence in 62 countries, including 16 road hubs in Europe, employs 83,000 people and has a ﬂeet of more than 30,000 road vehicles and about 60 aircraft. It is the smallest of the big four global package delivery companies.Another attraction for UPS is that TNT has a sizeable, albeit underperforming, presence in Brazil and China. UPS has ambitions in Latin America, has moved to develop a domestic Chinese footprint and has a reputation for buying struggling companies and fixing them up.Whether UPS will succeed in its bid is another matter. While some leading shareholders are backing the proposals, last week TNT’s board rejected the offer after careful consideration, although discussions are ongoing.Another wild card is FedEx. While UPS has a sizeable ground operation in Europe, FedEx has long been considered sub-scale in the region after closing its Brussels hub in the early 1990s following a long and unsuccessful battle to reach profitability.In public FedEx has insisted that its position, focused on moving high-value packages between Europe and Asia and Europe and the US, is solid, but analysts argue FedEx has an even more powerful incentive to purchase TNT than UPS and predict a bidding war could break out.Indeed, fending off a move by FedEx is another powerful reason for UPS to act. UPS generates about 14 per cent of its revenues from intra-European express packages while FedEx produces only about 2 per cent of its sales from that segment.In a tussle, UPS’s scale could make the difference. The company’s market capitalisation is more than double that of FedEx and it has substantial free cash flows, while its rival is committed to a heavy round of capital spending on new aircraft and might find it more difficult to pay for a deal.At the very least investors expect UPS to have to pay more to clinch a deal. Since the offer was revealed, TNT’s share price has jumped more than 50 per cent and is now well above UPS’s €9 a share offer price.
200;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-02-21T16:11:42Z;TNT Express: delayed delivery;Dutch delivery company’s results add nothing to its defence armory;The expression “timing is everything” unfortunately also includes bad timing. Just two days after news of UPS’s €9-a-share cash offer for TNT Express leaked out, the target company was obliged to unveil 2011 results that added nothing to its defence strategy. Admittedly, one-off items, related largely to the express business’s demerger from the TNT group, made headline numbers look particularly grim. But even with these stripped out, operating profit was almost a third lower than in 2010 at €230m, while revenues were less than 3 per cent higher at €7.3bn. Flat earnings in Europe/Middle East/Africa were offset by losses in Asia-Pacific and the Americas.TNT executives did their best, emphasising expansion opportunities in business-to-consumer deliveries – which might give the company a €38bn European market to play in by 2015, compared with a €20bn sector today. Outside Europe, there was talk of finding partners, while turnround targets – including the second half of 2012 for Brazil – were reiterated. But it is hard to see a strategy that will get the TNT Express share price – just €6.30 a few days ago – to €9 without bid interest anytime soon. Clean earnings per share in 2011 were about 20 cents, and might approach 30 cents by 2012 and 45 cents in 2013. The current offer price implies multiples of 30 times and 20 times respectively – compared with logistics sector averages of about 19 and 17 times.That, though, doesn’t mean UPS will get home at this price. TNT Express itself is talking of €150m of fixed cost reductions in its Emea business, and synergies overall for UPS could be anywhere up to €500m. There may, of course, be antitrust issues to negotiate: TNT Express has 17 per cent of the European B2B express market, compared with about 10 per cent for UPS and 16 per cent for Deutsche Post/DHL. But these can probably be remedied by limited disposals. For the moment, at least, TNT shareholders should sit tight.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
201;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;TNT Express to retreat from global aims;;"Dutch delivery company TNT Express suffered a net loss of €173m in the fourth quarter of 2011 and will retreat from its global ambitions even as it negotiates a takeover proposal from its larger rival UPS.TNT Express announced on Friday it had rejected a UPS bid of €9 per share. The refocus on its core European operations could make TNT Express more attractive to the US logistics company, which is seeking to compete in Europe with market leader DHL.Marie-Christine Lombard, chief executive, said TNT Express would reduce its exposure to fixed expenses in its lossmaking emerging-market segments in China and Brazil by seeking local partnerships. The company reiterated its target to return Brazil to profitability by the second half of 2012 and China by 2013.TNT Express will also shrink its aircraft fleet, divesting 10 to 12 of its fleet of 60 aircraft in Europe and cutting its own capacity on its China-Europe routes by half. The company said it would reduce costs in Europe and the Middle East by €150m by the end of 2012.“We are investing more in Europe, rather than the emerging platforms” of China and Brazil, Ms Lombard told the Financial Times. “We are reducing the financial exposure of TNT in those two businesses.”Mrs Lombard said the decision to concentrate on Europe reflected TNT Express’s comparative advantage there.“It’s obvious to us that our franchise is in Europe,” Ms Lombard said. With some 50 per cent of the market divided among small players, she said the region could deliver substantial growth in market share for TNT Express.But in a note, Alex White at accountant firm BDO LLP said the shift to Europe seemed to reflect a desire to wring “short-term profitability” out of established routes, rather than making long-term investments.Ms Lombard said she could not comment on the status of the negotiations with UPS or on whether there had been additional offers from American rival FedEx or others.The overall loss in the fourth quarter, against a profit of €4m in the same period of 2010, was due to €161m in one-off charges. These included a €104m impairment on the company's Brazilian operations because of greater than expected losses there in 2011, and a €39m impairment on the 747s it uses on its Asia-Europe routes.The results for the fourth quarter were greeted positively by analysts, who saw the 2.3 per cent year-on-year revenue growth and the steady improvement in margins in Brazil as promising.""The stronger focus on Europe is logical,"" said Andre Mulder of Kepler Capital Management. But he said the company's market share in Brazil should enable it to generate solid margins there.For the full year, TNT Express reported a net loss of €100m, compared with a loss of €57m in 2010. Revenues grew 2.1 per cent to €7.16bn.TNT’s shares jumped more than 60 per cent on Monday to €10.18 but were down 1.6 per cent at €10.02 in early trading in Amsterdam on Tuesday, against a 0.4 per cent drop in the AEX index.See Lex"

PostNL rose 49.9 per cent to €4.96.On the wider market, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 hit a seven-month high, rising 0.7 per cent to 1,090.95 as the recent trickle of mergers and acquisitions continued to improve sentiment.“The M&A cycle tends to follow business confidence,” said Robert Parkes, equity strategist at HSBC. “We’re starting to see selective deals and that’s a reassuring signal that confidence is slowly improving.”The Amsterdam Exchange index added 1.4 per cent to 332.58. Heineken rose 4 per cent to €40.02 after SocGen raised the stock to “hold” from “sell” following the brewer’s better than expected results last week. The Dutch stock has gained 13.3 per cent since the start of February.The Xetra Dax rallied 1.5 per cent to 6,948.25 as JPMorgan issued a bullish note on the German index.JPMorgan tipped the Xetra Dax as its preferred European index, citing the chipmaker Infineon Technologies as one of its top stocks. Infineon gained 3.2 per cent to €7.81 during trading.STMicroelectronics led the CAC 40 index higher. The chipmaker jumped 7.7 per cent to €5.69 as investors reacted positively to its decision to appoint a new chief operating officer to its troubled mobile chip venture ST-Ericsson. The CAC 40 index as a whole rose 1 per cent to 3,472.54.Elsewhere, Transocean, the world’s largest offshore drilling company, fell 5.1 per cent to SFr43.57 after it said that it did not plan to propose a dividend at its annual shareholder meeting and warned investors that there would be a “substantial” non-cash charge on the company’s goodwill.
203;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-02-17T23:40:48Z;UPS/TNT Express: package deal;Investors must watch that sloppy logic doesn’t derail a sensible deal;"Hoofddorp, twaddle-waddle, hogwash. Friday’s late announcement that TNT Express rejected a €9 per share approach from United Parcel Service was accompanied by the usual cardboard boxes of rubbish uttered during takeovers. And fair enough. The management and shareholders of the Dutch package delivery company want the highest price possible. UPS wants the opposite. But investors must be careful to watch that sloppy logic doesn’t derail a perfectly sensible deal.The more ridiculous arguments tend to come from the side of the target company. This is because it is almost impossible to deny that the future prospects for TNT, in this case, were already reflected in Friday’s undisturbed share price of €6.34 – which is almost 30 per cent below UPS’s offer. (Arguably including a takeover premium after years of rumours.) Cries of opportunism, therefore, are fatuous. There is no taking advantage of Europe’s woes – they are plenty real enough. Ditto of the weak euro; who is to say it is not going to fall further?The premium offered of €1.4bn-worth of market capitalisation can only be justified if over €200m of annualised synergies can be found. It is from here that TNT should draw its arguments. Operating expenses at TNT are running at about €7bn per year, a similar number to total revenues and hence its lack of profits. Trimming a couple of hundred million here and there in conjunction with UPS’s cost base which is approaching 10 times the size should not be a problem.So TNT is right to want a higher bid. And UPS has some leeway before its shareholders need to worry about overpaying. That is always a risk though when an acquirer is 16 times bigger. TNT’s management know that too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
204;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-02-17T16:42:47Z;TNT Express rejects €4.9bn UPS offer;;US logistics company UPS is in talks with TNT Express about a possible takeover, after the Dutch delivery company rejected an approach valuing it at about €4.88bn.After many years of speculation about a tie-up between the two, TNT Express said on Friday that UPS had submitted an unsolicited non-binding and conditional offer for the Dutch delivery worth €9 a share, valuing it at €4.88bn.The talks have been going on for months and the all-cash offer had been increased to €9 a share, people familiar with the situation said.In reaction to TNT’s statement, UPS said it made “a revised, increased and comprehensive proposal to acquire the entire issued share capital”.TNT Express, which faces pressure from shareholders after a drop in its share price, said it had rejected the offer but it continued to be in discussions about a possible takeover for the whole of the company.TNT Express shares were up 2.9 per cent before the announcement at €6.36 on Friday afternoon in Amsterdam.The deal, if successful, would highlight interest by global companies in taking advantage of the fall in European share prices in the wake of the sovereign debt crisis, which has depressed valuations of coveted targets.The combination would increase UPS’s presence in Europe but would also give the US company a domestic network in China, where it has been keen to expand.FedEx pursued TNT in 2008 and it declined to comment Friday on whether it would enter the bidding.“The market will hope that FedEx (is) also tempted in but very hard for FedEx to compete with UPS, who are the bigboy here,” said Mark Kelly, analyst at Olivetree Securities.In recent days, TNT Express has been caught up in an open feud with a group of activist shareholders, led by US hedge fund Jana Partners, rejecting their request to appoint three new directors.Jana Partners, which together with Alberta Investment Partners owns 5 per cent of TNT Express, was the driving force behind a shareholder revolt that led to the break-up of the former TNT into TNT Express and Dutch postal company PostNL last May.With other shareholders, it is now pressing for TNT Express to be groomed for a takeover by a larger rival, such as UPS or FedEx.When TNT Express was spun off last year, its shares were trading at about €9. PostNL holds a 29.9 per cent stake in TNT.Several large shareholders surveyed by the Financial Times have said an offer of €9 would be acceptable to them.Analysts at Wall Street research boutique Wolfe Trahan & Co recently called UPS and FedEx the most logical buyers of TNT Express.“We believe the separation of Express from Mail earlier this year could finally entice a strategic buyer to emerge,” they noted in a report. “We now estimate a €9 to €10 takeout price in our buy-out analysis, down from our prior expectations of €10 to €11.”TNT in recent months warned on profits, citing low demand on Europe-Asia routes, cost-conscious customers in Europe and continued losses in the Americas.Earlier this week, UPS announced its planned takeover of Kiala, the Belgian ecommerce company, which was estimated to be worth about $100m.Additional reporting Matt Steinglass and Jeremy Lemer
205;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
206;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-02-16T21:06:45Z;UPS acquires Belgian delivery group;;The consolidation of the European logistics sector gathered pace on Thursday with UPS, the US group, buying Kiala, a Belgian company specialising in deliveries of internet orders.UPS gave no details of how much it was paying for Kiala, which delivers internet-ordered goods to a convenient retail location. However, Kiala, which started in 2001, had forecast its 2011 revenue at €54.3m. The service operates in Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France and Spain as well as Belgium.The three main worldwide logistics and express parcel companies – UPS and FedEx of the US and DHL of Germany – have all been eager to exploit the potential of internet shopping to bring extra business to their parcel delivery networks.There has also been steady consolidation around the biggest players in the industry in recent years. In 2005, DHL took over the UK’s Exel, while in 2009 DHL pulled out of services in the US, leaving the market there to UPS and FedEx.Kiala is owned by a group of private equity and venture capital companies, including AGF Private Equity, Arts Alliance and HarbourVest Partners.
207;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-02-06T11:09:39Z;TNT Express feud with shareholders widens;;Dutch express mail company TNT Express is engaging in an open feud with a group of activist shareholders, rejecting their request to appoint three new directors on the grounds they had been paid directly by the shareholders.In a blistering letter of response, the leader of the shareholder group said TNT Express’s “lack of good faith and reasonableness” was “stunning”.The rejection marked a new level of acrimony in a long-running battle between TNT Express management and a shareholder group led by American hedge fund Jana Partners.Jana asked TNT Express in December to appoint three new members to the board of directors, including Alan Jones, who headed the express delivery service from 1999-2003 when it was a division of the former TNT postal group.TNT Express not only rejected the proposed candidates, but announced its board of directors had appointed two new members, both drawn from the Dutch corporate world.In a letter rejecting the proposal, TNT Express said the current board “has rejected the nomination of these candidates as they do not meet the requirements of independence as laid down in the company’s legal and governance rules”.TNT Express contends that the €20,000 Jana paid Mr Jones and the other two candidates, former Avis executive David Siegel and former UPS mergers and acquisitions head Thomas Delbrook, would render them unable to act impartially as board members.Barry Rosenstein, managing director of Jana, accused TNT Express of “attempting to hide behind a technical argument”, and said the payment had been intended to defray costs and inconvenience from the nomination. Mr Rosenstein said the candidates have agreed to refund the payments should they be elected.Despite management’s opposition, Jana will put its candidates for the board forward at the general meeting of shareholders in April, though it may reduce the slate from three to two.Jana Partners, which together with Alberta Investment Partners (AIMCO) owns a 5 per cent stake of TNT Express, was the driving force behind a shareholder revolt that led to the break-up of the former TNT into TNT Express and Dutch postal company PostNL last May. With other shareholders, it is now pressing for TNT Express to be groomed for a takeover by a larger sector-mate, such as UPS or FedEx.Jana and its allies are unhappy with the performance of Marie-Christine Lombard, chief executive. Shares in TNT Express have fallen by a third since the demerger as sales have been hit by the downturn in Europe, declines in volume on Asia-Europe routes, and problems at the company’s Brazilian division.But PostNL, which retains a 29.9 per cent stake in its sister company, has been ambivalent. Piet Klaver, chairman of PostNL’s board, has said Ms Lombard needs to be given the time to execute her strategic plans. PostNL’s chief executive, Harry Koorstra, is widely believed to be more sympathetic to Jana’s proposals.A source close to PostNL said the company was highly displeased with TNT Express’s new candidates, Marcel Smits, chief executive of Sara Lee Corporation, and Sjoerd van Keulen, chairman of the Holland Financial Centre. The source called them “more old boys’ network”, noting that neither had experience in the transport industry.The source also observed that, like current board chairman Antony Burgmans, Mr Smits formerly worked at Unilever. That would bring the number of Unilever alumni on TNT Express’s board to three.TNT shares were up 0.93 per cent to €6.28 on the Amsterdam exchange, against a drop of 0.33 per cent in the AEX index of shares.
208;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;UPS hit by pension accounting change;Fourth-quarter revenue grows 6 per cent;UPS, the global package delivery company, gave a cautiously optimistic outlook for 2012 on Tuesday, forecasting improved earnings and suggesting that despite mixed global growth, the US economy was showing some encouraging signs.Investors watch UPS closely for insights into the health of the global economy. The company delivers packages to companies and individuals around the world and at any moment moves about 2 per cent of global gross domestic product in its networks.In September UPS laid out ambitious growth targets for the coming years, aiming for an annual compounded earnings growth rate of 10 per cent to 15 per cent until the end of 2016, but warned that in 2012 it would likely experience below par growth.On Tuesday, UPS executives said that the outlook had improved somewhat since then and offered a better than expected forecast thanks in part to a record Christmas season and some promising long term trends in the US.For the full year 2012, UPS expects to earn between $4.75 and $5 per share, an increase of between 9 per cent and 15 per cent over the company’s 2011 earnings, thanks to steady revenue growth and improved productivity.“Recent economic news about slowing in Europe and Asia is in contrast to the more optimistic tone we are seeing here in the US…In spite of this macro outlook, UPS expects another strong year of earnings growth,” said Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer.Over the holiday period UPS broke internal records, delivering almost 500m packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Daily package volumes exceeded 27m packages on two days and 25m on five days, as online shopping took off.Mr Kuehn said he was more positive on the US economy, identifying a modest industrial “renaissance” as cheap energy, competitive labour costs and supply chain issues encourage companies to invest in domestic production.“There is a lot of discussion about ‘should the next unit of capacity be closer to home’… whether it’s floods or earthquakes, supply chains are very extended and can be fragile. And so we do see a lot of interest in near-sourcing,” he said.At the same Mr Kuehn said that although UPS was cautious on Europe, “part of the tone from our people at Davos was that business continues to go on and perhaps the core economy is a little more stable than the headlines would suggest.”For the three months to the end of December 2011, revenues grew about 6 per cent to $14.2bn compared with the same period in 2010 while net income dipped about 30 per cent to $720m, or about $0.74 per share.Last week, UPS said that it would switch to a mark-to-market pension accounting methodology in order to reduce the volatility of its results and present a “cleaner” picture of its underlying operational performance in 2012 and beyond.Excluding the one-off pension charges of $527m in 2011 and $43m in 2010, UPS reported earnings per share of about $1.28 as it benefited from solid US demand and improved productivity across the business. In early trading on Tuesday, UPS shares dipped about 1 per cent to $75.16.
209;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-01-26T11:00:54Z;Obama seeks to lift natural gas demand;;Plans to increase US demand for natural gas, including a new tax break for gas-fuelled trucks, are being unveiled by President Barack Obama on Thursday as part of the effort set out in his state of the union address to support “American-made energy”.The proposals, some of which will require legislation from a Congress that has been reluctant to endorse any of president Obama’s initiatives, include a new lease sale of offshore drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico, the second since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.The plans to strengthen gas demand follow a slump in the US gas price to a ten-year low last week. This was caused by the boom in reserves that were previously thought to be uneconomic, weak demand because of warmer weather than expected and the slow growth of the economy.Gas producing companies such as Chesapeake Energy and ConocoPhillips have been announcing plans to cut back their North American gas output.They are also hoping, however, that increased demand will help lift prices from their present levels of about $2.75 per million British thermal units.President Obama’s proposed tax break for trucks powered by gas or other alternative fuels would be worth half the difference in price between one of those trucks and a conventional diesel-powered vehicle.Among other proposals, he also wants a competitive grant programme to give funds to communities that come up with ways to break down the barriers to greater use of natural gas, support for investment in infrastructure such as filling stations and help for municipalities to switch to gas for their buses and trucks.With US crude oil at about $100 a barrel, gas is a much cheaper alternative.However, the growth of vehicles using natural gas as fuel has been restricted by the lack of infrastructure such as filling stations to give drivers the confidence that they will be able to refuel when they need to.President Obama will be making his speech at a UPS depot in Las Vegas, which has trucks powered by liquefied natural gas (super cooled to minus 162 degrees centigrade) in its fleet.UPS had been reluctant to deploy LNG-powered trucks in that area, the administration says, because of the lack of infrastructure, but the company was able to switch to gas after a filling station was opened in the city, thanks in part to help from the president’s 2009 stimulus package.Mr Obama has been stressing the value of US gas production in terms of job creation and the environmental benefits of burning gas rather than coal to generate power.The substitution of gas for oil in transport could help US energy security, given that oil imports are still running at almost 9m barrels a day.
210;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-01-25T19:13:59Z;D Post to appeal against EU ruling;Brussels to force the postal operator to repay €1bn of state aid to German government. Competition regulators determined to open up market;Deutsche Post on Wednesday assailed an “incomprehensible” Brussels decision to force the postal operator to repay up to €1bn of illegal state aid to the German government, a move that underlines the determination of competition regulators to open up the European market.The ruling from Joaquin Almunia, the European Union competition commissioner, is the latest twist in a decade-long legal battle over state support to Europe’s biggest mail service that has pitted Brussels against Berlin.Deutsche Post vowed to appeal against the judgement, which forces it to return German subsidies to pension payments that were found to be in breach of state aid rules. “Maintaining a level playing field is crucial in a sector that is just opening to competition,” said Mr Almunia.Since 1995, Germany has granted DP subsidies worth around €37bn to compensate for pension costs of civil servants. As a result, Deutsche Post has effectively benefitted since 2003 from social contribution rates that have been significantly lower than those of its competitors,” Mr Almunia said.The company said it would go to the European Court of Justice as the demand – which will cost it €500m-€1bn – stood “in clear contradiction” to other rulings and would prove to be invalid when examined by EU judges.“If you examine the state aid rulings on other European postal service providers, it becomes quite clear that here the Commission has applied double standards,” said Frank Appel, DP’s chief executive officer.According to DP, the Commission’s investigation touched on issues it had examined once before. That enquiry, harking back to 2002, ended in defeat for the Commission in 2010 when DP had the ruling against it overturned.In that appeals ruling, EU judges ordered the Commission to pay back the initial payment plus interest, or some €1b – a blow also to the companies that brought the complaints, UPS and other US private mail groups.The company said it expected the sum it would have to pay the Commission to “be at the lower end” of the €500m-€1bn range, stressing that it expected to receive this sum plus interest back after its appeal to EU judges.Given this, DP said, the payment due in the next few months would be recorded only in the company’s balance sheet for 2012. Earnings for 2011 and “in the years to come” would be “unaffected” by the ruling, it said.The ruling came as the EU concluded investigations into Germany, Belgium, France and Greece that cleared €5.6bn of German state aid to Deutsche Post between 1990 and 1995 and €1.9bn of French support to La Poste.Mr Almunia ordered Bpost, the Belgian state-controlled postal group, to reimburse €417m to the Belgian government for subsidies received in the period between 1992 and 2010. Further reimbursements for the period after 2010, during which Bpost has continued to receive state handouts, are also foreseen.The group, which is 49.9 per cent owned by private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, said it had ample cash reserves to make the payments, which are due to be made in the current quarter.“Bpost’s board will now check whether an appeal will be lodged at the European court,” said its chief executive, Johnny Thijs.
211;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-01-24T14:40:20Z;Case study: ‘We want users to feel they are appreciated’;Jane Bird finds out how DHL upgrades its service centres;One of the pleasures of shopping locally is being recognised and valued for your custom. DHL is trying to emulate this experience in the world of international parcel delivery.It sees customer service as the key to differentiating itself from competitors FedEx and UPS.“We want customers to feel we know and appreciate them because that is how we win their loyalty,” says David Richards, commercial systems director.“It may be a truism, but it really is easier to keep an existing customer than to go out and win a new one.”This is the goal of DHL’s global customer centre upgrade programme, launched last April, and being rolled out across 20 countries by 2013.Swift response is another aim. The company answers 90 per cent of calls in three rings on average, it says.This statistic masks the fact that response times are often quick in the morning, but can be up to three minutes by the end of the day, says Adam Faulkner, founding director of Sabio, the systems integration company implementing the DHL system.“Typically, when delays occur, call-centre staff start shouting for help answering the phones, by which time queues have already developed,” says Mr Faulkner.The new system predicts call volumes based on historical information so staff can be drafted in from other activities in advance of being needed.“This makes life better for agents too, because they are not talking to an irate customer who has been holding on for ages,” Mr Faulkner says.A priority is to route callers to agents they have previously spoken to, and new callers to someone who speaks their language, based on where the call originates. The goal is to increase the proportion of calls that are resolved first time and without transfers.Customers who have indicated a preference not to speak to a person will be automatically routed to interactive voice response. “We want to give them the choice,” says Mr Richards.Those who choose to contact DHL by email should also notice improved responsiveness thanks to prioritisation of emails, rather than simply answering them in turn.Customers who have queries when using DHL’s website will be able to click a “web chat” option, on trial in the US. The company is keeping a close eye on Facebook and Twitter in case customers want to be in touch that way.“Integration with social media would help agents know more about callers and respond in a more personalised way,” says Mr Richards. At present, callers are only identified by name.This year the company also plans to evaluate real time speech analytics. Software will identify key words and phrases used by customers during their conversations with agents, to understand their concerns.The idea is to escalate problems to managers while customers are talking to agents, says Mr Faulkner, “so we can respond immediately rather than agents or managers having to call people back”.Another plan is to reduce the number of screens agents need to consult when answering unrelated queries, for example on invoicing, shipment and bookings.“Getting everything on one screen might be a challenge, but we hope to minimise the number, so agents are able to deal with a broader range of queries more quickly,” says Mr Richards.
212;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-01-16T14:02:17Z;Debate grows over future of TNT Express;;When Netherlands-based postal company TNT split in two in May, separating its international express-mail arm from its Dutch regular mail arm, it represented a triumph of shareholder activism.A group of investors led by the American hedge fund Jana Partners had pressed relentlessly for the break-up, arguing that the spun-off international delivery company TNT Express would be worth more alone and would draw takeover bids from rivals UPS and FedEx.But seven months later, TNT Express is struggling, its share price is down 37 per cent and those activist shareholders have grown restless again. Critics say the company has stumbled in executing its ambitious plans to grow out of its European home market and expand into emerging markets.Now Jana, which together with Alberta Investment Partners (AIMCO) owns a 5 per cent stake of TNT Express, is demanding that the company add to its board of directors three executives it has recruited to streamline the firm and groom it for a takeover.The slate of proposed directors is led by Alan Jones, who headed TNT’s express mail division from 1999 to 2003. At the time, he was the superior of the current chief executive, Marie-Christine Lombard, and his return would be widely seen as a rebuke to her leadership.On Monday, TNT Express told Jana it did not object to the proposal in principle. But the company stopped short of endorsing the move, saying only it was “considering” approval. If the company declines to install the new board members, Jana says it will take the proposal directly to the annual shareholders’ meeting in April.That could trigger a sharp conflict between a management team that says it needs time to turn the company around and a group of shareholders whose main desire is to see it sold.It is not clear which side shareholders will come down on. Fund manager MacKenzie Cundill, which owns 4.5 per cent of TNT Express’s shares, and Franklin Mutual, which owns 1.9 per cent, both back Jana’s move to install the new directors.MacKenzie Cundill vice-president David Tiley said TNT Express’s private response to Jana did not go far enough.“In terms of full disclosure, it behoves the board of TNT Express to make those comments public to all shareholders,” Mr Tiley told the Financial Times.But the key lies with PostNL, the Dutch mail company formed out of TNT after the demerger, which retains a 29.9 per cent stake in its sister company.PostNL officially says it has confidence in TNT Express’s current board. But those with knowledge of its internal discussions say there is ongoing debate, and that chief executive Harry Koorstra might end up backing the move.TNT Express’s troubles are partly due to the slowdown in the European economy that began this summer. Delivery companies are bellwethers of the industrial economy, and as the leader in the European market (and fourth-largest delivery company globally) TNT is especially vulnerable to the downturn.But other problems are of the company’s own making. The worst have come in Brazil, where TNT acquired two local firms in 2010 as part of its global expansion into emerging markets.The company botched the integration of the firms, on-time delivery fell as low as 50 per cent, and clients switched to rival providers. TNT Express took a €132m impairment on its American operations in August.Mrs Lombard has personally taken supervision of the Brazil operations and promises to make them profitable by the second half of this year.Meanwhile, problems appeared this fall in another linchpin of the company’s emerging-markets strategy, China. TNT Express had acquired four 747s to serve its Europe-Asia routes and boasted of being the first international express company with direct flights to the new industrial hub of Chongqing.But those aircraft became a liability when China-Europe volumes plunged this autumn. The company’s high-fixed operating costs have cut into margins and it is now seeking to lease out two of its aircraft.Both in Europe and on international routes, customers have shifted from high-priced same- or next-day delivery to cheaper three-day deliveries. That cuts revenues by 30 per cent per package, and the shift is expected to continue with European countries implementing austerity measures this yearThe worsening outlook has strengthened analysts’ case that TNT Express’s most promising future lies in a takeover by FedEx or UPS. Both US-based companies would see substantial synergies from TNT Express’s strength in the European market.A Morgan Stanley report in November put the target price for TNT Express at €6.25 per share. Meanwhile, the report found the company’s value to a suitor such as FedEx could justify a takeover price of up to €9.65 per share.Jana hopes the move to add the new board members will serve as a signal to potential buyers that the company is serious about a sale. Besides Mr Jones, they include David Siegel, known for aggressive cost-cutting in the aviation industry and at Avis, and Thomas Delbrook, former head of mergers and acquisitions at UPS.But there have been no reports of concrete inquiries from either FedEx or UPS in years. Dutch analysts have wondered, if TNT Express is not attractive to its American sector-mates at its current depressed valuations, why it would be attractive if the stewardship of Mr Jones and other directors manages to raise share prices.Regardless of shareholders’ wishes, there may be no shortcut to putting TNT Express on a sounder footing.“They’ve got a couple of strategic problems that may or may not have been caused by the current management team,” said analyst Geert Steens of SNS Securities. “That doesn’t necessarily mean these can be solved overnight by putting a couple of extra people on the board.”But Mr Tiley said the problem was that management had not adjusted its vision to address shareholder desires for a takeover.“We are bemused by the absence of any public discussion or openness to the prospect of consolidation,” Mr Tiley said. “The entire point of the demerger was for there to be an unlocking of value in both companies.”
213;UPS;United Parcel Service;2012-01-16T14:02:17Z;Debate grows over future of TNT Express;;TNT Express, the Dutch express delivery company, has indicated it wants to avoid a direct conflict with activist shareholders and may accept their proposal to nominate three additional members to its board of directors.TNT has told Jana Partners it does not object in principle to the nomination of the new board members, which the hedge fund hopes will push the struggling company to move faster to streamline costs and open itself up for takeover bids.In a letter sent on Tuesday by TNT Express to Jana Partners, the company said it was still considering the proposal, but stopped short of endorsing it, a source who had seen the letter said.The proposed board members include Alan Jones, who was current chief executive Marie-Christine Lombard’s superior when he headed the express-mail division of the company (then known as TNT) from 1999-2003.If TNT Express eventually declines to endorse the new board members, Jana Partners, which together with Alberta Investment Partners (AIMCO) owns some 5 per cent of the company’s shares, says it will put them forward at the annual shareholder meeting in April. In that case approval will hinge on the votes of sister company PostNL, the Dutch mail deliverer, which retained a 29.9 per cent stake in TNT Express after the two companies demerged in May.That demerger was itself a triumph of Jana Partners’ activist philosophy. The hedge fund had pressed relentlessly for the break-up, arguing that a spun-off express-mail division would be worth more and draw takeover bids from rivals UPS and FedEx.TNT Express’s share price has fallen 38 per cent since the demerger on disappointing profit margins, and shareholders say management has been slow to shift gears. The new board members, who besides Mr Jones include former airline cost-cutter David Siegel and ex-UPS mergers and acquisitions chief Thomas Delbrook, are expected to groom the company for a takeover.There is active debate within PostNL over what position to take. Officially, the company says it wants to allow Mrs Lombard to execute her strategy and sees no need for new directors. Piet Klaver, chairman of PostNL’s board of directors, told the Dutch press last week that he had “full confidence in the current board of directors”.But those with knowledge of PostNL’s internal discussions said Mr Klaver had jumped the gun by committing the company to oppose the new directors. They said PostNL’s chief executive, Harry Koorstra, might yet end up backing the move.TNT Express is wrestling with the botched integration of two Brazilian delivery companies it acquired in 2010, and more recently with a collapse of demand on its China-Europe routes due to the economic downturn. Customers in Europe, where it is the sector leader, are switching from priority delivery to slower, cheaper products.
214;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-12-21T18:14:22Z;Cargo carriers escape new US pilot rules;;Cargo airlines run by companies such as United Parcel Service and FedEx will be exempt from new Federal Aviation Administration rules designed to reduce accidents due to pilot fatigue.The rules, which require pilots to rest more and work shorter stints and are the most extensive overhaul of pilot fatigue regulations in decades, were prompted in part by the Colgan Air crash near Buffalo, New York, in 2009 that killed 50 people.Since 2010, the prospect of new fatigue rules has caused consternation among airlines and air cargo operators who have argued that while well-intentioned, initial proposals were not based on scientific evidence and would impose considerable financial burdens.Airlines for America, the main lobby group for the US airline industry, forecast that the original proposal could have cost airlines as much as $20bn to implement over ten years, more than 15 times the FAA’s early estimate.Ray LaHood, secretary for transportation, described the new regulations on Wednesday as “a major safety achievement” that “raises the safety bar to prevent fatigue”. The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents about 53,000 pilots in the US and Canada, also broadly welcomed the new rules.But some unions reacted strongly to the cargo airline exemption. Captain Robert Travis, president of the Independent Pilots Association, which represents UPS pilots, criticised the FAA for succumbing to “intense industry lobbying”.“Giving air cargo carriers the choice to opt-in to new pilot rest rules makes as much sense as allowing truckers to ‘opt-out’ of drunk driving laws,” Mr Travis said.Steve Alterman, president of the Cargo Airline Association, which represents companies such as FedEx Express and UPS, rejected those assertions, stating that “the US aviation industry is not a unified whole and one size does not fit all”.In response to some 8,000 comments, the FAA scaled back its final regulations, substantially reducing new training requirements and exempting all-cargo operators from the rules entirely despite an earlier commitment to imposing a uniform industry standard.“Covering cargo operators under the new rule would be too costly compared to the benefits generated in this portion of the industry,” the FAA said, adding that it would encourage “cargo operators to opt into the new rule voluntarily”.The new rules will impose considerable change on the passenger airline industry. Pilots’ maximum duty hours will be reduced, rest time will be increased and they will also have to certify their “fitness for duty” before each flight segment.As a result of the changes, the FAA estimates the rules will cost the industry about $390m to implement over the next ten years but will bring as much as $470m in benefits due to a reduction in fatigue-related accidents.
215;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-12-15T21:47:19Z;FedEx results boost Wall Street;FedEx boosted by strong earnings;Shares in FedEx climbed 8 per cent to $83.47 after the package delivery service reported earnings for the three months ended November 30 that were 76 per cent higher than last year.“It’s good news for the domestic economy, and especially good news for anyone tied to eCommerce,” said Donald Broughton at Avondale Partners. “Management were clear that the incremental volume increase in ground shipping was due to a surge in eCommerce orders.”But sales rose much less than earnings, just 10 per cent year-on-year, and some analysts said there was little read across from the FedEx results to the wider economy.“A lot of investors look at FedEx as primarily a macro-driven stock that’s sensitive to volumes, but since DHL exited the US, the delivery market is effectively a duopoly. What we are seeing is FedEx and UPS pricing rationally to maintain earnings even if volumes are soft,” said Peter Nesvold at Jefferies.FedEx’s performance boosted shares in Amazon, which climbed 0.6 per cent to $181.26, but not Ebay, which fell 2.6 per cent to $29.60, on market chatter that December volumes on the auction site have been disappointing so far.Elsewhere, US stocks snapped three days of selling to eke out gains after new jobless claims fell to a three-year low.The S&P 500 climbed 0.3 per cent to 1,215.83, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 11,870.02. The Nasdaq Composite index climbed just 0.1 per cent to 2,541.01 as tech stocks had a poor day.Apple slipped 0.3 per cent to $378.94 as investors continued to fret that Intel’s move into hard drive-free ultrabook computers could impact sales of Apple products. “We think competitors’ ultrabooks need to fall below $800 before they start taking market share from Apple’s MacBook air, or offering an alternative to tablets such as the iPad,” said Ashok Kumar, tech analyst at Rodman and Renshaw.Solar shares continued to bleed on Thursday after Wednesday’s profit warning by First Solar added to fears of over supply and cost competition in the global solar panel industry.First Solar shares were down another 6 per cent to $31.45, after falling more than 20 per cent on Wednesday. Stephen Chin at UBS was unconvinced by the company’s plans to cut factory utilisation to 80 per cent and concentrate on developing large solar farms for sale to electricity utilities.“We believe First Solar may need to consider shutting down more capacity if it is unable to win more big projects,” he told clients.MEMC Electronic Materials, which manufactures wafers for use in solar panels, fell 5.2 per cent to $3.71. That left the tech sector of the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent, along with energy stocks, the only sector of the benchmark index to close in the red.Novellus Systems popped 16.3 per cent to $40.37 after Lam Research agreed to purchase the company for about $3.3bn in stock. The combination of two of the biggest companies in the semiconductor space is a challenge to market leader Applied Materials, which slipped 1.4 per cent to $10.19. Shares in Lam fell 8.4 per cent to $36.17.Morgan Stanley shares ticked down fractionally to $15.02 after the investment bank announced it will slash 1,600 jobs, or about 2.6 per cent of its global workforce, in the first quarter of 2012.Goldman Sachs was off 1.4 per cent to $91.97, as Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, predicted another downbeat quarter for investment banking revenues with markets volatile.“Overall, we think [the fourth quarter] will be another quarter that banks will prefer to forget,” Mr Staite told clients.Banks with strong retail franchises outperformed the market, with Bank of America climbing 0.7 per cent to $5.27 and JPMorgan Chase up 0.8 per cent to $31.77.Capital One slipped 2.9 per cent to $43.05 after the credit card company said net charge offs of bad debt rose to 4.29 per cent in November from 3.96 per cent in October.Shares in Michael Kors, an upmarket fashion and accessories brand, jumped 21 per cent to $24.20 on their first day of trading after the biggest ever US fashion IPO.

216;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-12-04T17:39:17Z;Deutsche Post pins hopes on e-commerce;;Email may be killing the traditional paper-and-ink letter but Deutsche Post DHL, Germany’s privatised post office, now believes the internet will bring it more joy than sorrow, especially around Christmas. While a wire can carry words, it cannot – at least just yet – deliver presents, food or drink.Deutsche Post says letter volumes will decline by an annual 2-3 per cent in coming years, but expects its domestic parcels business to thrive as big investments in sorting machines and services persuade more people to buy on the internet – and online vendors to use Deutsche Post for shipping.“E-commerce is interesting, because we currently seem to buy only the things we can easily pocket – books and CDs,” says Frank Appel, chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times on the 40th floor of Deutsche Post DHL’s vertiginous glazed headquarters in Bonn. “But why not buy bottles over the web? Why buy clothes but not toothpaste on the internet? Things will really change.”Deutsche Post handles 2.7m domestic parcels a day – 5.4m in the run-up to Christmas – and is struggling to keep up. With e-commerce expected to boost domestic volumes 5 per cent annually over the next few years, the company plans to invest €750m by 2014 to more than double its automated parcel sorting capacity to an hourly 50,000 units. “We expect to hit our limits soon,” says Mr Appel.Deutsche Post DHL emerged from the cocoon of state ownership 11 years ago, on 20 November 2000. With European postal markets being opened only slowly, Deutsche Post had time to use monopoly profits to prepare for life after the end of its special status on 1 January 2008.“The Germans allowed Post to keep its monopoly long enough to produce the money it needed to restructure,” Mr Appel says of a plan which drew criticism from commercial rivals like UPS and FedEx.Apart from restructuring its domestic postal operation, Deutsche Post took a leap into international waters in 2002 when it bought logistics group DHL. Although DHL spectacularly failed to build a US domestic express network, it has shored up its position as a fast-growing cross-border specialist.While the number of employees in Germany has fallen from 227,000 to 203,000 over the past decade, Post’s overseas workforce has grown from 97,000 to 267,000. “We’re well on the road to having a stable profit contribution from the domestic mail services and steady growth in international logistics,” Mr Appel says, praising successive German governments for not interfering when jobs or branches were axed.“There’s luck involved,” Mr Appel says, particularly in reference to Post’s performance at home. “But maybe fortune does favour the bold.” In his view, the company profited from Germany’s e-commerce surge as it had invested in infrastructure and services. “If you’re service isn’t good, you can’t do B2C [business-to-consumer].”Despite the gloom settling on the global economy, Mr Appel is also ebullient about the prospects for DHL, which has in past years focused on its strengths as an international logistics group by shedding domestic operations. Express mail should grow up to twice as fast as the global economy, he says.While the company’s biggest rivals, UPS and FedEx of the US, were betraying the first signs of dizziness at the prospect of global recession, Mr Appel a few weeks ago raised slightly Deutsche Post’s 2010 forecast for its international DHL franchise, as well as for its domestic letters and parcels operation.“Express is our fastest growing business. We’re strong in the fastest-growing markets – Asia and the Middle East – which means we can profit over-proportionally,” Mr Appel says. As the costs of building a network are high, big new rivals alongside the US duo and Dutch TNT are unlikely, he adds. “It’s not like manufacturing, where a Chinese company can decide to compete with you tomorrow.”Mr Appel insists he does not see a recession looming – although he also does not completely dismiss the danger given economic uncertainties. One result of this is that companies are manufacturing on demand and not filling inventories. “This suggests that if a downturn comes, the landing will be soft,” he says.If consumers keep spending, he says, “we could even see air cargo and express shipments rise as companies, who have kept inventories cautiously low, try to get products to clients before Christmas”.Mr Appel is clearly looking forward to Deutsche Post’s busiest time of the year. “Germany had tonnes of snow last year – and loads of first-time internet shoppers,” he said. “If it’s a white Christmas, do your shopping on the web and we’ll deliver. I like a white Christmas. Who would want a grey one?”
217;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-11-30T17:35:25Z;Excess capacity depresses air cargo earnings;;Figures from some of the most important companies in the air cargo industry predict that surging deliveries of new aircraft will depress already slumping earnings in the sector – and could push some carriers out of business.The forecasts reinforce the mostly gloomy message of recent statistics from IATA, the international aviation trade body, which showed air freight capacity was 1.8 per cent greater in October than in September 2010 but 4.8 per cent less freight was carried. Such divergences generally depress what carriers can charge. Air cargo accounts for 35 per cent of world trade by value.Air cargo operators are taking delivery of large numbers of aircraft ordered before the 2008 economic crisis, some of which suffered long manufacturing delays. They include Boeing’s 777 freighter and 747-8F, and Airbus’s A330-200F. Air cargo demand generally weakens as the world economy slows down, as shippers decide to move goods more slowly and cheaply by sea – a phenomenon that IATA research has detected in recent months.Michael Jones, a senior manager at UPS, the logistics company that also operates one of the world’s largest air cargo fleets, said the new aircraft deliveries would bring down prices. UPS makes around 80 per cent of its shipments on other carriers’ aircraft and carries the remainder on its own flights.“We may see that we are able to sell our bulk space for a little less but we buy additional capacity for a lower rate at times,” Mr Brown said.Robert van de Weg, senior vice-president for sales and marketing for Luxembourg’s Cargolux, one of the world’s largest all-cargo airlines, said his company was moving aircraft from the struggling Asia to US and Europe routes to those with continuing growth. Cargolux last month became the first airline to receive a 747-8F, although Mr van de Weg said such pure cargo aircraft were playing a smaller role in creating overcapacity than new passenger aircraft.“It’s the consumer goods to Europe and the US that aren’t moving,” Mr van de Weg said. “The exports from Europe to the US and the imports into Asia and the US are really quite strong.”However, one significant customer, Bruno Sidler, chief operating officer of Netherlands-based Ceva Logistics, said he expected the slump in rates, which started falling a year ago, to last for at least another six months and force some carriers into insolvency.“Everybody thinks there’s going to be a pick-up in the second half of 2012 – but everybody is extremely bearish on the first two quarters,” Mr Sidler said. “I think some people will go out of business.”
218;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-11-13T16:58:17Z;Airlines poor on ‘soft’ issues, says PwC;;Airlines are doing a poor job of keeping shareholders informed about a range of “soft” measures that can affect the bottom line, from carbon emissions to customer service and board diversity.The industry lags behind other sectors such as mining or oil and gas at consistent and relevant sustainability reporting, according to research by PwC, with fewer than four in 10 of the top 100 airlines by revenues issuing even the most rudimentary of reports.A study by the consultancy found that of those companies which do publish sustainability reports, none were considered “excellent” on criteria including clarity, reliability and “contextual consistency” – meaning readers would find it difficult, if not impossible, to compare one company with another.“The compliance commitment of the airline industry is very good,” said Klaus-Dieter Ruske, a PwC expert on transport and logistics, citing airlines’ ability to follow safety and other regulatory guidelines. “But they’re clearly behind in terms of reporting on sustainability.”Even carbon emissions, the measure most clearly linked to financial performance through fuel costs and emissions trading schemes, were poorly detailed in many of the 46 reports studied.“For those that do report fuel efficiency, the level of detail varies widely – and so do the definitions of how data is calculated,” wrote the report’s authors. They argued customers would struggle to choose an airline on the basis of fuel efficiency.The Global Reporting Initiative, a non-profit organisation, has already created a reporting standard for airport operators, and the European Commission’s inclusion next year of aviation in its emissions trading scheme (ETS) could add pressure for something similar for carriers. International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways and Iberia, said last week that ETS costs would reach €90m in the first year.The PwC study also found companies were inconsistent or lacking in transparency about gender diversity in management teams and on boards, about noise pollution, and about lost baggage, service disruption and customer complaints, in spite of evidence that these factors can have an impact on financial performance.Mr Ruske said the reports were all weak at making the data they did provide relevant to readers. “It seems they are happy with all the numbers they can produce, but you should know why you are reporting on those numbers. What do my stakeholders want? What are my peers doing? What do my shareholders want?”He said publicly listed airlines tended to do a better job than state-backed carriers. The highest quality reports, in PwC’s judgment, were issued by six airlines: Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines, Iberia, Chile’s LAN Airlines, Lufthansa, US budget carrier Southwest Airlines and the freight business UPS.
219;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-11-09T17:33:11Z;Deutsche Post;The mail and express delivery group is beating expectations, with room for outperformance;It would be difficult to find a better bellwether for the state of Europe’s economy than Deutsche Post. Since the start of 2010, its shares have almost exactly tracked the Euro Stoxx 50 index, falling by 21 per cent. But with a second European credit crunch descending, and a recession looming, Europe’s biggest mail and express delivery group was even beating expectations, raising its full-year profit forecast and sounding fairly relaxed about 2012 on Wednesday. Time for a little stock market outperformance, perhaps?There are two good reasons for the company’s optimism. The first is the strong showing of the DHL express division in Asia-Pacific, where a long-established presence gives it a market share that outstrips peers such as UPS or FedEx. Underlying express sales – which account for almost a quarter of Deutsche Post’s total – were up 13 per cent in the third quarter, driven by business within Asia and from the US into that region. The second is more surprising: a stellar performance by the German-based parcel business as online shopping expands. Third-quarter parcel volumes were up 11.4 per cent from a year ago, helping to lift overall mail division revenues by 2.6 per cent to €3.37bn. That was enough for Deutsche Post to nudge up its full-year guidance for earnings before interest and tax to more than €2.4bn, from €2.3-€2.4bn.It insists that its business should outpace global economic output and that underlying revenues will continue to grow. Investors will want to weigh such optimism against signs of weakness in the global forwarding and freight division, which reported “significant cooling-off” in air freight and a dip in ocean freight revenues. But Deutsche Post shares, trading on less than 10 times full-year earnings, are not expensive relative to UPS (over 16 times) and FedEx (almost 13). Plenty of room there for some outperformance.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
220;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-11-09T07:42:29Z;Deutsche Post receives fillip from DHL growth;;German mail and logistics group Deutsche Post on Wednesday raised its full-year business forecast amid profits from efficiency gains, internet-driven growth in its domestic parcel business, and fast-growing delivery volumes in Asia.The Bonn company said it now expected 2011 earnings before interest and taxes to exceed €2.4bn ($3.3bn) compared with a previous forecast of €2.3bn, with both domestic mail and DHL logistics contributing to the rise.Frank Appel, chief executive, said Deutsche Post would continue to profit from recent drives to increase efficiency and customer service at home and abroad and “would raise margins even as the recent economic momentum declines”.With this year’s operating earnings expected to rise at least 9 per cent from 2010, Mr Appel also said he was “cautiously optimistic” about growth in 2012 – even if economic and market uncertainty made a more precise forecast impossible.With that Mr Appel sounded more optimistic than Dutch rival TNT Express, which recently issued a profit warning, and US rivals UPS and FedEx. The latter recently warned about the “challenging economic environment” ahead.Group sales rose 2.5 per cent to €13.1bn in the third quarter, while ebit climbed 18.5 per cent to €646m. Net profit jumped 70.4 per cent to €385m in part because of the completion of the sale of Postbank to Deutsche Bank.Deutsche Post has worked hard to build DHL into a global provider of supply chain, shipping, and express-parcel services in order to cushion the end of much of its German mail monopoly in the course of European Union liberalisation.Mr Appel said Deutsche Post’s domestic letter and parcel service would profit this and next year from a deal with its union allowing it to hire new recruits for less pay, and from an unbroken trend towards more web-based shopping in Germany.Deutsche Post delivered 205m parcels in Germany in the third quarter, an increase of 11.4 per cent. This helped raise the domestic mail unit’s quarterly ebit 17.5 per cent to €257m, with annual ebit now expected to stabilise at €1bn.Only 8 per cent of German retail sales are made online, but Mr Appel said he expected web sales to grow to reach the low double-digit range and Deutsche Post planned to double its parcel-sorting capacity over the medium-term to handle this.After pulling out of the US domestic delivery market, DHL has focused on its international footprint, connecting the US, Europe and Asia, but also pan-European and, increasingly, pan-Asian services for boxes big and small.“You’ll find us where growth is also strongest,” Mr Appel said in a statement. “That means in emerging markets in Asia, in the Middle East, and in Latin America, as well as in the fast-growing parcel market in Germany.”According to Deutsche Post, DHL is Asian market leader for international express-delivery items, taking some 36 per cent of the Asia-Pacific market, ahead of FedEx with 21 per cent and UPS with 10 per cent – with scope to continue growing.DHL’s express service carried 526,000 parcels a day in the quarter, up 11 per cent on the year. DHL’s three units saw operating profit grow 15.2 per cent to €382m in the quarter, with Deutsche Poste expecting them to reach €1.7bn for the year.
221;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-10-25T12:48:43Z;UPS profits rise on higher prices;;United Parcel Service warned there were signs of slowing global growth due to decelerating technology exports from Asia as the global package delivery company reported strong third-quarter results and said the US economy had stabilised.In recent months, executives at UPS and also at FedEx, its main US rival, have trimmed their expectations for economic growth, blaming political gridlock in Washington and Brussels for undermining business confidence and in turn hurting the economic recovery.On Tuesday, Scott Davis, chief executive of UPS, offered investors a mixed outlook. “There is increasing uncertainty in the global economic environment. Most notably exports from Asia which slowed significantly during the quarter,” he said.“On the other hand, it appears that the US economy has stabilised and continues to show modest growth,” Mr Davis said. “In general, we are probably a little more optimistic than we were one or two months ago.”UPS executives pointed to a series of recent economic reports showing better retail sales, lower unemployment claims and an increase in bank loans for the company’s slightly more positive view on the US economy.At the same time, Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer of UPS, said the company could see a boost over the holiday season. Retailers have reduced their inventories, he said, so if sales improve they might have to use express air services to get hold of the goods they need.Indeed, despite being cautious about the outlook, in September UPS laid out an ambitious five-year growth plan, telling investors that the company would achieve an annual compounded earnings growth rate of 10 to 15 per cent until 2016.Investors watch UPS closely for insights into the health of the global economy. The company delivers packages to tens of thousands of companies and individuals around the world and at any moment moves about 2 per cent of global gross domestic product in its networks.For the three months to the end of September, net income at UPS rose about 5 per cent to $1bn compared with the same period in 2010, giving earnings per share of about $1.06. Excluding the gain from a property sale in the third quarter of 2010, earnings per share rose 14 per cent.Sales climbed 8 per cent to about $13.2bn compared with the same period in 2010. The results came in slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations. Analysts had forecast that earnings per share of $1.04 on sales of about $13.1bn.During the quarter, UPS was able to push up prices for delivery packages in the US and benefited from demand for its logistics services as companies looked to cut costs by outsourcing more of their supply chain operations.The group’s international operations, however, hit some turbulence during the quarter. Companies in Asia exported fewer smartphones and other electronic devices to the US, leaving UPS with too much capacity, denting operating margins. UPS said it expected exports to “firm up” in the fourth quarter.UPS shares, which are down about 4 per cent over the year to date, fell almost 2 per cent to $69.56 in early trading.

But, for some business owners, it has been the only option.Take EuroTalk, which sells language lesson software, covering 130 different mother tongues in more than 16,000 combinations – so that a Zulu speaker, if he or she so wished, could learn Icelandic.Since founders Dick Howeson and Andrew Ashe started 20 years ago, with a programme developed in Ashe’s living room to run on a Commodore computer, they have travelled the world – selling first CD-ROMs and now downloadable software and smartphone apps.In EuroTalk’s last financial year, 83 per cent of its £2.3m turnover came from sales outside the UK, earning it £730,000 in pre-tax profit.But selling abroad is not just a good way to increase your potential market size, it can also act as a hedge against problems in other markets, according to Howeson.“Although global financial turmoil has had an impact, it tends to affect different countries at different times so, luckily, our global coverage has a smoothing effect,” he explains. “Also, we believe that our healthy respect for supposedly small markets has made us more resilient to downturns.”One of his main tips is to get a good distribution company. “We charge people for shipping but we get really good prices from our shipper, UPS,” he says. “Sometimes, we will ship for free, depending on who it is, because that little bit of encouragement goes a long way.”As well as building trust with customers, exporters have to be generous in offering good credit terms to those who have proved they can pay, Howeson adds.“We normally make people pay upfront the first time on credit card and, after that, we will give them credit terms. In the early days, we didn’t ask for letters of credit and we just took it on trust. The same Japanese guy we started with still buys from us 19 years on.”EuroTalk may be able to take more risks than others due to its high margins. One of its CD-ROMs costs 10p to produce. By the time it is packaged, the cost has risen to £1. However, EuroTalk is able to sell this for £8.“Don’t risk what you cannot afford to risk,” Howeson advises. “But, if you have got a feel for a customer, risk what you can afford to risk.”Making people pay on time is important, though – not just for your own cash flow but to maintain good relations, Howeson adds. “If people owe you money, they will be embarrassed and won’t order any more product. When people have money problems, they will order from people they have credit with.”Another of Howeson’s rules is to remember that the customer is always right. “If a customer is not happy [with a product], for any reason, we send them a new one.”Another entrepreneur who has found exporting thrust upon him is Richard O’Connor, who co-founded Chocolateandlove.com – an upmarket chocolate business – two years ago with his Danish fiancé Birgitte Hovmand.Although it is early days for the business, it already gets 20 per cent of its revenue from exports to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the US, France and Belgium – primarily because the UK market for such a niche, and expensive, product is not large enough.O’Connor says that the most difficult challenge was finding the right partner for each country. “If you know nothing about the country or have no contacts there, it can be daunting to export,” he admits. “We were fortunate enough to meet someone who has been in this world for a while and she gave us some great contacts.”Chocolateandlove.com has benefited from the fact that the global fine food community is a relatively tight-knit group, with a fair degree of mutual support. “When you are trusted in this market, there are quite a few people who will help you,” he says. Having broken into a few markets, Chocolateandlove.com has also been approached by trade bodies in other countries to exhibit at events.O’Connor’s other tip is to get yourself a trophy client, who can act as validation of your worth in each market.In the UK, Chocolateandlove.com sells products at Harvey Nichols, for instance. This has helped the business get its chocolate stocked in 40 independent delis across the country. It worked in Denmark, too, thanks to a deal with Magasin Du Nord in Copenhagen.Exporting can deliver more than just revenue, however. A study of UK companies carried out by Imperial College London found that firms beginning to export gained a 34 per cent productivity uplift – and those that exported were 11.4 per cent more likely to survive a recession.Another survey of 400 companies by Aston University found that exporting companies also spent an additional £65,000 on research and development. In fact, UK-owned exporters contribute disproportionately to the value of R&D conducted in the UK, accounting for nearly twice as large a portion of R&D as their share of UK GDP would predict.Even so, many UK businesses have yet to take the plunge into exporting. Bruce Johnstone, who lectures in entrepreneurship at Cranfield University, says the most basic error potential exporters make is to do nothing. “Fail to globalise and you could be missing out on your best opportunity to grow your business,” he says.
223;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-09-22T12:44:43Z;FedEx warns of ‘challenging’ economic environment;;Shares in FedEx tumbled by up to 10 per cent on Thursday after the international package delivery company trimmed its full-year profit expectations, blaming a slump in consumer confidence that it said was damaging the US economy.“We expect sluggish economic growth will continue largely due to a lack of confidence that US and European policymakers will effectively address current economic challenges,” Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, told investors.Mr Smith said FedEx was not forecasting another recession in the US, but his comments will reinforce investor concerns about the health of the global economy. FedEx is a closely watched economic barometer because it delivers freight and packages to companies and individuals around the world.Michael Glenn, executive vice-president of market development and corporate communications, said the company had cut its forecasts for US gross domestic product to reflect recent downward adjustments to historical GDP numbers but also a sharp fall in consumer confidence during the debate on the US’s debt ceiling.“Make no mistake about it. A lot of what we’re dealing with today is sentiment based. There’s some sound, underlying economic issues …but we’ve got to turn around this sentiment in order to see some growth beyond what we are expecting right now,” he said.FedEx executives admitted that they had been caught out by slower-than-expected demand for express deliveries, particularly in Asia, in the first quarter of the fiscal 2012 year. “Simply stated, we put capacity out anticipating traffic that did not materialise,” Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said.FedEx cut its full-year profit forecast from between$6.35 and $6.85 a share to between $6.25 and $6.75, but Ed Wolfe, at Wolfe Trahan, wrote in a note to clients that those numbers were likely to be still too optimistic, potentially setting FedEx up to miss earnings expectations later in the year.Mr Smith and his team insisted that they had taken action to cut costs and trim capacity. Those moves, combined with price increases, will help FedEx to “improve earnings, margins and cash flows this fiscal year”, Mr Smith said.During the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, revenues at FedEx climbed 11 per cent to $10.5bn compared with the same period a year earlier helped by a jump in sales and operating profits at its ground transportation unit that offset weaker performance in the express segment.For the three months to the end of August, net income rose 22 per cent to $464m, or $1.46 a share, up from $1.20 a share in the same period a year earlier. Analysts were expecting FedEx to earn $1.45 a share on sales of about $10.3bn.In morning trading, FedEx shares, which have fallen more than 25 per cent since the start of the year as the global economic outlook has weakened, were down about 8.5 per cent at $66.36.
224;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-09-20T21:59:00Z;Politicians dodge the details in US tax debate;;Democrats and Republicans have claimed that reforming America’s outdated tax system is at the forefront of their respective agendas on Capitol Hill, but politicians on both side of the aisle are playing a subtle game of chicken that may undermine the chances for change.The White House, which this week presented a deficit reduction and tax reform package that it said would ultimately lower rates on corporate and individual taxpayers, has so far been conspicuously silent on the one detail the business community wants to see: the new target tax rate that the Obama administration would be willing to agree to make the US more competitive. Instead, Barack Obama has centred his message on the need to extract more tax revenue from wealthy Americans and some corporations and make the tax system more “fair”.At the same time, Republican leaders have called for a decrease in US tax rates from 35 to 25 per cent but offered scant details on how the US Treasury might pay for such a change. John Boehner, the Republican speaker, has said that he would support closing some corporate tax loopholes and deductions in exchange for a rate decrease but has not been forthcoming on exactly which individual and corporate tax perks he would be willing to scrap.While there appears to be recognition among both parties that the only politically feasible way tax rates can will be lowered systematically for individuals and corporations is if many special loopholes and deductions are cleared out, neither side has shown willingness to be the first to make concessions.One top business lobbyist told the Financial Times that companies at the centre of the tax reform debate were not willing to go to Capitol Hill and offer up their own tax breaks for sacrifice unless they have an indication that the White House was prepared to make a serious cut to corporate tax rates.Timothy Geithner, US Treasury secretary, on Monday said the Treasury would be releasing “broad proposals” on corporate tax reform that would make the country more competitive and strengthen incentives for investing before the end of the year. But he also added that the administration’s strategy on tax reform would be guided by “how to make sure we maximise the chances of reform coming on sensible terms”.He told Bloomberg that it was “hard to tell” whether changes to the corporate tax system had a greater than 50 per cent chance of passing in Congress.The tax debate has been complicated by divisions within corporate America on what kinds of reforms would be most beneficial. While some companies, led by Cisco, Apple and Pfizer, are pushing for a temporary “repatriation holiday” that would allow the companies to bring back hundreds of billions of dollars in profits earned oversees at a rate as low as 5.25 per cent, senior White House officials have suggested their campaign is a non-starter. They argue that the poor job market is not correlated to lack of US profits and that there is no evidence that such a change in tax policy would encourage growth.On Tuesday another group of companies, including United Parcel Service, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, announced the creation of a new coalition supporting an overall decrease in tax rates.“A lower corporate tax rate will boost investment in the US, bringing more American jobs, innovation and growth,” executives from the companies said in a letter to Mr Obama.
225;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;Cargo operators: Hopeful despite downturn;;"When an Icelandic volcanic eruption closed large swaths of northern European air space in April last year, there were dire predictions of the effects on the wider economy: supermarkets would run out of imported food; consumer goods from Asia would quickly run low.In the event, the consequences underlined air freight’s role as a niche mover of a small number of key products – it accounts for 0.5 per cent of the UK’s trade by weight but 25 per cent by value. The most seriously affected customers were some Japanese car manufacturers, which had to halt production after supplies of a tiny but vital sensor made in Ireland dried up. Everyday supplies – which continued to move by sea – were largely unaffected.The role of handling the most urgent, high-value goods has made air freight one of the most financially volatile segments of a world logistics industry that has been flying through severe turbulence ever since the start of the world financial crisis. As in container shipping, its problems look set to grow still more severe as the arrival of new capacity, ordered during the pre-2008 boom, is delivered in the face of a new downturn in demand.The hopes of the sector – made up of logistics companies such as the US’s UPS and FedEx, the cargo operations of passenger airlines such as Dubai’s Emirates and Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific, and cargo specialists such as Taiwan’s Eva Air and Luxembourg’s Cargolux – lie with the western world’s continued demand for high-fashion electronic products, such as Apple’s iPad. They are routinely flown from Asian manufacturing centres to Europe and North America. The industry must also trust that the gradual shift of manufacturing in China westwards, away from the country’s coasts, will encourage air cargo demand.Bruno Sidler, chief operating officer of Netherlands-based Ceva Logistics, says the industry has experienced an “absolute rollercoaster” since the start of the downturn. The 2008 fall – traffic in December 2008 was 22.6 per cent down on the previous year– was followed by a sharp rebound, then a steady decline which began in the third quarter of 2010.“I’ve been in this industry for almost three decades,” Mr Sidler says. “We have always had our ups and downs – but nowhere near what we’ve seen since 2008.”The key risk for air freight operators is that they will be unable to cover the high costs of operating their aircraft from the relatively small pool of cargo expensive or urgent enough to have to fly. Some logistics industry figures have even suggested that the economic downturn has prompted the shifting of some airborne goods to sea, although the slowing down of many containerships to save on fuel costs in the same period may have put a brake on the process.Professor Alan Braithwaite, an experienced logistics consultant, says companies are constantly struggling to reduce air freight use.“With a few exceptions, like iPads and pharmaceuticals, it’s a distressed purchase,” he says. “Their goods have been left behind again by the ship and have to catch up. For whatever reason, air freight is the only solution to save 15 days or whatever.”Mr Sidler agrees that volumes are currently dropping – “the situation is quite dramatic”, he says.However, he says that many companies’ recent reduction of their stock levels has encouraged some of them to turn to air freight more in emergencies.Prof Braithwaite insists there is, nevertheless, growing interest in one alternative to flying goods all the way from Asia to Europe. Some importers now send them by sea to Dubai, where the new, freight-only Jebel Ali airport neighbours the emirate’s vast port. The goods are transferred from the ship to aircraft waiting to fly them all over Europe. Mr Sidler suspects that this option is likely to become seriously popular only when rates to send cargo on aircraft rise from their current miserable levels.Rates, Mr Sidler adds, are unlikely to rise soon because deliveries of three new models of cargo aircraft – Boeing’s 777F, launched in 2009, Airbus’s A330-200F, launched last year, and Boeing’s 747-8F, whose first much-delayed models should be handed on September 19 to Luxembourg’s Cargolux – create further capacity.“It remains a real struggle for various players to sustain business,” Mr Sidler says. “Unfortunately, it’s really compounded by the fact that a lot of new capacity is coming in.”Yet, while Mr Sidler expects at least the next six to eight months to be “extremely difficult” for air cargo operators, one long-term trend could provide at least some of the demand needed to soak up the vast excess supply now being delivered.After years of discussion about the possibility that Chinese manufacturing would move away from the highly-developed coasts into the country’s under-developed west, contract electronics manufacturers are starting to make the move. The shift poses enormous challenges for the logistics industry because the new factories will be as much as 1,500km from established coastal logistics systems.But, Mr Sidler says, customers’ reluctance to wait the extra time it will take to deliver such goods by road and sea should mean the move is a rare piece of good news in the current environment for struggling air cargo operators.“People are not prepared to make any compromises,” Mr Sidler says. “All the factories that moved got the message, “Whatever you do, we’re not prepared to wait any longer’.”"
226;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;UPS sets ambitious growth targets;;United Parcel Service, the international package delivery company, has laid out ambitious growth targets for the next five years even as top executives have said the current global economic environment remains “dicey” and could be sluggish for several years to come.Speaking on Thursday at the company’s first investor day for more than three years, Scott Davis, chief executive, said that UPS was “on the move” but noted that the economy had been on a “bumpy ride that may likely continue”.“We took a hit in 2009 but we bounced back quickly,” Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, told investors. He said that UPS would achieve an annual compounded earnings growth rate of 10 per cent to 15 per cent until the end of 2016, even “with the scenario of a continued sluggish economy”.“The resilience of UPS, the breadth of the business model, minimises the impact of slow economic growth [and] allows us to adapt,” Mr Kuehn said. “We are confident it will allow us to grow [earnings per share] across the vast majority of economic scenarios.”During the recession, UPS suffered as international and domestic trade volumes declined. But actions to restructure its US network, increase prices and tap growth in Asia helped the company bounce back strongly, in spite of the fragile economy.Driven by demand trends, new technologies and improved operations, UPS expects revenues to increase to between $72bn and $79bn by 2016, up from $49.5bn in 2010, while earnings will be between $6.90 and $8.60 a share, up from $3.48 per share.In July, UPS was among the first companies to warn that the US economy had stalled. Mr Kuehn said UPS had been prescient but as a result the company’s share price slipped and remains down about 9 per cent over the year to date. It was almost flat in Thursday trading.Flush with cash, UPS said it had increased its share repurchases substantially. During the quarter so far, UPS has bought about $1.1bn of its own stock and intends to purchase $2.7bn of stock over the full year and $8bn of stock between 2012 and 2014.On Thursday, Mr Kuehn said performance at UPS’s domestic unit was “slow but stable”, that volumes in Asia had been slower than expected, and warned that US economic growth could be “sub-par” for the next year or two.Still, UPS management insisted the company was well positioned to outperform regardless of the slow-growth economic backdrop. The company expects to achieve record earnings per share in 2011 even if it only hits the bottom end of its forecasts.Mr Scott said that UPS’s competitive position had improved significantly in the past three years thanks to the decision by Deutsche Post DHL, a German competitor, to withdraw from the US market and ongoing problems at TNT, a Dutch rival.Over the long term, Mr Scott said that UPS would benefit from key macro trends. The value of global trade will jump from $10,000bn in 2007 to $70,000bn by 2025, while healthcare companies will boost spending on logistics from $80bn this year to $110bn in 2021.To tap that growth, UPS plans to spend more than $500m in the next two years to expand its international facilities, including $200m on its hub in Cologne, Germany.Separately on Thursday, Deutsche Post said it would spend €750m over the next few years to modernise its German parcel network.
227;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;TNT Express: bump in the road;The traditional corporate antidote to slow growth has its limits;Penicillin was once a wonderdrug but lost effectiveness because it was applied too broadly. The experience of TNT Express shows there is a similar problem with the simple three-step process widely considered a corporate antidote to slow old-world economic growth. The recipe: first buy up local operations in a favourite emerging market, then apply fancy developed-world management techniques to said emerging market and finally, watch the cash roll in. That technique, however, led the Dutch express postal service, which in May demerged from its snail mail unit, to a €103m first-half loss, compared with a €51m net profit last year. The pain came from a €132m impairment charge at a Brazilian operation which, until recently, appeared to have a good rationale.Last year, TNT bought two domestic delivery companies and assumed it could merge them – a classic developed world tactic – to cut costs and boost the combined company’s scale. However, it underestimated the importance of local managers and their relationships with business customers. As too many of these managers left the newly combined delivery company, so did corporate clients. In the second quarter, volumes across TNT’s Americas division fell 18 per cent.This experience helped push TNT’s share price down a quarter since the demerger – only slightly better than its slower-growth former brother, PostNL.True, the shares rebounded 3 per cent on Monday, but that owed much to investors attempting to establish a baseline for the stock after its first set of demerged results.TNT’s teething problems might yet encourage larger rivals FedEx or UPS to make an offer. There would be clear synergies, especially in the established courier business. But at least now that TNT has learnt from its emerging market blunder, the worst should be behind it.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
228;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-08-01T10:24:59Z;Emerging markets woes hit TNT Express profits;;Dutch international deliveries company TNT Express reported second-quarter net profit fell to €45m ($65m), down 23 per cent year on year, as the newly independent company struggles to make its growth businesses in China and Brazil profitable.Overall revenue rose slightly, mainly driven by strong growth in Asia. But higher fuel prices and volatile volumes on intercontinental shipping between Asia and Europe pushed the company’s Asian operations down from an €8m profit a year ago to an €8m loss this year.In Brazil, TNT Express is still trying to repair the poorly executed merger of two subsidiaries last year, which led to mix-ups in deliveries and lost customers. The troubles in Brazil meant TNT Express lost €45m on its American operations in the quarter, down from a €15m loss for the same period last year.Profits in Europe, where the company draws most of its revenue, were stronger than expected, and the company announced it will pay an interim dividend of €0.04. But analysts said they were waiting to see whether the company could make good on its challenges in Brazil and China.“We know in the past we made mistakes in managing Brazil. Now our priority is to make good progress,” Marie-Christine Lombard, chief executive, told reporters. She said management had been replaced, and reiterated the company’s target of returning Brazilian operations to profitability by the second half of 2012.TNT Express said it will implement €50m in cost savings by the end of the year, and is on track to meet its targeted underlying operating margin of 9 per cent.The quarterly results were the first since TNT Express spun off in May from its European regular-mail business, now known as PostNL. Investors had pushed for the separation for years, arguing it would free TNT Express to compete with larger express-mail rivals such as FedEx, UPS and DHL.Some investors moved into TNT Express stock hoping the split would lead to a takeover bid by one of its rivals, but none has materialised.“The takeover story has been a great story for 10 years, and it will continue to be a great story for another 10 years,” said analyst Geert Steens of SNS Securities. “UPS or FedEx might be desperate to buy TNT Brazil, but they would also be buying TNT China and TNT Europe, and do they want that?”
229;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-07-29T18:30:27Z;Groups wary of parting with their money;;Companies round the world queued up this week to tell investors how tough life is, as the half-year reporting season got into full swing.In Asia, Sony reduced its full-year profit forecast by 25 per cent and Nintendo cut the price of its latest handheld console because of poor sales. In Europe, results from Alcatel-Lucent missed expectations, while Daimler and Peugeot warned of softening demand. In North America the chief executive of United Parcels Service warned that its customers lacked confidence and Ford said the second half of the year would be weaker than the first.There were some exceptions. Wealthy Asians keep buying luxury goods, helping profits at LVMH to rise by 25 per cent. Elsewhere, people are turning to comfort food for solace– US chocolate maker Hershey raised its earnings outlook while shares in Dunkin’ Brands, the owner of Dunkin’ Donuts, closed up 47 per cent after their New York debut on Wednesday.Such bright spots were few and far between though, and against a backdrop of debt crises on both sides of the Atlantic, chief executives are erring on the side of caution. There was more evidence this week that companies are hoarding cash. Moody’s said the US corporate cash holdings rose to $1,240bn (£754bn) at the end of 2010, an 11 per cent increase on the position at the end of 2009.Balance sheet strengthening has been a long-term trend, and aside from the odd acquisition – a foray into emerging markets here, a new product line there – companies have generally been reluctant to open the purse strings.Shareholders are getting restless though, and this week there was evidence that such restlessness can pay dividends. Verizon Communications, the US telecoms operator, had finally conceded to Vodafone’s demands that Verizon Wireless, the mobile business the two companies jointly own, should pay a dividend. Vodafone will receive $4.5bn, most of which it will pay out to its own shareholders.British Sky Broadcasting, after months of News Corp-related uncertainty, announced a £750m share buy-back programme. And Motorola Solutions, a telecoms equipment business, said it would buy back $2bn of shares.But such examples are still the exception, rather than the rule. Even in the oil and gas and mining sectors, where high energy and commodities prices are providing healthy earnings growth, companies are reluctant to part with their money. Investors hoping for a big increase in either investment or cash returns will have to wait.
230;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-07-26T21:04:58Z;New York stocks down on debt worries;;US stocks stumbled for a second straight session on Tuesday as investors waded through a heavy volume of quarterly earnings reports amid continuing anxiety over the US federal debt limit.The S&P 500 stock index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,331.94 in New York.The benchmark was weighed down by the industrials sector, off 1.9 per cent, and materials, which declined by 1 per cent, while technology shares offset the gloom.Illinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, ended the day down 8.2 per cent at $52.34 after profits missed analysts’ forecasts. 3M, which produces goods from Post-it notes to stethoscopes, dropped 5.4 per cent to $89.93. Paccar, the maker of truck brands Peterbilt and Kenworth, fell 10.7 per cent to $45.02 after profits disappointed analysts,United Parcel Service, the global package shipping company, declined 3.3 per cent to $71.59. While second-quarter sales beat expectations thanks to price increases and a continued recovery in its supply chain business, chief executive Scott Davis noted that high US unemployment was braking demand for services and imports.Mr Davis also warned of ill effects from the political stalemate over raising the $14,300bn federal debt ceiling in Washington. The US Congress showed little progress towards a compromise before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.On Monday, Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, and John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, offered separate plans to resolve the borrowing limit issue.The White House threatened a presidential veto of Mr Boehner’s legislation Tuesday.“To move significantly one way or another, we’re going to need news on a deal out of Washington. It’s just another check point you need to get beyond,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis points to 4.284 per cent, suggesting continued demand despite the political uncertainty.Janney Montgomery Scott noted the situation seemed to have strengthened correlations among asset classes. “Given that the traditional safe haven asset class, Treasuries, is the source of capital markets uncertainty, we can expect this relationship between risk assets and Treasuries to remain off-kilter until Washington better wraps its hands around the debt ceiling and deficit problems or the government faces a credit event,” the broker-dealer said.Not every industrial stock lagged. Cummins, the diesel engine maker, rose 3.9 per cent to $110.82 after surpassing profit expectations. Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, rose 1.9 per cent to $80.82 as sales rose and executives raised their outlook for the year.Ford Motor lost 1.8 per cent to $12.94 after announcing a drop in second-quarter earnings. The Detroit-based carmaker said that pre-tax operating profit and cash flow for the year as a whole would be higher than in 2010.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,501.30.Second-quarter results have revealed a “pretty good earnings season so far”, said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems. Through Monday, almost a third of the 500 companies in the S&P index had reported quarterly numbers, and 83 per cent had beaten Wall Street estimates of earnings per share, he said.“The sector where we have seen the biggest surprise is in the technology sector,” he said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite held its ground, closing 0.1 per cent lower at 2,839.96.Broadcom, which makes chips for wireless devices, jumped 9.4 per cent to $38.20, after issuing a positive revenue outlook. Lexmark International, which supplies computer printers, gained 17.7 per cent to $33.93. Texas Instruments rose 0.3 per cent to $31.57, though executives foreshadowed a lacklustre holiday season.However, Netflix, the DVD and online video streaming service, tumbled 5.2 per cent to $266.91 after warning that a recent price rise would prompt some customers to downgrade or cancel subscriptions.The company, which was reporting second-quarter results, also indicated that revenues would “only grow slightly on a sequential basis” following the price change, which separates DVD and streaming into different subscription packages.After the New York market closed, Amazon reported second-quarter net profit of $191m, or 41 cents per share, sliding from $207m, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected the online emporium to earn 34 cents per share.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Shares in FedEx, which competes with UPS in the global package delivery business, fell almost 3 per cent before regaining ground to $91, down 1 per cent.Investors watch UPS closely for insights into the health of the global economy. The company delivers packages to tens of thousands of companies and individuals around the world and at any moment about 2 per cent of gross domestic product is passing through its networks.As the peak ocean shipping season gets under way – a key leading indicator of demand in the second half of the year – Mr Davis said that customer interest from areas such as Asia had been muted so far.“I wouldn’t say we’re pessimistic about the future. We’re just a lot more uncertain about how much the economy will grow,” Mr Davis told investors, as the company reported strong second-quarter results but painted a cautious outlook given the “uneven economic environment”.Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer, said UPS had seen “very strong growth” but was being cautious in order to be “credible and prudent on this and make sure that people understand the risks to the global economic environment”.“If congress and the president resolve the debt ceiling issue satisfactorily over the next week, the mood of the country could change quickly and we could see demand picking up,” Mr Davis said, while Mr Kuehn added that the company was still on track for a record year.For the three months to the end of June, revenues climbed more than 8 per cent to $13.2bn, compared to the same period last year, generating net income of $1.1bn, or about $1.07 per share, up from $845m, or $0.84 per share, in 2010.The results were boosted by $20m from two real estate deals. Excluding those one-off gains, UPS earned $1.05 a share, in line with Wall Street expectations. Analysts predicted sales of about $13.1bn.Beneath the top line numbers, UPS reported strong performances across its business lines. The US domestic package delivery unit reported a 6.4 per cent rise in sales to $7.7bn and a 29 per cent increase in operating profit to $966m.The best performer was the supply chain and freight unit, which manages warehouses and delivers larger items. Revenues rose 7 per cent to $2.3bn and operating profits surged 76 per cent to $235m compared with the year-ago period.Over the past decade, the company has invested heavily in its supply chain and freight business through a series of acquisitions, but tough price competition in trucking and other factors have produced a mixed performance at the unit until now.At UPS’s international package operation, revenues climbed 13 per cent to $3.1bn, but operating profits fell 5 per cent to $497m, as negative currency trends offset growth in Europe and China.Noting the weakness in the US economy, Mr Davis urged congress to take action. “Gridlock in our nation’s capital clearly is not helping this cause. We need leadership in Washington to step up and solve the debt ceiling stalemate.”
233;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;US stocks fall on Bernanke’s outlook;;Industrial transportations stocks climbed after FedEx reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and gave a positive outlook for the year, but the wider markets fell into negative territory after Ben Bernanke gave a cautious assessment of the US economy in a news conference.The package delivery group, considered a bellwether for the wider economy as it transports goods for such a wide range of industries, reported a 33 per cent jump in earnings, sending shares up 2.6 per cent to $91.44.The company gave a stronger-than-expected full-year earnings outlook.This caused a sigh of relief for investors as, due to a run of weak economic data in the US, many had been worried that forecasts would be sluggish.The outlook was “better than feared”, said analysts at Jefferies.Rival package delivery company UPS added 0.7 per cent to $71.11 on the news while Expeditors International of Washington put on 0.4 per cent to $48.45.But in the wider markets the S&P 500 index closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,287.14, breaking a four-session winning streak. The index dipped from positive to negative territory late in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve cut US growth forecasts and offered no hope that there would be another round of monetary stimulus.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent to 12,109.67 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,669.19.According to Investment Company Institute, the last two week were the worst fortnight for equity outflow since May 2010, the week of the flash crash. This did not help the mood in the markets.Wall Street was hurt by a move in the dollar, which edged higher after the Bernanke press conference. This weighed on the industrial, energy and material sectors.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, although these losses were pared somewhat by L-3 Communications, which spiked 4.6 per cent to $86.21 after reports that investors were pushing the defence company to spin off some units.The S&P energy and material sectors were both down 0.4 per cent.In the materials sector, CF Industries was down 2.8 per cent to $142.25 while Allegheny fell 2.5 per cent to $59.91.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.9 per cent to $142.25 while EOG Resources lost 0.8 per cent to $101.34.But the technology sector was the worst performing in the session, led lower by Adobe Systems, the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500.The software company that makes the Photoshop and Illustrator programs for media and internet professionals gave a disappointing earnings forecast, which dragged the stock down 6.3 per cent to $30.01.These losses came despite the fact that the company reported a 54 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings.Many analysts were still upbeat about the software maker in the long term.Analysts at Citigroup said that there were “lots of small things to quibble about” but that the “big picture [was] still bright”.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Autodesk was down 1.5 per cent to $36.47 while Juniper Networks lost 2.4 per cent to $29.53.The S&P technology index was down 0.8 per cent, although losses were pared by strong gains from Jabil Circuit. The electronics contractor was up 3.2 per cent to $19.45 after reporting powerful earnings and a share buy-back.Homebuilders also saw gains after home prices as tracked by the Federal Housing Finance Agency rose 0.8 per cent in April from the previous month, which was better than the 0.3 per cent fall that had been expected. PulteGroup was up 0.4 per cent to $7.49 while DR Horton added 1.4 per cent to $11.54.Consumer staples stocks also suffered, led by Lorillard Tobacco, which was down 1.7 per cent to $110.01.In the previous session, the US Food and Drug Administration released nine warnings on the ill-effects of smoking – combining graphic images and text – that must appear on cigarette packets as well as in advertisements no later than September 2012.The S&P consumer staples index was down, 0.7 per cent.CarMax, the used-car dealer, enjoyed the strongest gains on the S&P 500 after reporting first-quarter earnings up 25 per cent, beating analysts’ expectations. Its shares were up 7 per cent to $32.66 as earnings came in at $126.3m, or 55 cents a share, which was ahead of the 47 cents expected.AeroVironment’s fourth-quarter earnings rose 20.6 per cent on a jump in contract-services, leaving shares in the maker of unmanned aircraft up 19.6 per cent to $34.51.
234;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-06-17T18:23:29Z;UK restricts UPS air-cargo screening;;The UK government has taken the unusual step of blocking UPS, the global parcel delivery company, from screening packages at some of its facilities in Britain until it improves its security procedures.The Department for Transport said it had “restricted the number of sites in the UK at which UPS are permitted to screen air cargo”, adding that “the safety of the travelling public is paramount and our security regime is kept under constant review”.The news comes in the wake of heightened concerns about the air transport of cargo after a failed attempt to blow up several cargo aircraft using bombs disguised as print toner cartridges in November last year.At the time, the UK, US and a number of other countries boosted inspections and imposed a series of emergency restrictions on air freight, affecting companies such as UPS and US airlines that carry cargo in the holds of their passenger aircraft.Package delivery companies also introduced new policies, such as requirements for new or irregular customers to provide official ID and to allow their packages to be opened and inspected before agreeing to transport goods.UPS said that it was working to address the DfT’s “concerns” but admitted that the government intervention had “led to delays in the movement of packages” and forced the company to activate contingency plans and warn customers.Both UPS and the DfT declined to offer any further details about the specific security concerns or to detail the number of sites, customers or packages affected, arguing that to do so might undermine security efforts.But a spokesperson for UPS said that the company regularly works with transport and security agencies around the world in order to ensure that its network is safe. It expects to resume a normal service by next week.Earlier this week Philip Hammond, Britain’s transport secretary, urged his European counterparts to push ahead with plans for an EU-wide security regime for air cargo at a meeting in Luxembourg, despite failing to find a common deal in recent discussions.For UPS the restrictions are a setback. The company has built a substantial presence in the UK since 1985 and now employs about 6,800 people, runs a fleet of about 2,900 vehicles and operates about 50 small package facilities and 12 supply chain solution centers.Moreover, as it has grown through acquisitions it has worked hard to raise its profile in the country. In 2009 it signed a deal to become the official logistics sponsor of the 2012 Olympic Games based in London.
235;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-05-26T14:34:03Z;TNT: if you can’t beat ‘em ...;TNT Express should consider a tie up with one of its much larger rivals;Breaking up is tough, but shareholders in Dutch postal services operator TNT were right to approve the split of the business on Wednesday. No one has a clue how to stop the rot at its mail business – the UK’s Royal Mail faces the same dilemma. Volumes at TNT fell over 9 per cent in 2010 and will fall by only a little less this year. Now that the newly named PostNL has been separated from the express delivery division, executives can focus on managing decline: generating as much cash as possible while jostling with unions over inevitable job losses.In contrast, TNT Express is now free to grow. The company already runs the largest private mail network in China – which generates one-fifth of it revenues – and its Brazilian business has plenty of room for improvement.The split also neatly positions TNT Express to be acquired by one of its much larger rivals, FedEx and UPS. TNT’s North American business contributes only about 3 per cent of revenues, meaning competition concerns with its US-heavy peers should be minimal. But the company would not come cheap. TNT Express’ shares trade at about 20 times next year’s earnings, a 30 per cent premium to FedEx and UPS. Some takeover speculation may be priced in, but the emerging markets growth story will still command a meaty premium.While its current takeover negotiating position is strong, the challenges of being a relatively small player are formidable. TNT could struggle to deal with a larger rival starting a price war in brand-agnostic emerging markets. Rather than wait to see how well it does, management should consider a tie up with FedEx or UPS. After all, investors are still fairly optimistic, and delay could lead to a lower price.

236;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-05-22T17:01:36Z;UPS backs carbon tax, with conditions;;United Parcel Service, the package delivery company, would throw its weight behind a carbon tax to help tackle global warming – but only if the proceeds were tied to infrastructure improvement projects.In an interview with the Financial Times, Scott Davis, chief executive officer of UPS, said his company would back a federal tax on carbon as part of a broad sweep of measures to restore America’s creaking infrastructure.“We are paying attention to it but if you watch what China and other competitors are doing they are investing much more in infrastructure so we have to do that or we will feel the pain when the economy gets strong again,” Mr Davis said. His comments added an influential voice to efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide that have been linked to a rise in global temperatures. Other advocates of a carbon tax include Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, UPS’s main competitor.A tax on carbon would effectively raise the price of using energy for businesses and individuals, encouraging them to reduce their consumption, but as a result it has been heavily opposed by some politicians and interest groups.Still, Mr Davis’s suggestion adds a twist to the debate, tying environmental issues to infrastructure – a topic that has received considerable attention in Congress. Earlier this month, two influential senators proposed legislation to fund an infrastructure bank. The measure could be costly for UPS. The company runs a fleet of about 100,000 cars and trucks and about 230 aircraft. In 2010 UPS spent almost $3bn on fuel, although much of the cost was passed on to customers through surcharges.But any improvement in infrastructure would benefit the company. Mr Davis estimates that if UPS’s US truck and package car fleet spends just five minutes a day stuck idling in traffic it costs the company $100m a year. One area that needs especial investment, Mr Davis said, was upgrading the air traffic control system in the US. Federal regulators have a plan, called NextGen, to do just that, but progress has been slow.Experts regularly criticise the US for its failure to invest adequately in its waterworks and transport systems. Since the early 1960s, US infrastructure spending as a percentage of GDP has fallen steadily even though the population has grown by a third.In a 2009 “report card”, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the US a “D” for its infrastructure and estimated that it would cost more than $2,000bn over five years to get the country’s existing roads, bridges and tunnels into a serviceable state.
237;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-05-10T20:49:00Z;US stocks edge higher as global worries ease;;Microsoft lost ground after the software group confirmed that it was buying Skype for $8.5bn while US stocks continued to trend higher following the strong non-farm payrolls report.Shares in the world’s second-largest technology company by market capitalisation were down 0.6 per cent to $25.67 after announcing the deal with Skype.The acquisition is one of the largest by Microsoft and illustrates how the company is attempting to boost its online operations.The last substantial deal was the purchase of Aquantive, an online advertising company, in 2007 for more than $6bn.The move brings the value of worldwide tech-related mergers and acquisitions to $85.5bn, the strongest start to the year for tech M&A since 2000 according to Thomson Reuters.Ebay, the online auction site that still owns 30 per cent of Skype, was up 2.5 per cent to $33.93 in expectation of a windfall.Ebay shares were helped by the fact that the value put on Skype by the acquisition represents a large premium to what Wall Street had been expecting from its planned initial public offering.The news comes as a host of other internet companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, Groupon and Twitter are looking for initial public offerings at potentially lofty valuations.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent to 1,357.16, with solid economic data showing that US wholesalers had stockpiled goods in March as sales rose strongly helping to lift sentiment on Wall Street.But the wider markets were also bouncing back from losses last week after a string of disappointing economic data called into question the strength of the US economic recovery and sent the S&P 500 down 1.7 per cent.This malaise was largely banished on Friday, however, after a bumper official non-farm payroll figure turned sentiment around, leading to three solid days of gains on the S&P 500.“The jobs data on Friday was off the charts and that good news has been working its way into stock prices this week,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,760.59 while the Nasdaq Composite added 1 per cent to 2,871.89.The gains on Tuesday were broad based but industrial stocks saw some of the strongest improvements as healthy trade data from China pointed to robust global economic growth.United Parcel Service, one of the world’s largest package delivery companies, was up 0.9 per cent to $74.37 while General Electric added 1.2 per cent to $20.30.The S&P industrial sector was up 0.8 per cent.Energy stocks were the worst performing, weighed by falling oil prices after it was announced late on Monday that margins on US oil contracts would be raised by 25 per cent.The oil price recovered as the session continued but investors remained cautious. Hess Corp declined 0.4 per cent to $79.67 while ExxonMobil lost 0.4 per cent to $70.31.Elsewhere on Wall Street, shares in Dean Food rose 11.5 per cent to $12.24 after the dairy and meat purveyor beat expectations with its first-quarter results and raised its earnings forecast.The company lifted its forecast to 67-75 cents a share from its earlier view of 55-65 cents.It also estimated second-quarter earnings of 15-20 cents, ahead of the 13 cents expected by analysts.But in absolute terms, the food group’s first-quarter profit fell 41 per cent as margins slid, however.The stock is still down more than 30 per cent since the start of 2010.JA Solar Holdings was up 6.2 per cent to $6.48 after reporting a better than expected quarterly profit, although the solar company also said its second-quarter sales would be slowed by a cut in renewable energy subsidies in Italy.Wendy’s-Arby’s rose 4.2 per cent to $5.02 after the fast food group reported strong same-store sales growth in the US.Investors were impressed in spite of the company reporting a loss of $1.4m in the quarter compared with a profit of $3.4m a year earlier as well as lowering its full-year earnings forecast.Sotheby’s, the auction house, lost 6.1 per cent to $43.71 after reporting slimmer-than-expected first-quarter profit.The auctioneer did report an increase in the number of works sold over $1m but competitive pressures to win the consignments resulted in lower commission margins.
238;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-04-29T20:51:57Z;Wall St ends week of bumper earnings;;Large US indices hit multiyear highs this week after a number of bumper quarterly earnings reports and a well-received statement on monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.But the final session saw little action as investors paused for breath and attempted to make sense of these technical highs.Still, the markets ground a little higher on Friday as strong results from Caterpillaroutweighed more mixed results elsewhere. The world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues stormed past expectations, reporting a near 60 per cent jump in revenues and a fivefold increase in profit, sending the stock up 2.5 per cent to $115.41.But shares in Research in Motion plunged 14 per cent to $48.65 after the maker of the BlackBerry issued a surprise profit warning, due to increasing competition from Apple and Google and delays to the launch of its next generation of smartphones.Among other technology sector stocks, Microsoft lost 3 per cent to $25.92 after reporting that revenues from its Windows operating system had suffered a rare slip. It was the first quarter in more than two decades in which its profits had fallen below those of Apple.In other earnings news, Merck, the US pharmaceutical company, was up 0.5 per cent to $35.94 after reporting a tripling in its first-quarter net income, while Chevron added 0.6 per cent to $109.44 after announcing that its earnings were up 36 per cent, thanks to higher oil prices.Mixed economic data helped to foster a cautious session. Figures showed that US incomes had risen 0.5 per cent in March, ahead of expectations, but that spending rose by a worse than expected 0.2 per cent on an inflation-adjusted basis.All this left the benchmark S&P 500 up by a slender 0.2 per cent to 1,363.61 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 0.4 per cent at 12,810.24, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,873.54.The S&P 500 was up 2 per cent for the week overall while the Dow added 2.4 per cent and the Nasdaq rose 1.9 per cent. Over the month, the S&P was up 2.8 per cent.“People were taking a breather on Friday following the onslaught of strong earnings and the positive news from the Fed earlier in the week,” said Paul Brigandi, senior portfolio manager at Direxion Funds.The big market-moving event of the past five days was on Wednesday with the latest statement on monetary policy from the Fed and a subsequent press briefing by Ben Bernanke, chairman.The central bank struck a generally dovish tone, suggesting that it was still a long way from raising interest rates. The event was well received by the markets, lifting a host of big indices to multiyear highs. The Nasdaq Composite reached a decade-long high on Wednesday after the Fed statement.Other highs reached during the week included a 34-month peak on the S&P 500 and all-time highs on the Russell 2000 small-cap index and the Dow Jones Transportation Average.The Russell was up 2.3 per cent to 865.29 over the week and the Dow Transport added 4.2 per cent to 5,514.87. Strong earnings results added to relief over the Fed. So far, out of the 298 S&P 500 companies that have reported, 77 per cent have beaten analysts’ expectations.Of the companies to report and beat expectations, the largest was ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalisation. It reported a 69 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings to $10.7bn, largely on the back of high oil prices, and the stock was up 1.9 per cent to $87.98 over the week.The Nasdaq was helped to its 10-year high by Amazon, the largest online retailer, which rose 5.4 per cent to $195.81 over the week to a high after it reported a 38 per cent jump in sales. This rise in revenues was accompanied by a 33 per cent fall in net income, however, but investors had already braced themselves for this.SunPowerwas up 36.4 per cent to $21.69 over the week after announcing on Friday that Total, the French energy group, planed to acquire a 60 per cent stake in the US solar-panel maker.United Parcel Service, the package delivery company, was up 2.5 per cent over the week to $74.97 after it managed to shrug off higher fuel prices and bad weather to report a 66 per cent jump in net income for the first quarter.Procter & Gamble and Boeing also reported healthy earnings and their stocks were up 2.6 per cent and 5.7 per cent to $64.91 and $79.75 per cent respectively over the five days.
239;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-04-26T20:43:28Z;Industrials lift Wall Street;;The S&P 500 index jumped to a multi-year high after promising consumer confidence data and a range of strong earnings reports from leading industry names, such as Ford Motor, 3M and UPS.Shares in Ford rose 0.8 per cent to $15.66 after the carmaker reported first-quarter net earnings of $2.55bn, its highest profit for the period in 13 years and a 22 per cent advance on a year earlier. Its 61 cents of earnings per share in the quarter, up from 50 cents a year earlier, was also well above the 46 cents estimated by analysts.3M gained after the industrial group reported a 16 per cent jump in first-quarter profit.The stock was up1.9 per cent to $95.94. George Buckley, 3M’s chief executive, said that demand for materials used in the screens for tablet computers was “going up like a rocket ship. And we are the supplier to those folks”. But he added that disruptions from the Japanese earthquake would hit earnings by 10-13 cents per share this year.United Parcel Service also recorded gains after one of the world’s largest package delivery companies managed to shrug off higher fuel prices and bad weather to report a 66 per cent jump in net income for the first quarter. UPS reported net income of $885m, or 88 cents in diluted earnings per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents a share and sending shares in the company up 0.9 per cent to $74.30. The logistics group, which is often regarded as a bellwether of the global economy, also reported higher margins and raised its full-year earnings forecast.Cummins jumped 7.6 per cent to $116.39 after the maker of truck engines reported that its first-quarter profit had more than doubled. The well-received results left the S&P industrial sector up 1.8 per cent, the best performing sector on the S&P.Caterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, was up 2.8 per cent to $111.94 while General Electric gained 1.1 per cent to $20.10, as both stocks benefited from the generally higher sentiment in the industrial space.These gains helped the benchmark S&P 500 index close 0.9 per cent higher at 1,347.24, its highest level since June 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also up 0.9 per cent to 12,595.45 while the Nasdaq gained 0.8 per cent to 2,847.54, a 3½-year high.Also lifting sentiment in the wider markets was news that the US consumer had become slightly more optimistic in April, according to data from the Conference Board.The research group said that its index of consumer confidence increased to 65.4 in April, up from a revised 63.8 in March as more Americans said they expected their incomes to rise in the near future.On the negative side, the Richmond Federal Reserve reported weaker manufacturing activity and US home prices fell by 3.3 per cent in February from a year earlier, according to the S&P Case-Shiller home price indices. The fall in house prices was not unexpected.Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, said that now “rest period” in the markets was likely over the coming months, with the S&P ending the quarter only very slightly higher from here.Results from Coca-Cola were the only big disappointment of the session, as the company’s first-quarter earnings per share came in a penny short of Wall Street estimates. In spite of this, net income at the world’s largest soft drinks company by revenues rose 18 per cent from the same period last year to $1.9bn, or 82 cents a share.It also reported a rise in sales around the world in spite of rising commodity prices and political turmoil. Still, the earnings miss left the stock down 1.2 per cent at $66.93.Shares in Netflix fell 9 per cent to $228.91 after a disappointing earnings outlook. Investors focused on this, in spite of the company reporting net income at the top end of expectations. The DVD subscription and film streaming service said it added more than 3m subscribers in the quarter.Delta Air Lines jumped 11 per cent to $9.99 after the airline’s first-quarter earnings and revenue beat expectation. The world’s largest airline by market value still reported a loss, however, due to higher fuel costs.Emulex, the chipmaker, fell 6.2 per cent to $9.71 after forecasting disappointing fourth-quarter adjusted earnings.
240;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-04-26T19:20:03Z;S&P higher after strong US results;;A batch of strong results from leading US companies including Ford Motor, UPS and 3M helped push the S&P 500 index to its highest level since June 2008 in a sign of rising market confidence in spite of concerns about the world economy.Ford, the second-largest US car company by revenues, reported its highest quarterly profit for the period in 13 years, in the latest sign of the revival in US manufacturing.UPS, the logistics company, and 3M, the diversified manufacturer, raised their guidance for full-year earnings after first-quarter profits beat analysts’ expectations. Lockheed Martin, the defence contractor, also raised its full-year projection.The news follows excellent results from industrial companies such as United Technologies, Eaton and Honeywell.Of the 154 constituents of the S&P 500 that have reported earnings for the first quarter, 122 have delivered earnings ahead of average expectations, according to Bloomberg data.The S&P 500 index was 0.9 per cent up at 1347 by midday in New York and up 7.1 per cent this year. The rally this year has been led by the energy sector, which has risen 16 per cent, followed by the industrial sector and healthcare, which are both up 10 per cent.The benchmark has nearly doubled from its low of 676 set in March 2009, during the financial crisis, but is still 14 per cent below its all-time high of 1,565.15 reached in October 2007.Ford’s first-quarter earnings were $2.55bn, up 22 per cent on a year earlier and far ahead of analysts’ estimates. The company ascribed the rise to higher volumes and selling prices, as well as lower interest payments. Operating profits in Europe almost trebled, helped by new models.However, Alan Mulally, chief executive, said that despite the strong first quarter, Ford was sticking to earlier 2011 sales projections due to uncertainties.The company warned that results later in the year “may not be as strong as the first quarter”. It cited lower profits at Ford Credit, its financing arm, rising commodity prices and expanding investments, especially in emerging markets such as Russia, which Ford expects will be Europe’s biggest car market by 2015.Mr Mulally added however, that while new investments would push up costs, “they are also driving higher volumes, richer mix [of vehicles] and stronger transaction prices”.UPS also raised concerns about risks in the world economy, saying that the outlook was “a little cloudier” than it was three months ago.Ford shares climbed 2 per cent to about $15.90 at midday in New York, far above their lows of close to a dollar in late 2008, but still below January’s recent peak of almost $19.3M shares were also up about 2 per cent at $96.14, while UPS and Lockheed were both up about 1 per cent.Additional reporting by Michael MacKenzie in New York
241;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;Johnson Matthey takes Footsie higher;;The FTSE 100 pushed to within touching distance of a three-year high on Tuesday, with Johnson Matthey among the top performers.The platinum processor was up 1.3 per cent to £19.48 after an upbeat trading statement from Umicore, its Belgian-based peer.Umicore raised its 2011 earnings guidance by about 10 per cent to reflect strong demand for automotive catalysts, as well as improved volumes and prices for its precious metal recycling business.“Whilst we see much of Umicore’s reported first volume strength in our estimates, it should nonetheless be supportive for Matthey,” said Morgan Stanley.The wider market followed Wall Street higher after earnings from companies including Ford, UPS and 3M beat expectations.The FTSE 100 rose 0.9 per cent or 51.06 points to close at 6,069.36 – fewer than 22 points off the three-year peak it reached in early February.But the three-day week in London meant volumes were very light. Fewer than 1bn blue-chip shares were traded across all the main exchanges for only the third day since the turn of the year.Ford’s numbers helped GKN add 2.4 per cent to 216¼p. Ford has become gradually less important to GKN but still accounts for about 8 per cent of its Driveline business by volume, according to analysts.British Airways owner IAG led the FTSE risers, up 4.5 per cent to 228¼p, on the back of a positive note on the airline sector from UBS. The broker argued that discipline was returning to the long-haul market, which has suffered from overcapacity since late last year, and that yields on transatlantic bookings for May and June had rebounded. “Should oil stabilise and capacity discipline continue shares may rise,” said UBS, which named IAG as its top pick among the flag carriers.Technology stocks were in demand, with Autonomy up 0.6 per cent to £16.30 and Arm Holdings gaining 3.4 per cent to 620p ahead of results on Wednesday.Vodafone rebounded by 2.3 per cent to 173p, having dropped sharply last week in reaction to a profit warning from KPN and weaker than expected results from Verizon Wireless, its US joint venture.Burberry, the recent subject of renewed takeover speculation, advanced 1.6 per cent to £12.91. Dealers also noted data showing Swiss watch exports were up 10 per cent by value year on year in March, a positive indicator for the luxury goods sector.Northumbrian Water was also the subject of continued bid rumours, with shares in the utility up 1.1 per cent to 344p.Elsewhere among the mid-caps, Heritage Oil rose 5.3 per cent to 257¼p after it launched a $100m share buy-back. Heritage said it had taken the action, which was approved by shareholders in June, because the stock was trading at a significant discount to the company’s intrinsic underlying value. JPMorgan Cazenove reckoned the buy-back would boost net asset value by 3 per cent.Micro Focus rose 6.8 per cent to 360¾p after it confirmed recent bid rumours. The legacy software specialist, which parted company with its chief executive just over a week ago, said the bid approach was “very preliminary [and] non-binding” without giving any further details. Dealers said the company would be a natural target for private equity.Ahead of a trading statement on May 12, electronics and foundry equipment maker Cookson rose 2.7 per cent to 697p. “We expect performance to be ahead of market expectations,” said Exane BNP Paribas, which upgraded the stock to an “outperform” rating.“Strong volume growth in foundry and diminished Japanese supply chain risk should reassure investors that Cookson can deliver above-consensus performance in 2011,” it said.However, UBS analysts noted that Japan’s Krosaki Harima had bought Tata Refractories, Cookson’s main rival for supplying Indian steelmakers. Combining Krosaki’s technology with Tata’s customer base created a bigger competitive threat, UBS argued.
242;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-04-26T14:04:34Z;UPS delivers strong results despite fuel costs;;United Parcel Service, one of the world’s largest package delivery companies, shrugged off higher fuel prices and bad weather to report a 66 per cent jump in net income for the first quarter of 2011.The logistics company also reported higher margins and raised its full-year earnings forecast, helping its shares add 1.4 per cent to $74.67 by mid-session on Wall Street.But the Atlanta-based shipping company also struck a cautionary note regarding the global economy, saying that the outlook was “a little cloudier” than it was three months ago.UPS and other global logistics companies are closely watched barometers of global economic health because they transport many of the goods that are the backbone of domestic and international commerce.The company reported net income of $885m, or 88 cents in diluted earnings per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents a share. This was up from $533m, or 53 cents a share, in the same period last year.Scott Davis, chairman and chief executive, said that the strong results came despite “unrest in north Africa and the Middle East, skyrocketing fuel costs and some of the worst weather conditions in years.”Revenues rose 7.3 per cent to $12.58bn from a year ago with the growth spread relatively equally between its three main units: domestic US package delivery, international package delivery and supply chain and freight. This was slightly short of the $12.7bn analysts were expecting, however.Despite the more sobering assessment of world economic growth, the company raised its expected full-year earnings to $4.15-$4.40 a share, ahead of the $4.12-$4.35 predicted in February.Operating margins came in at 11.3 per cent, up from 8.9 per cent in same period a year ago, in a hopeful sign about the ability of US businesses to weather the storm of higher fuel prices.“The higher oil price is definitely a headwind, but the key thing to take away from these results is that it has yet to derail the global economy,” said Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer.One of the key drivers of earnings growth for the company was the margin improvement in its domestic package business, which rose 3.4 percentage points from a year earlier to 11.3 per cent.Mr Kuehn said UPS expected its margins to continue to to improve in the US. This sentiment was mirrored by analysts. “Operating margins were strong on the domestic side, which we think will continue,” said Jim Corridore, airlines and air freight analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Average margins for companies on the S&P 500 index are currently near cyclical highs as they effectively streamlined themselves during the latest downturn. Average operating margins for S&P companies are19.7 per cent, just short of the last cyclical high of 20.3 per cent in 2004.Last month, rival logistics company FedEx reported its fourth-quarter earnings, forecasting strong demand and higher margins in the rest of the year. UPS shares have been trading broadly flat since the start of the year, but are up 94.5 per cent since the lows of the financial crisis.
243;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Energy prices risk derailing equity advance;Direction of commodities will set S&P tone;Sitting on your hands may not win plaudits among the bold and the brave, but it has proved a winning formula for US stock market investors this year.A sharp jump in oil prices has propelled energy companies to a second successive quarter of impressive gains, making them the best performing sector in the S&P 500.Since the start of the year, and thanks in large part to the turmoil in the Middle East that has sent crude to its highest level since 2008, energy stocks including Chevron, ExxonMobil and Marathon Oil have been among the market’s biggest gainers in the first three months of the year. The sector has risen 17 per cent, eclipsing other industries to lead the S&P 5.6 per cent higher.The problem for equity investors is that energy’s sustained run, after a rally of 21 per cent in the past three months of 2010, is just the plus side to an oil supply shock – Libya – that threatens to cast a shadow over the market. Higher fuel costs are predicted to erode profit margins for many other companies and sap consumer spending.Indeed, Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, warns that higher energy costs are now “the biggest factor weighing on margin expansion”.One of the most important drivers for equities, therefore, in the second quarter will be whether commodity prices pull back. Stocks exposed to discretionary spending could benefit if the bull run in energy and raw materials runs out of steam.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management says breathing space may be at hand. A slower pace of growth in the world’s emerging markets should translate into a retreat for commodity prices.“Commodities are peaking here and we should get some relief,” he says. If that is accompanied by better jobs numbers – the latest US non-farm payrolls are due today – then stocks have room to rally more broadly, says Mr Paulsen.Other strategists, though, are less confident about the wider market’s prospects. Despite a recent run of robust economic data and solid corporate earnings, the prospect of an end to the Federal Reserve’s second round of “quantitative easing” – its huge bond-buying programme to stimulate recovery – could cap further gains.And, as oil prices have climbed back towards the record high set three years ago of almost $150 a barrel, some economists have begun lowering their growth expectations for the US economy in the first half of the year.“Equities face considerable headwinds in the second quarter,” says Kate Moore, senior global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “The market may have got ahead of itself. Rising oil prices, higher interest rates and downward revisions to economic data will weigh on the equity market.”The signs of diminishing confidence in the rally, which at its peak took the S&P to more than double its March 2009 nadir, is already evident in non-energy stocks that did well last year.Materials, for example is up just 3.6 per cent this year after a gain of 18.5 per cent in the fourth quarter. While industrials have done well again, they lag their rise of 11.2 per cent in the last three months of 2010. Technology’s 3.5 per cent gain in the first quarter is less than half its 10 per cent rally the previous three months.“Sectors that led the rally since last August are now lagging as investors worry about the ability of companies to increase their earnings,” says Ms Moore.One closely watched barometer will be the Dow Jones Transports Average, seen as a bellwether. This week, it climbed to a 52-week high, boosted by the performance of railways, which are seen as benefiting from more demand as fuel costs hurt truckers.Yet, having risen more than 140 per cent since March 2009, the Dow Jones Transports has slowed to a gain of 3.3 per cent since the end of December.Mr Ablin says: “A loss of momentum among this type of sector will be a prime indicator that the squeeze is ready to force the broad market lower.”Already, the first quarter has seen a marked reversal for airlines, which are highly sensitive to higher energy costs. The Bloomberg airline index has fallen 7 per centThe share prices for the big two delivery companies, FedEx, up 0.8 per cent for the quarter, and UPS, up 2.7 per cent, could also be useful leading indicators.But, for all the uncertainty over the effects of higher oil prices, equities are still seen by many as a better bet than bonds this year. Ms Moore expects oil prices to peak in the second quarter. A retreat in equities would represent a buying opportunity for those who have added heavily to their bond holdings in the past two years. “We still see equities as outperforming bonds in 2011,” she says.US consumers are not feeling particularly buoyant at the moment and that is potentially bad news for companies banking on a sustained recovery. his week, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge for March plunged to a three-month low. Consumers sharply lowered their expectations for future business activity, employment prospects and income growth. Meanwhile rising prices for food and energy pushed expectations for inflation over the next year to the highest level since October of 2008.
244;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-03-29T15:13:49Z;Tracking ‘green’ performance;;Corporate sustainability reports are often filled with glossy pictures and statements of good intent.These days, however, a few more of them contain hard figures on the company’s environmental and social footprint. IT systems and software help gather and analyse these data.Between 2006 and 2010, the proportion of companies using software to track their sustainability performance rose by 50 per cent, according to a survey released in January by the Global Reporting Initiative, which produces guidelines that help companies track their economic, environmental and social performance.“There’s a trend toward transparency that requires the use of technology to gather, organise and manage information in a better way,” says Nelmara Arbex, deputy chief executive of the GRI.She believes that as companies increasingly look to make business cases for sustainability, they will turn to IT more frequently.“These issues are becoming more and more part of everyday decisions on risks and strategic goals,” says Ms Arbex. “So, internally, the management needs to have this information better organised.”If – as the old business adage goes – what you do not measure you cannot manage, IT has a critical role to play, particularly as companies start to recognise that cutting their environmental footprints also helps them save money.This is especially true in the energy sector, where smart meters and other software tools are starting to play a big role in the measurement of companies’ energy use.“In the past three or four years, the IT industry has set its sights on energy and has seen an opportunity to contribute to a lower global carbon footprint and provide a bridge to reducing global energy consumption,” says Amit Chatterjee, founder and chief executive of Hara, a US-based company that sells environmental and energy management software and services.However, to do so, Mr Chatterjee argues that companies need to use software to establish a baseline from which to start reduction programmes.“Carbon reporting is a great mechanism, but simply creating that transparency doesn’t lead to reduction,” he says. “The best way to drive reduction is to understand inputs first by tracking the energy flow through the organisation.”For logistics companies, fuel is the energy requiring measurement.UPS, for example, is testing a telematics-based initiative. With sensors in delivery trucks, the system uses algorithms and proprietary firmware – the operating systems of devices in the cab – to analyse data that help, among other things, reduce idling and find the most efficient routes for drivers, thereby cutting fuel consumption.Cost is not the only reason for companies to use IT to measure their energy footprint. Growing amounts of carbon-related regulation also make understanding and tracking energy use increasingly important.For global enterprises, the challenge is managing a complex web of rules and regulations, from the EU’s emissions trading scheme to a range of state-level requirements in the US.Reporting requirements in some jurisdictions might operate on a calendar year, while in others, authorities demand figures for the financial year.“When you start to see the complexity in how organisations have to manage data and information – and that’s just on one subject – the ability of IT to do that and to identify gaps in the data is quite powerful,” says Martin Baxter, executive director of policy at the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment, a European non-profit body that promotes industry standards in environmental management, auditing and assessment.“And when you have a level of complexity, you need systems that are robust and don’t get calculations wrong,” adds Mr Baxter.If errors are made, IT can also help. One tool is the web-based ESG Data Correction Platform recently jointly launched by Justmeans, an online marketing and communications company, and CRD Analytics, which provides sustainability investment analytics.The tool analyses an organisation’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) data – in its online materials and published reports – against 175 ESG metrics, spots inaccuracies and omissions and provides an outline for correction.If companies need to measure and manage sustainability data for internal purposes and reporting to regulators, they also increasingly need to provide clear information for consumers and shareholders“[They] need to be more confident in talking about this information externally,” says Ms Arbex.“Today, information is easily exchanged and it’s expected to be available for anyone looking for it.”Moreover, information for shareholders and consumers needs to be understandable to audiences who may not be experts in carbon measurement or water consumption assessments.“In the world of environmental sustainability, the challenge is to create clarity from complexity,” says Mr Baxter. “And IT helps people do that.”
245;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Sustainability: Technology has potential to retrofit the world;;"The bicycle is a quintessentially clean form of transport. But researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have made it cleaner still.The Copenhagen Wheel, developed by MIT’s SENSE­able City Lab, allows riders not only to save energy produced while cycling and braking for later use (on uphill journeys, for instance); a bike retrofitted with the wheel also collects data on local environmental conditions.This is just one example of how technology is providing information that can help us reduce our impact on the planet.As the Copenhagen Wheel demonstrates, anything connected to sensors and software can become an intelligent instrument, measuring everything from carbon emissions to water consumption.“Technology is going to be a game changer,” says Laura Ipsen, senior vice-president and general manager of Cisco Systems’ Connected Energy group.“The only way we can make smart changes to our planet is by using technology to manage, monitor and control …natural resources.”The energy sector is ripe for this kind of transformation. Smart meters enable companies and consumers to collect detailed data on energy use and reduce their consumption – as well as their carbon footprint.IT will also allow power utilities to operate demand-led energy management and offer flexible pricing mechanisms that will prompt greater efficiencies.Other business opportunities exist in creating products such as bundling different energy services.“With electric vehicles, you could have a maintenance agreement that would include cost of power, or a battery leasing agreement with the cost of power behind it,” says Darrin Hill, energy expert at PA Consulting Group.The question is whether IT can do all this fast enough.In the energy sector, industry is playing catch-up after decades in which power has been managed across infrastructure little changed in more than a century, delivering one-way flows of electricity that users cannot monitor or control.Meanwhile, companies face organisational obstacles, with departments responsible for paying electricity bills not necessarily communicating with the purchasing units that buy machines consuming the energy.“Until you have a centralisation of control and authority around energy management, you’re not going to be able to have strategic energy management,” says David Metcalfe, director of Verdantix, a research company.Mr Metcalfe believes IT provides an opportunity for companies to start centralising this control. “Technology enables a more global approach,” he says.IT is also an important tool in measuring corporate consumption of not only energy but also other resources.Software and databases mean companies no longer have to work in the dark when assessing their environmental impact, as well as their exposure to environmental risk.For large consumers of water, such as those in the drinks industry, remote sensors combined with flow meters help monitor leaks and establish a consumption baseline from which to set reduction goals.Meanwhile, advanced geospatial analytics aggregate data on global water consumption, allowing companies to assess their exposure to water shortages.For big multinationals, technology helps make sense of an otherwise unmanageable mass of data. This is important both for internal resource management and external reporting.David Walker, director of environmental sustainability at PepsiCo, says: “When you have this much data being collected from so many sites around the world, it presents a challenge to meet corporate audit requirements and financial-level requirements that sustainability is demanding.” The group has established a single database, so staff anywhere can upload data on energy, water, solid waste and other sustainability every month.The greater efficiencies IT facilitates also generate cost savings.Since the deployment of route planning technology in 2004, the CO2 reductions made by UPS, the logistics company, equate to taking 5,300 passenger cars off the road for a year – cutting fuel costs in the process, with savings of 10m gallons of petrol.Web technology helps save carbon emissions in another way, too – by matchmaking.An online transport marketplace called uShip helps logistics companies run fewer trucks partially full or empty after making their deliveries.It connects shipping customers with transporters that are making a trip and have extra space in their vehicles. The company’s software also allows users to offset the carbon emissions created by their deliveries.Of course, an even more fuel-efficient strategy would be not to make the trip at all. And while goods will always need delivering, technology is helping reduce the number of people that need to be moved around.As the usability of telepresence and other videoconferencing systems has improved, executives have found it easier to reduce the business trips they make.In a recent study from WWF, the conservation body, more than 60 per cent of respondents used videoconferencing regularly, with most saying this had an impact in cutting air travel.The reduction in flights because of videoconferencing – as opposed to measures such as corporate travel policies – was about 12 per cent.Of course, IT also has its own footprint. For a start, it generates large amounts of electrical waste.In Europe, rules govern management of this waste, with manufacturers and retailers required to organise collection and disposal of electronic equipment at the end of its life.Even so, implementation of the EU’s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive has proved challenging, as collection inefficiencies and inequities in the system persist.IT is also an energy consumer. Research indicates the industry contributes up to 3 per cent of global CO2 emissions through data centres, servers, mobile devices and desktop computers.Companies can make a dent in this by buying more efficient equipment, switching off machines when not in use, moving applications into the cloud and using virtualisation technology, which squeezes several applications on to a single server.Yet, compared with the buildings sector, the IT industry’s footprint is relatively small. Buildings are thought to contribute some 40 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.Here, modelling and design software has the potential to accelerate the move to more resource efficiency that makes greater use of renewable energy and natural light and ventilation.For new buildings, technology can produce remarkable efficiencies. The bigger challenge is retrofitting older buildings – the bulk of the world’s building stock. IT allows designers to model virtually a range of changes and assess which improvements would have the greatest impact on energy use.The role of software in retrofitting reflects the broader role for IT in promoting sustainability – the use of digital information to improve the management of existing global infrastructure.Take renewable energies such as solar and wind power, which are intermittent in their nature.“Technology is critical in integrating those renewable sources into a grid that wasn’t built for that power,” says Michael Valocchi, energy and utilities industry leader for IBM’s Global Business Services unit.Of course, with the aid of digital design systems, IT is also important in creating new products and services with smaller environmental footprints.However, whether mapping water leaks, integrating renewables into the grid, remodelling buildings to generate efficiencies, or fixing a smart wheel on to a bicycle, the challenge is not only to design products that are more resource-efficient – it is also to apply intelligence to existing systems.In short, IT has the potential to bring about a giant sustainability retrofit of the world."
246;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-03-17T21:50:47Z;Wall Street led by industrial gains;;Industrial and commodity stocks led a rebound on Wall Street following strong manufacturing data and a sense that the sharp sell-off in the previous session had been overdone.The S&P 500 bounced back 1.3 per cent to 1,273.72, paring some of the 2 per cent losses in the previous session, boosted by news that the Philadelphia Fed business activity index had showed its best monthly reading since January 1984.The index climbed 7.3 points in March to 43.4, far surpassing the 28.8 reading expected by economists.Also lifting sentiment was separate figures showing that weekly unemployment claims had declined by 16,000 to 385,000. “The downtrend in initial jobless claims is undeniable,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The data helped industrial stocks post some of the strongest gains in the session, recovering from some of the sharp losses earlier in the week. General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan, added 1.4 per cent to $19.22, paring back the 3.4 per cent losses seen in the previous session. The stock is down 5.6 per cent over the week, however.The S&P industrial index was up 1.6 per cent, reducing some of the 3.9 per cent losses suffered in the past five days. 3M was up 1.3 per cent to $88.69 while Honeywell was 1.6 per cent higher to $55.21 in the session.Elsewhere in the sector, FedEx saw gains after giving a strong fourth-quarter profit forecast. The package delivery company predicted a profit of $1.66 to $1.83 a share, topping the $1.66 estimated by analysts.This bright outlook overshadowed a reported 3.3 per cent fall in third-quarter profits and the shares were up 3.1 per cent to $87.89.Shares in rival UPS were up 1.8 per cent to $71.61 while Expeditors added 1.2 per cent to $47.11.Energy stocks saw the most powerful gains, however, as oil and gas prices jumped due to the turmoil in Japan and Bahrain.Schlumberger, the world’s largest oil services group, was up 4.8 per cent to $87.06 while ConocoPhillips, the energy group, added 4 per cent to $76.72. The S&P energy sector jumped 3.1 per cent.Material stocks also saw strong gains. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, was up 3.4 per cent to $52 as copper prices rose due to subsiding global panic. Cliff Natural Resources was up 5.8 per cent to $88.60.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.4 per cent higher to 11,774.51 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,636.05 in the session.Still, strategists warned that this was not the end of the pullback in US equities and the market was still in a corrective phase. “The averages will probably work their way a bit lower in the coming weeks, but we are probably more than halfway through the corrections,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The S&P is still down 5.2 per cent since its mid-February high before the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa. The index is down 2.3 per cent over the week, but still up 1.3 per cent since the start of the year. The previous session saw the index fall into negative territory for the year for the first time.The Vix index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was down 10.4 per cent in the session. It is up 30.8 per cent over the week and 60 per cent above mid-February lows. Elsewhere, technology stocks saw gains, rebounding from a week of sharp losses.Qualcomm, which lost 4.7 per cent in the previous session, was up 3.6 per cent to $52.32 after the mobile-phone chipmaker said it sees limited impact from the Japanese disaster.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Apple was up 1.4 per cent to $334.64 while Hewlett-Packard gained 3.2 per cent to $41.40. The S&P technology index was up 1 per cent, paring some of the 2.7 per cent fall previously in the week.In corporate news Winnebago Industries, the motor home manufacturer, reported a surprising 3.6 per cent decline in second- quarter revenue, sending the stock down 12 per cent to $13.37. The company blamed weakening consumer confidence caused by volatility in gas prices for the fall. Elsewhere Guess, the clothing retailer, gave a weak outlook both for earnings this year and for the current quarter’s results. The company also reported lower comparable sales at its larger US retail business declined. Shares were down 14 per cent to $37.71.
247;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-03-17T13:56:46Z;FedEx delivers with upbeat forecast;;FedEx shares jumped in pre-market trading, after investors shrugged off weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings and focused on the package delivery company’s forecasts for strong demand and higher margins in the rest of the year.For the three months to the end of February, net income fell three per cent to $231m, compared to the same period last year, on revenues that rose 11 per cent to $9.7bn. Earnings per share slipped to $0.73 from $0.76 last year.Excluding certain one off charges, FedEx earned about $0.81 a share, which fell just short of revised analyst estimates.Last month, FedEx slashed its third-quarter earnings estimates by about $0.25 per share after the company was hit by severe winter storms, which dented shipping volumes, and higher fuel prices, which increased costs.FedEx shares, which have fallen about 8 per cent since the start of the year, rose about 5 per cent to $89.36 in pre-market trading after Fred Smith, chief executive officer, painted a positive picture of the current quarter and the next year.“Continued growth in the global economy is driving solid revenue gains in our transportation businesses,” Mr Smith said. “We expect strong demand for our services to boost our financial performance in our fourth quarter.”FedEx said that growth would be helped by the recent combination of its FedEx Freight and FedEx National LTL (Less than truckload) operations, which would create a leaner, more efficient freight business.FedEx and its rivals, UPS and Deutsche Post DHL, are closely watched by investors as barometers of the global economy because they carry the goods that make up the backbone of international commerce and trade.For 2011, FedEx expects earnings per share of between $4.83 and $5.00, down from its previous forecast of $5.00 to $5.30 per share, excluding restructuring charges and certain legal costs.The forecast assumes that fuel prices remain stable and moderate global economic growth continues and FedEx warned that “ongoing political turmoil” in the Middle East and the impact of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan created uncertainties.
248;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-03-08T15:53:53Z;Hydrogen van road-test begins;;The UK’s largest road-test of hydrogen-powered vehicles began on Tuesday as companies seek low carbon alternatives to oil amid spiralling prices.Two converted Ford Transit vans began work at Stansted airport along with a mobile hydrogen generating and filling station to test whether the technology is practical.ITM Power, a Sheffield-based company, is to run trials with 21 companies and state bodies, including DHL and UPS, the logistics companies, Scottish Water, the utility, the RAC, and Enterprise, the facilities managers. Each will have the equipment for a week to test.Graham Cooley, chief executive of ITM, said it had targeted users with large fleets operating from a base, which therefore did not need to refuel on the road.“The return to base market is where all alternative fuels will begin,” he said. “The rationale for these tests is to understand the economics. The economics need to be right. We know the technology works.”However, he said fossil fuels would continue to increase in price. “We believe we are at the end of cheap oil. Hydrogen requires a capital investment then you have free fuel. It is about security of supply. There is a great opportunity for UK plc.”The vans’ engines have been converted to run on liquid hydrogen as well as diesel. The HFuel unit, built with £350,000 support from the government’s Technology Strategy Board (TSB), produces hydrogen on site by passing electricity through water. The only byproduct is oxygen. As long as the electricity is from renewable sources and generated on site, the process is carbon free. The vans can drive 200 miles on a tank of hydrogen and can refill with diesel if necessary.Ideally, they would be equipped with fuel cells, making hydrogen within the vehicle, but the cost of this is so far prohibitive.Mr Cooley said Stansted was also interested in reducing air pollution. He said hydrogen was favoured for vehicles because it could store energy generated outside peak hours.Germany, Japan and the US state of California have committed to building hydrogen filling stations and in return carmakers have agreed to produce hydrogen models by 2015.However, pioneering new technologies is risky. Aim-listed ITM has raised £45m from investors. But only this week Modec, an electric van maker in Coventry, went into administration.Garel Rhys, a motor industry expert attached to Cardiff Business School, said the internal combustion engine was likely to dominate for years to come. “Hydrogen is seen as the great white hope. It is clean at the tailpipe. But it is much more at the margins than electric cars. The hydrogen society does not exist yet. You need the infrastructure to make it in commercially viable quantities. You need the filling stations.”Nevertheless, Prof Rhys said it could form part of a “pick-and-mix” solution with different technologies.ITM has adopted its own “pick-and-mix” approach, releasing market-ready products to generate revenue while it waits for its vehicle bet to pay off. These include a welding torch and domestic boiler and cooker.
249;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-03-07T02:35:54Z;Modec runs out of power with debts of £40m;;Modec, maker of pioneering electric delivery vans, has gone into administration with debts of more than £40m.The main creditor is Federated Investments, the vehicle of Lord Borwick, who founded Modec in 2004. He invested the £14m profit on the sale of the 38 per cent stake held by his family for more than 40 years in Manganese Bronze, maker of the London taxi.News of the administration emerged the day after Manganese Bronze announced the single largest order for its taxis. The company’s joint venture with Geely Automobile Holdings of China is to supply 1,000 vehicles worth $27m (£16.6m) to Azerbaijan by the end of November.Lord Borwick, a former chairman of Manganese Bronze, set up an assembly plant in Coventry to build the Modec, which is comparable in size to a Ford Transit or Mercedes Sprinter. Tesco took 15 of the first vans to be built in 2007, but has not placed an order since.The plan was to increase production to 2,000 vans a year, but so far just 400 have been sold, including 150 in the UK, to customers such as UPS and FedEx.The report and accounts for 2009 show turnover of £9.3m, a pre-tax loss of £6m and net liabilities of £29m. Grant Thornton, the auditors, said the figures indicated “a material uncertainty which may cast doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern”.Three partners from Zolfo Cooper, a corporate advisory and restructuring business, were appointed as administrators on Friday, and immediately made 26 of the 53 employees redundant. They described Modec as “a market leader in its field, and as such it represents an attractive purchase for the right buyer”.Lord Borwick said the company had been hit by the recession, which had left potential customers reluctant to invest in something new. In spite of low interest rates, companies had been unwilling to incur the high capital cost of £55,000 per van. Enthusiasm for green transport was at a lower level than three years ago, even though diesel was becoming expensive.Nevertheless he believed that electric vehicles with low running costs were “the vehicles of the future. But we are unfortunately operating in the present”.The difficult economic climate has claimed other victims among companies focused on green transport. In April 2009, Axeon, an Aim-quoted company that supplied Modec with battery packs, was taken private after going into administration. At the beginning of this year, Tanfield, the Aim-quoted powered access specialist, completed the sale of the assets of Smith Electric Vehicles UK to its US associate. The group had set out to become a global leader in zero-emission electric trucks through its ownership of Smith Electric, renowned for producing milk floats in the 1950s.
250;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;FedEx slashes earnings forecast;;FedEx on Monday cut its earnings forecast for the third quarter of 2011 by at least 22 per cent, blaming the move on bad weather and volatile fuel prices that have increased expenses and reduced revenues.This winter, European and US cities have been snowed under, while oil prices have spiked, in part due to instability in the Middle East.“We experienced significant network disruptions …and unusually high costs from severe winter storms. In addition, fuel prices continued to escalate since we provided our earnings outlook in December,” Alan Graf, chief financial officer of FedEx, said in a statement.The package delivery company now expects adjusted earnings, excluding certain freight costs, to be between $0.70 and $0.90 per share for the three months to the end of February. Previously, FedEx had forecast earnings of between $0.95 and $1.15.FedEx said the constrained performance would dent its full-year expectations and that it would update the market further when it releases its third-quarter results on March 17.Earlier this month, United Parcel Service, FedEx’s main rival, said it was hopeful it could mitigate the effects of poor weather and higher fuel costs, but admitted first quarter 2011 earnings were under pressure. “Europe, [where they had] the worst weather in the UK in 60 years, had a big impact on us. But there really hasn’t been a good, clean week in January so far, week after week,” Scott Davis, chief executive of UPS, told investors.Wall Street has reduced its forecasts for both companies. In the past four weeks, analysts have cut their third-quarter expectations for FedEx by $0.06 a share to $1.02 and their first quarter forecasts for UPS by $0.03 a share to $0.87.Nevertheless, most analysts remain positive on the sector. After a tough period in 2009, delivery companies bounced back strongly in 2010 as the global economy experienced a moderate recovery and international trade surged. Christian Wetherbee at Citibank wrote at the end of January: “The bull case for FedEx is underpinned by improving economic growth domestically and internationally, which is likely to drive better volumes and solid pricing.”Mr Graf said FedEx continued “to see strength in our base business across all transportation segments and geographies”. But he cautioned that the revised third quarter estimates assumed stable weather and fuel prices.FedEx shares, which have climbed about 20 per cent over the past 12 months, slipped 1 per cent to $93.34 in after-hours trading. UPS shares, which have added a third in the last year, fell 1 per cent to $74.25.
251;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-02-04T11:57:37Z;Shopping;Domestic consumption is becoming increasingly global in nature;What do Australian department stores, Brazilian industrial production data, and financial results from UPS have in common? All three are influenced in peculiar ways by the increasingly global nature of domestic consumption. Whereas shopping used to involve heading down to the shops, or, more recently, buying things locally online, now people are increasingly happy for goods to be shipped from abroad.Desiring stuff made in other countries is not new. But investors, in their love affair with emerging markets, often overlook the phenomenon. For example, one reason why Brazil’s industrial output fell 0.7 per cent in December – the second straight monthly decline – is that its increasingly wealthy citizens used the strong real to buy imported goods. Policymakers need to remember that a rising currency does not only hurt exporters. For local producers, the lesson is that a booming economy is no excuse for laziness. On the contrary, they have to work harder to match what is available from overseas.Retailers face a more direct problem Down Under. The Australian dollar’s near-parity with the greenback has resulted in 40 per cent of online spend going overseas (clicking abroad also saves on local sales taxes), according to PayPal. American internet shoppers spend only a tenth of their dollars abroad. Some Australian retailers and wholesalers are calling for a tax on all foreign internet purchases. Needless to say, the campaign is not popular.UPS loves this shift to overseas shopping. Its international export revenues expanded 9 per cent year-on-year in the final quarter of 2010. That is impressive – normally matching gross domestic product growth is the best that package delivery companies can hope for, given rising oil prices, bad weather, and sluggish economic growth. UPS’s strength hints at changing consumer habits. Global trade is thousands of years old. It has just never been so easy to do it from the comfort of home.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
252;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-02-04T00:57:32Z;UPS to increase quarterly dividends;;United Parcel Service on Thursday said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 11 per cent to $0.52 per share payable on March 2.The package delivery company has maintained or boosted its dividend every year for forty years. UPS shares held steady at about $74.23 in after-hours trading.On Tuesday UPS reported a 48 per cent increase in quarterly profits, pledged to buy back $2bn of shares in 2011 and forecast record full-year earnings for 2011.Profits and revenues at logistics companies have bounced back strongly as international trade has grown amid a moderate global economic recovery.“[This year] is going to be a great year for UPS and we’re committed to significantly increasing distributions to shareowners,” Scott Davis, chief executive of UPS, said.
253;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-02-01T22:09:14Z;Wall Street matches 2008 mark;;"US equities broke through a series of technical barriers as a series of strong earnings reports from industry heavyweights and promising manufacturing data set a buoyant mood.The S&P 500 closed above 1,300 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 12,000 as Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, reported that its fourth-quarter profit more than tripled from a year earlier. This sent shares in the company up 5.5 per cent to $19.22.The industry bellwether posted income of $2.89bn, or 36 cents a share, up from $767m, or 10 cents a share a year earlier. Optimism over the stock was muted slightly, however, as the company gave a 2011 profit forecast that was below analysts’ expectations.Nevertheless, the news helped lift the rest of the pharmaceutical sector. Mylan, one of the world’s largest generic drugs companies, was up 1.6 per cent to $23.54 while Merck gained 2.5 per cent to $34.But the best performing sector on Wall Street was the materials sector, which was lifted by data showing booming manufacturing activity in the US and around the world.The S&P materials index was up 2.8 per cent to 246.02 as the ISM manufacturing composite index jumped to 60.8 in January, up 2.3 from December and ahead of the median forecast of 58. This was its highest level since May 2004.“Today’s report is another very strong signal regarding near-term manufacturing activity. To sustain this strength, much will depend on the consumer,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Among the stocks to gain were Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coal miner, which was up 4.9 per cent to $89.64 and Alcoa, an aluminium producer, which added 4.5 per cent to $17.32.This helped the S&P 500 close 1.7 per cent higher to 1,307,59 busting through the technically significant 1,300 mark that the markets struggled with last week.The S&P index lost 1.8 per cent late last week on disappointing GDP figures and concerns that the Suez Canal might be shut down due to the protests in Egypt. But the markets have now completely bounced back from those losses after two consecutive sessions of strong gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3 per cent to 12,040.16, the first time the index closed above 12,000 since June 2008. Last month, the index saw its best January performance since 1997. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.9 per cent to 2,751.19 in the session.Central to investor confidence in the session was a string of healthy earnings reports. Archer Daniels Midland, the world’s largest grain processor, reported that second-quarter earnings had jumped 29 per cent in the second quarter due to high grain prices and strong global demand. This sent shares in the company up 6.2 per cent to $34.70.ADM reported a net profit of $732m, or $1.14 per share, compared with a profit of $567m, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier and way ahead of analysts’ estimates of 78 cents per share.United Parcel Service also saw strong results, reporting a 48 per cent jump in profits due to strong demand over the holiday period. The logistics group also forecast that 2011 will see record earnings, eclipsing the 2007 peak in earnings. The news lifted the shares 4.2 per cent to $74.59.Fedex, another global delivery company, added 2.6 per cent to $92.69.Also helping to liven the S&P index were energy stocks, which saw strong gains as the Brent crude oil price hit $100 a barrel in the previous session for the first time since October 2008.ExxonMobil, the giant of the energy sector, was up another 4 per cent to $83.91 in the session. The company posted earnings on Monday close to the 2008 record, which sent the shares up 2.1 per cent. The stock is up 36 per cent since the start of September.Murphy Oil was up 3.1 per cent to $68.37 while the S&P energy index added 1.9 per cent to 554.13.Lexmark International, which makes laser and inkjet printers, saw some of the strongest gains on the S&P index, rising 13.2 per cent to $39.45 after predicting strong first-quarter
profits.Baidu saw strong gains after the Chinese internet-search group said revenue had doubled in the fourth quarter and net earnings had increased by 171 per cent, beating analyst and company expectations. The stock was up 9.3 per cent to $118.73. Rival Google rose 1.8 per cent to $611.04"
254;UPS;United Parcel Service;2011-02-01T17:58:54Z;UPS predicts stronger US economic growth;;United Parcel Service expects US economic growth to strengthen in 2011 as the impact of recent monetary and fiscal stimulus policies take effect and businesses become more certain about the outlook.“Businesses are in a much better position to make critical decisions with a greater understanding of what the impact will be to their bottom line,” Scott Davis, UPS chief executive, told investors on Tuesday.“Clearly this is reflected in the recent upward revisions in 2011 economic indicators for the US.”UPS now expects the US economy to grow about 3 per cent in 2011 and, while global GDP growth will moderate, the company thinks industrial production should remain ahead.The comments came as the package delivery group reported a 48 per cent jump in quarterly profits , helped by strong demand for services over the holiday period, and forecast record full-year 2011 earnings.UPS and other global logistics companies are closely watched barometers of global economic health because they transport many of the goods that are the backbone of domestic and international commerce.Mr Davis commended Washington for its recent tax compromise noting that the moves “will quicken the pace of economic recovery … Although I would like to see a more permanent solution this is an important move in the right direction and should support a more dynamic recovery in 2011.”However, Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer of UPS, said there could be some headwinds in the coming year not least from the severe winter weather which has already swept through parts of Europe and the US, disrupting retail sales and deliveries. “We are also a little concerned about the instability in the Middle East,” Mr Keuhn said.Mr Kuehn also expects the variable patterns of economic growth that emerged in 2010 will continue in 2011 with some countries like Germany and China seeing slightly slower growth but still outperforming peers.For the three months to the end of 2010, UPS reported net income of $1.1bn or $1.11 per share, up from $757m or $0.75 a share, a year earlier. The increase was helped by an after-tax gain of $32m related to the disposal of certain non-core business units.Revenues jumped 8.4 per cent to $13.4bn, boosted by a strong performance across UPS’s three main units: domestic US package delivery, international package delivery and supply chain and freight.Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.08, up 44 per cent from a year ago and higher than the average $1.05 per share expected by analysts complied by Reuters.During 2010 as a whole, revenues rose by 9.4 per cent to about $50bn producing net income of $3.5bn, up 62 per cent on the previous year.UPS shares, which have climbed about 24 per cent over the last year, jumped about 4 per cent to $74.11 in early market trading. Logistics stocks have rebounded solidly over the last two years as a burgeoning economic recovery has raised demand of their services.“Over the past two years, UPS took the necessary steps to weather the economic storm and emerged stronger,” said Mr Kuehn. “As a result, we expect to exceed previous peak earnings level with 2011 diluted earnings.”UPS expects to achieve earnings per share of between $4.12 and $4.35 in 2011, which would represent an increase of between 16 per cent and 22 per cent over its underlying 2010 results.Mr Kuehn added that cash flows were expected to be particularly strong allowing the company to return money to shareholders by ramping up its policy of stock repurchases from about $800m a year to about $2bn in 2011.
255;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
256;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Asia’s healthcare sector needs to consult a doctor;The industry is a powerful source of economic growth, but consolidation is needed;Private healthcare is the hot new thing in emerging Asia, with more than half a dozen countries targeting it as a powerful source of economic growth. Yet if healthcare was a patient it would be lying in a hospital bed awaiting essential surgery.It is not only governments that see the sector as a boom area. UPS, the US logistics group, has just announced plans to open specialist healthcare hubs in Singapore and possibly China. Moelis, the US financial advisory firm, recently said healthcare ranked alongside energy and financial services among its top targets for Asian expansion.The attraction is twofold. Much of the early demand has been intra-regional, with a flow of patients from countries with less developed healthcare towards those with better hospitals and techniques.For example, visitors to Parkway Holdings’ Mount Elizabeth hospital in Singapore – the first in Asia to perform cardiomyoplasty surgery for heart failure successfully with a laser – can expect to hear plenty of Bahasa Indonesia, the language of its large southerly neighbour.The big target, though, is westerners travelling to Asia for elective or essential treatment that they can’t get at home because they are not insured or face long waiting lists in public healthcare systems.A study by India’s Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry put the potential value of such business at Rs80bn ($1.75bn) a year by 2012, compared with Rs45bn in 2010. It also costed key procedures, estimating that knee surgery costing $15,000 in the UK can be done for $1,000 in India, while a $300,000 US liver transplant is available for just $4,000.With price disparities on this scale it is hardly surprising that India’s Clinical Research Institute estimates that more than 700,000 uninsured patients from the US alone are now seeking treatment abroad each year. ICRI says this will help India to achieve medical tourism growth of more than 30 per cent a year by 2012.This sort of calculation lies behind the widespread adoption of healthcare as a strategic priority, especially in south-east Asia. Malaysia, for example, has made the sector one of 12 main economic areas, which are supposed to double national income per head over the next decade.Thailand started trying to do the same thing in 2003, when former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra launched a medical hub strategy. Singapore has also built a large medical tourism sector, the Philippines has a big “Medical City” in Manila, and Indonesia and Vietnam have both been identified by Kuala Lumpur as potential rivals.These countries seem to view healthcare as an easy economic win. The Malaysian government, for example, boldly predicts that it will be hosting 1m health travellers a year by 2020, which will contribute M$27.8bn ($9bn) to gross national income.There is less talk of emerging problems, such as fears among health professionals that underfunded public hospitals are bleeding medical staff as rewards rise in the private sector. Some countries are facing an ethical backlash: China has had to introduce new rules for organ collection in the face of claims that kidneys were being taken from executed prisoners.The industry is also extremely vulnerable to external shocks. Malaysia’s business fell by 4 per cent in 2009, for example. And at Bangkok’s Bumrungrad Hospital, one of the most established medical tourism destinations, profits improved in 2009, but were still 22 per cent down on the pre-crisis peak of 2007.The fundamental problem, though, is that there are too many countries trying to do the same thing, with too few substantial players. That suggests that the sector needs a rapid bout of consolidation to reduce competition and create companies with sufficient scale to operate across national borders.To be fair, the scalpel has already been wielded. In the biggest deal so far, Malaysia’s Khazanah Nasional acquired Singapore’s Parkway for S$4.5bn ($3.5bn) after a tussle with India’s Fortis Healthcare. Parkway, which runs three hospitals in Singapore, one in Brunei, six in China and two in India, is being merged with Khazanah’s Pantai Holdings, which runs nine.There have been plenty of smaller deals, including a recent $330m merger between Thailand’s Bangkok Dusit Medical Services and Health Network PCL. Insiders say there will be more, at least within the 10-country Association of South East Asian Nations, once foreign shareholding limits are eased as part of wider moves towards an Asean single market by 2015.Still, much more corporate blood needs to be spilt if the sector is to achieve the results for which governments are so desperate. Asian economic growth and western cost-cutting suggest the prognosis is good, but only if the patient keeps taking the medicine.kevin.brown@ft.com
257;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;FedEx and UPS in US antitrust probe;;UPS and FedEx, two of the world’s biggest parcel delivery companies, are being investigated by the US Department of Justice over allegations that they broke antitrust rules relating to their treatment of third-party shipping consultants.Susan Rosenberg, a spokeswoman for UPS, said the company had been co-operating “fully” with the authorities since November when the DoJ launched a preliminary investigation in response to a lawsuit filed by AFMS, an Oregon-based consulting firm.“We’re aware that the plaintiff’s attorney has asked the justice department to look into this issue,” said Maury Lane, a spokesman for FedEx. The DoJ declined to comment. AFMS said it had not contacted the DoJ.Such has been the complexity of the rates and services offered by FedEx and UPS, that even multinational companies have employed consultants to help them choose the most suitable products.These third parties also negotiate discounts from carriers, that can range from 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the base prices. They typically receive a proportion of the money saved as a fee.In a lawsuit filed last summer in a district court in California, AFMS, one such consultancy, claimed UPS and FedEx had conspired to monopolise the package delivery business, refusing to deal with consultants and intimidating customers who used third parties.AFMS, whose customers include Sony and Guess, said it had suffered damages of more than $20m as a result of the carriers’ actions. UPS and FedEx have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which will be heard this month.In their responses, lawyers for the carriers argued they continued to deal with consultants, that it was, by definition, impossible for two carriers to monopolise an industry and that AFMS had presented no evidence of collusion.Ms Rosenberg said that as a result of the suit, the DoJ had asked UPS for details of its policies for interacting with third-party negotiators and shipping consultants.“We defend our right to decline to work with third-party negotiators if we believe it is in the best interest of customers …The notion that FedEx and UPS would conspire is outrageous …we compete aggressively,” she said.One consultant familiar with the issue said: “Carriers love it when they win new business thanks to a consultant but when they lose a big customer they tend to blame the consultants.”UPS shares, which surged more than 25 per cent in the past year as the global economy recovered, fell slightly to $71.94. FedEx dipped 0.2 per cent to $93.

Earnings came in at $1.16 a share compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.31 and revenue was also lighter than the consensus forecast.But the package delivery company raised its forecast for the fiscal year 2011 on the back of a stronger-than-expected holiday season, much of which was not included in the second quarter. It now predicts earnings per share of between $5.00 and $5.30 for the full year.Shares in FedEx gained 2 per cent to $94.22, helping the wider industrials sector add 1.1 per cent.The stock fell after its reported first-quarter results in September which had more than doubled year-on-year because the company issued a cautious outlook warning of the slowing of economic growth.Rival United Parcel Service also rose, up 2.1 per cent to $73.76.“I’ve always looked at FedEx as a bellwether of US economic activity because they transport goods across the country,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer of Smart Growth Funds. “They raised estimates on the back of the positive holiday season but is that going to extend
into 2011?”Stocks extended their gains after a report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed factory activity in the region rose to 24.3 in December, maintaining and adding to gains after a jump to 22.5 the month before.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,242.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to close at 11,499.25 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,637.31.Initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, down 3,000 to 420,000. But last week’s figures on the number of people claiming unemployment benefit for the first time were revised slightly higher.“This is a modest decline but enough to keep both the four- and eight-week moving averages heading down; the former is now at just 422,750, the lowest since July 2008, before the Lehman bust,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.A separate report released before the opening bell showed construction began on more homes in November than in the month before, the first such rise for three months.The S&P 500 homebuilders index added 1.6 per cent to $248.16.Shares in Visa and Mastercard tumbled after the Federal Reserve proposed new rules which could cut the debit card fees paid by retailers who accept the cards by up to 90 per cent. Visa dropped 12.7 per cent to $67.19 and Mastercard lost 10.3 per cent to $223.49.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $12.52 after the bank said investors in some mortgage bonds had agreed to postpone a deadline

The company had to cut the price of its initial public offering to $806m, or $11 per share, when it had originally offered shares at between $13 and $15 each.In other earnings news, General Mills profits rose 8.6 per cent and shares added 0.6 per cent to $36.59 after the maker of Cheerios cereal and Progresso soup missed analyst expectations. Sales volume rose but the company cut prices

The plan will see a secondary offering worth up to $20bn in the first half of next year.AIG also said it had agreed to repay a $20bn loan from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with money from the sale of its businesses in Asia and that the Treasury would convert its preferred stock into common shares, raising its stake to 92 per cent.Financials led the risers, up 0.4 per cent, as bank stocks were buoyed by hopes that a higher Treasury yield could boost profit.Bank of America jumped 2.6 per cent to $12.31, Wells Fargo gained 0.9 per cent to $29.62 and JPMorgan climbed 1.1 per cent to $40.71.Elsewhere in financials, BlackRock added 2.1 per cent to $177.37 after it was reported that the world’s largest money manager expected “very strong” earnings for the fourth quarter.But State Street sank 3.5 per cent to $44.57 after it said it had sold $11bn in mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities as part of a strategic repositioning of its investment portfolio, resulting in a $350m charge to be recorded in the fourth quarter.The S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent to 1,228.92 by midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.2 per cent to 11,344.89 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,610.65.Investors were cheered when data showed initial jobless claims had fallen more than expected last week with the four-week moving average hovering around two-year lows.But the government revised the previous week’s figure higher, saying claims tended to jump after the Thanksgiving holiday.“The holiday season normally creates volatility in these figures that doesn’t shake out until late January/early February, so unfortunately it will be difficult to draw firm conclusions from these data for a while,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Global markets and S&P futures had already been edging higher after data showed that Japan’s economy had grown faster than its government had initially calculated and that Australian employers had added more than double the number of workers previously forecast last month.Elsewhere, plans to return more money to shareholders were celebrated.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold climbed 1.6 per cent to $110.28 after the company announced a two-for-one stock split and a supplemental dividend of $1 a share, on the back of the rising price of copper.Richard Adkerson, chief executive, said: “Authorisation of this supplemental dividend reflects the strong current cash position and significant cash flows being generated by our global operations.”United Parcel Service added 1.1 per cent to $72.83, a 52-week high, after the delivery company’s chief financial officer told a German newspaper that it planned a higher dividend and more share buy-backs rather than use its free cash flow for large acquisitions.Whole Foods, the high-end supermarket, also announced that it would resume paying a dividend but its shares nudged down 0.4 per cent to $48.94.Analysts at JPMorgan said the company had discontinued its dividend in August 2008 because of negative free cash flow trends but, after eight quarters of robust cash flow generation, it now felt more comfortable.“We note that the ongoing dividend payment is a good indicator for the long-term outlook for the company and we believe this will be a positive catalyst for the stock,” they said.Meanwhile, Ford edged up 0.4 per cent to $16.75 after analysts at Bank of America raised the carmaker’s 2011 and 2012 earnings-per-share estimates. They added that its shares were likely to outperform on earnings growth and balance sheet improvement.
260;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-12-09T15:06:27Z;Treasurers rejoice;Timely pension accounting windfall blunts effects of expensive money;Every cloud has a silver lining. While the historic spike in bond yields has made money suddenly more expensive, it is coming at an opportune time for some corporate treasurers if rates hold until the end of the month.Companies with defined benefit pension plans had been expecting a big hit to shareholders’ equity and possibly a boost in required contributions as a result of low yields on the baskets of corporate bonds they use to discount liabilities. Back in mid-September, actuarial firm Milliman calculated that the funded ratio of America’s 100 largest defined benefit pension plans had dropped to 70 per cent, the lowest in the decade for which they have published results. In October, when rates were near their nadir, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts estimated that company pensions in the S&P 500 were 77 per cent funded as compared with 82 per cent at the beginning of the year.Rates’ impact can be surprisingly large. During fiscal 2009, which ended in March 2010, BT Group saw liabilities increase by £9.9bn, mostly because of a drop in bond yields that brought its discount rate from 3.8 per cent to 1.8 per cent. That period also marked the end of a stellar year for investment returns, but assets grew only £3.5bn. Ford Motor calculates that a 1 percentage point move in these rates up or down could subtract or add $7.4bn or $8.7bn from its pension and healthcare liabilities respectively. It earned $2.7bn in 2009. UPS calculates that each quarter-point change would subtract or add about $640m to pension liabilities.Though most companies probably get a net benefit from cheap money, it is comforting to know that the past month’s bond market carnage is not wholly unwelcome in some corporate boardrooms.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
261;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-12-02T15:37:24Z;TNT;Dutch postal group’s decision to break up is neutral for investors;"Almost one year ago to the day, Peter Bakker, chief executive of TNT, was adamant the Dutch postal group would not be broken up. Just four months later – and perhaps under pressure from activist investors – he decided to spin off the declining mail business. A few months later, and the express parcel business was set to be jettisoned. Now, a plan for the latter has finally been confirmed; the split is real.The result for investors is effectively neutral. Upon completion of the demerger, they will own a share in the mail business and a separate share in the express business. The former will be valued at roughly €3bn and the latter €6bn, estimates Credit Suisse. Taken together, that is about the same as the combined business now. So why bother? After all, the additional costs of maintaining a second listed company could be €15m in the first year alone.There is certainly strategic logic for the split as the two businesses are very different. The snail-mail division focuses on Europe and particularly the Netherlands, and requires little capital. Its volumes shrank 7 per cent in the third quarter, although it still generates plenty of cash. Conversely, the global express business needs loads of capital to fuel its high growth agenda. Investors can now pick and choose.But the real impetus for the split may have come from TNT’s activist investors, who want to facilitate an acquisition. US rivals Fedex and UPS covet the express business as a vehicle to take them further into Europe; a separate listing would make a takeover easier. More importantly, takeovers fought over shares listed on a public exchange can push up the final purchase price, and with it the premium for shareholders. Either way, TNT shareholders win – which shows that bigger is not always better.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
262;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-11-15T12:08:26Z;Low yields lure blue chips to US corporate bond market;;Companies from UPS to Time Warner Cable have rushed to lock in the low interest rates still available in the US bond markets, using the money to plug pension fund gaps, buy back shares or build up rainy-day cash piles.The amount of money borrowed in the corporate bond markets so far this month has been greater than during any previous November, according to data provider Dealogic. Blue-chip companies with investment grade ratings sold more than $41bn of new bonds in the past two weeks, Dealogic said.With government bond yields at near-record lows, investors keep pouring money into corporate bond funds to boost returns.It is somewhat unclear what direction rates are headed, however. Last week, 10-year US Treasury yields rose to 2.79 per cent, more than 30 basis points higher than earlier this month when the Federal Reserve announced it would buy $600bn of government bonds as part of its monetary easing.“Some companies are getting a little concerned about the sustainability of low US Treasury yields,” said Therese Esperdy, head of debt capital markets at JPMorgan. The recent rise in yields had “poked some of the fence-sitters into activity”, she said, adding that a lot of companies were lining up deals and she expected bond issuance to continue at a high pace until the end of the year if markets remained stable.Last week, UPS, the express delivery company, sold a $2bn bond, with the proceeds to be used to fund a deficit in its pension plan. “What drove it was the attractiveness of the market right now,” said UPS. “This was just a matter of taking advantage of some very attractive rates.”Time Warner Cable sold $1.9bn of new bonds and said some of the money would be used to buy back shares, a growing trend as companies take advantage of low interest rates and cheap stocks.Some companies are selling bonds even if they do not need the money right away. “The vast majority of new deals are driven by the very low yields on offer to companies, even though there may not be an immediate need for that cash,” said Jonny Fine, head of US investment grade syndicate at Goldman Sachs.Despite renewed eurozone sovereign debt concerns, corporate bond spreads have remained stable. “Sovereign risks in the eurozone and global currency issues are two ongoing concerns for US corporate bond markets,” said Mark Bamford, head of global fixed-income syndicate at Barclays Capital. “So far there has not been an impact but it is something to keep an eye on.”
263;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-11-07T21:53:32Z;DHL chief promises action over bomb fears;;"The head of one of the three big air-express companies has reacted to the parcel bombs sent from Yemen and Greece by pledging better screening of customers and packages before they reach airports.“What we need to do is improve surveillance at the pick-up point, have more aggressive screening as items enter our systems,” said Ken Allen, chief of DHL Express, rival of UPS and Federal Express.With European Union governments to meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss airfreight safety, Mr Allen cautioned against an overreaction. “A blanket approach” could “end up diverting time and funds from other important security areas,” said Mr Allen, whose company is a subsidiary of Deutsche Post. “It’s about targeting and intelligence.”Air cargo does not routinely go through electronic screening. But the discovery of US-bound parcel bombs aboard aircraft in Dubai and the UK last month, and the spate of explosive packages sent from Greece to governments in Europe, prompted calls for tighter security.While some EU governments announced national measures, interior ministers on Monday will discuss stricter European rules and the possibility of harmonising them with the US.The airfreight industry and exporters are worried that governments could force them to re-examine all packages while in transit, which would slow the tempo and raise costs of cargo.Mr Allen said it would be practical to have one set of rules for “a well known company sending something to another well known company” and stricter ones for “an unknown dispatching something to who-knows-where”.A “huge amount” of security already existed which the industry did not like to discuss. “When you buy a ticket, you divulge details which can be used to vet you; the same goes for information about goods being shipped.”"
264;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;DHL ready to expand again after US setback;;Express delivery company DHL Express has undergone a tough restructuring after pulling the plug on its US domestic delivery business two years ago and is now ready to expand again, its chief executive said.“We’ve stabilised the business, everyone’s refocused,” said Ken Allen, who is also a board member of Germany’s Deutsche Post, which owns DHL Express. “I know it’s early days, but we know what we need to do to grow.”In particular, he said, DHL Express was aiming to work more closely with Post’s two other freight units, DHL Global Forwarding and DHL Supply-Chain Management, to offer DHL customers different ways of moving goods.“It’s not about cross-selling, it’s about offering each customer a full range of logistical services,” said Mr Allen, who joined the company some 35 years ago. “People talk about a one-stop-shop, but I call it a [shopping] mall.”After losing billions trying to establish itself as a domestic rival to US-based UPS and Federal Express, DHL Express hit the headlines in 2008 when it closed its national US express-delivery business, shedding 15,000 jobs.In the wake of this dramatic move, Mr Allen moved from heading DHL Express’ US business to running the entire company in 2009 and sought to bring the company back to its original strength – cross-border express delivery.While UPS and FedEx started life as domestic players, DHL was founded in the US in 1969 to provide international express services to its – mainly US – corporate clients, who were then expanding their global businesses.“DHL was pretty much alone in the game until the early 90s, when rivals got into the international business,” Mr Allen said. “We should never forget that we are the global market leader in international express delivery.”While DHL Express’ US presence shrivelled, analysts at Dutch bank ING reckon the company in 2008 moved 24 per cent of international packages from Europe and 36 per cent of packages within Asia – more than any rival.In the second quarter of this year, DHL Express clocked up revenues of €1.6bn ($2.2bn) from cross-border express delivery, while UPS and FedEx respectively recorded €1.5bn and €1.4bn in sales for international package deliveries.Mr Allen said DHL’s selling point was the fact it was “a collection of businesses which all grew up locally to form an international network”, rather than being a more centrally operated business like some of its rivals.“In Australia, we sponsor the lifesavers at the beach, our brand is an integral part of society,” British-born Mr Allen said. “People think of us as a UK company in the UK. It’s a real ‘think globally, act locally’ company.”He recalled taking managers from the US – where DHL continues to pick up and deliver international packages – to Europe and Asia.“The penny dropped,” he said. “They saw how strong the brand was outside the US.”Mr Allen in addition trimmed DHL Express’ structure and costs. He sold domestic delivery businesses in the UK and France, and trimmed management, including DHL Express’ board, which shrank from 13 members to five.DHL Express also bought domestic delivery companies in India and China, although Mr Allen said these moves were “one-offs” rather than an attempt to re-enter national express delivery markets in any major way.“The company is back to a level of profitability not seen since Deutsche Post took over [DHL in 2002]. We’ve taken cost out without sacrificing quality,” said the man who daily receives punctuality statistics by e-mail.Instead of losing most of DHL Express’ international clients in the US, “we managed to keep 75 per cent”, he said. The plan was to cut US losses from €1.3bn to €400m by now. “I can say that we’ve done better than that.”
265;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;Greece halts mail services after attacks;;Greece has suspended international mail and courier services from Athens International Airport for 48 hours following a spate of attempted parcel bombings that included packages sent to Angela Merkel, German chancello r, and Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister.Wednesday’s move by the country’s civil aviation authority came after two parcel bombs discovered at the airport’s cargo terminal were detonated by police in a controlled explosion.The packages were addressed to Europol, the European criminal intelligence agency, and the International Court of Justice, both based at the Hague, a police official said.Thirteen parcel bombs were sent by courier on Monday and Tuesday, mainly to foreign embassies in Athens. A courier company employee was slightly injured when one package exploded.Police were still searching for two more packages intended for delivery in Greece, the official said. Two suspected members of Conspiracy of Cells of Fire, a Greek anarchist group, have been arrested.German police destroyed a parcel bomb that arrived at Ms Merkel’s office on Tuesday.A UPS cargo plane was diverted from Rome to Bologna on Tuesday following an alert that it was carrying a suspicious package addressed to Mr Berlusconi. The package caught fire as it was being checked by airport police.Concern mounted in Athens on Wednesday that the bombing campaign was aimed at heightening political tension ahead of Sunday’s local government elections.George Papandreou, Greek prime minister, denounced the campaign, saying, “These irresponsible and mindless attacks aimed at damaging Greece’s huge effort to put the economy back on track and regain credibility will not succeed.”Several bomb attacks overnight against cars parked in the centre of Athens triggered fears of broader violence by local extremist groups.A series of bomb scares underscored the nervous mood.The finance ministry building was evacuated for several hours after an anonymous telephone threat.Similar calls were made to shipping companies in Piraeus port, the Union of Greek Shipowners and the offices of Cosco, the Chinese state shipping company which operates a container terminal at the port. No explosives were found, police said.Meanwhile, European interior ministers have agreed to discuss air cargo safety at a meeting in Brussels on Monday in response to both the parcel bombs and the devices discovered in Dubai and the UK last week, aides disclosed on Wednesday.Germany had pushed for the issue to be raised at the regularly-scheduled meeting, in the hope of crafting a Europe-wide response by the end of the year. Its interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, has accentuated the need to improve the monitoring of non-EU shipping freight coming to and through Europe.The European Commission said on Wednesday it would host a special meeting of air safety experts from the 27 member states on Friday to assess its response to recent threats, calling it a “stock-taking exercise”.“The terrorist threat is always there, as we have repeatedly seen in the past few months,” a spokesman said. “We have to remain vigilant both at member state and at European level.”
266;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-11-01T16:34:20Z;Parcel force;For logistics companies, terrorism is just another cost of doing business;Thunderstorms can be terrifying, but are nothing out of the ordinary. The same is true of social weather, even if individual events appear disturbingly unpredictable. So markets are unruffled by the discovery of bombs in aircraft cargo holds– September 11 was a shocker but research from Standard and Poor’s shows that on average the S&P 500 was up 2 per cent within a month of subsequent serious terrorist events. For logistics companies, terrorism is just another cost of doing business, like stormy seas or negotiating with Somali pirates.Indeed, even a new layer of security costs – if governments decide more needs to be done – would be insubstantial next to the big expenses of fuel, capital and labour. Since everyone would pay, no one would lose out to competitors. Customers might face delays, but shippers and freight forwarders are used to rerouting around bottlenecks.Indeed, prosaic concerns are more pressing for freight operators, in particular the gentle pace of economic recovery and its uneven geographic spread. Asian trade is still booming, but in Europe Dutch parcel company TNT on Monday reported average yields and shipment growth in the third quarter that were below analyst expectations. In the US, growth rates for air cargo have slowed as the boost from industrial restocking starts to fade.There are also structural concerns, particularly in Europe. High margin overnight business, a priority for several years, could lose out as customers restructure operations in the wake of the recession. Cheapness and reliability might be more valued than speed. Land shipments are less of a threat to air freight in the gigantic US, but investors in FedEx and UPS might worry that one of them will overpay for the express business of TNT, which is about to be split out from the mail operation.

More important, fourth-quarter guidance has been very strong.”The gains were pared in the afternoon as the dollar strengthened and equities trod a path that has become familiar, moving in the opposite direction to the dollar. The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 1,180.26, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to 11,146.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,459.67.Increased demand for construction equipment in emerging markets helped Caterpillar beat expectations. Sales rose 53 per cent and profits were up 96 per cent from the same period a year earlier. Caterpillar, which is seen as a barometer for global construction, also raised its 2010 revenue forecast. Its shares, up 38.4 per cent this year, fell 1.2 per cent to $78.89.Investors also looked to United Parcel Services for signs of a strengthening global economic recovery. The world’s largest package shipping company can be seen as a bellwether for international trade.UPS beat expectations in the third quarter as net income jumped 69 per cent.It also raised its full-year outlook, saying it expected modest growth in demand during the holiday season. Its shares, which have added 21.3 per cent this year, nudged down 0.1 per cent to $69.59.Auction website operator Ebay surged 6 per cent to $27.19 after its third-quarter earnings beat expectations. It is halfway through a three-year plan to revive growth. Ebay also owns PayPal, the payment service used across the internet, which benefited from more consumers shopping online and using it to settle bills.Ebay raised its outlook for the fourth quarter above analysts’ estimates.Netflix soared 12.8 per cent to $172.69 after the film rental company said it was expanding its online-streaming offer and would use this to expand outside the US. Reed Hastings, chief executive, said the company was now primarily an online streaming company that also offered DVDs by post. Earnings were in line with forecasts but the company’s subscriber base expanded faster than expected in the third quarter.Fidelity National Financial introduced a new dividend policy that could see its 2011 pay-out halved.

268;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-10-21T18:05:58Z;UPS upbeat on growth prospects;;Tight supply chains and companies’ need to rebuild stocks could provide a boost to the global economy, according to UPS, one of the world’s largest logistics companies.Companies slashed production and cut their stocks in an effort to trim costs during the downturn.But many, UPS said, went too far and therefore began ramping up production at the end of 2009.Introducing UPS’s third-quarter results, Scott Davis, chief executive, said the company continued to plan for a “slow-growth economic environment”, but noted some potential upside to the base scenario.Investors scrutinise UPS results closely because its international network delivers packages and supplies to businesses and consumers around the world, making it a useful barometer of global economic activity.“Some inventory rebuilding has occurred this year,” Mr Davis said, “but due to the low inventory-to-sales ratios and other indices, it appears that there may still be room for additional restocking.”Analysts have expressed worries that, with stocks approaching their pre-recession levels relative to revenues, the inventory cycle had run out of steam, depriving the global economy of a key support.Over the past decade the US sales-to-inventory ratio – a measure of the amount of stock available to support a given rate of sales – has fallen sharply as corporations have tried to use capital more efficiently by keeping inventories relatively low and relying on rapid parcel delivery.But tight inventories leave little room for error. During the 2009 Christmas period US consumers spent more than expected, forcing retailers to switch from ocean to air freight in an effort to restock and catch up with demand.“On the retail side inventories remain pretty tight. Customers decided not to move everything by ocean early, so there is some potential leverage if this holiday season is better [than expected],” said Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer at UPS.UPS reported another quarter of rising earnings thanks to solid international sales, a better performance at its supply chain business and a rebound in profits at its reorganised US domestic package division.Net income soared 81 per cent year-on-year to $991m, including a one-off gain of $109m from the sale of property, giving earnings per share of $0.99 for the third quarter, higher than analysts’ expectations, up from $0.55.Total revenues climbed more slowly than in previous quarters. Sales rose 9.3 per cent to $12.2bn.Revenues at the domestic package unit, the company’s largest segment, rose 6.2 per cent to $7.3bn while operating profits almost doubled to $1bn. UPS attributed the performance to better volumes, higher prices and more streamlined operations.During the downturn UPS cut thousands of management jobs and reshaped its domestic small package division by consolidating regional and district hubs.UPS said the performance made it comfortable, increasing its full-year earnings forecast for the third time, boosting its outlook from between $3.35 to $3.45 per share to a range of $3.48 to $3.54 per share, up to 53 per cent higher than in 2009. UPS shares nudged down 0.3 per cent to $69.47 at midday in New York. The stock has gained about 21 per cent so far this year.
269;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-10-20T17:45:44Z;Alibaba plans China delivery network;;Alibaba Group, China’s leading e-commerce company, is planning to build a massive logistics network across the country because it is dissatisfied with the quality of local delivery services and wants to stay ahead of rising competition in its fast-growing home market.The group is to set up distribution centres in 52 Chinese cities over the coming two years, Jack Ma, founder and chairman, told management in recent internal strategy meetings, according to sources at the company.The logistics service, details of which have not been revealed, is designed for users of Taobao, an unlisted group affiliate which has a stranglehold on China’s consumer e-commerce market.Its platform for trade between consumers and its retail platform where merchants sell to consumers have a combined market share of 83.8 per cent, according to Alan Hellawell, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.Purchases on Taobao already make up more than 70 per cent of domestic couriers’ daily deliveries, and this has led to delays and patchy quality in distribution and delivery because the local logistics companies do not have the capacity to cope with the fast growth in e-commerce.This trend has led to United Parcel Service, the US package delivery company, moving ahead with plans to establish a domestic service in China.Alibaba, initially just a business-to-business platform, has left rivals, including Ebay, far behind in the consumer e-commerce sector since the launch of its Taobao site in 2003. Taobao has 230m registered consumer users, compared with 90m registered on Ebay.But it is facing new competition. Baidu, China’s leading search engine, launched an online mall website this week together with Rakuten, Japan’s largest online shopping mall operator.A growing number of foreign retailers are setting up their own online shopping sites in China. While Adidas opted for a shopfront on Taobao, Uniqlo, the Japanese clothing retailer, launched its own Chinese online store last year, and its rival Gap is set to follow next month. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is also preparing to launch its own e-commerce site in China.Tencent, China’s largest internet company by registered users, is also working to expand Paipai, its e-commerce arm.While e-commerce revenues in China are still small, they are expected to grow at 42 per cent a year to Rmb1,523bn ($229bn), or 7.2 per cent of total retail sales, by 2014, said Mr Hellawell in a research report.“E-commerce in China is still in a nascent stage, but if Taobao wants to retain the market position it has now, it must up its game,” said a company official who asked not to be named.
270;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-10-17T22:55:59Z;US retailers to ride wave of China web sales;;Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is about to launch a website for its Sam’s Club stores in China, in a sign of the growing interest of global retailers in online sales in the fast-growing market.Gap, the US clothing retailer, will open a Chinese online sales site next month, to complement the opening of its first stores in the country.Japan’s Uniqlo, a rival of Gap, launched an e-commerce business in China last year, while Adidas, the sportswear company, opened an online store in August on Taobao, China’s dominant internet marketplace. Coach, the US handbag retailer, intends to open an online store in China next year.The retailers’ push comes as growth in China’s e-commerce market is expected to take off. Online retail sales increased by 117 per cent last year to $39bn, according to iResearch, a Beijing-based company.“About two-thirds of Chinese have been online for three years or less, and half for less than two – and in the past it has taken about three years for an internet user to become an online shopper,” McKinsey, the consultant, revealed in a recent report on Chinese internet use habits. “Assuming that this conversion continues, tens of millions of new e-commerce consumers could be just around the corner.”This prospect is particularly alluring for companies as Chinese consumers appear to trust retailer and manufacturer websites and are likely to search for product information there. “That is a stark difference from the US, where consumers prefer to consult consumer and third-party reviews, such as Amazon,” the McKinsey survey said.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Walmart’s global e-commerce business, told a meeting with investors last week that the retailer was “excited about the size of the opportunity” for online sales in China.Walmart expects China to overtake both Japan and the UK over the next five years to become the world’s second-largest e-commerce market behind the US, with projected online sales of $230bn, against a forecast $490bn in the US.One in four of China’s 400m internet users buy online, according to the state-run China Internet Network Information Centre.Walmart said it will use its own internet platform for the service, which would support the handful of Sam’s Club stores it currently has in China, rather than its more numerous Walmart and Trustmart locations. But it said the service would include both next-day delivery and information on product availability in store for Sam’s Club’s customers, who are primarily small businesses and local retailers.Gap is working with a local partner, Shanghai Yi Shang, which will handle distribution and fulfilment of orders. Gap is believed to be the first retailer to launch an e-commerce business in parallel with the opening of its first stores.Toby Lenk, head of Gap’s direct sales, said last week that online sales were viewed as “a really exciting opportunity long term”.Taobao, owned by Alibaba, provides internet “store fronts” for retailers and dominates online merchandise sales in China.However, Baidu, the search company, is preparing to launch a rival marketplace with Japan’s Rakuten.Wan Ling Martello, chief operating officer of Walmart’s global e-commerce business, said that both she and Mr Castro Wright had been “completely, absolutely blown away by how much Chinese customers have embraced e-commerce”.Dan Brutto, head of the international business of UPS, the parcel logistics company, said its decision to seek a domestic delivery license in China was driven in part by demand for business-to-consumer shipping.“A lot of customers are asking us, ‘Hey, can you help us in China? I have a plant in China that I now want to use to service the Chinese consumers.’ So we think there is demand,” Mr Brutto said.Additional reporting by ­Jeremy Lemer and Kathrin Hille

Little wonder then that United Parcel Service studied its application for a domestic parcel licence in China for more than a year before deciding to make its move this week.In some respects UPS has been slow off the mark. While it is a significant player in the delivery of packages to and from China – a market dominated by international carriers with their vast global networks – it has no domestic set-up, leaving it lagging behind in a fast-growing segment.Its peers have been providing domestic services within China for several years through joint ventures and acquisitions. For example, FedEx launched an overnight express delivery product within China following its 2007 purchase of local partner DTW.According to Parcel Research, a consultancy, DHL, part of Germany’s Deutsche Post, has more than 9,000 staff in China and about 380 domestic depots, while TNT, the Dutch carrier, has more than 16,000 employees and about 1,500 domestic depots.However, Dan Brutto, president of UPS’s international operations, argues that 2010 represents the perfect moment for a cautious company like UPS to expand beyond the international express business that has long been its focus in China.Chinese demand, once a distant possibility, is taking shape, he says. In 2005, less than 30 per cent of Chinese consumers had an annual disposable income of $3,000 or more but, by 2015, it is expected to be more than 77 per cent, according to some forecasts.IBISWorld, a market research company, estimates the Chinese courier market is worth about $9bn a year, of which 60 per cent is domestic volume, and will double in size by 2015.At the same time, Chinese officials have changed their attitudes to foreign carriers, says Mr Brutto. “China wants to export but they also realise that they need to import. Their people are becoming more affluent and want products from the outside.”A revised postal law introduced in October 2009 cut international companies out of the letter and document delivery segment but also for the first time created an attainable path for UPS to gain a domestic package licence.“China’s domestic delivery industry is in a period of consolidation and there is a good opportunity for foreign companies to expand here,” according to Xu Yong, chief adviser to China Express Consulting.In other markets, powerful incumbents have undone new entrants. In 2003 DHL tried to crack the US market but could never gain the scale to take market share from dominant players, FedEx and UPS. By the time it retreated in 2008 it had lost almost $10bn.But the Chinese market remains more fragmented. Apart from Chinese state-controlled EMS, which still controls about a third of the domestic express market, there are at least 10 other local companies vying for position and hundreds of smaller regional players.Mr Xu estimates that international companies may be able to capture a combined 5-8 per cent of the domestic delivery services market by 2015, up from a fraction of that today. The arrival of UPS, therefore, is likely to shake up the competition.According to Doug Caldwell of Parcel Research, while UPS is often slower to move than its peers, it rarely makes a mistake. “The culture of the company is that they don’t do things on the spur of the moment, they are very well thought out,” he said.Mr Brutto argues UPS’s approach has given it the time to get things right. It established its first joint venture in China in 1988, and bought the international operations of its local partner Sinotrans in 2005, rebranding its trucks in the distinctive UPS brown.With more than 5,500 employees in China, running a delivery fleet of more than 850 vans and trucks at 92 operating facilities, Mr Brutto says the company already covers 80 per cent of the domestic population from its presence in 33 of the largest cities.As a result UPS expects to spend millions of dollars to get its domestic service started once it receives government approval – small sums for a company with $45bn in revenues. To promote its brand it will run more brown trucks within cities but will rely on third parties to haul packages long distance.But while Chinese authorities are required to respond within 45 days of accepting the application, Mr Brutto points out that pinning officials down is tough in China. He plans to meet senior officials in the next few weeks to press his company’s case.“We have a target that puts the footprint down and scales very quickly,” he said. “What we can’t determine right now is how
fast we can get licence approval. We may get one national licence [or we] may get approved province by province.”Mr Brutto is in no hurry. UPS started a domestic service in Germany in 1976 but it was 1996 before the business reached a decent scale. “We don’t want to get ahead of demand. China is a huge opportunity and you have to look at it in generational terms,” he said."
272;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-09-27T21:26:27Z;UPS to tap China’s booming domestic market;;United Parcel Service, one of the largest package delivery companies, is moving ahead with plans to establish a domestic service in China as it seeks to tap into booming consumer and business demand in the country.As early as this week UPS will submit an application for a domestic licence to the State Post Bureau, the local regulator. Once approved, the company will roll out a next-day delivery service and second and third-day delivery products.“The opportunities are tremendous,” Dan Brutto, president of UPS International, told the Financial Times. “If you take a look at the growing middle class, in the future the domestic market is going to be worth billions.”He believes the Chinese market could be as large as 5m packages a day. For comparison, in 2009 UPS delivered about 1.2m packages a day in its international-domestic segment – its term to describe deliveries within foreign countries – worth $2.1bn in revenues.The move underscores the continued attraction of the Chinese market even as leading executives at international companies and US politicians have criticised China for protectionism and currency manipulation.Mr Brutto said UPS had been encouraged to expand in China by its multinational clients who have a presence there but want a safer, more reliable and more familiar way to reach domestic consumers.“In Amazon’s case they are using 500 carriers in China to deliver their packages and they are saying this is insane. So the market is just ripe for consolidation,” he said.As China has opened to foreign competition, international package companies have poured in, using their global reach and technological expertise to break into the fast-growing market.IBISWorld, a market research company, estimates that the Chinese courier market is worth about $9bn a year, of which 60 per cent is domestic volume, and will double in size by 2015.But a combination of business strategy and local regulation encouraged foreign companies to focus on the import-export market, largely ceding the domestic market to a myriad of local companies until the past decade.In the past few years UPS’s rivals have been providing domestic express services through acquisitions and joint ventures. Analysts note that the Chinese market will be one of the few where the biggest players compete head to head across a full suite of services.
273;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-09-22T17:39:53Z;Give US companies certainty on taxes;Republicans and Democrats need to settle their differences on 2011 tax rates;In trying to ignite its economic recovery, the US should look to its companies since they have record levels of cash. For example, UPS has increased its cash from $2bn to $4bn over the last six months. By contrast, the American consumer is largely tapped out, with substantial debts held by most and unemployment faced by many.But leaders of American companies are reluctant to invest their cash in light of the high level of political and financial uncertainty. In particular, they are concerned about the uncertainties surrounding taxes due to the fierce battle between Democrats and Republicans on this subject. They do not know the tax rates for 2011 on ordinary income, capital gains, dividend income or large estates.Following is a compromise that should be acceptable to both parties, though neither will praise it.1) Keep the Bush tax cuts for all individuals through to the end of 2011, and then raise only the top tax rate on ordinary income from 35 per cent to 39.6 per cent.2) Set the tax rate permanently at 20 per cent for all capital gains and corporate dividends.3) Exempt the first $4m per person from estate taxes, with a rate of 30 per cent on the next $10m and 45 per cent above that level.The US cannot afford to make permanent the Bush tax cuts on ordinary income for all individuals because that translates into $1,700bn in lost revenues over the next decade. Of that amount, close to $700bn would be revenues lost by the Bush tax cuts for ordinary income over $250,000 per year.As we saw during the 1990s, the US economy can grow quite nicely if the top tax rate on ordinary income is 39.6 per cent rather than 35 per cent. However, even some Democrats recognise that the economy is too fragile at this time to be raising taxes on anyone.To reconcile these long-term and short-term considerations, Congress should extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone until the end of 2011. At that time, the tax rate on ordinary income above $250,000 per year would be automatically increased to 39.6 per cent.Even if Congress allows the Bush tax cuts to expire, the tax rate on capital gains would rise from 15 per cent to only 20 per cent. Although investors would prefer a 15 per cent rate, they can tolerate a 20 per cent rate on capital gains.By contrast, if Congress allows the Bush tax cuts to expire, the tax rate on dividends would jump from 15 per cent to as high as 39.6 per cent. This is not acceptable to investors. Moreover, it creates a perverse incentive for successful companies to stop paying dividends to investors and instead buy back company stock. Although raising dividends typically gives a boost to a company’s stock price, the impact of stock buybacks has been uneven.The best compromise seems to be a permanent tax rate of 20 per cent on both capital gains and dividends. That would be considerably lower than the rate on ordinary income, and would not create any artificial incentives to choose capital gains over corporate dividends.Despite much acrimonious debate, I believe there is a strong consensus in Congress to continue the estate tax, but with exemptions large enough to avoid taxing the estates of almost all farmers and small family-owned businesses.This objective would not be achieved if Congress does nothing before 2011. In that event, the estate tax would revert to its pre-Bush status with an exemption of only $1m per person and a tax rate of 55 per cent.Although some Republicans would like to eliminate the estate tax, they would be even more upset if we went back to the pre-Bush status on either the exemption amount or the rate. In 2009, most Democrats seemed comfortable with an exemption amount of $3.5m per person and a top tax rate of 45 per cent. This structure for the estate tax would achieve the objective stated above.Both Republicans and Democrats should recognise that it is especially absurd to have no certainty on the estate tax since this, by its nature, requires advance planning. As a political compromise, Congress should enact a permanent solution to the estate tax issue with an exemption of $4m per person (indexed to inflation), a tax rate of 30 per cent on the first $10m above the exemption amount, and a tax rate of 45 per cent beyond that level.In short, while taxes tend to provoke heated ideological arguments, both parties have a strong interest in promoting a stronger economic recovery in the US. Congress can help support this goal by providing certainty on taxes for at least the next few years.The writer is senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and author of Too Big to Save?

274;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-08-22T21:08:35Z;The real market for fake brands;;The 2007 film Superbad showed some heavy underage drinking. But its makers were faced with a problem. “Obviously, no booze company in the world wants their products to be associated with that,” says Burbank-based graphic designer Ted Haigh. “So I had to come up with 500 labels for bottles that gave a sense of the real thing.Much of Mr Haigh’s work involves inventing fictitious brands for films and television. These might be anything from snack products that get a few seconds in the background to full-blown corporations that characters work for.These ersatz brands are surprisingly ubiquitous. For example, The Terminator film franchise gave us Cyberdyne Systems, while the television show Lost features Oceanic Airlines. Meanwhile, the cartoon show The Simpsons has an entire invented brandscape – ranging from the Kwik-E-Mart to Duff Beer to the Canyonero car.“If you can use something real, it’s great,” says Mr Haigh, “but that’s not always possible.”Indeed, although product placement is rife, there are any number of reasons why producers might want to use a fictional brand. For example, if you need to use a delivery truck for a heist, UPS is unlikely to want its logo on the side. Similarly, many companies do not take kindly to their products being lampooned.In many countries, there are strict rules covering product placement. The BBC, for example, is not allowed to give brands undue prominence, so the writers and script editors come up with names that are then checked to find out if they really exist. As the corporation says: “If you need an estate agent, you make it up.”In commercial television, producers may want to invent brands so that the products used in the show do not clash with the adverts. If the broadcaster is running commercials for Pepsi during the breaks, it might look odd if everyone is drinking Coca-Cola on the programme.Fictitious brands might also be needed if the programme or film is set in the past or future and requires period brands.Sometimes, however, it is simply more fun to make up a brand.Mike Judge’s 2006 satire Idiocracy features a sports performance drink that is used for everything from irrigating crops to nursing infants. It is called Brawndo, The Thirst Mutilator. The Simpsons has done similar things with the Krusty the Clown franchise, which is a sort of borderline credible parody of a children’s TV brand.When ideas for brands go through a vetting process to ensure that they do not exist in the real world, some products and services can be much harder than others. Mr Haigh says that telecommunications companies are especially difficult because virtually every permutation of “com” and “tel” has already been taken.With that cinematic mainstay, the large evil corporation, you may just want something that sounds generic – as many real corporations do. Usually, he says, you come up with several names and hope one will pass legal and creative muster. Then you design the graphics around them.“What makes these virtual brands work is that people believe them in the context they see them,” says Max Raison, director of brand strategy at Interbrand, the brand consultancy. In some ways, he adds, the effect you are aiming for is the opposite of the kind of glaring product placement in films such as Casino Royale. If you get it absolutely right, adds Mr Haigh, people may even remember it as a brand they have seen elsewhere.But while some people may believe fake brands are real, one man is doing his best to make fake brands really real. Pete Hottelet is the chief executive of Omni Consumer Products (the name comes from the fictional company in the film Robocop). In 2007, he launched Brawndo, The Thirst Mutilator, which had previously only existed on screen. “I contacted Fox, found the right person and put a proposal together,” he says. “Then I had to figure out how to make a beverage and have it canned and meet legal requirements – it took about a year.”He attributes its success to the fact that “you have a brand that comes with a ready-made market”. Since Brawndo, he has gone on to breath life into Tru Blood (a drink from the vampire series, True Blood, pictured above) and Sex Panther Cologne (from the film Anchorman). The company is shortly to launch Stay Puft Marshmallows, which first appeared in Ghostbusters in 1984.Mr Hottelet used to work in advertising but, he says “this is now what I spend 90 per cent of my time doing. We watch movies and TV shows and if we see a product we like, we make enquiries.” The result is a strange and decidedly 21st-century phenomenon: “We call it defictionalisation – it’s like product placement in reverse.”
275;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Stocks struggle to move past highs;Rally faltering as yen nears 15-year peak against dollar;Tuesday 19.30 BST. After a sizzling run for risky assets on Monday, investors are flocking to “haven” bonds and the yen, while stocks and commodities struggle to overcome lingering doubts about the global economic recovery.The yen is at a new high for the year against the US dollar, below Y86, and nearing a 15-year peak. Yields on short-term US Treasury bonds have reached a fresh record low.In equities, the US S&P 500 index is down 0.5 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended flat. The FTSE All-World stock index is up 0.1 per cent, thanks to Asia extending Monday’s rally following faster-than-expected manufacturing activity growth in the US and Europe.But a fresh tone for the markets was set after Yoshihiko Noda, Japan’s finance minister, said late in the Asian day that “foreign exchange rates are something that should basically be set by the market”.With that assurance in their pocket, traders swooped in to strengthen their vote against the US dollar in favour of the yen. Forex dealers had previously been worried that Japan could intervene in the market and sell yen to support its critical export sector, which had limited the currency’s gains.That move was followed by a report in The Wall Street Journal that the US Federal Reserve may be considering using income from mortgage-backed securities to buy Treasuries, in effect putting more cash into the economy.“It would be a symbolic step towards more easing rather than towards ‘normalisation’ in the Fed’s balance sheet and monetary policy, and possibly a step to precede additional quantitative easing measures,” said Robert Lynch, currency strategist at HSBC.That only confirmed traders’ growing sense that some kind of easing is on the cards for US policy, following dovish comments from Ben Bernanke, US Federal Reserve chairman, and other Fed officials in the past few weeks. Fed Fund futures are pricing in a higher chance of a rate lowering by this time next year, leading the dollar to tumble against the euro, pound and yen.While a strong earnings season has helped traders recover much of risky assets’ fall from their high water mark in April, concerns over global economic growth continue to gnaw at sentiment, leaving shares unable to push past three-month highs.Australia left interest rates on hold, with policymakers noting that easing in the global economy’s growth rate was helping to moderate inflation in the commodity-exporting country. That sent the Aussie dollar lower after its recent run-up to four-month highs.A batch of US data added further uncertainty to the economic narrative: factory orders fell more than forecast, suggesting that the inventory rebuild cycle that has driven the economy has slowed. And personal consumption– the potential next catalyst, and the one cited by Mr Bernanke – failed to show expected growth in June.☼ Factors to watch. US non-farm payroll data, to be released on Friday, are likely to set the tone for the rest of the week’s trading. The figures are expected to show 30,000 jobs lost, due to more census-hiring declines, but 110,000 private jobs created, exceeding last month’s 80,000. However, the same factors that have led to volatile and unreliable claims data – summer factory shut-downs and government benefit changes – are adding uncertainty to economists’ forecasts. ☼• Europe. Ignoring the bullish sign of Banco Santander’s ambitious expansion plans, the European banking sector fell. The UK’s FTSE 100 index was flat, as HSBC reversed its sharp gains from Monday after its stellar earnings results.Germany’s Dax was up 0.3 per cent. Deutsche Post and BMW, both beating earnings expectations and raising forecasts, as competitors like UPS and Honda have done, were in the top 3 gainers.Athens – the world’s best-performing market in July – added 1.3 per cent. Talk of potential suitors for troubled state-controlled ATEbank, the only Greek lender to fail the recent EU stress tests, pushed up local bank stocks.• Asia. Gains were solid, but did not keep pace with Monday’s sharp rises in the US and Europe. Japan’s Nikkei 225 led the way, up 1.3 per cent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was up 0.5 per cent, although shares came off their highs after Peter Wong, HSBC’s Asia-Pacific chief, warned that Hong Kong property values “may form a bubble” if monetary conditions remained loose.Shanghai shares were down by 1.7 per cent, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index was up 0.7 per cent and Korea’s Kospi 200 index was up 0.5 per cent.• Currencies. The yen jumped shortly after the European open. It is now up 0.8 per cent against the US dollar, at Y85.85. The Japanese unit’s post-crisis low – also a 15-year nadir – is Y84.83.Though this is partially a dollar move, it seems there is also a general decline in risk appetite, as evidenced by the move to close out carry trades by buying and returning yen. The yen is up 0.5 per cent against the South African rand and 0.4 per cent versus the New Zealand dollar.The Australian dollar is down 0.1 per cent against the US dollar following the Reserve Bank of Australia’s rate pause. The pound is adding to its surge from Monday, up 0.4 per cent to $1.5947 against the greenback. The euro is at a fresh three month peak, up 0.4 per cent to $1.3232.• Bonds. “Haven” bonds are in strong demand, with the yield on the Japanese 10-year falling 1 basis point to 1.02 per cent, its lowest since the crisis struck. Demand was strong at an auction earlier in the session. German Bunds are also down by 9 basis points to yield 2.60 per cent.The WSJ report on the Fed’s potential move has sent US bond yields lower. Two-year US Treasury yields are down 2 basis points to 0.53 per cent, a new all-time low. Ten-year US Treasuries are down 5 basis points to 2.91 per cent.“Peripheral” eurozone debt is also in demand. Greek 2-years are down 9 basis points, with smaller gains for benchmark Spanish and Portuguese government bonds. European banks, however, signalled that they were still risk averse, oversubscribing to the European Central Bank’s latest call for cash deposits to offset its latest purchase of peripheral debts, which supported prices.• Commodities. Oil is up again after surging more than 3 per cent on Monday, extending further past $81 a barrel. It is up 1.3 per cent to $82.42, its highest since May.Crude is being supported by a warning from the US that a tropical depression could reach the Gulf of Mexico this week, disrupting production. Overall fundamentals for oil are still shaky, with the most recent reports expecting oversupply in the US and Opec markets, although some strategists suggest that crude may go as high as $83.Gold is up 0.3 per cent to $1,186. The yellow metal has declined in recent weeks, shrugging off the dollar’s decline, as investors flock to the euro and pound.Follow the Global Market Overview on Twitter at @telisdemos(Jamie Chisholm is on holiday)
276;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
277;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-08-03T13:23:04Z;Deutsche Post sees sharp rise in freight volumes;;Deutsche Post DHL capitalised on a recovering global economy in recent months, announcing second-quarter profits that were double those of last year and raising its estimate for its underlying full-year earnings.The German mail and logistics company followed rivals such as UPS in showing it was reaping the benefits of an upswing in world trade. As an important piece of the global supply chain, companies such as DHL, United Parcel Service and FedEx are considered barometers of global economic performance. UPS and FedEx raised earnings guidance last month.Deutsche Post said it now expected underlying earnings to be between €1.9bn and €2.1bn, having previously given a range of €1.6bn to €1.9bn. Frank Appel, chief executive, said: “We benefited significantly from the recovery of the world economy in the second quarter.” A moderate recovery in global transport volumes was expected over 2010 as a whole, Deutsche Post added.Second-quarter earnings before interest and tax rose from €109m ($144.2m) last year to €253m, including €250m of expenses, mainly related to the sale of DHL’s Express business in France. Quarterly net income – affected by a €145m swing in the market value of options related to the group’s plan to sell its remaining stake in Deutsche Postbank – rose from €66m to €81m.Revenues rose more than 15 per cent to €12.8bn compared with the second quarter of 2009.Mr Appel said the group, which employs 500,000 people, was benefiting from an efficiency drive and the extensive efforts to reshape its businesses over the past two years, which have included the costly closure of its lossmaking US express business.Deutsche Post’s revenue growth came from its DHL businesses – which also include freight, forwarding and supply chain services – and was in contrast to the flat sales in its domestic mail business.However, underlying earnings rose 42 per cent to €243m in the mail business, with Deutsche Post earning more from parcel deliveries.For the first time this year the DHL businesses are expected to contribute more to the group’s earnings than the mail business, which the group is also trying to invigorate with new services such as electronic letters.Axel Funhoff, analyst at ING, said the quarterly earnings were “substantially above expectations with respect to most line items”.Deutsche Post shares rose €14.08 in early afternoon trading in Frankfurt, a gain of 4.3 per cent.
278;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-07-26T22:20:00Z;Wall Street rally continues as all sectors post gains;;US stocks were lifted on Monday by better housing data than expected and a forecast earnings rise by FedEx, the delivery company seen as a barometer for global trade.The S&P 500 closed up 1.1 per cent at 1,115.00, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1 per cent to close at 10,525.43 and the Nasdaq was 1.2 per cent higher to close at 2,296.43.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 were up, continuing Friday’s rally.Data for June showed the number of new homes bought were up 24 per cent on May to an annualised figure of 330,000. Analysts had forecast a total of 320,000 units. Home sales had been falling since a tax credit expired this year.The S&P 500 homebuilders index rose 3.7 per cent, with DR Horton up 3 per cent to $11.17, PulteGroup higher by 4.7 per cent to $9.07 and Lennar rising 3.3 per cent to $15.42.AIG, the bailed-out insurer which has units that initiate, insure and invest in home loans, advanced 6.9 per cent to $39.30.FedEx boosted investor confidence by raising its profit forecast. It pushed up its earnings per share guidance for this quarter to a range of $1.05–$1.25 from $0.85–$1.05. The news came after UPS reported better second-quarter earnings than expected last week. FedEx shares rose 5.6 per cent to $83.39.Ralph Fogel, investment strategist at Fogel Neale Partners, said “It’s interesting to note that with recent moves in the market, both up and down, it is transportation that has led the move.”US-listed shares in BP rose 4.9 per cent to $38.65 after it was reported that the oil company was set to announce the departure of Tony Hayward, chief executive, in the next 24 hours.

The index made its largest leap for two weeks, with industrials, financials and consumer discretionary stocks leading the charge.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, continued his testimony to Congress. But his comments largely reflected topics covered on Wednesday and did not weigh on sentiment. Investors also downplayed data that showed US jobless claims rose more steeply than expected last week. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were up 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 464,000.There was some relief as existing house sales fell less than expected by a seasonally-adjusted 5.1 per cent in June. The S&P 500 housebuilders rose 3.4 per cent.Michael Yoshikiami, chief investment strategist at YCMNET, said: “When you see home sales numbers and jobless claims numbers that go beyond this earnings season, we can see that the next earnings season is going to be the one that’s very difficult.” He added that although companies were raising earnings projections, it was because their original forecasts were “unreasonably negative”.Among stocks in the news, AmeriCredit surged 21.4 per cent to $23.91 after General Motorsannounced it was buying the auto finance lender for $24.50 a share. The $3.5bn cash deal aims to make car-buying easier for subprime shoppers.Dell was flat in after hours trading after the SEC charged the computer maker with failing to disclose material information to investors and accounting fraud.

280;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-07-23T00:21:14Z;US needs to deliver certainty, says UPS;;A lack of clarity about energy and healthcare policy is restraining the pace of economic recovery among small businesses in the US, according to UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company.“There is no doubt that policy uncertainty is an issue out there,” Scott Davis, chairman and chief executive of UPS, said on Thursday.“We need to resolve that to get this recovery going full steam.”In recent weeks a host of US executives have complained that they are facing costly and imprecise new rules – including healthcare legislation, financial reform and rule making on carbon emissions – that are discouraging investment. Logistics companies such as UPS, are viewed as a barometer of the economy because they ship millions of packages every day, putting them in close touch with thousands of businesses around the world.“Clearly policy uncertainty is one of the worst things for a recovery,” Mr Davis said.“The sooner we get some of these issues resolved …the sooner the small businesses will get spending money again and hire employees.”Mr Davis’s comments carry weight in key political circles. This month he was appointed to serve on a new Export Council advising President Barack Obama on ways to promote growth and jobs and reach his target of doubling exports within five years.“It’s a stretch goal,” Mr Davis said.“We are going to have to get more accommodative trade policies. It starts with free trade agreements with Korea, Colombia, and Panama and that’s certainly part of what we’re trying to work on.”Mr Davis added that UPS has developed several initiatives to help small businesses compete. “We’ve identified 7,000 or 8,000 customers right now that export to just one country, and we’re going to try to get them to go to at least two.”Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer at UPS, said the company was “working like crazy to lower barriers to doing trade globally …If we make it easy and the government facilitates us …there are a lot of latent capabilities in US small business.”The comments came as UPS reported second-quarter results that beat estimates due to a sharp increase in international revenues, particularly from Asia. The company also raised its earnings guidance for the second time this year.Net profit soared 90 per cent to $845m compared with the previous year, which was hit by a $48m after-tax charge related to foreign currency accounting, and earnings per share jumped 91 per cent to $0.44.Revenues rose 13 per cent to $12.2bn and operating margins rose 320 basis points to 11.5 per cent as the company kept a tight reign on costs and benefited from higher prices.UPS also boosted its full-year guidance for adjusted earnings to a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per diluted share, up from earlier forecasts of $3.05 to $3.30 per share, implying a 45 per cent to 50 per cent increase over 2009 results.Still, Mr Davis was cautious about the outlook. “We don’t expect robust economic recovery …But we think even in this modest environment, we can prosper and continue to raise profits substantially.”UPS shares rose 6.2 per cent in midday trading to $63.75 and are now up about 12 per cent over the year to date.
281;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-07-22T21:32:25Z;Banks volatile ahead of stress test verdict;Pound boosted by strong UK GDP data;Equities, commodities and the euro enjoyed a strong session on Thursday as investors cast aside their doubts about the global recovery and instead embraced a batch of robust earnings and economic releases.Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, unnerved the markets on Wednesday when he spoke of an “unusually uncertain” outlook for the US economy, and said the central bank was prepared to take further policy actions.But analysts said the Fed chief had said little that was actually new. Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank said: “In reality the sell-off after Mr Bernanke’s comments could be seen as a reversal of the expectations that some form of policy easing would be announced.”Investors quickly put aside any disappointment as strong economic data in Europe and encouraging corporate earnings in the US rekindled confidence in the global outlook.The imminent publication of the results of stress tests on European banks also seemed to hold few fears for the markets, though there was deep scepticism among some in the markets as to how useful they would actually be.Marc Ostwald at Monument Securities said: “Why should these stress tests be viewed as some form of cathartic panacea from which markets can take reassurance about the health of the European banking sector, and identify the so-called villains?“If history teaches us one thing, it is that these tests will not test for whatever is actually the next stress event, and will not account – or at least not sufficiently – for the lateral or nuclear fallout events associated with whatever engenders the stress.”However, there were more concrete signs that the non-financial corporate sector was weathering the crisis. Caterpillar, 3M and, crucially, United Parcel Service – often seen as a bellwether for the US economy – all unveiled forecast-beating quarterly results and improved outlooks. Positive data releases on both sides of the Atlantic also helped investors put aside worries that the global recovery was faltering.The day’s key release showed that the eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index rose from 56.0 to 56.7 in July, compared with an expected drop to 55.2 – indicating increased activity in both the manufacturing and service sectors in the region.That offered a marked contrast to recent declines in the US manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs and suggested the eurozone might be evading the risk of a double-dip recession, analysts said.UK retail sales also offered a positive surprise as they rose 0.7 per cent last month, more than expected, although economists said this was due in no small part to the “World Cup effect”.The encouraging economic newsflow continued across the Atlantic, where US existing home sales and the Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators both fell by less than expected last month.The burst of optimism among investors drove equity prices higher.In New York, the S&P 500 rose 2.3 per cent while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 gained 2.1 per cent.In Asia, Shanghai rose for a fourth straight day, buoyed by hopes of easier monetary policy in the second half, although the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 0.6 per cent.The Vix equity volatility index fell 3.6 per cent to 24.72.Commodities rallied across the board. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index struck a one-month high as US oil jumped $2 a barrel and copper struck a two-month peak above $7,000 a tonne.In the currency markets, the euro rose back above $1.29 and the commodity-focused Australian and New Zealand dollars also gained ground.A drop in dollar interbank rates added to pressure on the US currency. Three-month dollar Libor fell below 0.5 per cent for the first time since May.In government bonds the two-year US Treasury yield was steady at its record low of 0.56 per cent, while the 10-year yield rose 3bp to 2.93 per cent.The 10-year German Bund yield rose 5bp to 2.67 per cent.
282;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;European hopes trump US uncertainty;Solid economic data spark rally in euro and equities;Thursday 20:00 BST. A solid bunch of European economic data and US company earnings has overshadowed Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s cautious tone about the pace of the economic recovery.The FTSE All-World equity index has reversed an early decline and is now up 1.9 per cent, commodities are higher and US Treasury yields are moving up. The S&P 500 index in New York has closed up 2.3 per cent, its best performance in two weeks.Uncertainty is a market’s kryptonite. So, when Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, said late on Wednesday that the outlook for the US economy was “unusually uncertain”, it swiftly weakened traders’ resolve, and US and Asian markets fled from risk.Mr Bernanke during his second day of testimony has helped to counter that soundbite. He acknowledged that recent economic data did not “radically change our basic outlook” of a moderate recovery, and stressed what the Fed could do – rather than on Wednesday, when he talked about what it could not do – if the economy were to falter.On some days, merely mentioning that possibility would be enough to send markets into a tailspin. But traders took it all in their stride as European economic news was surprisingly strong. UK retail sales, and eurozone services, manufacturing and industrial orders data all beat forecasts, reducing fears about economic fragility.Notably, US traders were not cowed by a rise in initial jobless claims, which were dismissed as mere summer volatility from seasonal plant shut-downs. New claims were still below the fear level of 500,000. US markets were also unconcerned by less-than-forecast dips in existing home sales and the leading economic indicators.The bulls are also getting excited about relief from another uncertainty: the European bank stress tests. The stage has been set for a positive result to the stress tests. Various media reports suggest that Greek and Spanish banks will do quite well, though all is still in the realm of rumour. Their ultimate impact on sentiment may also be blunted by fears that the conditions used were not terribly stressful.A batch of upbeat company reports was icing on the cake. Caterpillar said its order book for industrial equipment was still strong, and raised its forecasts for later this year. To some degree, markets already knew about the industrial recovery. More interesting was Blackstone’s report that improving property values powered its return to profit.UPS, AT&T and 3M also beat expectations, and Credit Suisse, like Morgan Stanley on Wednesday, posted decent enough results, as profits rose 1 per cent over last year. The FTSE Global Bank index is up 2.7 per cent.After the closing bell, results from Amazon, American Express, and Microsoft were the focus of attention and Amazon missed estimates sparking a plunge of 14 per cent in the internet retailer’s stock price in after-hours trading. Amex and Microsoft beat estimates, and their stocks have rallied in after-hours activity.Also making news is Dell, as the computer maker has agreed to pay $100m, while Michael Dell, the chief executive officer will pay $4m to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims that the company used fraudulent accounting to meet earnings targets. The stock is up 2.5 per cent in after-hours trade.● Asia. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index closed up 0.1 per cent as the region reacted relatively calmly to Wall Street’s drop. Most of the damage was done by Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 fell 0.6 per cent as the rising yen again battered exporters.Hong Kong added 0.5 per cent and the increasingly maverick Shanghai market climbed 1.1 per cent. This is the fourth day in a row that the mainland benchmark has gained ground and has left investors hoping that the previously under-performing exchange may have put in a floor.● Europe. Bourses opened lower by about 0.6 per cent in reaction to Wall Street’s late slide, but the upbeat economic data and hopes for an early release of the bank stress tests soon encouraged buyers. The FTSE 100 in London was up 1.9 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was higher by 2.1 per cent as banks and miners gain ground.Energy producers were also among the top performers, following an announcement that the world’s biggest oil companies, except BP, had agreed a $1bn fund for spill clean-ups.● Forex. The dollar has resumed its usual position as the loser in a risky asset rally, and is today down 0.9 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. It is also off 1.1 per cent versus the euro at $1.2897, as the single currency continues its bull run amid European economic improvement and, of late, anticipated relief following the stress tests.The yen was again the beneficiary of broader market malaise early on as the Japanese unit continues to be the reluctant haven of choice. But the improvement in sentiment has seen the yen pull back. It is down 0.9 per cent against the surging euro at Y112.03, though it is mostly flat against the dollar, still hovering near 20-month highs near Y86.● Debt. Bonds are not seeing nearly as strong a reaction as equities. The two-year note yield is sitting unchanged at its record low of 0.56 per cent, while the 10-year yield is up 4 basis points at 2.93 per cent, near its 2010 lows. Mr Bernanke’s soothing offer of potential government support may ease economic fears, but it also fuels many bond bulls who see looser monetary conditions ahead.Europe’s periphery received a boost after investors purchased the entirety of a Hungarian auction of 12-month bills. Though the yield was 5.75 per cent, 32bp higher than the previous sale of such bills, to sell the whole run was a relative success. Investors balked at two auctions last week, following the International Monetary Fund’s concerns that Hungary’s austerity measures were insufficient.Greek bonds were higher, with the 10-year falling 9 basis points to yield 10.55 per cent, though Portuguese and Spanish debt yields ticked upwards. The stress test rumours were most specific about the six Greek banks, which were said to have mostly passed, even with tougher conditions.● Commodities. A greater aversion to risk and pared growth expectations initially led to selling in the metals complex. However, most metals are now higher. Copper was up 2.2 per cent at $6,995 a tonne, its highest mark in two months.Oil has also turned things round and in the US has closed up 3.6 per cent at $79.30 a barrel. Gold is moving away from two-month lows below $1,180 and is currently up 0.9 per cent at $1,195.35 an ounce in New York.
283;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-06-30T21:39:20Z;Bids spark power struggle for Chloride;;The battle for Chloride, a hitherto unremarkable UK electronics company, has pitted two heavyweight US chief executives against each other.On one side, David Farr, chairman and chief executive of US manufacturing group Emerson, only its third head in 55 years.On the other, Joe Hogan, a former General Electric executive who now runs Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB.This week, Mr Farr put in what many analysts see as a knockout blow. Emerson offered 375p a share for Chloride, valuing its equity at just under £1bn and eclipsing ABB’s 325p agreed offer.ABB has until Friday to decide whether to increase its bid.What interests both bidders is the rapidly growing market for Chloride’s uninterruptible power supply products. As the world moves its day-to-day business online, the reliability of a power source becomes more critical.Chloride protects power supplies for telecoms companies, government departments, banks and events such as the Beijing Olympics. The company generated sales of £336m in the year to March 31, with pre-tax profits of £29.9m. It has net debt of £41m.Mr Farr has been after Chloride for more than two years. He’s keen to add the company to Emerson’s own UPS business and widen its geographic spread. Emerson is strong in the Americas, while Chloride has a presence in Europe and emerging markets such as India.Frost & Sullivan, the industry analysts, said the combined Emerson-Chloride operation would move into second place in the global UPS market, ahead of Eaton Electrical and behind France’s Schneider. Emerson also estimates that it can achieve £33m of cost savings out of the move.Buying Chloride would also be a defensive move for Mr Farr. “Emerson is eager to keep a new potential entrant out of the market,” said Jason Feldman, an analyst for UBS in New York. ABB, with a market capitalisation of $40bn (£26.8bn) and net income of $3bn would have more firepower to push into the UPS market than Chloride could muster on its own.Emerson’s two initial proposals in 2008 – first of 255p and then 270p– were both rebuffed by Chloride. Mr Farr later described the protracted bidding process in 2008 as “out of control”.He returned in April this year with an unsolicited indicative offer of 275p. Again, the Chloride board rejected the offer.Mr Hogan and ABB stepped into the fray in June. ABB is not a leading force in the secure power market but has been looking to bring together the manufacture of power equipment, where is it strong, with systems that ensure security of power supply, where it is not.It would also help the company, whose customers are largely in the oil, gas and chemical sectors, to move into new industries such as financial services, data centres and public infrastructure. The pursuit of growth has already led ABB into the recent $1bn acquisition of US software group Ventyx. It has earmarked its $5bn cash pile for further acquisitions.The question now facing Mr Hogan is how much of that cash he can plough into Chloride before his shareholders start to quibble about the valuation.Emerson’s 375p offer values Chloride at about 18 times this year’s expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, in line with the highest historical acquisition multiples for the sector. Mr Hogan would have to beat that, but cannot count on the same level of cost savings as Emerson.That would limit the extent to which ABB could beat Emerson’s bid. Analysts believe that it could not stretch much further than 385p a share.“Shareholders on both sides are going to be questioning if it is too rich,” said Scott Cagehin, an analyst at Numis Securities.
284;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Emerson / Chloride;The fight is more a civilised duel than all-out bidding war;"The fight for Chloride is more of a civilised duel than an all-out bidding war but shareholders of the British maker of uninterruptible power supply systems are loving it. The latest bid by Emerson Electric of the US of 375p per share – 83 per cent higher than Chloride’s pre-offer share price – trumps ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, and values the company at a tick under £1bn.Emerson has always been the more logical bidder for Chloride. If the deal goes through, Emerson will diversify into Europe and India. Gluing Chloride to its existing UPS business is expected to return about £33m of synergies. Taxed and capitalised, these could be worth about £275m – which makes the bid of 18 times this year’s expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation slightly easier to bear. At best, ABB, with an unrelated business, can only hope to find about half the synergies.The only question is whether ABB comes back with a counter-offer. The traders who sent Chloride’s share price up to 390p appear hopeful. ABB has about $6bn sitting doing nothing; money it would love to put to work. But at Chloride’s lofty valuation, further pursuit is folly.After a previous attempt in 2008, David Farr, Emerson’s chief executive, will be kicking himself for not trying to seal the deal again 12 months ago when Chloride’s share price wallowed at 145p. Now, at least, 375p should be a knockout blow. Sure, if Chloride pulls out of its existing agreement with ABB it will be hit with an £8.5m break fee but that is small fry. The deal is about nothing but price and Chloride’s board appears indifferent as to the company’s final destination. So too, it seems, do Britons. Their distaste for selling companies to foreigners appears limited to those that make chocolate.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyEmerson Electric returned on Tuesday with an offer of 375p a share for Chloride in a move it hopes will break up an agreed bid for the UK group from ABB, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group.Emerson’s firm cash offer values Chloride at £997m, a considerable step up from an indicated 275p a share offer made in April which was rejected by Chloride as undervaluing the company. The US group’s new offer also excludes the forthcoming 3.3p dividend due to be paid by Chloride to shareholders at the start of August."

286;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-06-08T12:51:52Z;ABB / Chloride;Equipment maker’s shareholders will welcome a bidding war;Almost every office has one in the basement. So do most schools, hospitals and factories. To safeguard operations, an uninterruptible power supply is a must. That is the reason why a battle has erupted over Chloride, the British provider of UPS equipment. Tuesday’s offer of £864m by ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, was almost two-fifths higher than that of Emerson Electric of the US. And to the ire of the latter, ABB’s bid came blessed by Chloride’s board.At first, ABB’s offer of more than 15 times next year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation seems high. Chloride, though, is growing fast having almost quadrupled operating profits since 2005. And ABB is under pressure to deploy its cash. At the end of 2009 it had net $7bn stuffed under the mattress. Five months later, it has splashed out $1bn on half the minority investors in its Indian subsidiary, and a further $1bn on Ventyx, a US electricity software group, all before the Chloride approach.But while ABB has a stuffed piggy bank, Emerson is perhaps the more logical suitor. Already a player in the UPS sector, Chloride would help it push into Europe and it should be able to extract greater synergies. But as UBS points out, some companies that have bought into the UPS market have still managed to extract synergies equal to 5 per cent of sales. If ABB could find this amount, then taxed and capitalised they could be worth £150m.The joust between ABB and Emerson is not over. There is noise that Emerson was going to raise its offer for Chloride anyway. The latter’s shareholders will salivate at the prospect. Since 22 April, when Emerson first made its bid, Chloride’s share price has jumped two-thirds. Board support for ABB means any counter-offer will require a meaty additional premium. Oh what a lovely bidding war.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyABB on Tuesday threatened a bidding war for Chloride after it made an agreed £864m ($1.3bn) bid for the UK maker of uninterruptible power supplies, trumping an approach from Emerson Electric of the US.The Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group dipped into its $5bn cash pile for the second time in several weeks to make a 325p a share cash offer, firmly outbidding a 275p approach from Emerson in April.
287;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-06-03T20:32:04Z;Wall St rally wanes after tepid retail sales;;"US stocks continued the previous day’s rally on Thursday, helped by some positive macroeconomic news, but lacklustre retail sales figures weighed on sentiment.Initial jobless claims were 453,000 last week, compared with the 455,000 consensus estimate, boosting hopes that Friday’s much-awaited non-farm payrolls would at least match expectations.However, ADP private sector payrolls increased by 55,000 last month, less than the 60,000 expected.The rally has been boosted by the recent entry of bargain-hunters into the market, said John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities. “Never failing to look a gift horse in the mouth, however, we are quick to acknowledge that structural problems in the economic, political and ecosystems abound and remain threatening overhangs to the longevity of any near-term rally,” he added.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,102.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 10,255.28 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,303.03.The retail sales results were mixed with discounters broadly faring best, even if they fell below some analyst expectations.TJX Companies, owner of the TJ Maxx discount retail chain, added 0.4 per cent to $46.30 as it posted a better-than-expected increase in same-store sales last month and said it saw demand pick up substantially in the second half of the month as the weather turned warmer.Family Dollar Stores lost 3.6 per cent to $38.66 as the discount retailer gave a third-quarter profit outlook that missed analysts’ consensus estimates.BJ’s Wholesale Club, a warehouse discounter, fell 2.6 per cent to $38.76 in spite of an increase in same-store sales that topped analysts’ average expectations for a 6.6 per cent
gain.Costco Wholesale, BJ’s main rival, declined 1.7 per cent to $57.93 after the company reported sales data for May that missed average analyst estimates.Sales in stores open at least a year rose 9 per cent compared with expectations of 9.7 per cent.Abercrombie & Fitch, an upmarket teen fashion retailer, advanced 6.6 per cent to $37.58 after its May sales beat analyst estimates.It also said its average unit retail price declined by 6 per cent last month compared with a drop of 10 per cent last quarter.Rival Aeropostale gained 5.7 per cent to $30.01 as its sales last month topped expectations.Limited Brands, a clothing retail chain, gained 1.2 per cent to $26.26 as it said same-store sales had risen 5 per cent in May, easily beating the 2.1 per cent gain analysts had forecast. The company said it expected June same-store sales to be flat or slightly higher, in the low single-digits.Department store chains Macy’s and Saks reported better-than-expected same-store May sales. Their shares were up 0.4 per cent to $22.49 and 0.7 per cent to $9.14, respectively.However, rivals Nordstrom and JC Penney missed average expectations, sending their shares down 4.3 per cent to $38.52 and 0.3 per cent to $27.07, respectively.JPMorgan pulled back 1.1 per cent to $39.10 as its securities arm was fined £33.3m ($48.7m) by the UK’s Financial Services Authority for failing to protect billions of dollars of client money by not segregating it into separate accounts.Had the bank run into financial difficulties, its clients would have been at risk of losing their money. It is the largest penalty ever levied by the regulator.Shares in Joy Global, a maker of mining equipment, rallied 2.6 per cent to $53.81 after the company raised its full-year profit outlook and reported better-than-expected second-quarter results.Dynamex, a provider of same-day delivery services in the US and Canada, retreated 10.7 per cent to $14.35 after it lowered its earnings forecast for the current fiscal year to as low as $1.05 per share. The average analyst estimate is for $1.21 per share.However, FedEx and UPS, its main rivals, were up 0.8 per cent to $83.98 and 0.7 per cent to $63.01, respectively. AutoNation climbed 4.1 per cent to $21.32. The largest US new car dealer said revenues rose 22 per cent last month."
288;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;UPS reads the smoke signals from Europe;;It was an all G2 affair at the official opening of UPS’s new Asia-Pacific hub in Shenzhen, the Chinese manufacturing centre just north of Hong Kong.The Sino-US symbolism on display included a Chinese vice-mayor, an American consul general, jazz on the sound system and a lion dance.With intra-Asia trade projected to grow at an annual average rate of 12.2 per cent until 2020, the new UPS facility in Shenzhen will be the distribution group’s biggest in the region – bigger even than its international hub in Shanghai.Europe, however, was not forgotten at Tuesday’s ceremony. UPS’s business between Asia and the EU is growing at 40 per cent. Dan Brutto, president of UPS International, referring to the latest disruptions to air traffic from Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano said: “I look at my PDA every five minutes to see where the ash is going”.It could be worse. When Cologne, UPS’s primary European hub, was closed because of ash last month, the world’s largest parcel delivery company diverted flights to Vienna, Madrid and Barcelona and then trucked its packages north.As for the smoke sent skyward by rioters in Athens, Mr Brutto noted that Greece did not loom very large in the greater economic scheme of things.He said: “Europe – Germany, France and the UK – still remain strong. We can’t predict the future but we are still very confident about the growth of our Asia-Europe trade link.”In at least one sphere, it would appear, Europe is still relevant.Capitalism’s lead roleFrank Capra made a number of films depicting the greed and self-interest of businessmen and politicians alike, giving capitalism a bad name. Remember Mr Deeds goes to town or Mr Smith goes to Washington, just to name a couple of his classics.This month, three film makers – two American and one Swiss – have gone to the Cannes Film Festival to show their films that, roughly three-quarters of a century later, seem to contain the same message.Like Mr Capra, who happened to have been a conservative and a Republican, these films – a fiction and two documentaries – are not a rant against capitalism as such. They simply try to expose how self-seeking and corrupt individuals abuse the system at the expense of society as a whole.If the system is to improve and survive, businessmen, bankers and politicians must all strive to adopt high standards of ethics and professionalism – in short, all the basic principles of good governance.Just like the 1930s, the 2008 collapse of the financial markets and the subsequent economic crisis was bound to attract independent filmmakers and Hollywood studios to cater to the public mood against rich and nasty bankers and dodgy dealmakers.But in the case of one of the big headline grabbing contributions to the current Cannes show – Oliver Stone’s sequel of his 1987 blockbuster Wall Street – the purpose of the film is not just to make money. Its producer, Rupert Murdoch-owned 20th Century Fox, clearly hopes it will.But Mr Stone and Michael Douglas, his lead star, both suggested the sequel Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps was also intended as a mea culpa of sorts.In the original, Mr Douglas was supposed to portray the sort of individual no young banker would want to emulate. But his “greed is good” philosophy seems to have had the opposite effect.Mr Douglas explained, at the new film’s premiere in Cannes, that his original character, Gordon Gekko, was a villain: the guy who destroyed corporations and people.But he also conceded: “We never anticipated that all these people would be raving that this was the man they wanted to be.”Result: subprime crisis, collapse of Lehman Brothers, AIG, countless rogue traders, global meltdown. The other two films, also take Wall Street to task.Inside Job by Charles Ferguson tells the story of the 2008 financial meltdown and argues it could have been avoided. Cleveland versus Wall Street by the Swiss Jean-Stéphane Bron recreates a fictional trial against bankers blamed for the crisis and pain that hit the US rust belt city.Whatever their merits or shortcomings, these films tend to confirm Hollywood’s and the industry’s traditional anti-big business bias.There is, of course, a huge paradox in all this given that filmmakers and their stars rely on just the same uncultivated producers, financiers and sponsors they mock and criticise on the big screen.This may be a way for the industry to expiate itself of its own sins – and those of Wall Street – while continuing to do business as usual.Equally, it could simply be a good commercial opportunity. As Mr Capra said: “If you want to send a message, try Western Union.”world.view@ft.com
289;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;Deutsche Post takes advantage of recovery;;Deutsche Post DHL took advantage of the recovering global economy and achieved better-than-expected profits in the first quarter while confirming that earnings for the rest of the year would also be at the top end of previous forecasts.The figures from the world’s biggest logistics company follow good quarterly results from US rivals such as FedEx and UPS. Logistics and freight companies are a bellwether of world trade and the underlying economy.Shares in the Bonn-based company, which also provides the postal service in Germany, bucked a faltering market and rose in morning trading in Frankfurt, as Deutsche Post showed signs of recovering after a costly restructuring, including a withdrawal from DHL’s attempt to compete with UPS and FedEx in the US express delivery business. The express business earned €110m compared with a quarterly loss of €392m year ago.The group said it was on course for earnings from its DHL businesses, including freight forwarding, to more or less equal those from its historically more important mail business for the first time.“In the future, our goal is to achieve a stable result in the mail division and for DHL to become the driving force of growth in consolidated net profit,” said Larry Rosen, chief financial officer.Continued recovery in global transport volumes in 2010 should push underlying earnings before interest and tax to about €1.9bn – the upper end of a range previously indicated.Deutsche Post acknowledged that the estimate might still seem cautious, given that projecting quarterly earnings over the year would produce ebit of more than €2bn. Mr Rosen said: “It is much too early to judge how strong and, above all, how stable the economic recovery will actually be this year.”Sales in the first quarter rose 4.4 per cent to €12bn, compared with a year ago, while underlying earnings before interest and tax rose 81 per cent to €566m. Net income and earnings per share increased 85 per cent.A partial end to an exemption from value added tax in Germany would cost an annual sum in the “low triple-digit millions”, Mr Rosen said, with Deutsche Post deciding not to pass on the full costs in order to retain volumes.Deutsche Post said disruption caused by last month’s volcanic eruption in Iceland had only a “negligible” financial impact in spite of the closure of much of Europe’s airspace for several days. The company rerouted flights and used extra trucks to shift freight from its main air hub at Leipzig.Shares rose 2 per cent in Frankfurt to €12.17.
290;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-04-27T20:18:52Z;Stocks slump on Greece and Portugal downgrades;US Treasuries soar on haven flows;21:55 BST. A downgrade of Greece and Portugal’s credit ratings triggered a sharp sell-off in stocks and eurozone debt markets on Tuesday, adding to jitters as traders watched the “The Lloyd and Fabulous Fabrice Show”.The FTSE All-World equity index dropped 2.1 per cent, the sharpest dip for the global metric since October 2009. The dollar and US Treasury prices rallied while the euro fell sharply – to its 2010 low point – as traders reduced their exposure to risky assets.Strong reports by BP, Deutsche Bank, Ford and UPS boosted Asian shares, which were also building on continuing strong macroeconomic data from the US – where consumer confidence and home prices improved markedly.Europe tried to extend those gains, but Greek worries sent them into a sharp tailspin after Standard & Poor’s cut credit ratings on Portugal and Greece to A- and BB+ respectively.And while Wall Street had lately been able to shrug off eurozone debt default contagion worries, the double whammy of credit downgrades and accelerating financial regulation, plus the consequent plunge in the euro and surge in bond prices, seemed to finally spook US traders.The S&P 500 fell 2.4 per cent – its steepest drop in two and a half months – and the Vix index, a measure of expected equity market volatility, soared 31 per cent to 22.81, its highest level in two months and its sharpest jump since October 2008, just after Lehman Brothers collapsed.● Behind the headline figures, however, were details suggesting US traders hadn’t completely changed their tune on financials, a key engine of the recent market rally, as dramatically one might expect. True, S&P 500 financial shares declined 3.4 per cent on the day. But Goldman shares rose 0.7 per cent, and as much as 1.7 per cent earlier, as Fabulous Fab & Co. strongly denied any wrongdoing.Credit default swap spreads of banks actually tightened during the day, according to Markit data, though they had gapped higher overnight. Citi and JP Morgan swaps both tightened by about 6bp, suggesting a decline in the market’s view of their riskiness.“Credit spreads of US banks were negatively affected by the events surrounding Greece and Portugal,” said Pri de Silva, analyst at CreditSights, “which offset a potential improvement due to the impasse in the Senate.”Plus, an expectations game was afoot. According to Thomson Reuters, analysts have raised their bank earnings predictions faster than any other sector, so even a small drop back next quarter would be an even bigger disappointment. And as David Bianco, chief equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, points out, bank profits have driven much of the current earnings rally – with their reports mostly compete for the quarter, the S&P may have already enjoyed its bump for the season.“About half the increase to our …EPS estimates last week was from lower credit costs at financials,” Mr Bianco said. “Estimates climbed 9%, rising at a faster pace than prior reporting seasons. But this should significantly slow now that financials have reported.”Greece, meanwhile, watched its sovereign credit spreads extend to a startling 800 bp, a fresh all-time record. No such relief for the Greeks.● Selling in European bourses accelerated after the S&P downgrades. Strong results from BP and Deutsche Bank could not stop the FTSE 100 in London falling 2.6 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 retreating 2.6 per cent. The heavyweight mining and banking sectors did most of the damage.The Athens stock market plunged 6 per cent and Lisbon fell 5.4 per cent.In earlier Asian trading the Shanghai market had at one point fallen to its lowest level in six months, before closing down 2.1 per cent, as investors became wary of a slew of fresh share issuance. The Hang Seng lost 1.5 per cent in sympathy, and this helped push the FTSE Asia-Pacific index down 0.2 per cent.Elsewhere in the region the mood was less glum, after a raft of earnings reports impressed. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 rose 0.4 per cent, although gains were capped by Wall Street’s soft close overnight.● The euro plunged 1.6 per cent to $1.3175, at a one year low, as investors fled the single currency project. The dollar jumped 1 per cent on a trade-weighted basis on haven flows.Sterling fell 1.2 per cent versus the dollar to $1.5272 as the latest opinion poll pointed to the election in May delivering a hung parliament that some believe would hamper moves to tackle the UK’s budget deficit.● Portugal’s sovereign debt remained under pressure as investors feared Lisbon would be next to struggle in controlling its finances. The yield on the 10-year note rose 35 basis points to 5.58 per cent and the cost of insuring Portuguese bonds against default – as measured by credit default swaps – jumped 12 per cent to a new high.Greek 10-year yields moved up 4bp to 9.56 per cent and the two-year yield soared 216bp to 16.08 per cent. Greek CDS rose 8.3 per cent, also a new high.The yield on US 10-year notes fell 12bp to 3.68 per cent as perceived havens were sought. The gains moderated after a middling auction of $44bn two-year notes. The bonds priced 1.4bps higher than the market rate, suggesting an uptick in worries about possible inflation.That’s the direction many have expected Treasuries to move as the US economic recovery proceeds apace and more supply – $129bn in total will be auctioned this week – hits the market.“The Treasury market’s been on a short-term rally since the situation with Greece and sovereign risk has escalated,” said Jeffrey Elswick, director of fixed income at Frost Investment Advisors. “In our mind the fair value on the 10-year is about 4.5 per cent. We think there will be more selling once the markets get some more positive payroll information.”● Commodities were sold heavily as traders reduced exposure to riskier assets. Oil fell 2.7 per cent to $81.90 a barrel and the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a commodities basket, lost 2 per cent.Gold rose 1.4 per cent to $1,169.80 an ounce – the highest since December 2009 – as haven flight trumped the effect of the stronger dollar.Follow Jamie Chisholm’s market comments on Twitter: @JamieAChisholm

The fraud charges concern the packaging and selling of collateralised debt obligations. The bank is charged with not disclosing the role Paulson & Co, a hedge fund, played in a transaction.After the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.6 per cent at 1,192.13, leaving it 0.19 per cent lower during the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 11,018.66, leaving it up 0.2 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.4 per cent lower at 2,481.26, but up 1.1 per cent for the week.Bank of America fell 5.5 per cent to $18.41 yesterday even as it was reporting better first-quarter earnings than expected.“After the JPMorgan results this week, it’s hard to be a shining star,” said Steve Hagenbuckle, managing partner at New York-based TerraCap Partners.The results were boosted by a strong performance by its investment banking division that is largely made up of the Merrill Lynch business it bought at the height of the financial crisis.“If it wasn’t for Merrill, the figures would look very different,” said Mr Hagenbuckle.Net income was 28 cents per share, compared with consensus analyst estimates of 9 cents per share.JPMorgan was 0.9 per cent lower on the week to $45.55 after reporting earnings per share of 74 cents, more than double the same period last year, and beating expectations of 64 cents per share.Citigroup fell 5.2 per cent to $4.56 but rose 0.2 per cent for the week. The stock broke the key $5 mark on Thursday for the first time since October.Moody’s, the agency that rates corporates and structured derivative transactions, declined 7.6 per cent yesterday to $27.41 as news of the legal action against Goldman emerged.Google lost 7.6 per cent to $550.15 after reporting quarterly earnings after Thursday’s close that fell short of some “whisper” numbers among traders but beat consensus analyst estimates.It posted net income of $1.96bn, or $6.06 per share, up from $1.42bn, or $4.49 per share, the year before.General Electric was 2.7 per cent lower at $18.97 as the infrastructure, finance and media conglomerate reported disappointing first-quarter revenues.“Investors [have been] intently focused on revenue growth to confirm the sustainability of the economic and earnings recovery,” said Jonathan Golub, US equity strategist at UBS.However, earnings at GE were significantly higher than expected at 21 cents per share, topping consensus analyst estimates of 16 cents per share.The airline sector was lower across the board yesterday on worries about air traffic disruption in Europe resulting from the eruption of a volcano in Iceland.The market was unimpressed with fresh merger talks between Continental and United Airlines.Continental Airlines fell 3.3 per cent to $22.98, Delta Air Lines lost 3.6 per cent to $13.87 and UAL Corp, parent of United Airlines, declined 3 per cent to $22.83.As the earnings season kicked into full swing this week, a number of blue-chip corporates reported strong first-quarter results.Package delivery group UPS added 5.9 per cent to $68.21 on the week as
it reported earnings of 71 cents per share on Thursday, up from 52 cents last year and above consensus analyst expectations of 57 cents.Yum Brands rallied 4.9 per cent to $42.70 on the week after the restaurant chain operator, which owns KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, said on Wednesday that profit in the quarter had risen 11 per cent, boosted by strong sales in China."

Overall, earnings are likely to pleasantly surprise the markets.“The question is what happens after the earnings cycle. We are probably looking at seasonal weakness around the summer, where we could get a 5-10 per cent correction.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,211.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to 11,144.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher at 2,515.69.UPS added 5.3 per cent to $68.89 after the package delivery company, which is often regarded as a bellwether for the wider economy, reported better-than-expected quarterly results after the session’s close on Wednesday and raised its full-year earnings forecasts.Adjusted earnings were 71 cents a share, up from 52 cents last year and above consensus expectations of 57 cents.Revenue rose 7 per cent, helped by significant volume growth in international markets.Rival FedEx, the world’s largest cargo airline, was up 1.7 per cent to $95.62.Yum Brands rallied 2.6 per cent to $42.78 after reporting strong first-quarter results after the close of the session on Wednesday.The company, which owns KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and other restaurant chains, said profit in the quarter rose 11 per cent, boosted by strong sales in China and a Pizza Hut $10 pizza promotion.Shares in Citigroup pulled back 2.4 per cent to $4.81.

293;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T05:58:35+0000;Greek bond plunge stalls China-inspired risk rally;Rise in US weekly jobless claims reignites recovery fears;21:15 BST: A roaring Chinese economy was heard across global trading desks on Thursday, boosting risk appetite and pushing stocks to cyclical highs.However, exuberance was tempered by an initial sharp sell-off in longer-term Greek debt and a plunge in the euro – as news that Athens had asked the EU and IMF to discuss aid reminded traders about the unsustainable level of many developed nations’ debt burdens.In addition, US weekly jobless claims unexpectedly rose for the second consecutive week, calling into question the strength of the US recovery.The FTSE All-World index rose 0.2 per cent after it had earlier in the session hit its best level since mid-September 2008, as investors welcomed the Chinese addition to a slew of positive macro and micro-economic data over recent days.News that China’s gross domestic product expanded by nearly 12 per cent in the first quarter, comes after a strong showing from US retail sales on Wednesday and better-than-expected results from tech and banking giants Intel and JPMorgan Chase this week.All this while consumer price inflation in the US and China has come in below forecasts, prompting many to hope that the Federal Reserve, for one, will not need to tighten policy aggressively any time soon.This “sweet-spot” for stocks requires the improving growth and earnings theme to be maintained, of course, and news that the labour market continues to struggle is a blemish on that rosy scenario.● Global equities began Thursday’s session in good fettle, reflecting the data out of China and Wall Street’s ability to bounce 1.1 per cent. The S&P 500 closed above the 1,200 level for the first time in more than 18 months. But the heightened sovereign debt worries curtailed optimism.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 bounced off a morning sell-off to add 0.6 per cent and London’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.5 per cent. The Athens stock market rose 2.1 per cent, in spite of the wobble in the nation’s bond market.On Wall Street, the S&P 500 inched higher to 1,211, supported by strong earnings from UPS. A batch of regional and national manufacturing data confirmed the sector’s continued expansion.A Fed official’s dovish recantation helped sentiment later in the day, which had been wobbly after the mixed economic data, with the S&P index spending some of the afternoon in the red.Jeffrey Lacker, a regional president, who had on Wednesday failed to use the ‘extended period’ mantra in reference to near-zero rates, said: “I’m comfortable with interest rates where they are now,” adding he did not yet see a reason to move them. So much for all that.Asia was mostly closed before the euro began to fall. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo led the way with a 0.6 per cent advance after a survey of Japanese manufacturing sentiment for March showed the first move out of negative territory in two years. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index rose 0.5 per cent after hitting its best level in 20 months.Traders in China were a little more circumspect, as some worried that Beijing might adopt further measures to damp speculative activity. The Shanghai Composite fell just 0.04 per cent, though Hong Kong followed the global trend and added 0.2 per cent.● Trading in forex markets was initially subdued, with much of the focus on whether Beijing would use an appreciation in the renminbi as a tool for damping inflationary pressures.However, as the European session got into its stride the euro began to slide as Greek fiscal worries refused to dissolve and the nation’s bond yields spiked higher. The euro fell 0.6 per cent to $1.3577 – the first drop in six sessions – and lost 0.8 per cent versus the yen.The dollar index, which tracks the buck against a basket of peers, began to push higher as fiscal-linked tensions bubbled and investors sought a haven, gaining 0.4 per cent to 80.48.● Greek 10-year yields flew close to a new 11-year high above 7.4 per cent at one stage, and the spread with Bunds – the premium Athens must pay to raise funds – rose back above 400 basis points.No particular news appeared to have caused the early sell-off, other than a pervasive fear that Athens’s plans for cutting the budget and securing long-term funding were not practical. Talk that Greece would not undertake a planned US roadshow to sell its debt due to lack of interest was doing the rounds – though the abandonment was later denied by Athens, according to Reuters. It was only later news emerged that Athens had requested a meeting with the EU and IMF.Yields were later at 7.10 per cent, up 9 basis points, reducing the Bund spread to 397 basis pointsThe cost of insuring Greece debt against default fell back from an early all-time high.

It will give further details at the end of April.The company’s comments are closely watched because its extensive international networks provide analysts with a barometer of the health of the global economy.The pre-announcement, the second in a row for UPS, comes as a number of indicators are suggesting that the current global economic recovery is more robust than some had feared.In the first quarter, UPS earned 53 cents a diluted share compared with 40 cents a share for the same period the year before, which represents a 33 per cent improvement.Excluding restructuring charges, a loss on the sale of a German transportation business and a tax expense from a German subsidiary, earnings were 71 cents per share.In recent weeks analysts have been steadily pushing their estimates higher, but consensus expectations were still for adjusted earnings per share of about 57 cents on revenues of about $11.6bn (€8.6bn, £7.5bn).Building on the strong first-quarter results, UPS said it had raised its full-year adjusted diluted earnings outlook, from the $2.70 to $3.05 cents per share range it had noted earlier in the year, to between $3.05 and $3.30 cents per share.UPS’s shares, which have added 14 per cent in the year to date, on Wednesday rose 4.2 per cent in after-market trading to $68.22.The company said its international package and supply chain and freight businesses had performed particularly well, with revenues from the segments rising by 18 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, and contributing to a consolidated revenue gain of 7 per cent.US domestic daily package volume remained a laggard, increasing by less than 1 per cent in the quarter, but that was still the first year-on-year growth for the segment in more than two years.Margins improved across all business segments.The transportation sector as a whole is expected to post a 25.4 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings compared with a year ago and a 20.5 per cent increase over the full year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
295;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-04-09T05:35:38Z;TNT plans to spin off its mail business;;TNT, the Dutch mail and express delivery company, on Thursday unveiled plans to spin-off its mail operations in preparation for a possible partnership with a rival or a listing of the business.The group has been under pressure since late last year from two activist shareholders who believe splitting the mail business from the express division would create value.The company said in December it was abandoning its strategy of trying to become the leading European mail company because liberalisation of European postal markets had not delivered enough benefits.TNT then signalled that the Dutch mail business might “over time” participate in Europe-wide consolidation.Peter Bakker, chief executive, on Thursday said the spin-off could be completed this year but he would not say how long the company would take to make a definite decision on the fate of the business. Talks on partnerships with rival postal companies had yet to start, he said.“Can we, through partnerships, strengthen the position of mail? Can we make it part of European mail consolidation? Are there other incumbents who, like us, have an interest in joining forces? Or, alternatively, should we consider a separate listing for the mail business?” Mr Bakker said, describing the questions facing TNT.He conceded the spin-off could fuel speculation of an approach for the express division by larger rivals such as US groups UPS and FedEx. In the past both have signalled interest but were reluctant to take on the mail division.While Mr Bakker had previously argued a break-up would be disruptive, he has faced renewed questions about the company’s structure since Jana Partners, an activist investor, and Alberta Investment Management built a 5 per cent stake in TNT last year.On Thursday he said an outright sale of the mail business, valued at about €3bn ($4bn) by analysts, was “not the most likely scenario” but also said “nothing is totally off the table”.The group has shifted its growth ambitions to the express delivery division, which is focusing more on deliveries guaranteed on a given day rather than by a certain hour and is growing in China and other emerging markets. The mail division, by contrast, is facing 7-9 per cent annual volume declines in the Netherlands.
296;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;TNT;Considering a listing of the domestic mail division is the right step;"The usual debate is under way over whether the activist shareholders camped on its lawn pushed TNT of the Netherlands into a strategy shift or – as Europe’s second-largest mail and delivery company naturally claims – it was already moving in that direction. Either way, considering a partial listing or initial public offering of the sluggish domestic mail division, as well as looking for partnerships, is the right step.TNT’s two halves are diverging fast. Its express delivery service, with a fifth of the European Union market and mushrooming emerging markets presence, is high-growth – but investment-hungry. But e-mail’s rise condemns the Dutch snail mail business, like peers everywhere, to live with constant volume declines. Hopes of revitalising it by taking advantage of coming European postal liberalisation have been undermined by long delays in the legislation and political obstacles even in markets already opened to competition.So instead, putting hopes in the consolidation of European mail operators or attracting outside investors is smarter. After all, the mail business generates lots of cash – potentially attractive to income investors. Any gain from the mail arm could be ploughed into developing the express arm. Alternatively, the express business becomes much more attractive to, say, FedEx or UPS of the US; both are thought to have looked at it but been deterred by the snail-mail burden.Do not expect an express delivery. TNT must consult with its union – though March’s new labour agreement may have eased the path. It needs a government ruling on the return it can make on delivering its obligation to provide a universal mail service across the Netherlands, which could be delayed by forthcoming elections. But at only 12.5 times forecast 2011 earnings, TNT lags far behind FedEx or UPS’s 18 times; management has taken an important first step towards closing the gap.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyTNT, the Dutch mail and express delivery company, said on Thursday it would spin off its mail operations in preparation for a possible partnership or listing of the business.The group has been under pressure from several shareholders who believe splitting the mail business from the express division would create value.The company said in December it was abandoning a previous strategy of trying to become the leading European mail company, largely due to a flawed European liberalisation of postal markets, and signalled that the Dutch mail business might ”over time” participate in European-wide consolidation.Thursday’s announcement of a legal and financial carve-out of the entire mail business is a marked acceleration of those plans and sent shares in the company up almost 6 per cent to a 19-month high."

298;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-04-07T22:35:06Z;The iPad’s scary counter-revolution;This is the digital future, whether publishers like it or not;"Last Saturday, a man in brown from UPS came to my door with an Apple iPad. On Sunday, Twitter brought adoring sighs from people who had also bought one. On Monday, the internet delivered a backlash.Things move faster these days. We have already been through several news cycles on the pros and cons of what Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, calls “a magical and revolutionary product” and the device is not even for sale outside the US yet.Many companies – from newspapers to book publishers and broadcasting networks – are keen on the iPad because they think it offers a chance to sell a professional product in a controlled setting. They hope for an alternative to giving away content on the internet, hoping forlornly for advertisements (or something) to save them.Thus, a lot of commentary centres on the issue of whether the iPad can “save publishers”. Since that is a rhetorical question requiring the answer “no”, I will instead address another one – whether it is good for publishers. Having played with my iPad for a while, I think the answer to that one is “yes and no”.The iPad is a curiously seductive device for something that is, on the face of it, a touchscreen laptop with the keyboard removed. Microsoft has made repeated attempts to introduce “tablet” computers with very limited results. Hewlett-Packard will soon have another go with a Windows 7-based tablet.Mr Jobs’ famed reality distortion field must be working at warp factor 10 because to pick up the iPad is to feel you are entering a different technological world. The sceptics dismiss it as a compromise between an iPod Touch and a MacBook, but they are wrong.Actually, the iPad feels much more like a cross between a computer and a television, one that you hold in your hands. It manages, more than anything I’ve seen before, to fill the gap between “sit back” screens and “sit forward” computers and video games consoles.That is, I think, one reason why it has upset many traditionalists in Silicon Valley, who see it as a counter-revolutionary, not a revolutionary, machine. They fear that it will turn engaged and interactive internet users back into passive couch potatoes.Cory Doctorow, co-editor of the Boing Boing blog, wrote an eloquent lament for the passing of the open source, fix-it traditions of personal computing and mourned the iPad’s “palpable contempt for the owner”. The device was a throwback to the early days of AOL and its walled garden alternative to the internet, he lamented.I would say it was more subversive than that. The iPad is (despite lacking a flash drive or a camera) a fairly open device, which gives its users a choice between internet browsing and devoting time to games and media applications sold by developers and publishers. They are not being forced to spend their time and money in ways that Mr Doctorow disdains.Yet they are likely to do so because it is simpler and more entertaining. That is why the iPad helps publishers: it restores a comparative advantage that the computer-based internet took away. It is much easier on an iPad to navigate the full depth of content in some publications, and to appreciate the best photos and videos.One of the difficulties publishers face on the internet is that it is laborious to navigate websites much beyond their home pages, which has encouraged many consumers to consume snippets of material from many sources, rather than engaging deeply with one publication. I found it far easier, for example, to navigate the digital Wall Street Journal on the iPad than on a laptop.That is the good news for publishers, but there is a catch. While I think the iPad is good for them as a category, I’m not so sure it is good for those that now exist – certainly not all of them.The problem for publishers is that the iPad is a demanding medium because it is not sufficient to publish text, or indeed photos or videos, on their own. Media apps work best on the iPad when they combine depth of information with a lot of visual material in innovative ways; that is what makes them shine.The Time magazine app will, for $4.99 a week, give you the text of the magazine filled out with videos and photo slideshows – there is a nice display of Matisse paintings in this week’s edition. I found it pleasant to scan but I am not sure it is deep enough to pay $20 a month, and it has already been harshly criticised for being too similar to the magazine’s print version.Danny O’Brien, a technology writer, identified this on his blog Oblomovka as a revisiting of the old CD-Rom problem. The medium allows publishers to go to town with words and pictures – indeed, it demands it – but that is expensive and hard to make profitable.That favours publishers with the resources to create multimedia content and a bank of information to be remixed and repurposed. Both Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, which have other ways to earn a dime, have launched free apps with lots of such material.Rising costs and flat (at best) revenues in a fragmented industry generally lead to consolidation and that is where the iPad, and successive generations of information/entertainment tablets will take publishers. There is a high barrier to entry, and many will not clear it on their own.The iPad is an alluring vision of the digital future for publishers, but a scary one too.john.gapper@ft.com

Its shares added 4.2 per cent to €20.91.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.7 per cent to 1,072.44.Greek stocks performed well after Germany clarified that any financial rescue could go ahead only once Greece had done its utmost to raise money on the international capital markets, the IMF had agreed to make a “substantial contribution”, and rules had been negotiated to prevent a recurrence of such a debt crisis.Alpha Bank rose 3.5 per cent to €6.82, while Piraeus Bank added 1.1 per cent to €6.30. Titan Cement, the largest Greek cement producer, was 4.5 per cent higher at €18.29.The Athens General index added 1.8 per cent to 2,047.03.Rheinmetall shares fell as the German automotive and defence company said it intended to make further acquisitions. Adrian Pehl at Equinet said: “The company is likely to make smaller acquisitions of unlisted companies for the defence side of its business, probably in the ammunition environment. It is very lucrative.”Analysts said the company would target specialised companies such as chemical makers.Rheinmetall was 1.6 per cent lower at €49.45 after worse-than-expected guidance for 2010 and plans to propose a dividend of €0.30 per share for 2009, compared with €1.30 for 2008.OPAP, Europe’s largest publicly traded gambling company, rallied 8.7 per cent to €16.48 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of €92.1m that beat analysts’ estimates. The Greek group was the biggest winner on the FTSE Eurofirst.Raiffeisen weakened after it again failed to reassure investors over how minority shareholders would benefit from a planned merger with RZB, its unlisted Austrian parent.The bank’s shares fell 1.9 per cent to €34.31 as investors feared that a deal would reduce Raiffeisen’s exposure to the fast-growing eastern Europe market.Volkswagen lost 4.4 per cent to €72.36 after the German carmaker said it would sell as many as 65m new shares to help finance the takeover of Porsche’s auto-making unit.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
301;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-02-02T22:35:49Z;Risk appetite returns as rate fears ease;European stocks rebound despite BP slump;21:30 GMT. Riskier assets were back in favour on Tuesday as investors welcomed signs that fresh evidence of improving global economic activity may not necessarily face a ham-fisted monetary response.The FTSE World equity index rose 1.4 per cent, bonds dipped and commodities rebounded after sharp falls last week as traders continued to absorb much better-than-expected worldwide manufacturing data released on Monday.“The market over recent weeks has been looking past the evidence of strengthening global demand and reacting to risks to the outlook from policy tightening in China and India, a drift towards less accommodation in the US and UK, fiscal tightening trends in several countries, sovereign risk spread widening in Europe, and tough banking sector reform,” noted analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland.“Having taken on board and reacted to these developments, the market was in a space where it could draw some solace from strong manufacturing data, where there is significant momentum in activity.”Such robustness would have given ample excuse for the Reserve Bank of Australia to match market expectations and raise interest rates from 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent. But it held steady.Australia is clearly in a different stage of the monetary cycle to many developed economies. But traders may hope the RBA’s decision points to a more nuanced and tender process than they had feared – one that recognises the impact of tightening elsewhere, in this case China – and that this will be the tone set by global peers. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England give their decisions on Thursday.Countering the generally upbeat mood on Tuesday, however, is the ratcheting up of tensions between the US and China. Beijing reiterated it would impose sanctions on those US companies that are involved with selling arms to Taiwan. Coming so soon after the Google spat, it seems clear investors should be wary of the impact such disputes can have on trade.● The S&P 500 in New York rose 1.3 per cent, helped by a generally well-received number of fourth-quarter corporate results. UPS, the parcels group, provided hope for a broad improvement in commercial activity in its positive forecasts for 2010. Slightly stronger-than-expected pending home sales data also lent support.European bourses were able to recover from a weak start after a badly received earnings report from BP initially hit sentiment. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.7 per cent and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 added 0.9 per cent.The FTSE Asia Pacific index rebounded 0.8 per cent from three-month lows, with Sydney up 1.8 per cent, boosted by the RBA standing pat and a rally in mining stocks.The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 1.6 per cent and Hong Kong rose 0.1 per cent. Shanghai dipped 0.2 per cent as traders remained worried about a lot of future share sales, and the second IPO in the space of a week fell below its issue price.● The Australian dollar was the main feature in the forex markets. The Aussie dropped 0.8 per cent against the dollar as some of its supposed yield attraction did not come to pass. Trading elsewhere was pretty quiet, with the dollar drifting lower by 0.2 per cent.● Gold added to the previous day’s sharp gains, advancing 0.9 per cent to $1,115. Oil rose 3.9 per cent to $77.35 a barrel, leading the way in a commodity complex boosted by the solid manufacturing reports. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a commodity basket, jumped 1.9 per cent.● The US 10-year Treasury yield fell 2 basis points to 3.63 per cent. Overnight, the US Treasury said it expected to sell $392bn of marketable debt in the first quarter of the year.Fears about a Greek default appeared to subside a touch in earlier European trading. The yield on 10-year Greek government bonds fell to 6.5 per cent, having breached 7 per cent last week. The yield spread with German Bunds dropped back to 330 basis points. However, the pessimists later took command, pushing the spread back past 350 basis points.
302;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:09:12+0000;Positive earnings lift US stocks;;Encouraging results from industrial groups and the homebuilding sector re-newed investors’ confidence in the economic recovery, pushing US stocks to a higher close on Tuesday.After a shaky start, Wall Street steadily added to its gains and the S&P 500 closed up 1.3 per cent near its intraday high at 1,103.32.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent to 10,296.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.9 per cent to 2,190.06.The benchmark index recorded its worst monthly losses for a year in January after a series of downbeat earnings reports and concerns over Chinese demand prompted a pause in the market’s 11-month rally.However, Wall Street staged a recovery on Monday after last month’s ISM data showed the strongest level of manufacturing activity for six years.”In the wake of Monday’s ISM report, people are starting to come round to a more positive view again,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.Arguing that the sell-off in the past few weeks created a better platform for the market to go higher, Mr Schweitzer said: ”Since last June, we have had five corrections on the scale of the January correction and each one proved temporary because the underlying fundamentals were getting better. We should look at January through that lens.”He added: ”The critical question is whether the fundamentals are getting better and whether they will stay better.”Lexmark led the S&P 500 higher in early trading after beating quarterly estimates because of cost cuts and increasing demand for printers and ink. Its shares jumped 12 per cent to $30.01.Shares in United Parcel Service gained 0.4 per cent to $58.62 after the world’s largest package delivery service gave an optimistic profit forecast for this year.The group, which is considered an economic bellwether of consumer demand and business activity, said that last year’s holiday shopping period had been better than expected.Emerson Electric , which makes industrial equipment, also boosted its profit forecast for this year after posting better quarterly results than analysts had been expecting.Its higher profit was largely due to cost-cutting, including the elimination of 20,000 jobs since the beginning of last year. Its shares jumped 10.1 per cent to $46.77.Whirlpool , the largest maker of home appliances, rose 8.1 per cent to $82.23 after announcing that it had doubled profit on cost cuts and higher demand.Shares in ComsysITPartners surged 31.4 per cent to $17.39 after Manpower agreed to buy the recruitment company for $17.65 per share.
303;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-02-02T15:38:42Z;UPS posts declining quarterly profit;;UPS, the logistics company, reported another drop in quarterly profits on Tuesday, in line with expectations, while predicting the economy would gather momentum as the year progressed.“Economic forecasts indicate gradual improvement as 2010 unfolds,” Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer of UPS, said. “The first quarter will be the most challenging of the year for UPS with profitability only slightly better than last year.”UPS’s comments are closely watched by the market because its deliveries of packages and goods provide analysts with a barometer of the health of the global economy.In early trading UPS shares rose 1.1 per cent to $58.39.The company also included a full-year forecast for the first time since the downturn began, predicting that earnings per share would come in between $2.70 and $3.05 this year, almost a third better than in 2009 and at the upper end of the range.Mr Kuehn said the goals were “ambitious” but achievable, given the “firming economy”, improved pricing environment and increased volumes the company was seeing.Still the company is keeping tight control of costs. UPS is planning capital expenditure for the year of about $1.8bn, well below its historical norm, and intends to cut 1,800 jobs over the next year, generating savings of about $160m a year from 2011.In the fourth quarter of 2009, UPS reported net income of $757m, or 75 cents per share, compared with $829m, or 83 cents per share, in the same period in 2008. The 2008 net income number excludes a $575m impairment charge.Revenues slipped 2.5 per cent to $12.38bn, as 5.8 per cent growth in the international package segment because of strong performance in Asian markets was offset by weaker but stabilising US domestic package and supply chain and freight segments.In January, UPS boosted its fourth-quarter forecast to 73-75 cents per share, thanks to the impact of cost savings and an improved operational performance.For the full year, net profits excluding the impact of foreign exchange and impairments fell 35.3 per cent to $2.3bn, or $2.31 per share, on revenues down 12 per cent to $45.3bn.“The company demonstrated its ability to manage effectively in changing market conditions,” said Scott Davis, UPS chairman and chief executive. “UPS has emerged from the worst recession in decades leaner, more focused and better positioned to take advantage of increased global trade.”
304;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-01-15T20:04:52Z;Agencies struggle to secure transport link;;A secure overland route into Haiti was on Friday emerging as a key priority after the destruction of the capital’s port and the seizing-up of its airport made direct transport into the country all but impossible.Logistics experts were instead working to ensure the smoothest transport possible from the neighbouring Dominican Republic, where Santo Domingo airport and the large, modern port of Caucedo look likely to be vital to early rescue efforts. Guards would be needed to protect the route against hijacking and looting, experts said.Tuesday’s earthquake caused extensive damage to the port in Port-au-Prince, the capital, destroying the container terminal’s only large crane and two floating mobile cranes. WFP Logistics, an arm of the United Nations World Food Programme, said the port was “non-operational”.The port’s destruction put extra pressure on the city’s airport. Flights have had to circle in the air for two hours and more as workers struggled to clear supplies from aircraft that had landed. “There is obviously quite a bit of a traffic jam there,” the Disasters Emergency Committee, the UK umbrella aid organisation, said. “Flights going in are being stacked up in the air.”Problems at the airport included a lack of refuelling, cargo and ground handling equipment, a lack of space for bigger aircraft to stay overnight and no safe accommodation for crew.But a US official said Cuba had agreed to let the US military use restricted Cuban air space for medical evacuation flights carrying earthquake victims from the US naval station in Guantánamo Bay to Florida.Tom O’Malley, vice-president of the Americas regions for UPS, the logistics company, said his company, which is helping with the relief effort, would fly to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic until order was restored at Port-au-Prince.UPS would also be working with shipping lines to move goods brought into the port of Caucedo in the Dominican Republic to Port-au-Prince.The Disasters Emergency Committee emphasised that the road from the Dominican Republic was open and that aid supplies were getting in, despite congestion.But, according to Mr O’Malley, UPS had not yet been able to make any overland movements. It was vital to ensure there would be no customs problems at the border and that aid agencies would have staff in place to receive the goods when they arrived.“We are working to resolve the overland transportation link because we think that’s the way we’re going to be most effective,” Mr O’Malley said.Matthew Leech, managing director for the Americas region of DP World, which runs the Caucedo port, said it would be offering free handling for any critical relief supplies. But he also expressed concern about overland movements.“Our company is looking at setting up a seamless logistics channel from Caucedo into Haiti.”Maersk Line, the world’s largest container shipping line, said it was making available two geared ships – ships with their own cranes – in the hope that they might be able to use Port-au-Prince’s battered port.

Within the past year Priscilla Queen Of The Desert, Sister Act and now Legally Blonde have all taken feel-good flicks and assiduously crushed any particle other than feel-good out of them, jettisoning almost all the smarts of the original films and leaving a strip-cartoon version.Of course, the essential two-faced message of Legally Blonde remains in place: as we watch California fashionista Elle Woods follow her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School, be first humiliated then succeed on her own terms, we can tell ourselves we are wise enough not to judge by appearances …whereas the underlying values are exactly the opposite, that beauty does imply substance.In Jerry Mitchell’s West End production, there are two designated not-beautiful female characters: one is a lesbian, the other a murderess. But at least the two aren’t equated, as are gay and European in a second-act courtroom number.Mitchell’s production, and the script, know exactly where to pitch themselves. The show includes not one but two dogs for us to go “Aaahh” at, and the biggest whoops of the evening (even bigger than those for the first appearances of Sheridan Smith and Duncan James, each stationary – whoo, they can stand!) go to a sub-Chippendale of a UPS parcel delivery guy.Instead of a personal essay, Elle presents the Harvard entry assessors with a cheerleading number; Brooke Wyndham, the keep-fit guru whom she defends on a murder charge, likewise gets a work-that-body routine, and as for the patented seduction tactic of “Bend And Snap” …you guessed it. One of the musical leitmotifs is a melodic progression close to the hook of The Bee Gees’ song “Words”, and indeed much of Laurence O’Keefe and Nell Benjamin’s score aspires to the condition of Saturday Night Fever: bouncy, whitish soul-disco.Smith is of course natural casting as Elle, bursting with musical and comedic talent, but I’m not sure she can pass for a freshman any more, even after a first college degree.As Professor Callahan, Peter Davison is similarly consummate (his stage musical chops are often underappreciated), but bless him, he’ll never be a merciless, unscrupulous shark in anyone’s book. It’s all jolly, loud – but for once not too loud – and affirmative, but as I say, we should look twice at exactly what we’re affirming. Oh well, welcome to 21st-century values. Whoop!

After an early rally, Kraft shares lost 0.2 per cent to $29.23. The group was also in focus following reports that Italy’s Ferrero has decided to pull out of the running for the British chocolate maker.Meanwhile, Hershey, the US confectioner that has shown interest in Cadbury, lost 3 per cent to $36.61.Energy stocks dragged the market into the red for brief periods in morning trading after a bearish inventory report pushed the price of US crude oil below $80 a barrel. However, the rally among financial stocks helped the market to recover its losses.After pushing steadily higher in the afternoon, the S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,145.68.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 10,680.77 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.1 per cent higher at 2,307.90.Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday for the first time this year after Alcoa, the aluminium producer, kicked off the earnings season with worse-than-expected fourth-quarter results. “This market hasn’t decided what it wants to be when it grows up in 2010,” said Randy Cass, founder of First Coverage, the research group that tracks market sentiment.“We’ve already seen substantial shifts in the sell side. They came into the new year trying to advocate a little bit of cautiousness and perhaps a movement from traditional positions in areas such as financials and technology into newer plays of basic material, oil and industrials. But none of that gained traction.”He said the earnings season would play a crucial role in giving the market direction. “The year 2009 was about giving everyone the benefit of the doubt and looking for the silver lining in every data point that came out. But the year 2010 is really about making sure that the market is where it should be and that the rally wasn’t too much, too soon.”Google was also a source of concern on Wednesday after the search engine said it would end the controversial censorship of its service in China, taking the risk of being thrown out of the country. Its shares fell 0.6 per cent to $587.09.Meanwhile, Baidu shares jumped 13.7 per cent to $439.48 in New York as investors bet that the Chinese search engine would benefit if Google was forced to leave the world’s most populous internet market.Elsewhere in the technology sector, shares in Triquint Semiconductor rose 6.9 per cent to $6.22 after the company raised its forecast for the fourth quarter.Arris Group, which makes broadband equipment, also raised its outlook for the fourth quarter, helping to boost its shares 5.9 per cent to $11.44.Flanders dropped 9.2 per cent to $4.35 after the maker of air filters said it would voluntarily delist from Nasdaq. The company said the move would help it save money by reducing legal and accounting costs.Merck rose 3.7 per cent to $38.93 after Credit Suisse raised the drugmaker to “outperform” from “neutral”, citing promising new products in the pipeline.Analysts at RBC Capital gave a boost to Atlas Air Worldwide and United Parcel Service, raising the carriers to “outperform” from “perform”. Atlas gained 2 per cent to $40.14 while UPS fell 0.5 per cent at $62.07.Wyndham Worldwide showed one of the greatest gains in the benchmark index, rising 8.6 per cent to $22.19 as Deutsche Bank raised the hotel operator to “buy” and increased its price target on the stock.
307;UPS;United Parcel Service;2010-01-08T19:46:46Z;S&P holds steady despite jobs data;;Wall Street recorded its biggest weekly gain in two months after investors shrugged off disappointing jobs data.While the unemployment rate held steady at 10 per cent as forecast, the Department of Labor said the economy had shed 85,000 jobs last month.Analysts in their consensus estimate had not expected any further job cuts during December.After spending most of the day in the red, the S&P 500 climbed higher in the last hour of trading and finished 0.3 per cent up at a fresh 15-month high of 1,144.98. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 10,618.19 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,317.17.Stocks have crept up every day this week and financial stocks rallied late on Thursday ahead of the non-farm payrolls report. Retailers also added to the market’s optimism after reporting higher sales from the holiday shopping season than Wall Street had been expecting.Over the week, the benchmark index gained 2.7 per cent, the Dow was up 1.8 per cent and the Nasdaq added 2.1 per cent.The Vix index, which measures risk aversion and is often described as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell to a 19-month low.United Parcel Service was in focus after announcing it was cutting 1,800 management and administrative jobs in an effort to streamline its small-parcel service. But the group raised its outlook for the fourth quarter, helping to boost its shares 4.8 per cent to $60.17.UPS lifted the S&P 500 industrials sector, which itself led the market higher from the opening bell. So far this week, the materials, energy and industrials sector have outperformed the market as investors bet on the economic recovery.Oil-related groups were in favour again on Friday.Goldman Sachs added Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oilfield services company, to its “conviction buy” list. Analysts said Halliburton was the most likely to benefit from higher demand in the sector. Its shares rose 5.1 per cent to $34.12.Pride International, the oil and gas company, also gained 0.8 per cent to $33.86 after Calyon Securities upgraded the stock to “outperform”.Telecoms stocks were down for the third day in a row, adding to pressure from consumer discretionary groups. The S&P 500 telecoms services sector lost 2.6 per cent this week. AT&T, the mobile network operator, slid 0.7 per cent on Friday to $27.10 and MetroPCS Communications fell 5.6 per cent to $7.10.Dragonwave, which makes wireless network equipment, escaped the sell-off after boosting its revenue forecast for the current fiscal year. Its shares jumped 11.4 per cent to $13.53.Phil Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors, said the weakness in defensive stocks indicated that the market still remained optimistic about the pace of economic recovery after the unemployment report.“As we’ve gone into the new year, investors are generally more upbeat about the economy and the market,” he said. “This jobs report, while disappointing, did not derail our thesis that the jobs market and the economy are going to recover pretty strongly over the course of this year.”Generic pharmaceutical companies also weighed on the market on Friday after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the industry to “neutral” from “attractive”.Mylan, the country’s largest maker of generic drugs, lost 3.4 per cent to $17.42 after analysts at the bank said the industry could suffer from healthcare reform.Elsewhere, shares in Cytori Therapeutics surged 12 per cent to $7.26 after regulators gave the drugmaker permission to market Puregraft System, a treatment whereby a patient’s own fat tissue is re-injected into different parts of the body for aesthetic contouring.
308;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-12-08T19:40:00Z;Activist hedge fund swoops for 5% TNT stake;;Hedge fund activism made a high-profile return to Europe on Tuesday when it emerged that Jana Partners and co-investor Alberta Investment Management Corporation had taken a 5 per cent stake in the Dutch postal services giant TNT. The move is being seen as a prelude to the sale of the group.Details of the stake, which were disclosed by the Dutch market regulator on Tuesday, follow news of a similar investment by the US asset manager BlackRock.Jana’s move marks a big-ticket return to activism, with echoes of its boom-time peak in 2007 when hedge funds triggered the sale of ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, to Royal Bank of Scotland.Activist hedge funds, which were hard hit in 2008, were now queuing up to deploy capital in Europe, industry insiders said.Cevian Capital, Europe’s largest dedicated activist fund, told the Financial Times it had made more than twice as many investments this year than usual.Other funds said they were quietly building stakes in target companies and expected to disclose next year.Jana and Aimco’s stake in TNT was revealed because it triggered Dutch market disclosure rules, which require shareholders to announce positions of more than 5 per cent in companies.TNT, which took its name from the international express carrier that merged with the Dutch post office in 1996, has long been in the frame as a possible takeover target.US postal services companies UPS and FedEx, together with DHL – which is owned by Germany’s Deutsche Post – were last year said to have been interested in acquiring the group.TNT’s directors, however, have since outlined a “standalone” strategy. The group has made inroads into the UK market on the back of declining Royal Mail services.The intentions of Jana and Aimco are unknown, but a sale of TNT to one of its rivals is widely seen as one possible outcome.Jana’s last significant foray into European corporate activism was in 2007, when the company, together with hedge fund giant DE Shaw, took a 1.6 per cent stake in Philips, the electronics company.On Friday, TNT unveiled a “Vision 2015” strategy to analysts in London that played up its prospects in “day-definite” express deliveries, but failed to outline a explicit plan for the mail business.It is struggling with a 4-6 per cent annual decline in mail volumes in the Netherlands and full competition after the European market was liberalised this year.Its workforce is partly unionised.The company has warned that it may need to make up to 11,000 staff redundant. It declined to comment.TNT shares closed 2.8 per cent higher at €20.91.
309;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-12-08T15:11:40Z;TNT;Activist shareholders could press for a break-up;"Yikes! Activist hedge funds are back in the Dutch market; remember what came out of TCI’s 2007 push to break up ABN Amro. But these are more sober times, and Jana Partners and co-investor Aimco, newly announced on the register of Dutch postal services group TNT, could make a useful contribution.TNT has a plain-vanilla mail service, the former Dutch post office, subject to increasing competition due to European Union liberalisation and the decline of snail mail. Trade unions, meanwhile, are cutting up rough over a new labour agreement. But it has a peachy express parcel service, with nearly a fifth of the EU market and a growing emerging market network. Jana is likely to push for TNT to be sold, ditching its standalone strategy. US rivals FedEx and UPS – with only 9 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, of European express delivery services – were both thought to have been interested in acquiring it in 2008, when TNT’s shares, as today, were trading at about €20.But the Dutch mail arm could put off potential acquirers, so realising full value might entail a break-up. The mail business – a handy cash generator, if a decent union agreement can be reached – could go to, say, private equity or a European operator such as Deutsche Post. The express arm would then be more attractive to US buyers. Collins Stewart suggests that, valuing mail on a discounted cash flow basis and express parcel somewhere between FedEx’s 7.5 times 2010 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and UPS’s 11 times, TNT could be worth up to €30 a share, or about €11bn. A break-up, however, could provoke political opposition – and like many Dutch companies, TNT has a foundation that could, in theory, block a takeover. Change is likely to move at the pace of snail mail, not an express parcel. And the package may yet not arrive.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially"
310;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;FedEx exceeds profit expectations;;FedEx said mounting demand for international and domestic shipments, along with cost cuts, had helped the package delivery company beat its own quarterly profits forecast.Considered a bellwether by many investors for its role in facilitating global trade, FedEx has seen its outlook brighten steadily since June, when the company ended a fiscal year that its chief executive, Fred Smith, called “the most difficult economic conditions that the modern world has seen since the end of world war two”.By the end of the summer, Mr Smith said in September, the early stages of a recovery appeared under way. FedEx forecast that US gross domestic product would expand by 3 per cent this quarter, then 4.9 per cent in the last three months of the year.In a statement announcing the Memphis-based company’s preliminary fiscal second-quarter results, FedEx said it earned $1.10 a share for the period ended November 30, down 30 per cent from the $1.58 it earned a year earlier. The courier had forecast a profit of 65-95 cents a share.Christopher Ceraso, an analyst with Credit Suisse, wrote on Monday in a note to clients: “We believe that the positive preannouncement represents further evidence of improvement in both the domestic and the international freight environment. This is well above our current estimate of 84 cents a share and consensus of 95 cents.”FedEx’s shares surged $2.59, or about 3 per cent, to $90.11 in late trading following the close of US markets. Before the announcement, the stock had climbed 36 per cent this year.United Parcel Service, FedEx’s rival, rose $1.38, or 2.4 per cent, to $59.25 in after-hours trading.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said in the statement: “FedEx will exceed previous earnings guidance in the second quarter primarily due to better-than-expected growth in FedEx International Priority and FedEx Ground volumes, coupled with the benefits of our continuing cost control programmes. Year-over-year growth in our US overnight express and FedEx International Priority services increased each month during the quarter, aided by inventory restocking and …successful sales efforts.”Mr Graf said demand for international services had “improved significantly” since the first quarter.FedEx will report its complete second-quarter results on December 17.FedEx reported net profits of $181m, or 58 cents a share, last quarter, a 53 per cent drop from a year ago. Total revenue slipped 20 per cent to $8bn.
311;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-11-11T22:33:43Z;Wall Street hits fresh highs for the year;;Wall Street hit fresh highs for the year on Wednesday after positive surprises from a luxury homebuilder and an armoured-tank manufacturer added to rising investor optimism.Production data from China showing that factory output had hit a 19-month high in October lifted commodity-based stocks, pushing United States Steel3.2 per cent higher to $39.30.Comments from Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday about the weakness of the economic recovery also left investors more confident that interest rates would be maintained at their low levels for a longer period.On light volumes, the S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent higher at 1,098.51, its highest level since October last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up for the sixth session in a row, gaining 0.4 per cent to 10,291.26. The Nasdaq rose 0.7 per cent to 2,166.90.“We’re seeing more productivity overseas but the main thing that’s driving the market today is the Fed,” said Doug Roberts of Channelcapitalresearch.com. “They indicated that they’re going to keep rates fairly low and that’s what people are looking for. The government is the lender of last resort and as long as the stimulus programmes continue then there’s plenty of liquidity. A weaker dollar is also fuelling the whole market.”Toll Brothers, the largest luxury homebuilder in the US, surprised the market by announcing that fourth-quarter revenues would only drop 30 per cent and would come in more than $100m above analysts’ estimates. The Pennsylvania-based builder also said that net contracts for the quarter had risen 42 per cent, raising hopes that the housing market is beginning to stabilise. Shares in the group climbed 16.4 per cent to $21.41.Shares of United Parcel Service, the world’s largest package delivery service, gained 2.2 per cent to $58.07 after its chief executive, Scott Davis, told Reuters that he expected volume to grow next year and would also increase shipping rates. Last week, the group said that it was looking to emerging markets and the healthcare sector for acquisitions in order to bolster its supply-chain and freight-forwarding units.On Tuesday, FedEx, the second-largest player in the market, also forecast a rise in shipments in the run-up to Christmas as shoppers spend more money and business deliveries begin to pick up. FedEx shares were up 0.5 per cent at $82.50, leaving them 7 per cent higher this week.Oshkosh, the speciality vehicle manufacturer, said that it had received a $438m order for an additional 1,000 blast-proof trucks from the US military, sending its shares up 3.2 per cent to $40.25. The trucks are designed for use in Afghanistan, where the military can’t use the vehicles it normally deploys in Iraq because of the poor quality of the roads.Microchip Technologies gave a boost to the Nasdaq after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “neutral” and removed it from its sell list, saying the company was beginning to address gaps in its portfolio. The shares were up 1.9 per cent at $26.71.However, shares in Nucryst Pharmaceuticals surged the most on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, rising 70 per cent to $1.70 after Smith & Nephew, a medical technology company, agreed to buy the drugmaker’s assets for about $21m.The wider market also managed to shrug off a series of disappointing corporate results on Wednesday.Macy’s fell 8.1 per cent at $17.86 after the department store chain reported a third-quarter loss and gave a full-year profit forecast below expectations. However, its net loss narrowed to $35m from $44m a year earlier due to stronger sales at it Bloomingdale’s stores and online.Shares in Tyson Foods, the world’s largest meat producer, slipped 1.1 per cent to $13.04 after JPMorgan cut its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “overweight” due to increased corn and hog prices and pressure from rivals.Simmons First National, the financial holding company, priced its public offering of 2.65m common shares at a discount to their closing price on Tuesday. Shares in the Arkansas-based group fell 4.2 per cent to $24.52
312;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-10-09T22:19:45Z;Royal Mail hires temporary staff;;Royal Mail is recruiting hundreds of temporary staff at special sorting centres in an effort to keep services going in the face of national strikes threatened by 121,000 postal workers.The move comes as online retailers and other businesses step up plans to switch to alternative delivery services if strikes by the Communication Workers Union go ahead. These could start by the end of the month if talks fail to resolve the dispute, which revolves around changes to working conditions.Manpower, the recruitment company, is appointing 400 workers at a sorting office in Dartford, Kent, for the three months to Christmas. Demand is so high that recruits are being told they can start straight after their initial interview, assuming they pass security checks.The CWU believes other sites are being created at Bristol, Peterborough and elsewhere as Royal Mail brings forward by more than a month part of its usual plan to recruit 20,000 seasonal workers to cope with Christmas demand.Royal Mail says it has reduced the backlog caused by regional strikes, mainly in London, from 9m to 4m letters and parcels, by using the Dartford centre and drafting in managers and other staff to handle sorting and deliveries.But the CWU claims the backlog is still 20m and adds that it would be harder for Royal Mail to keep post moving in a national stoppage because it would be less able to switch managers between regions.A Royal Mail spokesman said: “Royal Mail is focused on delivering a great Christmas, as well as on minimising any delays to mail caused by the CWU’s irresponsible campaign of local strike action, and, as we do every year, we are setting up special sorting facilities to help us manage the volumes of mail. These are staffed by Royal Mail people, including managers and the fully vetted agency staff we always employ in the run up to the Christmas period.”Post-Switch, a broker that arranges postal deals for clients, estimates that a quarter of Royal Mail’s 100 biggest customers, including banks and utilities, are talking to rival operators.For letters, there are limited benefits from switching because, though private operators have one-third of the market for collecting and sorting, almost all use Royal Mail for final delivery. The state operator still delivers more than 99 per cent of letters.But large retailers such as Amazon – which is preparing contingency measures – have a wider choice for delivering packets. They can turn to courier-type services run by companies like Home Delivery Network, UPS, TNT and DHL. This hurts Royal Mail because packets are more profitable than letters and the state operator has identified them as important to its future.
313;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;UPS focus turns towards tighter supply links;;The raised crane booms at the ports of China’s Pearl River Delta are a sign of the behind-the-scenes drama in global outsourcing.The booms have often been raised out of use since early in 2008, when the Chinese authorities launched a crackdown on labour standards in the area, which had been the first beneficiary of China’s manufacturing boom. Production, and port activity in coastal cities such as Shenzhen, shifted to elsewhere on China’s coast or even to other countries.Such shifts have become more frequent and more dramatic, according to Daniel Brutto, president of the international business of UPS, the US parcel delivery and freight forwarding business, since the world economic downturn forced many companies worldwide to re-examine their supply-chain costs.Speaking during a visit to London, Mr Brutto says companies are becoming increasingly discriminating both about which of their products needs to be sourced where, and how they travel to their destination.There are increasing concerns about manufacturing being based in a single site in China and the dominance of air freight for transporting whole categories of some consumer goods.The changes have come about partly due to a rise in the low wages in China that initially helped to make it what Mr Brutto calls “the factory of the world”. Some companies have simply sought out a cheaper base.“Where we see them going is Vietnam,” Mr Brutto says. “Certainly, that’s a big area. We don’t see as much of India, but there’s a start to that, and even [to] Pakistan.”With the outsourcing of more valuable goods, such as internet routers and medical devices, there is some “near-sourcing” – migration of production to low-cost centres near the main consumer centres of western Europe and North America.Such “near-shoring” could help companies by letting them hold less stock and be more responsive to changing trends than is possible with production in China.“You have some companies setting up in Mexico to feed the United States or, central Europe to feed western Europe,” Mr Brutto says. “It was a much greater phenomenon when oil was $150 a barrel because the fuel surcharge [from ship and aircraft operators] was almost wiping out the labour-cost arbitrage.”Other companies are moving the manufacturing of their most sophisticated products to the most developed economies, he adds. They fear their intellectual property rights might be at risk elsewhere.However, the biggest trend Mr Brutto identifies is a differentiation between how companies are treating similar products of different values. Some fashion goods might need to be made close to customers, but others might not.“If I’m going to manufacture gym shoes and I know that, if I can get it down to the right price point, it’s just going to be a consumable, I’m going to try to get that from the lowest-cost area I can,” Mr Brutto says. It would, however, make less sense to go around the world to make a customised gym shoe.For other goods, the key issue might be how quickly – and how expensive it would be – to move them to market, even if they are still made far away.Mr Brutto uses the example of a maker of hard disks whose cheapest product has predictable sales patterns, but sells at low profit margins. Until recently, it was expensively air-freighted to its market in line with the company’s policy of keeping inventories small to reduce costs. That logic has now been re-examined.“If you can predict your cycle, you can use ocean shipping and reduce your cost to the point where the increase in inventory will be offset by the decrease in transportation costs,” Mr Brutto says.However, the most sophisticated case he describes involves a maker of laptops. Its calculations illustrate the minute detail in which many companies are now seeking new supply-chain efficiencies.The company scrapped a policy of flying laptops to market – complete with product manuals, batteries and cables.“Now they’re saying: ‘Maybe I don’t need to fly everything’,” Mr Brutto says. “The thing you really need to turn over fast is the computer. But, if you standardise the cables and produce the documentation near the customer, you can put the cables on the ocean.”
314;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-09-17T21:32:05Z;FedEx bullish on delivery demand;;FedEx on Thursday declared that a global economic recovery was under way, which it said would fuel demand for the company’s package deliveries.The forecast came as the US logistics company, considered a bellwether for the US economy, said that quarterly results had exceeded its own expectations, reflecting corporate America’s optimism for the immediate future.Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive, had called FedEx’s last fiscal year, which ended in June, “the most difficult economic conditions that the modern world has seen since the end of world war two.”The large logistics companies – FedEx, UPS and Deutsche Post DHL, which are considered bellwethers for global trade – all suffered during the past year as the global downturn took hold.However, by the end of the summer, Mr Smith said on Thursday, conditions had improved.“The economy was slightly better during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and confidence appears to be improving,” said Mr Smith said during a conference call with analysts.“The housing sector seems to have bottomed and auto sales have picked up.”The package-delivery company predicted US gross domestic product would expand by 3 per cent this quarter, then 4.9 per cent in the last three months of the year. US GDP will grow at a 2.9 per cent pace next year.“More importantly,” Mr Smith said, “industrial production – a significant driver of FedEx’s business – should improve more than 4 per cent in 2010, a strong contrast to its 10 per cent decline in 2009.”FedEx reported net profit of $181m, or 58 cents a share, in its first fiscal quarter, a 53 per cent drop from the $384m, or $1.23, the Memphis-based company earned a year ago.Total revenue slipped 20 per cent to $8bn.FedEx’s express-delivery business earned $104m, down 70 per cent, on sales of $4.9bn. The ground-shipment arm reported a 7 per cent increase in operating income, to $209m from $196m. Revenue fell 2 per cent to $1.73bn.The company’s shares slipped 3.1 per cent to $75.79 by midday trading in New York, paring much of the gains they had made since FedEx disclosed its per-share results in a preliminary report a week ago.Its 59-cent profit exceeded the 30-45 cent range FedEx predicted in June. The company also reiterated its second-quarter profit forecast of 65-95 cents a share. FedEx earned $1.58 a share in the same period a year earlier.The company plans to raise its shipping rates in January by an average of 5.9 per cent for US domestic and export services, while trimming its fuel surcharge by 2 percentage points.

Japan Airlines will be the senior partner in any deal, with $2bn of cargo revenues – more than twice that of Nippon Yusen Kaisha. Its operating income for international cargo in the quarter to end-June more than halved, year-on-year, the steepest fall of any business segment. For NYK, air cargo has always been marginal, and with expected recurring losses this financial year of $234m, on sales of $565m, it is a business it can do without. Cost synergies could be significant, perhaps $200m, if both sides retain an interest in the merged business. But plucking out these problem assets and fobbing them off to greater fools would instantly boost earnings per share.For airlines, making money from air cargo has never been easy or a particularly high priority. Stuffing electronics, food and textiles on passenger flights is a commoditised service that most offer not because they want to, but because – with wide-body aircraft with masses of belly room – they would be mad not to. Many also operate dedicated freighters, but struggle to compete with the likes of FedEx and UPS for urgent, high-margin business. And when it comes to ordinary bulk cargoes, the freighters are selling on the basis that they are quicker than a container ship. That’s hardly compelling, when there is no rush for retailers to restock shelves.Until details of the deal emerge, Japan’s two largest air cargo operators will continue to take out capacity. Other airlines with deadweight freight divisions will study the tie-up with interest.Japan Airlines (JAL) and Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) announced on Friday that they have reached an agreement to begin negotiations involving a potential merger between their air cargo businesses.Through a major restructuring of the cargo business and by combining the strengths of the two largest cargo operators in Japan to form the biggest solitary Japanese cargo transport provider, JAL and NYK foresee being able to secure profitability and raise the value of both companies.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
316;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-07-23T20:34:36Z;Dow breaks 9,000 as US stocks soar;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 9,000 points on Thursday to a record high for the year as corporate profits continued to please US investors and drive stocks higher.Two pieces of takeover news also boosted confidence in the health of corporate America on another busy day of earnings news.Bristol-Myers Squibb, the drugmaker, easily beat profit estimates and raised its full-year outlook.The company also said it would buy smaller rival Medarex for $2.4bn, a deal it estimated would improve its earnings by 2-3 cents a share in 2009. Bristol-Myers rose 2.8 per cent to $20.86 and Medarex soared 89.2 per cent to $15.89.Amazon announced its expansion into the clothing sector with a $928m deal for privately-held Zappos.com, the online shoe retailer.
The shares rose 5.7 per cent to $93.87.Amazon’s rival Ebay further boosted market sentiment after sales and profits topped estimates. The shares climbed 10.6 per cent to $21.52.Two smaller healthcare companies added to Bristol-Myers’ gains, helping the sector outperform the broader market.Rival drugmaker Celgene jumped 18.6 per cent to $55.97 after it beat estimates for its profits and said a test showed that a blood cancer drug could be used earlier in a patients’ treatment than thought.Intuitive Surgical surged 26.8 per cent to $215.37 after profits that were 26 per cent better than analysts’ forecasts as sales of its robotic system for surgery easily beat expectations.Ford showed signs of strength from the US consumer as it reported a smaller operating loss and cash-burn rate than exppected. Its shares gained 9.4 per cent to $6.98.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.3 per cent up at 976.29, while the Dow rose 2.1 per cent to 9,069.29 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.5 per cent to 1,973.60.“The markets broke through a key resistance level,” said Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group. “Now the S&P can get to 1,100 before you get significant resistance.”But Richard Hughes, co-president of Portfolio Management Consultants, warned: “Much of this is fuelled by short covering. Some see signs of stabilisation in spending, but with the exception of tech stocks most companies have not seen revenue growth.”Economic data gave further fuel to the rally. The number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits unexpectedly fell and sales of existing homes rose more than expected.This helped homebuilders rally strongly as DR Horton climbed 7.6 per cent to $11.17 and Lennar gained 6 per cent to $11.26.But the session was dominated by earnings news, with two companies in particular boosting the Dow.Strong sales at 3M helped the maker of Post-It Notes easily beat revenue and profit expectations. The shares picked up 7.4 per cent to $69.43.AT&T, the telecoms company, also beat expectations, helped by strong sales of Apple’s iPhone, which in the US operates only on the AT&T network. The stock advanced 2.6 per cent to $25.48.But McDonald’s injected an element of caution as the restaurant group’s revenues missed Wall Street expectations and analysts warned that its results were a sign of continued weakness from the US consumer. McDonald’s shares fell
4.6 per cent to $56.09.Omnicom, the advertising conglomerate, and UPS, the parcel deliverer, experienced continuing declines in revenue and profits, suggesting business spending remained constrained.But both reversed early losses as the rally gathered steam and Omnicom closed up 0.4 per cent at $34.56 and UPS was 2.3 per cent higher at $53.51.There were mixed results from banks as both Huntington Bancshares and Fifth Third reported their earnings. Investors remain concerned over future write-offs from bad loans. Huntington more than tripling the reserves set aside for such losses and Fifth Third saw an 82 per cent rise in net charge-offs.Huntington fell 4.9 per cent to $3.73 but Fifth Third, which made a smaller operating loss than expected, jumped 14.3 per cent to $8.01."
317;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;UPS and D Post in gloomy outlook;;United Parcel Service and Deutsche Post DHL, two of the largest package-delivery companies, on Thursday warned investors that they had seen few signs that many of the world’s economies were emerging from a year-long downturn.The grim outlooks came as the logistics groups, considered bellwethers for global trade, reported sharp drops in quarterly profit. Cost cuts helped insulate both UPS and Deutsche Post from steeper declines.“Whether or not we’re at the bottom is not the main issue,” Scott Davis, UPS chief executive, said Thursday. “What is important is how long we remain here and what type of recovery we have. Remember, all these indicators are still well in the negative territory, illustrating the challenges that lie ahead.”The economic downturn continued to weigh on many UPS and Deutsche Post businesses, from overnight deliveries and freight to logistics services.UPS’s net income plunged to $445m, or 44 cents a share, from $873m, or 85 cents, a year ago. Revenue slipped 17 per cent to $10.8bn, reflecting a steep decline in international deliveries.UPS employees worked fewer hours and the Atlanta-based company used its trucks and aircraft less frequently. The resulting pared costs cushioned the revenue drop. Operating expenses fell 14 per cent to $9.93bn.While UPS predicted its third-quarter profit would remain in the 45-55 cents per share range it had forecast for the second period, the outlook fell short of Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 60 cents.Deutsche Post said package volume declines might have “seen the bottom” in percentage terms. But it did not expect a substantial recovery in world trade in coming months and saw continued risks to customers and industries from insolvencies or extended factory closures.“We still don’t have a clear view of . . . further economic development,” said Frank Appel, chief executive. “Though economic conditions haven’t worsened, with new business bustling and our strong market position in Asia, we are not yet seeing any substantial improvement.”Compared with last year, underlying quarterly earnings fell 37.8 per cent as a result of the global economic crisis. Reported earnings before interest and tax fell from €366m to €109m while revenues fell 18 per cent to €11.1bn.Deutsche Post said annualised savings from a cost-cutting programme were €552m and expected to reach its €1bn target in a year’s time, six months ahead of schedule.“We view the results as promising and not negative . . . most business divisions surprised positively,” said Axel Funhoff, an ING analyst.
318;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-07-02T11:37:24Z;Improve service by spending on efficiency;;Service organisation are currently vulnerable to the eroding loyalty of hard-pressed consumers. If competitors offer a lower price, or your customer service slips, customers will jump ship.With consumer-driven sites such as Angie’s List, The Consumerist and Twitter letting anyone shout their complaints across the globe, negative comment in this internet age can cripple a customer base.So how does a service organisation keep its customers happy and cut costs without jeopardising service levels?A recent Forrester Research study suggests spending your way out of it, because customers are too important to lose. But where does the money for this advice come from?Investing in making processes more efficient is a good first step. As UPS learned, simply driving better routes can yield savings in fuel. Automating reporting and record keeping, or updating job statuses and dispatching new work in real time can also cut costs. So analyse and act – quickly.Organisations must also strive for fine-grained operational balance. Most businesses have a reasonable overall operational balance, with capacity just about sufficient to their workload. If you’re satisfied with this, look again and examine the fine detail.A big utility in California learned a lesson from this the hard way. When a customer called for service, the organisation was unable to co-ordinate essentials such as the availability of materials, equipment and field crews. Schedulers scrambled to put the resources in place to meet their commitments, frequently having to employ expensive subcontractors on short notice. Customer satisfaction fell when jobs were delayed, and the utility often faced financial penalties for late delivery of services. On the flip side, this lack of scheduling visibility led to periods of field crew inactivity as well, further eroding revenues.Few service businesses achieve a high level of fine-grained balance because it’s hard to do: a large part of the service workload is reactive, triggered by customer calls. There is no way to predict when a specific call will come. However, there are ways to predict the most likely composition of the work load for next day, week or month.Customer demand forecasting can improve resource capacity planning and enable organisations to improve customer service levels, while utilising budgets and resources effectively.Doing so will ensure organisations have just the right amount of technicians with the right skills to get the work done throughout the day, the month and the year. Failing to have that fine-grained balance can lead to high overtime costs, low utilisation, missed service level agreements and worst of all, an unhappy, nervous customer looking for any excuse to find a new provider.In the utility company example, the company solved its problem by modernising its workforce management system to automate intelligently all the workload demand forecasting, resource availability and scheduling parameters.Spending money saved them money. The new efficiency delivered quick returns on investment.So, while it is imperative that companies cut the cost of doing business, service organisations should find the right balance between saving money and keeping customers happy and loyal.For this, they need to find the right balance between forecasting and planning. Accurately predicting future workload and intelligently planning resources will strike these balances.Dr Moshe BenBassat is a specialist in optimisation and decision support software.
319;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-06-23T08:28:23Z;Alice.com;;"Remember creative destruction? One thing a recession is good for is giving the wheel of business development another kick. The launch this week of Alice.com, an online delivery service in the US backed by some of the largest manufacturers of consumer goods, may represent the latest disruptive blow to existing retailing models.Once it was efficient for local stores to deliver groceries around a neighbourhood. But as Wal-Mart and its competitors and imitators developed, sitting outside towns and having customers visit for regular large shopping trips turned out to be a cheaper alternative. The next spin aims to take that efficient approach another step and deliver dry goods – detergents, nappies, deodorants and the like – nationally to doorsteps for free via the trucks of courier service UPS.Others have tried before, with mixed results. Amazon sells a small amount of dry goods in bulk. Retailers have experimented with their own internet services. But Alice, which will sell individual items at Wal-Mart prices, works slightly differently to normal online stores. Light on capital, manufacturers will fund the stock of inventory. Alice will act merely as a co-ordinator of the logistics, sharing customer data with the consumer goods companies and trying to make money through advertising.That the toothpaste and detergent makers are willing to upset the big retailers by supporting the site reflects other shifts under way in the industry. Retailers are increasingly pushing their own brands, particularly as consumers trade down in the recession. And the rise of in-store marketing has shifted more power to the retailers. Pursuing a direct relationship with the consumer is, after all, the aim of most marketers. But if successful, another corner of the retail world threatens to disappear online.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

320;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-06-08T20:47:15Z;FedEx hits at UPS on union bill;;FedEx is taking aim at United Parcel Service for its role in pushing US legislation that would make it easier for express-delivery workers to organise with a multimedia campaign that links its arch rival to banks, carmakers and other recipients of government ­largesse.In advertisements and a website, FedEx argues that the measure would leave its air and ground delivery networks – and in turn the US economy – susceptible to costly disruptions and is tantamount to a “legislative bail-out” for UPS, which is subject to different bargaining rules and remains the largest employer of members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.“This is a bail-out, plain and simple, and the American people won’t stand for it,” FedEx says on its site, whose address, Brownbailout.com, takes a swipe at the UPS slogan, “What can Brown do for you?”The provision affecting FedEx is included in a bill authorising funding for the country’s aviation regulator. UPS, one of Washington’s most generous campaign contributors, has supported the measure, which was passed by the US House last month.The campaign is FedEx’s latest and most visible attempt to stop a bill that would strip the company’s express-delivery business from its right to bargain under the Railway Labour Act, which blocks workers at railroads and airlines from organising at a local level.UPS dismissed the FedEx effort as “noise”.“It would appear that FedEx is preparing to spend millions of dollars trying to convince Congress that a FedEx driver delivering a package is different somehow [from] a UPS driver delivering a package,” UPS said. “The packages aren’t delivered by airplanes, and we don’t believe FedEx can fool Congress about that.”FedEx must now wait to see if the Senate includes a provision on its bargaining status in its version of the authorisation bill. Even if it does not, the House and Senate could reach a compromise that affected the company’s RLA status.A similar bill was passed by the US House in 2007 but failed to come before a vote in the Senate, leading Congress to extend the life of a Federal Aviation Authority Reauthorisation law, which sets policy on FAA funds and how the agency can tax air carriers for two years.FedEx has said its express business fits the description of the kind of integrated transportation system Congress sought to protect from disruption, and points to a US circuit court decision that supports its case.“It is extremely bad public policy,” Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, said in December. “FedEx Express has been a Railway Labour Act carrier since its inception. It was one of the key elements in the formation of the company.”FedEx also made a recent order of 15 Boeing 777 aircraft contingent on its continued exemptions under the Railway Labour Act.In an unrelated statement, UPS said its pilots agreed to concessions that will help the company avoid as many as 300 absences.
321;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-05-28T22:58:22Z;Microsoft’s Bing has positive buzz;;"Microsoft is taking aim at Google’s core business with Bing, its new search engine.Initial reviews around the web are positive. CNET said, “in search presentation, Bing wins.” Geekword said it was not just renamed Live Search, but rather “a significant upgrade that contains new features and a new interface and is considered as a decision engine.” But Search Engine Land made it clear that, “no, Bing is not a ‘Google Killer.’”FT reporter Joe Menn attended Bing’s unveiling at the D7 conference, and filed this report:Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer gave an impressive demonstration of the company’s improved search engine, rebranded as “Bing,” at a technology conference in Carlsbad California.The latest effort in a years-long struggle to stay relevant in a market where it is a distant No. 3 behind Google and Yahoo, Bing brings far more relevant information onto the front page of results by pulling more from what otherwise would be searchers’ likely destinations.In a striking example, searches for major company names returned at the top of the results page not just a link to the official website of those companies but the customer service phone numbers, which are often deliberately buried on corporate sites. It worked for UPS, Amazon and Microsoft itself.Categories of searches that Bing recognizes as such return a set of useful tabs along with the traditional list of possibly interesting links. For a musician, there are tabs for tickets, lyrics, fan clubs and biographical information. For a city, tabs include attractions, events, and hotels. For a consumer electronics product, there is an automated rating based on a survey of opinions on the Web.A search for an airline flight number displays the projected arrival time and airport gate number. Searching for flight routes in general returns a projection on whether ticket prices are likely to rise or fall.Hovering over a link in any search results previews that page in a small box; hovering over the thumbnail picture representing a video in a video search starts that video playing."
322;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-04-23T21:33:46Z;Overview: Stocks falter over differing economic signals;;Conflicting signals on the health of the global economy and the banking sector sparked a divergence between US and European equities and failed to enhance the safety appeal of the dollar or the yen, while UK government bonds suffered from worries over supply.The figures on eurozone manufacturing and service-sector activity beat expectations and provided an early boost to investor risk appetite as they helped offset the International Monetary Fund’s cut to its growth forecast for the region. “The first signs of improvement in the eurozone business cycle are starting to emerge,” said Marco Valli, economist at UniCredit.“Today’s data contain some clearly positive news, particularly in manufacturing, that make us more confident that we will see an easing in the pace of recession starting from the second quarter.”Eurozone industrial orders declined in February, “but showed signs of stabilisation”, according to Barclays Capital.The more positive view was further encouraged by better than forecast French business confidence data and a slightly better tone to the latest industrial trends survey from the CBI, the UK employers’ organisation.Good news also came on the banking front as first-quarter profits at Credit Suisse easily beat expectations and Barclays in the UK pledged to resume dividend payments in the second half of this year.Japanese investors managed to shrug off local press reports that Nomura would report a record annual loss due to the cost of buying up operations from collapsed investment bank Lehman Brothers.The more confident mood in Europe then faltered as US labour and housing market data failed to impress. Continued jobless claims reached a fresh record high last week, while sales of existing homes fell by 3 per cent last month.“Sharply lower mortgage rates are still failing to convince people to step back into the housing market,” said Dimitry Fleming, economist at ING.The mood was also dented by a poor outlook statement from United Parcel Service – often considered a bellwether of the US economy – and equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic turned lower early in New York.But, the S&P 500 subsequently rallied in late trade and closed up 1 per cent, after the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gave up an early advance to finish 0.4 per cent lower.Asian markets, had staged a modest rebound following recent losses. The Nikkei 225 Average rose 1.4 per cent, while Hong Kong climbed 2.3 per cent.Credit markets outperformed equities, with the investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index down 3 basis points at 152bp and its US counterpart, the Markit CDX North America index, down 3.5bp at 180bp.Government bonds were divergent. After a weak start US Treasury prices rallied after a well received sale of five-year inflation bonds.The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell 2bp to 2.93 per cent, after rising above 2.98 per cent in early trade amid concerns about the level of new supply coming to the market next week.Issuance worries did weigh on UK gilts after the Budget on Wednesday. The Treasury will issue a record £220bn of securities this year – more than observers had expected.The yield on the 10-year gilt rose a further 9bp to a seven-week high of 3.51 per cent after climbing 12bp in the previous session.In Germany, the yield on the 10-year Bund rose 1bp to 3.23 per cent.In the currency markets, the euro pushed above $1.31, boosted by eurozone purchasing managers’ index data, while the dollar was undermined by the US housing and employment figures.The euro also gained ground against the yen as appetite for the “riskier” single currency was heightened by the early gains for Asian stocks.Sterling managed to rebound against the leading currencies after falling sharply following the Budget.In commodities, gold rose above $900 an ounce as the dollar weakened and the outlook for the US economy turned more uncertain.Copper fell back in line with losses for equities, while the benchmark US crude oil price rose to just below $50 a barrel. Brent crude also rose and closed above $50.
323;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-04-23T21:09:25Z;US shares struggle on economic news;;US stocks struggled for direction before ending higher on Thursday as investors reacted to quarterly earnings reports from companies including Apple and United Parcel Service and digested more disappointing economic news.UPS reported quarterly profits that missed analysts’ estimates and forecast no quick turnaround as the global economic downturn continued to take its toll on the world’s largest package delivery group.Its quarterly net income fell by 56 per cent, from $906m a year earlier to $401m. Its shares fell 2.6 per cent to $53.33. Shares in its main competitor, FedEx, which like UPS has been on a cost-cutting drive, rose 3.4 per cent to $55.04.In contrast, Apple said after the market closed on Wednesday that its profit had risen 15 per cent to $1.21bn, or $1.33 a share, compared with forecasts of $1.08. Its shares closed 3.2 per cent higher at $125.40 in spite of a relatively downbeat forecast for the current quarter, with revenues estimated at $7.7bn-$7.9bn and earnings at $0.95-$1 a share.The previous session had ended lower with leading indices giving up an earlier rally, leaving some analysts to express doubt about the sustainability of the rebound. A late sell-off in the financial sector had erased gains made during a choppy trading day on Wall Street.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 1 per cent higher at 851.92 points while the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,652.21 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7.957.06 points.The CBOE’s Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was down 2.5 per cent at 37.15 and remains significantly below highs of approaching 90 reached last year, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Disappointing economic news also weighed on stocks with a weekly report on jobless claims saying the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance in the week ending April 18 rose by 27,000 to a higher than expected 640,000, while continuing claims crept up again to a new record high.The pace of sales of existing homes in the US fell 3 per cent in March to a sharply lower-than-expected 4.57m unit annual rate, according to the National Association of Realtors.Shares ended higher led by late gains for banks and companies involved in the credit card business. These moved higher after senior executives from the industry met with President Barack Obama. Representatives from banks including Wells Fargo, Visa, JPMorgan, MasterCard and Visa, were among those at the meetings. Wells Fargo shares rose 10.5 per cent to $20.09 while Capital One shares rose 17.7 per cent to $16.93.The earnings season is in full swing with many reports issued before the bell on Thursday and several more due after the close. Before the open, Hershey and Raytheon posted better-than-expected results. Shares in Hershey rose 3.9 per cent to $37.45 while Raytheon rose 5.9 per cent to $43.72.Fifth Third Bancorp shares rose 3.5 per cent to $3.82 after it also beat analyst expectations, posting a smaller than expected loss.Boutique investment bank KBW swung to a first-quarter profit on lower costs that offset declines in commissions and investment-banking revenue.Shares in the company advanced 2.6 per cent to $24.87.SunTrust Banks shares fell 3.3 per cent to $14.89 after it swung to a $714.8m first-quarter loss, hurt by real-estate and mortgage investments and ”recession-related costs” as it boosted reserves for bad loans. PNC Financial Services’ shares rose 7.5 per cent to $40.93 as first-quarter profits came in well ahead of expectations. Microsoft, American Express and Amgen were due to report after the closing bell last night. Microsoft shares moved 1.2 per cent lower to $18.54.The exchange sector was in focus as profits at the CME Group operator of the world’s largest futures exchange, plunged by 30 per cent in the first three months of the year from the same period in 2008.But in spite of this, CME shares rose 9.4 per cent, to $239 leading other exchanges groups higher.Shares in NYSE Euronext were up 13.7 per cent at $23.37 while Nasdaq OMXshares rose 3.3 per cent.
324;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-04-23T13:45:14Z;UPS profits tumble by 56%;;United Parcel Service reported on Thursday a quarterly profit that missed analysts’ estimates and forecast no quick turnaround as the global economic downturn continued to take its toll on the world’s largest package-delivery company.UPS’s quarterly net income fell by 56 per cent, dropping to $401m in the first quarter of 2009 from $906m a year earlier. Revenues fell 13.7 per cent to $10.9bn from $12.7bn a year before.Delivery companies such as UPS, FedEx and DHL have been under severe pressure during the economic downturn as businesses and consumers send fewer packages. Diluted earnings per share at FedEx, which reported its prior quarters results last month, fell to 31 cents, compared with $1.26 for the same quarter a year earlier. And decreases in demand forced DHL out of the US domestic market at the end of January.Adjusted earnings per share were 52 cents, missing analysts’ estimates of 56 cents a share. Including a non-cash charge related to the earlier than expected retirement of aging aircraft, diluted earnings per share were 40 cents.The company saw broad losses across its domestic and international businesses. Even after rival DHL left the US domestic market, volumes declined 4.3 per cent. During its conference call with analysts the company said it expected to continue to look for opportunities from DHL’s exit from the market.New investments in China, Europe and Puerto Rico helped offset declines in international volume, which fell 1 per cent.The company saw no quick turn around, forecasting that earnings per diluted share would fall in a range of 45 cents to 55 cents in the second quarter. The company expects that revenues in all markets, except for China and Poland, will fall over the next quarter.”Economic indicators tell us recovery in the US might begin late this year, but more likely not until 2010,” said Kurt Kuehn, UPS’s chief financial officer. ”So we expect the second quarter will be another difficult one.”UPS, along with rival FedEx, have both unveiled a series of cost-cutting measures to combat the downturn in their revenues. UPS has cut 10,000 employees from its US workforce and operating expenses, excluding fuel, have been slashed by 10 per cent.”As economic activity deteriorated throughout the world during the quarter, we managed costs while maintaining our excellent service to our customers,” said Scott Davis, UPS chief executive .
325;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-04-17T18:16:07Z;D Post ends co-operation talks with UPS;;Deutsche Post DHL has abandoned plans to enlist United Parcel Service to help with its troubled US operations, bringing to an end co-operation talks between two of the world’s biggest logistics companies.Deutsche Post is also to shut its DHL hub in the US – putting thousands of jobs at risk – and move to a smaller site as a consequence of its decision to curtail most of its US express business to stem years of losses.The German group had proposed cutting costs in the US through an estimated $1bn annual contract with UPS – an arch-rival – through which the US company would provide express air services for DHL.But Deutsche Post later decided to take even more of an axe to its DHL US express business, abandoning all intra-US operations and cutting volumes by 90 per cent.UPS had acknowledged this year that prospects for a deal had grown slimmer because of the change in Deutsche Post’s plans.“It is true that UPS and DHL have mutually agreed to terminate their negotiations,” a spokesman for UPS said Friday.The company is to publish its first-quarter results next week.Deutsche Post said on Friday: “The size and scope of the planned agreement with UPS was adjusted to reflect the lower shipment volumes . . . However, we have not been able to come to a conclusive agreement that is acceptable to both parties.”The company is expected instead to rely on existing agreements with Astar, in which it is a shareholder, and ABX Air.As a foreign company, Deutsche Post was not allowed directly to own air services in the US.The German company’s plans for US cuts became a controversial issue during the US election campaign – in particular the threat they posed to the town of Wilmington, DHL’s hub in the politically important state of Ohio.Deutsche Post has now told staff at Wilmington that DHL will return by late summer to its mothballed former base at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky (CVG) airport, which has a smaller parcel capacity in line with the reduced US operations.DHL will employ about 1,000 at CVG and said all staff from Wilmington would be offered jobs at the new hub, about 60 miles away. Wilmington’s hub employs about 8,000 from DHL and other companies, including about 2,750 at ABX Air.“CVG, which served as DHL’s international hub and gateway for over 20 years previously, will be more cost effective for handling the company’s international express shipping volumes, and is expected to improve DHL’s long-term financial position,” the company said.Restructuring costs in the US would amount to $3.9bn – double the previous estimate – Deutsche Post said last year.
326;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-03-25T20:13:55Z;UPS versus FedEx;;"Unions are advocating passage of the Employee Free Choice Act, which would remove the requirement for an anonymous vote on whether a company’s workforce should unionise.Employers’ groups have argued workers would be intimidated by labour leaders if votes were held in the open and decided by a simple majority signing a card.The AFL-CIO union federation argues the so-called “card check” law is needed and accuses some companies of pressing staff not to support foundation of a union.A marketing war has erupted between unions and employers’ groups, both sides buying hours of television adverts. Wal-Mart, the country’s biggest retailer, was downgraded by Citigroup on the mere prospect of the bill becoming law, with the broker warning of a steep rise in costs.In January, FedEx ordered 30 Boeing 777s contingent on a piece of union friendly legislation failing. A provision in a House bill to set funding for the Federal Aviation Administration would, if passed, free workers at FedEx’s express-deliver business to organise at local level. Congress passed the act to help ensure localised strikes by railroad and airline employees would not disrupt transportation. The FAA bill would strip FedEx of a similar protection.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

327;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-03-10T23:34:10Z;US companies pull out of retirement contributions;;"A wave of US companies are suspending payments to their staff 401(k) retirement plans in a bid to cut costs amid the economic downturn.Saks, General Motors, newspaper group McClatchy, clothing company J.Crew, FedEx, UPS, Coca-Cola Bottling, Reader’s Digest, Motorola, Regions Financial and Sprint Nextel are among the growing list of companies which have suspended contributions in recent months.Even the AARP, the influential advocacy group formerly known as the American Association for Retired Persons, will suspend contributions to its staff 401(k) plan from March 22 for the rest of the year.The growing number of suspensions appears to strike a blow against the viability of 401(k) plans, which were introduced 30 years ago as the main way that Americans should save for retirement, replacing defined benefit pension plans. Companies typically offered to match employee contributions up to 5 per cent of annual salary.The average 401(k) plan at the end of 2007 held about $65,000, but half of them held less than $19,000, according to a trade group, the Investment Companies Institute. They would hold much less today because of stock market falls. The suspensions mean that individuals can continue to contribute to their plans, but their companies will not.Adam Sohn, a spokesman for AARP, said his organisation, which has 40m members aged 50 and over, had fully matched staff contributions up to 3 per cent of annual salary.“We have taken a temporary suspension for the remainder of the year to help with cost containment measures,” he said. The AARP, whose revenue comes in part from investment income, also offers its 2,400 staff a defined benefit pension plan.In recent months, companies have also become increasingly less likely to enrol new workers automatically in their 401(k) plan, citing the costs as the main
reason, according to a study by Hewitt Associates, a human resources consultancy.“The continued bleak economic outlook is forcing many companies to make difficult decisions with respect to their retirement benefits,” said Pamela Hess, Hewitt’s director of retirement research, said in the study.Hewitt estimated that only 5 per cent of large companies would halt 401(k) contributions in 2009, but that could rise to more than 10 per cent in the next 12 to 18 months."
328;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-02-26T20:32:43Z;Deutsche Post disappoints;;"Now does not look a good time for the British government to proceed with politically touchy plans to sell 30 per cent of Royal Mail. Echoing comments last week from the Netherlands’ TNT – seen as a potential Royal Mail buyer – that 2009 is proving grim for the logistics industry, Deutsche Post reported a fourth-quarter net loss and hacked its dividend by a third.With volumes falling, Europe’s largest postal operator politely declined to give specific 2009 guidance, except to say that it expected underlying earnings to fall. Deutsche Post’s shares, down 20 per cent in the previous two weeks, fell another 6 per cent yesterday.The loss related to the group’s partial strategic retreat from its unprofitable US express business. But the real shock was the dividend cut from €0.90 to €0.60, in spite of hints from senior managers that it was probably safe. Admittedly, the postal group is paying this from reserves. But it closed the sale of 22.9 per cent of Deutsche Postbank to Deutsche Bank on Wednesday: having received total cash of €4.2bn, it is virtually debt-free. Reducing the dividend hardly signals underlying confidence.Look at the business environment, however, and a confidence crisis is understandable. Sharp demand falls in the fourth quarter have deepened, hitting all regions and most sectors, Deutsche Post said. It expects volumes to decline through the first half and perhaps beyond. Most worrying are shrinking sales in the cash-generative core mail division, hit by falling demand for direct marketing as businesses slash budgets. At 7.9 times this year’s forecast earnings, Deutsche Post’s multiple is close to TNT’s. Both are at sizeable discounts to UPS and FedEx, boosted by hopes of an earlier US recovery. Given the uncertain global outlook, the UK government should take heed of European caution before banking on the postal service to ring up even half-decent privatisation receipts.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

329;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-02-10T01:13:05Z;Return of bill heightens union threat to FedEx;;"FedEx this week faces the return of a bill that could escalate a lobbying war with organised labour and rival United Parcel Service.US congressmen plan to reintroduce legislation this week that would authorise funding for the country’s aviation regulator, containing a provision that targets only one company, FedEx, and its ability to keep more of its express delivery employees from organising.If the bill succeeds, the provision would strip the company’s express delivery division of its rights to bargain under the Railway Labor Act, meaning the company could no longer block FedEx Express workers from organising at a local level.Such a reversal would leave the business more susceptible to strikes and could drive up labour costs.FedEx argues that local labour actions could disrupt its air and ground delivery network and, in turn, the country’s economy.United Parcel Service, founded as a ground-based courier, has not enjoyed the same treatment as FedEx, because the original exemption covers railways and airlines. FedEx was founded as an airline.UPS has been pushing for the exemption to be scrapped for many years.A similar bill passed the US House in 2007 but failed to come before a vote in the Senate, leading Congress to extend the life of an existing Federal Aviation Authority Reauthorisation law, which sets policy on FAA funds and how the agency may tax air carriers for two years.The current extension expires at the end of March.Jim Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who chairs the House transportation and infrastructure committee, will unveil the bill before Wednesday’s scheduled hearing, a committee spokesman said.Some analysts and investors predict that the FedEx provision stands a better chance of surviving during the current Congress, and with a Democrat in the White House.“With the exception of the pilots’ union, FedEx has been very successful at holding off unions,” Tom Wadewitz, a JPMorgan Chase analyst, wrote in a November note to clients.“We believe the risk of unionisation would increase significantly if FedEx Express was moved out of [the Railway Labour Act]”.FedEx has argued that the express business fits the description of the kind of integrated transportation system Congress sought to protect from disruption, and points to a US circuit court decision that supports its case.“It is extremely bad public policy,” Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, said in December.“FedEx Express has been a Railway Labor Act carrier since its inception. It was one of the key elements in the formation of the company.“We would hope that that provision would not see the light of day.”●
FedEx said on Monday it would cut about 900 jobs at 130 facilities, citing unprecedented economic conditions and aggressive pricing by carriers."
330;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-02-03T21:39:33Z;US stocks rally on pharmaceuticals;;US stocks advanced for the first time in four sessions on Tuesday as strong performances among consumer and health care stocks helped offset more selling in the financial sector.A batch of better-than-expected results reassured investors that the performances of at least some companies during the recession may not be quite as bad as feared.Well received figures from Merck and Schering Plough sent shares in the pharmaceutical group and drugmaker up 6.4 per cent to $30.24 and 8.2 per cent to $18.91, respectively.That helped lift the health care sector 2.4 per cent overall.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 1.6 per cent to 838.51, paring its loss for the year so far to 7.2 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.8 per cent higher at 8,078.36 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.5 per cent stronger at 1,516.30.The market drifted between positive and negative territory early in the day, but found momentum in early afternoon.The battered shares of US housebuilders were among the biggest winners after the National Association of Realtors reported a 6.3 per cent rise in its gauage of pending home sales in December, albeit helped by lower prices.The sector rallied 11.8 per cent overall. DR Horton, however, escaped the gains after disclosing another quarterly loss that was at least not as bad as feared. Still, the shares dipped 2.2 per cent to $4.04.The market rally was wide-ranging and took in all sectors other than financials.Even UPS – whose results are often considered a proxy for the broader US economy – found positive territory despite results that missed Wall Street estimates. The shares rose 6.1 per cent to $45 as traders welcomed nevertheless welcomed a return to profitability.Bucking the generally positive momentum in the telecoms sector, Motorola shed 11 per cent to $4.04 after the group disclosed a fourth-quarter loss and said it would suspend its quarterly dividend.Motorola reported the quarterly loss versus a year-ago profit on weaker sales, although both earnings and sales results topped analysts’ expectations.The share price falls came as the telecoms company also warned that it would post a bigger-than-expected first-quarter loss, that it is suspending its dividend and that it is in search of a chief financial officer.SanDisk, off 23.2 per cent at $8.66, escaped the gains in the technology sector on a disappointing outlook.Meanwhile, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, eased 5.3 per cent at 43.1.Ian Griffiths, dealer at CMC Markets, said: “All eyes are still firmly focused on the non-farm payrolls for later this week and until then we may see the major US indices struggle for direction.”Energy stocks, up 1.9 per cent, tracked the oil price slightly higher, while materials rose 2 per cent.Dow Chemical rallied 2.7 per cent to $11.35 despite downbeat figures.Plunging car sales, however, hurt sentiment. Ford nevertheless rallied 4.3 per cent to $1.96, while General Motors dipped 1.4 per cent to $2.85.Despite the gains elsewhere, financials lost 2.5 per cent overall amid concerns over Washington’s plans to shore up the sector. Regional banks came under particular pressure, down 7.7 per cent overall.Citigroup issued its first progress report on how it was spending the $45bn it received in government funds. The bank said it had approved the use of $36.5bn to issue mortgages, make credit card loans and buy troubled assets. Shares in Citigroup, which have fallen by almost 50 per cent so far this year, were 5.2 per cent lower on Tuesday at $3.46.Bank of America and JP Morgan lost 11.7 per cent to $5.30 and 4.6 per cent to $24.05, respectively.Job losses were announced by companies including PNC Financial, which reported a big fourth-quarter loss and said it was cutting 5,800 jobs.PNC shares fell 7.2 per cent to $29.85Elsewhere, Lockheed Martin boosted its target bonus for chairman and chief executive Robert Stevens, according to a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Shares in the company edged 0.9 per cent higher to $79.90
331;UPS;United Parcel Service;2009-02-03T18:06:13Z;UPS offers gloomy outlook;;United Parcel Service, the world’s largest parcel delivery company, missed Wall Street’s quarterly profits estimates on Tuesday and gave investors little reason to expect a recovery this year.“The severe decline in economic activity around the world resulted in sharply lower package and freight volumes for UPS,” Scott Davis, chief executive, said. “Consequently, we’re making the tough decisions necessary to adapt our enterprise to today’s realities.”The company also cast doubt on striking an accord to airlift packages within the US for Deutsche Post’s DHL, which is withdrawing from the domestic market to cut losses.“We’re finding it increasingly difficult to reach an agreement,” Kurt Kuehn, finance chief, told the Financial Times.While its bleak outlook echoed a forecast by rival FedEx, which last month called the downturn “the worst economic conditions in the company’s 35-year operating history”, UPS also predicted the market would stabilise as the year progressed.The company’s shares jumped 6.3 per cent to $45.08 in midday trading on Tuesday.UPS will look to offset the slowdown by consolidating air and package-handling operations, freezing managers’ salaries and suspending matching contributions to employees’ retirement-savings accounts. The efforts will shed more than $500m in annual costs, Mr Kuehn said. The company has also trimmed capital expenses by $400m.UPS reported net income of $254m, or 25 cents a share, in the fourth quarter. That compared with a net loss of $2.63bn, or $2.52, for the same period a year ago, when the company took a $6.1bn charge to withdraw some employees from a pension plan following its new contract with the main union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.Excluding one-time charges in the most-recent quarter, UPS’s profit fell to $829m, or 83 cents a share, missing Wall Street’s average estimate.Revenue fell 5.2 per cent to $12.7bn from $13.4bn. US package volume, which usually tracks at or slightly above growth in the nation’s gross domestic product, slipped 4.4 per cent during the quarter.The Atlanta-based company predicted it would earn 52-68 cents a share in the first quarter – also less than analysts’ expectations, while declining to offer a forecast for the full year.“Since economists do not expect any meaningful recovery until 2010, earnings in 2009 will suffer,” Mr Kuehn said in a statement. “Lower volume levels and reductions in package weight will put further pressure on margins. We anticipate the first quarter will be weak, with slight improvements later in the year.”DHL’s decision to abandon the US market has complicated the company’s discussions with UPS, which had planned to ferry packages between US cities by aeroplane. While both sides agreed to narrow the scope of the venture to reflect DHL’s reduced presence, they have failed to reach an agreement.
332;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-12-09T21:54:47Z;Financials suffer losses as Wall St rally fades;;Financial stocks bore the brunt of the losses on Wall Street on Tuesday as a two-day rally fizzled out.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs dropped 8.2 per cent to $14.97 and 5.7 per cent to $72.77, respectively, amid nervousness of more write-downs ahead of fourth quarter earnings.KBW said their figures are “expected to be grim”. The broker cut its fourth quarter earnings forecast on Morgan Stanley from a profit to a loss of $0.19 a share.Fresh signs of stress in credit markets – the Treasury sold $30bn in four-week bills at zero per cent as investors fled to safety – added to the selling pressure. JPMorganfell 6.9 per cent to $33.96. Bank of New York Mellon was among several regional banks to sustain heavy losses, down10.2 per cent to $27.63.Discount brokers were in focus after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of the sector with a “neutral” view. “Client activity could retract significantly in 2009,” Goldman said. OptionsXpress lost 8.5 per cent to $12.82 after the bank gave a “sell” recommendation and a $13 price target. “We expect 2009 to be the first year since 2002 when industry option volumes decline.”Profit warnings and downgrades added to the gloom and pushed the S&P 500 index 2.3 per cent lower to 888.67 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 2.7 per cent to 8,691.33 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.6 per cent to 1,547.34.Investors took profits in infrastructure stocks, which had enjoyed strong gains on the back of economic stimulus plans from president-elect Barack Obama.FedEx was the worst hit in the industrial sector, off 14.5 per cent – its worst show since 1987 – to $63.65 after the package shipping group issued a profit warning.United Parcel Service, another delivery group, lost 7 per cent to $54.51 and was also pushed lower from a bearish JPMorgan note.“The deterioration in express demand trends appear to be so sharp that the market weakness will overwhelm the benefit from DHL’s withdrawal from the US and also the support for earnings from falling fuel prices,” the bank said, and cut its recommendation on the stock from “overweight” to “neutral”.Transport stocks came under further pressure from Con-way, which dropped 13.9 per cent to $22.19 after the trucking group also slashed its earnings forecast.The financial sector led the retreat, down 4.9 per cent, amid concerns about more possible writedowns in the fourth quarter.Host Hotels was the biggest loser on the S&P, down 16.1 per cent to $7.15. The lodging sector came under pressure after Wachovia downgraded its recommendation on the sector to “underweight”.Still, there were rare signs of encouragement. The market entered positive territory during the morning and traders appeared encouraged by signs that some sectors had stopped reacting so adversely to bad news.Semiconductor stocks performed well in spite of a profit warning from Texas Instruments, which rose 4.9 per cent to $15.55.Investors also overlooked planned factory closures by Sony, the Japanese electronics group, and snapped up technology stocks on hopes they may have reached a nadir. The sector finished down 0.5 per cent.Better than feared results from Autozone lifted shares in the car parts retailer 6.9 per cent to $124.51.The energy sector had earlier provided the market with support but tracked the oil price lower to finish down.General Motors and Ford lost 4.7 per cent to $4.70 and 4.4 per cent to $3.23, respectively, amid fears political wrangling could delay a government bail-out of the ailing car industry.Food retailers came under pressure from Kroger, which warned fourth-quarter profit would be less than Wall Street had expected.Shares in the grocery chain lost 6.7 per cent to $25.47.Wal-Mart lost 3 per cent to $55.81 after the discounter agreed to pay $54.3m to settle a wage and hours-related lawsuit in Minnesota and suspended its share buy-back.Airlines were one of the worst performing sectors, off 7.2 per cent overall, after Giovanni Bisignani, director general of the International Air Transport Association, warned that the industry would suffer a $2.5bn net loss next year.
333;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-11-28T20:08:52Z;US Postal Service;;"Heard the one about the layoffs at the post office? To make sure everyone received their pink slips on time, they were mailed last year. Often the butt of jokes about inefficiency, the US Postal Service is bleeding red ink just two years after it was put on a more independent footing by Congress. The Post Office’s latest fiscal year ended with a $2.8bn loss on $75bn in revenue. Its accumulated deficit of $7.2bn, covered by a Treasury credit line, is now nearly half the limit allowable by law.The losses may revive calls to end the Post Office’s monopoly, but these miss the point and ignore its tough operating environment. The main privilege it enjoys is the sole right to deliver to mailboxes – hardly enviable given the accompanying universal service obligation requiring it to be ubiquitous. What private company would deliver a Christmas card to the bottom of the Grand Canyon by mule for 42 cents? With e-mail replacing letters, bills increasingly being paid by direct debit, spam usurping junk mail and credit card solicitations dropping amid the slump, volumes are sagging.It is likely this unionised federal agency could be more efficient and fetch a high price to boot if privatised. Applying the average revenue multiple of FedEx and United Parcel Service yields a value of $60bn, not to mention the Post Office’s valuable real estate. However, efficiency gains have been decent with a 12 per cent cut in employees since 2001. And the Post Office performs numerous unprofitable but vital chores for the government while raising prices only in line with inflation. After the government- sponsored enterprises fiasco, a private sector company with public obligations and a backstop looks like a bad idea. And it is positively refreshing to see a company nearly as big as UPS and Fedex combined whose “CEO” – the Postmaster General – makes about 3 per cent as much as each of their bosses.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

334;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-11-17T22:01:41Z;Wall St falls on financial sector layoffs;;The biggest round of US job cuts for 15 years helped push Wall Street stocks lower on Monday as fears heightened over the scale of the difficulties facing financial institutions.Financials were among the biggest losers, down 6 per cent overall. Citigroup shed 6.6 per cent to $8.89 after unveiling plans to cut 52,000 jobs, which, according to consultants Challenger Gray & Christmas, was the biggest job cut announcement since the 60,000 by IBM in 1993.The bleak news, coupled with mounting signs of global recession, overshadowed any developments at the G20 meeting.Still, the market pared early losses as investors hunted for bargains in the energy, material and industrial sectors and briefly entered positive territory.Jeffrey Kleintop, strategist at LPL Financial, said there was a “tug of war” between poor economic developments and some signs of improvement in credit markets.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished down 2.6 per cent at 850.75 points after a sharp sell-off into the close, near the session’s lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.6 per cent at 8,273.58 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 2.3 per cent at 1,482.05.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, edged 4.2 per cent higher to 69.10, which continued to indicate elevated signs of distress.Elsewhere in financials, Bank of America slid 8.5 per cent to $15.03 after the group said it would increase its stake in China Construction Bank from 10.75 per cent to 19.1 per cent.Investors brushed aside a better-than-expected reading on industrial production – output rose 1.3 per cent last month, according to the Federal Reserve – as downward revisions to prior figures offset the rare positive news.RDQ Economics said the data were in any case primarily a result of “post-hurricane rebounds” and Bank of New York Mellon called the increase a “dead-cat bounce”.Official confirmation that the Japanese economy had entered recession increased concerns that the global downturn was spreading.Construction groups came under pressure after separate data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed manufacturing in New York contracted in November at the fastest pace since records began in 2001. Caterpillar lost 3.4 per cent to $35.70.General Motors jumped 5.7 per cent to $3.18 on mounting hopes Washington would grant aid to the car industry, although Ford eased 4.4 per cent to $1.72.In earnings news, Lowe’s and Target became the latest retailers to disclose sharp falls in third-quarter profit.Yet the figures were not quite as dire as analysts feared and shares in the former rose 4.2 per cent to $18.99.Target lost 4.1 per cent to $31.68 after management warned that the discounter’s gross margin performance might not be repeated in the fourth quarter.Also in the consumer sector, McDonald’s edged 0.9 per cent lower to $55.61 even after UBS upgraded its recommendation on the fast food group from “neutral” to “buy”. The bank said it was encouraged by the group’s “ongoing strong global trends amid a deteriorating global consumer environment”.In technology, Dell fell 3.4 per cent to $10.52 after Merrill Lynch downgraded its recommendation on the computer maker from “buy” to “neutral” ahead of results due this week, owing to lower than expected demand.Walt Disney lost 6.4 per cent to $19.74 after Soleil Securities cut its recommendation on the theme-park operator and media group from “buy” to “hold”.United Parcel Service was up 0.3 per cent at $53.28 even after the delivery group declined to forecast its peak day for holiday shipping, breaking with a long-standing practice in the industry. An uncertain economy made prediction too difficult, it said.Alcohol, tobacco and casino stocks received a boost after Merrill Lynch issued a bullish outlook on the so-called vice sectors.“Consumers do not kick their habits in tough economic times,” said Merrill.Still, brewer Molson Coors shed 2 per cent to $41.71.Energy was one of several sectors to find positive territory earlier in the session, but finished down 1.6 per cent overall as crude oil settled just above $55 a barrel.
335;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-11-10T22:32:55Z;Financials lead Wall St declines;;Wall Street stocks failed to cling onto early gains on Monday as China’s near $600bn economic stimulus package did little to assuage fears for the growth prospects of some of the biggest names in corporate America.The bankruptcy of a well-known retailer, concerns over the fate of shareholders in the nation’s automakers and drastic losses at AIG and Freddie Mac sent many stocks to multi-year lows.Financials led the declines, down 4.4 per cent overall. Goldman Sachs hit a five-year low, down 8.5 per cent to $71.21, after analysts at Barclays became the latest to forecast a fourth-quarter loss, citing in part its exposure to private equity.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 1.3 per cent at 919.21 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent at 8,870.54 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.9 per cent at 1,616.74.The market had risen as much as 2.3 per cent on the hope that the Chinese plan could lessen an expected global slump. Hard-hit construction, material and energy stocks were given a particular boost. New projects such as railways and airports as well as rebuilding earthquake-hit areas seemed likely to form a key plank of the Chinese government’s plan and the move sparked hopes of a floor in commodity prices.Also helping the market earlier, the Federal Reserve unveiled a revised $150bn rescue plan for AIG.The shares jumped 8.1 per cent to $2.28 in spite of third quarter figures from the struggling insurer that showed a net loss of $24.5bn .Stocks retreated as familiar concerns returned to the fore. Among the biggest, General Motors shed 23 per cent to $3.36 after Deutsche Bank set a price target of zero for the shares and recommended clients sell them.The bank said that while necessary for its survival, a government bail-out would do little to help shareholders. “Even if GM succeeds in averting a bankruptcy, we believe that the company’s future path is likely to be bankruptcy-like,” Deutsche analysts wrote, adding that “equity shareholders are unlikely to get anything”.Barclays also downgraded its recommendation on the stock and cut its price target from $4 to $1.Ford lost 4.5 per cent to $1.93 in spite of further signs that the pair, along with privately-held Chrysler, would secure government assistance. Credit Suisse called Ford’s cash burn “eye-popping” and also lowered its price target from $4 to $1.Best Buy rallied as much as 7.3 per cent on hopes the bankruptcy of smaller rival Circuit City would provide an opportunity for the electronics retailer to expand.Best Buy had previously said it could take over stores that struggling rivals closed. Yet the shares closed down 1.5 per cent to $25.21.Other retailers came under pressure after Barclays Capital issued a bearish outlook on a series of department stores after last week’s October sales figures.“We remain especially concerned about declining access to consumer credit and higher finance charges for consumer credit card balances,” the bank said in a report.Macy’s tumbled 9.3 per cent to $9.94 after Barclays cut its price target on the stock from $18 to $15.Starbucks fell 3.3 per cent to $10.20 and a further 2.8 per cent in after-hours trade, when the coffee chain disclosed fourth quarter profit slumped 97 per cent, hurt by the cost of closing underperforming stores.Earlier, UBS trimmed its forecasts and said that “new smoothies did not seem to drive significant sales”.Defensive names were among the biggest winners. Among them, upbeat like-for-like sales figures from McDonald’s lifted the burger chain 1.8 per cent to $56.48, and gave the fast food sector a boost.Delivery stocks United Parcel Service and Fedex rose after rival Deutsche Post unveiled plans to scrap domestic express services in the US.UPS and Fedex climbed 3.2 per cent to $53.60 and 2.7 per cent to $66.29 respectively, as the move is expected to allow the dominant US duo to take yet more market share.Dish Network slid 14.7 per cent to $13.24 after the satellite television group said quarterly profits dropped more than half. DIRECTV Group, its larger rival with which communications group AT&T has struck a deal to replace Dish in providing bundled deals, gained 1.1 per cent to $22.17.
336;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-11-10T21:55:24Z;DHL to cut 9,500 US jobs;;DHL’s express delivery service within the US is to close with the loss of 9,500 jobs after Deutsche Post, its parent company, abandoned its attempt to compete with FedEx and United Parcel Service on their home turf.The withdrawal from all ground and air domestic deliveries is a radical response by Deutsche Post to the widening losses in DHL’s US express business. Restructuring costs – estimated at $2bn in May – will almost double to $3.9bn, which Deutsche Post said would drive it into a net loss in 2008.Deutsche Post said the global economic slowdown had sparked a need for “more prudent action” in the US, where it had intended to cut its ground operations by 30 per cent.With 5,400 jobs already cut this year, DHL Express’s US workforce will shrink from 18,000 to fewer than 4,000.Frank Appel, Deutsche Post’s chief executive, acknowledged the company would face a “strong public reaction”. He said: “We are more than aware of the consequences but there are no alternatives.” Losses at DHL’s US Express business are set to widen from $1.3bn to $1.5bn this year.Deutsche Post shares rose 6.8 per cent to close at €10.00 in Frankfurt.From January, DHL Express will handle US packages only as part of international shipments, cutting costs by more than 80 per cent. John Mullen, chief executive of DHL Express said: “If you are shipping between cities in the US you will not have that service”.DHL’s US Express business will contract from more than 400 stations to 100 and all 18 ground hubs will shut. The air network will handle about 100,000 daily shipments compared with capacity for 1.2m today.Deutsche Post is not closing its other US businesses, including DHL’s global forwarding and supply chain businesses, which employ 25,000.For FedEx and UPS, DHL’s departure from the domestic express delivery business eliminates a competitor from a market that the two US companies dominate.Most of the more than $2bn in domestic air revenue that DHL makes annually, and another $750m in ground parcel revenue, should shift to UPS and FedEx, said Thomas Wadewitz, a JPMorgan analyst.Deutsche Post has been negotiating for months with UPS on a contract to handle air shipments in the US. The much lower volumes now anticipated will complicate efforts but Mr Mullen said talks should end this year. He said: “If that does not happen we will have to make other arrangements”.UPS said: “Clearly today’s announcement is going to affect the size and scope of any such contract.”Axel Funhoff, an analyst at ING, said: “Deutsche Post needed to do this to get their performance and cost problems under control. The market has been waiting for this for up to two years. But too much of the future strategy is still subject to the UPS contract.”Deutsche Post’s underlying third-quarter earnings fell 9 per cent year-on-year as the worsening economic climate took its toll. Underlying earnings in DHL Express fell 46 per cent but would have risen 8 per cent without the US.DHL will show a net loss this year as it incurs most of the $3.9bn restructuring charge.
337;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-11-09T17:11:22Z;Bigger cuts loom for DHL’s US service;Downturn complicated restructuring;"Deutsche Post is poised to reveal bigger cuts than expected to its troubled DHL US express deliveries service on Monday after the rapid economic downturn complicated efforts to restructure the lossmaking business.The German logistics company has for months been in talks with UPS, its industry rival, to agree a contract that would see UPS handle DHL’s air business within the US. The cost-cutting measure was intended as part of a €2bn ($2.6bn) restructuring plan along with cuts of about 30 per cent in DHL’s ground-based operations within the US.Deutsche Post is now expected to reduce ground operations further as the deteriorating state of the US economy reduces demand for logistics services.Falling volumes have complicated the contract talks with UPS, which, when announced in May, was set to be worth about €1bn annually over 10 years.An industry insider said: “The economy is dying, volumes are dying …this has been a moving target”.In October, Deutsche Post warned of “ongoing deterioration” in the US express business as it retreated from group earnings forecasts for this year and next.The downturn means underlying losses in the business this year are set to be wider than the €1.3bn announced in May.Some analysts say the plan for a deal with UPS could be radically redrawn or even abandoned.Axel Funhoff, an ING analyst, wrote in October: “The contract with UPS could be dead or turn …into a mini-contract”.He also says restructuring costs could be up to €3.5bn, compared with the €2bn estimated earlier by the company.Deutsche Post would not comment on its plans, which Frank Appel, chief executive, is to announce on Monday.Analysts at JPMorgan have pointed out that the rising value of the dollar against the euro would in any case increase costs for Deutsche Post by about 23 per cent, even without any widening of the previous restructuring plan.Other companies in the logistics sector – viewed as a barometer of world trade – have warned of tough times as demand contracts. UPS said last month the volume of packages shipped in the US fell 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, with expectations of a steeper drop in the important pre-Christmas fourth quarter.Deutsche Post’s plans for DHL in the US also ran into political trouble because of its aim of closing its US hub in Ohio, a key battleground state in the run-up to last week’s election. Politicians including John McCain, the defeated Republican candidate, urged the US justice department to investigate the planned deal.DHL intended to become a third significant force in the US market but failed to break up the de facto duopoly enjoyed by UPS
and FedEx. The company employs about 18,000 in its US express business."
338;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-10-23T23:30:10Z;Wall St volatile on mixed earnings and jobs news;;"US stocks were mixed after another highly erratic session on Thursday as investors considered whether relatively upbeat corporate earnings showed the global economic slowdown may not be as grim as the market’s brutal sell-off has implied.The session began in upbeat fashion. Dow Chemical, Altria and Eli Lilly were up 10.5 per cent to $24.43, 1.5 per cent to $19.58 and 4.3 per cent to $33.48, respectively, after overshooting analyst estimates.However, the S&P 500 closed up 1.3 per cent to 908.11 points having swung between losses of 4.3 per cent and gains of 2.9 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2 per cent higher at 8,691.25 points but the Nasdaq Composite Index ended 0.7 per cent down at 1,603.91 points.Financials were one of three sectors to drag on the market, down 0.9 per cent. Goldman Sachs tumbled 5.3 per cent to $108.58 after it emerged that the bank was planning to cut 10 per cent of its workforce in response to the deteriorating environment.The sector was also hit by further stress in money markets after signs of improvement this week. The rate at which banks lend to each other over the long-term rose for the first time since the fresh round of government intervention in the banking system this month.General Motors lost 1.5 per cent to $6.10 after it emerged that the group was to begin involuntary lay-offs.The news from Goldman and GM came after first-time unemployment benefit data jumped more than forecast. “There is every reason to expect hiring to drop in the wake of the disaster in the stock markets and the continued tightening of credit,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics.The rise came after the benchmark S&P 500 index fell to a fresh five-year low in the previous session after poor figures from companies such as AT&T and Boeing.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 14 per cent, to 79.43, which continued to signal a heightened level of distress. It had fallen as much as 7.5 per cent in the session.Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that the global financial crisis was a “once-in-a-century credit tsunami” and he foresaw more
lay-offs.Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said that this quarter, companies could no longer “have good earnings and expect that your stock’s going to go higher”.Coca-Cola Enterprises tumbled 18.5 per cent to $9 after the soft-drink bottler and distributor lowered its profit forecast for the year, while the consumer discretionary sector was another key weight on the market, off 0.5 per cent.Homebuilders were among the hardest hit sectors. Pulte Homes dropped 18.5 per cent to $8.11 after posting a larger-than-expected quarterly loss.Online retailers tumbled in sympathy with Amazon, which earlier rose as much as 1.8 per cent to $50.91 after the group lowered guidance for the fourth quarter. It ended the session 0.7 per cent higher at $50.32 while Ebay rose 1.9 per cent to $15.32.Xerox slid 3.4 per cent to $7.71 after the office supplier posted weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.Energy was the biggest winner, up 6.6 per cent overall, helped by oil’s edge towards $70 a barrel as well as positive results in the sector. National Oilwell Varco advanced 9.4 per cent to $26.78 after profit topped forecasts.Chevron and Exxon Mobil jumped 8.2 per cent to $66.77 and 9 per cent to $70.39, respectively. Transportation stocks enjoyed an early boost on the back of well-received earnings.Union Pacific, one of several hard-hit railway stocks, jumped 2.4 per cent to $58.25 after the railway company unveiled better-than-expected results.United Parcel Service gained 3.8 per cent to $48.13 after its drop in profit was not as bad as feared.Amgen climbed 11.8 per cent to $55.55 after the world’s largest biotechnology company forecast optimistic full-year earnings on the back of a fivefold increase in quarterly profit.In technology, Microsoft, which lost 7.8 per cent in the previous session, recovered 3.7 per cent to $22.32 ahead of results due after the bell."
339;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;UPS still delivering;;A much-anticipated parcel delayed in transit can be most vexing. Sometimes, though, a hold-up is good for you. United Parcel Services benefited in its third quarter as the cost of fuelling its fleet of brown trucks reversed sharply, in parallel (alas) with global economic prospects. Customer charges for rocketing fuel costs, however, take two months to respond, boosting its flagging US operations by $90m. Should oil prices stabilise or continue to tumble, this lag will also give the fourth quarter a helping hand.It may be needed. UPS has seemed slow to appreciate its deteriorating environment, suggesting in July that the worst of the slump was over. Third quarter earnings of $0.96 a share surpassed expectations, but average daily volume for US packages fell 3.4 per cent. Modern businesses’ need for speed – or just-in-time delivery – means UPS no longer functions as a canary for US economic fortunes. But numbers of parcels dispatched still tend to move in synch with output, and volumes are forecast to fall 4 per cent in the rest of the year.Customers shifting from pricier air options to road and rail could help UPS relative to higher-end competitors like Fedex. But UPS’s international operations, still posting strong volume growth of 7 per cent in spite of falling US imports, can only head one way as woes spread. Rather like UPS’s strategic plan for $200 oil, decoupling as a business model must, for now, be filed away.With the business throwing off $4.6bn of cash this year, UPS’s confidence in its funding is such that it will continue buying back its shares, down 32 per cent this year. Ultimately, the severity of the expected Christmas retail slump will determine whether it hits its (broad) range for the fourth quarter. With growth in business to consumer flows now slowing more than other areas, signs are that fewer festive households will be waiting for parcels, timely or otherwise, come December.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click hereLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

340;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-10-23T18:57:55Z;UPS warns of tough quarters;;United Parcel Service, the world’s biggest package-delivery company, conceded it would face a “challenging environment for a number of quarters” as the economic slump sapped demand for shipping goods.Considered an economic bellwether for its role in facilitating global trade, UPS yesterday reported a 12 per cent drop in third-quarter net income. US package volume, which typically tracks at or slightly above the pace of growth in gross domestic product, dropped 3.4 per cent in the third quarter and may drop another 4 per cent in the fourth.“Expectations are that the next few quarters will be challenging,” said Scott Davis, UPS’s chief executive.Net income fell to $970m, or 96 cents a share, from $1.1bn, or $1.05, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 7.4 per cent to $13.1bn, paced by gains from its international package-delivery, supply chain and freight businesses.While UPS still expects to meet its target for per-share earnings this year, albeit on the low range of its $3.50-$3.70 forecast, the company trimmed $200m from its 2008 capital-spending budget and plans additional cuts next year.“Strong companies really shine during tough times,” Kurt Kuehn, UPS’s chief financial officer, told the Financial Times. “We are being prudent and cautious, but at the same time expanding and competing aggressively.” UPS could pursue both goals, executives said, by retaining its ability to churn out cash and tap the capital markets even during the downturn.Although UPS lost its triple A credit rating in the past year, the company has produced $4.6bn in free cash flow in 2008, more than what was reported a year ago, and closed the quarter with $1.8bn in cash and equivalents.UPS would continue to buy back its stock, Mr Kuehn said.Also reporting quarterly results yesterday were US airlines US Airways and JetBlue Airways.US Airways lost $1.67bn, or $17.47 a share. Fuel expenses jumped 59 per cent, offsetting increases to both passenger and cargo revenue. The Arizona-based carrier had earned $506m, or $5.33, a year ago.JetBlue reported a net loss of $4m, or 2 cents a share, even as revenue rose to a record.www.ft.com/lex
341;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Greening data centres needs realistic risk assessment;;"Global businesses have successfully re-engineered business systems and their underlying IT infrastructures to meet the challenge of delivering 24/7 service availability. In the face of growing fears over climate change, companies are now addressing the huge task of re-orienting their business operations to reduce their carbon footprint – specifically their IT system energy demands.But as companies face up to fulfilling their corporate and social responsibilities, senior executives must ensure that reducing their carbon footprint is brought into the risk management planning for their IT operations.In particular, as companies green their operations with the latest high density, lower energy demand servers, they must ensure that they don’t inadvertently compromise the resilience of their systems by asking too much of their data centres’ existing back up power systems.The latest servers and storage equipment are placing unprecedented strain on data centres’ standard uninterruptable power supply (UPS) and back-up generator systems – the units that maintain continuous operations in an emergency or power outage. For example existing UPS equipment, originally designed to supply 100kW of power, is now more likely to fail and disconnect itself at 80kW or less when powering new, “greener” IT equipment. The start-up power needs of new equipment can also outstrip the capacity of older data centre power supplies – even though on paper they can run the devices.Companies that fail to address this hidden but critical mismatch in what the industry calls “power factor correction” are inadvertently undermining the capability of their data centre to withstand power grid difficulties. Modern IT hardware relies on a “clean” and secure power supply; having no power protection exposes the hardware, and business, to an increased risk of shut down or damage due to power disturbances.The problem stems from three factors: the huge expectations being placed on enterprise IT, the way that many data centres are owned and configured, and the gathering environmental agenda.First, computing development has for decades been about providing more computing power and performance – at the expense of all else. As the global economy boomed, IT departments were told to add more capacity and the CIOs scaled up the infrastructure simply to keep pace with demand. The internet explosion exacerbated the situation, demanding “always on” business applications, leading to vast computing centres, with bigger servers, more storage, and powerful cooling systems that themselves required additional power .The second factor is the manner in which many complex data centre infrastructures are operated. Data centres may be duplicated at multiple locations for business continuity, or are sprawling estates that have grown massively to meet demand. They may be co-located and run by third parties, maintained by outside infrastructure specialists, all of whom must support the IT department. Ordering an “about turn” to deliver green IT requires input from many specialists.Third, the climate change debate has caused further disruption to business strategies. As critics have suggested that IT operations have similar levels of carbon emissions to aviation, the IT supply industry and its users have had to reverse their power consumption habits – while still meeting the 99.9999 per cent service expectations of the online user.Everyone appreciates the benefits of energy efficient operations but changing the demands on complex data centre infrastructures must be a central part of an organisation’s risk management whether it adopts a declared green IT strategy or not.The answer is for organisations to engage with their data centre providers and infrastructure specialists to examine the operational requirements and power demands on data centres to identify the critical pressure points and risk factors. Enabling issues such as power factor correction have to be recognised and managed while supporting the overall IT strategy. As investment in more energy-efficient operations is approved and existing data centres gradually become rows of ultra high density servers and storage arrays, data centre UPS and generator protection will require regular risk assessment, performance testing and, where necessary, certification that they are still fit for purpose.This is no phantom menace: infrastructure experts have started to see the first instances of what were initially unexplained failure of hitherto robust and proven UPS in data centres.The CEO that walks through a data centre would doubtless be impressed by a state-of-the-art blade server that handles unprecedented numbers of transactions with greater energy efficiency and a smaller footprint than ever before. They might be less impressed if they knew that because the IT department didn’t go through the extra risk assessments with the data centre owner and their infrastructure adviser, that the server’s back-up power which seemingly ticked all the insurance boxes, is now an emerging risk to their organisation."
342;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-08-22T19:27:56Z;Banks to the fore as Europe advances;;A last-minute rally in banking stocks and a wave of takeover speculation boosted European shares, but failed to cancel out their losses from the start of the week.The benchmark FTSE Eurofirst 300 jumped 1.8 per cent to 1,175.79, but ended down 1.2 per cent on the week.Dutch logistics firm TNT stood out, gaining 6.9 per cent to €26.45 on rumours that US rival United Parcel Service was preparing to make a bid at the weekend.Takeover speculation has surrounded TNT for two months, with FedEx also in the frame as a potential suitor. The shares fell nearly 18 per cent on July 25 after FedEx was reported to have pulled out of talks.Meanwhile, Hochtief, the German construction group, gained 8.5 per cent to €54.34 on speculation that Spanish builder ACS, which owns 25 per cent, was interested in Hochtief’s US, Australian and Asian divisions. ACS shares rose 2.5 per cent to €30.20 after the company denied that it had break-up plans for the company. It refused to comment on whether it would make a full takeover bid for Hochtief.Financials provided much of the upside for European stocks, rallying after recent sharp losses. Switzerland’s UBS gained 4.8 per cent to SFr22.86, putting it 3.6 per cent higher over the week.However, the rally was an isolated bright spot for the European banking sector this week. Fears for the health of the government-backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the US had cast a pall over banks and other businesses exposed to Europe’s property market.Irish banks took a battering, with Anglo Irish Bank down 12.9 per cent to €5.53 over the week, Bank of Ireland falling 13.5 per cent to €5.25 and Allied Irish Banks sliding 5 per cent to €8.22. Irish cement producer CRH also slid 7 per cent to €16.97.Spanish banks and construction companies also faltered. Sacyr Vallehermoso shed 7 per cent to €12.32, Banco Popular lost 4.9 per cent to €7.01 and Grupo Ferrovial lost 5.3 per cent to €33.36. Ferrovial was hurt by fears that its subsidiary BAA will have to sell three of its British airports this year after a report by UK competition authorities attacked its dominance of the industry.Airlines stocks had a bumpy descent as the oil price rallied. Deutsche Lufthansa lost 5.5 per cent to €14.44, Air France-KLM slid 5.6 per cent to €16.43, while budget airline Ryanair sank 10.2 per cent to €2.56.However, oil and mineral stocks crested the gainers list. Portugal’s Galp Energia rose 4 per cent to €13.71, France’s Total added 3.3 per cent to €49.17 and Norway’s StatoilHydro gained 8.2 per cent to NKr165.60 and Austria’s OMV climbed 4.1 per cent to €42.42.Mining group Eramet advanced 11 per cent to €363.16, while German steel company Salzgitter rose 5.1 per cent to €103.32.
343;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-08-11T20:41:12Z;US stocks up as investors cheer drop in oil;;The S&P 500 index broke through the 1,300-point barrier on Monday for the first time since late June as investors cheered another drop in the oil price and some analyst upgrades in an otherwise unremarkable trading session.The telecoms and consumer discretionary stocks were among the biggest gainers, advancing 2.7 per cent and 4.4 per cent.Qwest Communications International rose 5.3 per cent to $4.01 after Citigroup recommended that investors buy the shares, arguing the company “remains ripe for both an operational and financial restructuring to improve returns to shareholders.”Verizon added 2.1 per cent to $35.30 while AT&T rose 2.8 per cent to $31.84.Another Citigroup note, this time on Amazon, also struck home with investors. Mark Mahaney, a Citigroup analyst, reiterated his “buy” call on the online retailer, pointing to stronger-than- expected sales of the Kindle, Amazon’s electronic book reader. “Turns out the Kindle is becoming the iPod of the book world,” Mr Mahaney said. Amazon rose 9.4 per cent to $88.09.Sentiment was positive throughout the retail sector as oil wallowed below $114 a barrel for much of the session. Gap, Dillard’s and Kohl’s climbed 8.8 per cent to $19.68, 6.9 per cent to $11.60 and 8.8 per cent to $51.01 respectively.The information technology, consumer staples and healthcare sectors also advanced, reinforcing their strong comeback as investors have moved away from energy stocks and into more defensive areas. Over the past six months the three sectors are the only ones to have made ground, adding 6.6 per cent, 4.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively.Brian Belski, US sector strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the sectors “offer US investors the most stable growth properties at current levels and going forward in terms of earnings and sales growth, margin expansion and cash flow”.On Monday, financials stocks were another standout, climbing 1.9 per cent as investors bought into heavily sold stocks and stalwarts alike. Washington Mutual added 3.5 per cent to $4.74, Wells Fargo climbed 4.8 per cent to $31.61 and American Express rose 3.6 per cent to $39.17.The benchmark S&P 500 gave up early gains of as much as 1.3 per cent but still closed 0.7 per cent ahead at 1,305.3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 11,781.78 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1 per cent to 2,439.95.Those gains followed a strong showing last week, when the S&P 500 advanced 2.9 per cent, buoyed by some decent results, a sharp drop in the oil price and the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates on hold.Still, analysts believe the major indices could move higher. Claire Collingwood, a dealer at CMC Markets, said: “Oil prices continue to be the main driving force behind the markets . . . as commodity prices continue to weaken then we can expect this to lead to a degree of movement back into equity markets.”With earnings season winding down, S&P 500 companies have posted second-quarter profit declines of about 23 per cent on average. Excluding financials, average earnings grew about 4 per cent.The energy sector lost 0.4 per cent after oil prices hit their lowest level since May. But coal stocks retreated. Massey Energy fell 5 per cent to $56.07, Consol Energy lost 4.4 per cent to $60.19 and Peabody Energy slid 5.8 per cent to $55.19.Among materials groups, a dip in industrial and precious metal prices shaved 0.4 per cent off the sector, making it the second worst performer of the day.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 3.8 per cent to $82.30, US Steel fell 6.7 per cent to $128.46 and Titanium Metals gave up 3.5 per cent to $10.63.Some deal news had a mixed impact. Waste Management, the rubbish hauler, raised its bid for Republic Services, a rival, by about 10 per cent to $6.73bn. In July, Republic rejected a $6.2bn offer from Waste Management. Waste Management shares rose 0.3 per cent to $36.10 while Republic shares rose 0.6 per cent to $35.05.United Parcel Service was in focus after the UK’s Sunday Telegraph said the parcel delivery company had held talks to buy TNT for €10bn ($14.9bn). UPS dismissed the report, but it slid 0.3 per cent to $65.51.
344;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-08-08T20:41:00Z;US stocks rally as oil prices fall;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Friday, and made their first consecutive weekly gains since May, after a dip in oil prices offset weak results and a dividend cut from Fannie Mae, the embattled mortgage agency.Crude oil fell more than $4 a barrel to a three-month low on Friday, taking its tally for the week to a 5.7 per cent decline.Oil-sensitive stocks rallied strongly on the news. General Motors advanced 2.9 per cent to $10.03 and Ford rose 7.6 per cent to $5.23. Retailers Macy’s and JC Penney climbed 9.5 per cent to $20.73 and 6.6 per cent to $35.75 respectively. An index of airline stocks added 8.2 per cent and the consumer staples and discretionary sectors advanced 2.3 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively.McDonald’s added to the positive momentum. The restaurant company posted July sales that rose significantly more than analysts estimated thanks to a strong performance in Europe. The shares climbed 6.2 per cent to $65.67 and a 43-year high.The industrial sector also made some notable headway, climbing 3.3 per cent. UPS rallied 3.8 per cent to $65.65 while General Electric rose 3.8 per cent to $29.64.Financials were in focus after Fannie Mae, the biggest US mortgage-finance agency, reported a wider- than-expected loss of $2.3bn – its fourth quarterly loss in a row. Earlier in the week, fellow government-sponsored entity Freddie Mac reported a loss that was three times wider than analysts anticipated, prompting concerns that the company would have to raise fresh capital.Fannie fell 9.1 per cent to $9.05 while Freddie rose 0.2 per cent to $5.90 on Friday. The pair are down 23.4 per cent and 26.1 per cent over the week.Separately, MBIA, the beleaguered bond insurer, posted a $1.7bn profit in second-quarter net income thanks to an accounting change. MBIA shares, which have lost more than 90 per cent of their value in the last year, added 3.5 per cent to $8.57. Ambac Financial Group, a peer that reported a $5.2bn gain on accounting changes on Wednesday, fell 5.7 per cent to $4.33.The financial sector focused on the positive and rose 3.5 per cent, turning weekly losses into a 1 per cent gain.Nine of the 10 leading industry groups closed ahead, helping the benchmark S&P 500 index climb 2.4 per cent to 1,296.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.7 per cent to 11,734.32 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.5 per cent to 2,414.1.Over the week, the S&P 500 climbed 2.9 per cent for its biggest gain since April. A rapid decline in oil prices, a swathe of earnings reports that were for the most part positive and a decision by the Federal Reserve to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 per cent, all played a part. The Dow rose 3.6 per cent over the week while the Nasdaq gained 4.4 per cent.The sector rallied 6 per cent over the week, after Cisco reported some solid earnings and analysts upgraded some key semiconductor companies.Cisco rose 10.3 per cent to $24.25 during the week, while Intel added 8.4 per cent to $24.23 and Sun Microsystems rallied 9.8 per cent to $10.25.Over the week consumer discretionary and staples stocks were also solid performers, making gains of 7.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively as the headwinds of rising commodity prices abated.Materials and energy stocks were the laggards over the week, falling 2 per cent and 4 per cent as commodity prices slipped back. The two sectors, which were the best performers in the first half of the year, are among the worst performers in the second half to date.The Olympics kicked off on Friday and that could be a positive for Nike, the athletic goods company.According to Bloomberg data, during the last six summer games, Nike shares have gained an average of 8.7 per cent. Nike shares rose 3.5 per cent to $62.95 on Friday.
345;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-08-07T19:10:00Z;Gloom descends on US finance executives;;US finance chiefs’ outlook for America’s economy sunk to a four-year low amid mounting concern over high oil prices, waning consumer demand and inflation, according to a study.The findings, which are to be released on Friday, follow a spate of US economic data and corporate earnings reports in recent weeks that fuelled fears of a recession and damped hopes of an easing of the financial crisis.Optimism among chief financial officers has also faded this year, and in the second quarter touched its lowest point since June 2004, a survey by Financial Executives International and Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business showed.At least half of those surveyed believed that the price of crude oil would climb to at least $160 a barrel in six months, or about a third higher than where it traded on Thursday.Many have taken steps to insulate their companies from the jump in fuel costs, raising prices, cutting corporate travel or investing in more energy-efficient gear. Controlling expenses is among the top challenges for the rest of the year.“It’s obvious to everyone in the business world that economic conditions in the US continue to slow,” said Scott Davis, chief executive of United Parcel Service, the package-delivery company, which is considered an economic bellwether.“Economists hold a bleaker outlook for the second half of this year than was the case even three months ago.”However, the study also showed that more than two-thirds of the 200 CFOs surveyed remained optimistic about their own companies’ prospects. Some even planned to increase technology and capital spending in the next year.“While economic worries remain, the steadiness in CFOs’ outlook toward their own companies may reveal that they are adapting to the turmoil and taking appropriate actions within their organisations,” said John Elliott, dean of the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College.Last month, Jeff Immelt, General Electric’s chairman and chief executive, described the US economy as “sluggish” but added: “The US remains tough, the capital market is still uncertain, but the global markets are robust and we just don’t see a slowdown.”The US unemployment rate rose last month to its highest level for four years. Recent data, including this week’s Institute for Supply Management’s index of new export orders in the services sector, have also painted a worrying picture of the health of US exports.
346;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-07-29T20:51:54Z;Wall St shrugs off writedowns and housing data;;US stocks shrugged off news of further writedowns in the financial sector and some weak housing data to make steep gains on Tuesday due to a sharp drop in oil prices and decent earnings reports.Oil prices fell about $3, prolonging a four-week slump that has seen prices tumble from more than $145 a barrel to about $122.That news, and an unexpected rise in the Conference Board’s gauge of consumer confidence, helped trigger broad equity advances.Nine of the 10 top industry groups were in positive territory. Consumer discretionary stocks added 3.3 per cent, industrials gained 2.7 per cent and technology posted a 2.1 per cent rise.The moves helped offset news of an $8.5bn stock offering from Merrill Lynch. After the close on Monday, the brokerage also announced a further $5.7bn in writedowns on certain mortgage securities.The International Monetary Fund said the US housing crisis could continue for some time and stood by its estimate that losses for the banking system could reach $1,000bn, sending financials into a tailspin.As if to underline that thesis, the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite home price index dropped 15.8 per cent in May compared with a year earlier.That was the biggest decline since 2001, but was smaller than expected, and housebuilding stocks rallied 9.1 per cent.The news from Merrill heartened some analysts.Meredith Whitney, of Oppenheimer, noted that the stock was closer to “fairly valued levels” and applauded the “purging of assets as an attempt to cut its losses and focus on stabilising its platform and righting the franchise towards growth”. Analysts at CreditSights, a research provider, noted the moves made Merrill “more appealing as a takeout candidate.”Investors seemed to agree and Merrill’s shares overturned early losses to gain 7.8 per cent to $26.25. The S&P 500 financials index surged 7.5 per cent, led by an 8.2 per cent advance for regional banks and a 9.7 per cent gain for diversified banks such as Wachovia and Wells Fargo.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 2.3 per cent higher at 1,263.2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.4 per cent at 11,397.56 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.5 per cent higher at 2,319.62.The second-quarter earnings season continued apace. So far, about 255 companies in the S&P 500 have reported and, on average, earnings have dropped 22.8 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. Financials were the worst performers, posting a 90.2 per cent decline, but excluding that sector, profits rose 8 per cent.Overnight, Amgen, the biotechnology company, reported that net income fell 7.7 per cent due to poor sales of certain anaemia drugs. But the fall was smaller than expected and it raised its full-year earnings forecasts. Amgen’s shares rose 3 per cent to $62.28.In the consumer staples sector, Colgate-Palmolive also beat expectations, posting a 19 per cent increase in profit as it passed on costs to the consumer and achieved strong sales in Asia and Latin America. Colgate’s shares rose 8.2 per cent to $74.15, leading the broader sector to a 2 per cent gain.In the consumer discretionary sector, McGraw-Hill said profit fell 23 per cent, but the education and financial services company re-affirmed its 2008 earnings forecasts and its shares rose 6.9 per cent to $39.78.The drop in oil prices proved a boon to the likes of Dillard’s and General Motors. The pair added 8.3 per cent to $10.43 and 8.2 per cent to $11.90 respectively.Consumer-facing technology groupsbounced back from Monday’s sell-off. Ebay, Apple and Dell climbed 3 per cent to $25.52, 1.7 per cent to $157.08 and 3.3 per cent to $24.01 respectively.In industrials, transportation stocks led the gainers with a 4.5 per cent advance. Ryder System added 5.7 per cent to $68.35, UPS added 3.3 per cent to $63.31. FedEx rose 5.2 per cent to $82.12.Material stocks were among the leading gainers, advancing 2.2 per cent thanks in part to US Steel. The company said second-quarter profits more than doubled on higher steel prices. US Steel’s shares rose 14.1 per cent to $165.76.The oil moves were less positive for energy stocks. ConocoPhillips dipped 2.4 per cent to $80.27 while Schlumberger slid 1.4 per cent to $96.23.
347;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-07-22T20:49:24Z;Wall Street rallies as oil price drops sharply;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as a sharp drop in oil prices boosted consumer-facing stocks while a plan to turn round Wachovia helped investors shrug off some disappointing earnings reports.Most eyes were focused on the financial sector, which staged a remarkable midday volte-face to gain 6.6 per cent as investors skipped over a series of weak earnings results to focus on the positive.Overnight, American Express reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and withdrew its full-year earnings forecast. The credit card company’s shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to $37.99 while peer Discover Financial lost 3.8 per cent to $14.62.An $8.9bn loss from Wachovia and some depressing results from regional banks, including Regions Financial and Keycorp, initially added to the sour mood.But by midday investors had shrugged off the bad news, focusing instead on a strategy from Robert Steel, Wachovia’s new chief executive, to cut $2bn of expenses by the end of 2009, sell assets and slash jobs and the dividend at the bank.Wachovia shares swung from an 11.6 per cent loss to a 27.4 per cent gain at $16.79. Regions Financial and Keycorp overturned early losses to gain 9.6 per cent to $11.40 and 4.3 per cent to $11.99, respectively.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim, an online brokerage, said: “Wachovia presented a plan this morning, they cut their dividend – they are doing something. This credit crisis is not going away in a month, but if we have a plan to get ourselves out of it in a year that makes the market feel good.”There were some more consistent bright spots. Western Union advanced 8.6 per cent to $27.23 after the money-transfer company said second-quarter profit had risen 13 per cent, thanks to international revenues, and raised its 2008 profit forecast.SunTrust Banks said second-quarter earnings had slumped 21 per cent. But that was a smaller fall than expected and the shares rallied 17.1 per cent to $39.97 after the bank ruled out a capital raising or dividend cut.CME Group, which runs futures exchanges, said second-quarter profit had risen 60 per cent to $201m thanks to its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME shares rose 12.5 per cent to $366.27.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had shaken off early losses and was up 1.4 per cent at 1,277.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 11,602.5 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was ahead 1.1 per cent at 2,303.96 points.The day began in downbeat fashion after Apple forecast fourth-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ projections. The news, and speculation about the health of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, sent shares in the iPod maker down 2.6 per cent to $162.02.Texas Instruments and SanDisk also disappointed investors in the technology sector. The semiconductor makers both predicted earnings that trailed analysts’ expectations. Texas shares fell 14.2 per cent to $24.48, SanDisk dropped 24 per cent to $13.62, while an index of semiconductor stocks slipped 2.8 per cent.A $4 drop in oil prices took the sting out of the worst results. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks were among the best performers, adding 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart added 3.1 per cent to $59.06 while Starbucks rose 7.4 per cent to $15.13.In industrials, some solid earnings news helped steady investor concerns about the health of the economy. Caterpillar, the heavy goods maker, Lockheed Martin, the defence company, Paccar, the truckmaker, and United Parcel Service, each met or beat analysts’ expectations for their quarterly results.Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 per cent to $74.98, Lockheed Martin added 2.3 per cent to $103.88, Paccar climbed 4.4 per cent to $44.60 and UPS advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.11.Energy was the best performing sector on Monday, but that trend petered out on Tuesday as oil prices slipped back below $130 a barrel and some decent results from the services sub-industry left investors unmoved. BJ Services and Baker Hughes rose 6.6 per cent to $31.99, and 3.2 per cent to $87.06, respectively.
348;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;UPS suffers as economic downturn bites;;United Parcel Service said quarterly profit plunged 18 per cent as its domestic package-delivery business slumped - an ominous sign for the health of the US economy.US package volume, which typically tracks with or slightly above the economy’s gross domestic product, fell 1.3 per cent during the second quarter. The downturn, coupled with surging fuel costs, prompted more customers to seek cheaper shipping alternatives.“Slow US economic activity and fuel price increases hit us and our customers during the quarter,” Kurt Kuehn, UPS’s chief financial officer, said in a statement. “ Even though economists do not predict a recovery until 2009, we anticipate that the second half of 2008 will generate modestly better results than the first half, assuming business conditions do not worsen.”UPS predicted that 2008 earnings would total $3.50-$3.70 a share, as second-half profit climbs to as much as $1.98. The Atlanta-based company earned $1.72 during the year’s first half.Operating profit fell to $1.4bn, or 85 cents a share, within the range of forecasts UPS issued last month. The company earned $1.77bn, or $1.04, a year ago. Revenue climbed 6.6 per cent to $13bn.The company’s domestic-package business earned $900m, down from $1.19bn a year earlier. Revenue totalled $7.71bn on average daily volume of 13.1m.The international delivery arm reported a drop in quarterly profit, to $408m from $475m, on higher fuel prices. Revenue rose to $2.95bn.
349;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-07-14T20:06:17Z;Targeting TNT;;Nothing spices up a morning like receiving an unexpected package. Possible interest in TNT from rival FedEx sent shares in the mail group up by more than a quarter on Monday. Yet the idea of consolidation has surfaced periodically since UPS, another US competitor, listed in 1999. Will FedEx actually make a bid this time?The logic behind a deal is clear. FedEx and UPS are both strong globally in express delivery services, but lack scale in Europe. For example, FedEx serves only about 2 per cent of the intra-Europe express market, compared with TNT’s 17 per cent. With TNT’s exposure outside Europe limited mainly to a decent Australasian business and some nascent Asian exposure, the geographic fit would be attractive.However, the chances of picking up TNT on the cheap are slim. Its share price, before Monday’s pop, had halved from last year’s high of €36. Putting TNT’s express courier division on the same 15 times earnings multiple carried by FedEx and UPS suggests a valuation for that business alone of about €7bn, or €18 per share. This is before valuing other divisions – such as the reliable, but mature, Dutch postal arm that contributes half of TNT’s operating profit – or synergies, although scope for the latter looks limited. To get management talking, any bid would have at least to approach €30 per share. UPS, meanwhile, would be forced to consider a counterbid.The timing is not ideal either. FedEx has already notched up three profit warnings amid a sagging economy and rising oil prices. Profits are expected to fall by a fifth in the year ending May 2009 – hardly the ideal time to embark on the group’s first large-scale acquisition and then integrate a business based several thousand miles away. Investors have had a useful reminder of TNT’s attractions as a target, but delivery of a deal looks some way off.
350;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-07-11T22:31:54Z;FedEx in talks to buy Dutch rival TNT;;FedEx is in preliminary talks to acquire TNT, its smaller Dutch rival, in a deal that would bolster the package-delivery company’s parcel network throughout Europe.A deepening economic downturn and mounting fuel costs have hurt demand for package deliveries, reviving merger discussions that have continued in starts and stops for years.While FedEx and arch-rival United Parcel Service have coveted TNT’s European parcel business, they have been reluctant to take on the Dutch company’s slower-growing postal division.On Friday, FedEx’s market capitalisation was $22.8bn (€14.3bn), while TNT’s market capitalisation was $11.3bn.Deutsche Post’s £3.7bn to acquire Exel, the UK-based logistics group, in 2005 has so far been the biggest deal in the sector. Other transactions have included the $1.1bn merger of Deutsche Bahn, the German rail operator, and Bax Global, the logistics arm of US-based Brink’s and the €490m acquisition of Paris-based ACR Logistics by Kuhne & Nagel of Switzerland.DHL, TNT and FedEx together account for about 60 per cent of the European express logistics market in value terms.TNT, which primarily operates in Europe and North America, divides its business into two segments: express and mail.FedEx runs the world’s largest express-delivery company. The group mainly operates in the US, but in recent years has begun to expand its international operations.However, the US company in June posted its first quarterly loss in 11 years and projected earnings that fall short of analysts’ estimates because of fuel costs and declining demand.FedEx reported a fourth quarter loss of $241m on a writedown for its Kinko’s unit and predicted a “very difficult” environment in the coming year.Economists have cut their US growth forecasts for later this year and next as job losses, food and fuel prices and tougher lending rules hurt consumers.“As a matter of policy, FedEx does not comment on rumours or speculation about corporate development activities,” a company spokesman said.FedEx has sought to build out its Continental network as well as aiming to establish a presence in individual European countries. The company bought ANC in 2006 to strengthen its domestic express-delivery business in the UK.
351;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-07-08T20:37:10Z;Wall Street rallies in late trade;;Wall Street stocks rallied the most in over a month on Tuesday, bouncing back from bear market territory as falling commodity prices boosted consumer facing stocks and financials roared ahead.Oil was the prime mover on Tuesday, falling about $6 a barrel and dropping below $137 a barrel.That retreat, and some new data showing that tax rebates continue to fuel spending helped consumer-facing stocks. Gap added 5.6 per cent to $16.75 and Ford rose 9.6 per cent to $4.90 while the consumer discretionary sector advanced 2.2 per cent.Office Depot, however, was a weak spot, dropping 31.6 per cent to $7.08 after it said North American same-store sales fell nearly 10 per cent in the second quarter and it warned on operating margins.Consumer staples also fared well, climbing 1.5 per cent. SuperValu rose 5 per cent to $32.67 while Wal-Mart rose 3.9 per cent to $59.11.Results from Pepsi Bottling Group took some of the shine off the sector, however. The company posted second-quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations but investors were unimpressed, trimming the share price by 2.7 per cent to $27.88.Industrials and healthcare stocks also advanced, adding 0.7 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.An analyst upgrade boosted United Parcel Service 4.3 per cent to $60.40 while falling oil prices helped other transport-related stocks gain.GE climbed 3.5 per cent to $28.06, CSX advanced 6.9 per cent to $60.79 and Ryder System rose 4.4 per cent to $70.08.In healthcare sector, stocks rallied a day after S&P equity strategists upgraded the group to “market weight” arguing that with equity volatility likely to remain elevated and valuations low, “investors will re-focus on healthcare’s defensive qualities, allowing for better relative performance. ”Schering-Plough was among the leading gainers, climbing 4.6 per cent to $20.86 after it said its experimental treatment for infertility had met its main goals in a late-stage study.Biogen Idec and Abbott Laboratories gained 6.9 per cent to $62.94 and 5.9 per cent to $57.37 respectively.The benchmark S&P 500 closed the day up 1.7 per cent at 1,273.68. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 per cent to 11,384.21 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3 per cent at 2,294.42. Both indices moved out of bear market territory.Financials stocks climbed sharply, adding 5.7 per cent for their biggest one day gain since early April. The Federal Reserve chairman suggested the central bank would give investment banks access to emergency cash into 2009 while the chief executive of JP Morgan said credit losses would ease.The news offered the sector some consolation after a volatile start to the week in which they re-tested five year lows.The most heavily sold stocks made the strongest advances. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Washington Mutual jumped, soaring 11.9 per cent to $17.62, 13 per cent to $13.64 and 16.8 per cent to $5.99 respectively.On Monday a wave of speculation that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government sponsored mortgage entities, might have to raise capital to retain their triple A credit ratings triggered heavy selling .In spite of Ben Bernanke’s soothing comments, there were some moments of excitement.IndyMac Bancorp provided the most spectacular of those, plummeting 38 per cent to $0.44. The California mortgage specialist said it did not have enough capital to offer new home loans and an analyst said shareholders may be wiped out.Energy stocks crumpled in response to the falling oil prices however. The sector fell 1.6 per cent and is now on the brink of a correction from its May highs, down about 9 per cent..Exxon Mobil fell 1.2 per cent to $85.94 while ConocoPhillips lost 1.3 per cent to $89.15.Still, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, warned: “It is a passing thing. I don’t think we are going to get a real break in energy prices until the fourth quarter when prices are seasonally weak and some Fed rate hikes take effect.”The materials sector fared little better, losing 0.6 per cent as commodity prices slipped back and investors worried that a global economic downturn would hurt demand. US Steel fell 4.6 per cent to $150.55 while Nucor lost 4.4 per cent to $63.16.
352;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-07-02T01:42:10Z;Brussels overruled on ‘illegal’ state aid;;Competition regulators in Brussels suffered an embarrassing defeat on Tuesday when one of Europe’s top courts overturned their decision that €572m ($904m, £453m) of state aid given to Deutsche Post had been illegal.The German group, which is Europe’s largest mail service, said the ruling meant that it should get back about €1bn, including interest, on the funds, which it had to hand back to the German state in 2003.The postal operator said it “would prefer to earmark the amount for returning to shareholders” – including the German government itself, which has retained a stake of more than 31 per cent in the quoted company.However, the ruling could still face an appeal: a European Commission official said on Tuesday that the details were being studied and no decision had yet been made. The Commission has just over two months in which to consider options.The Commission decision, which followed an inquiry triggered by complaints from UPS of the US and an association of private mail delivery services, dates from 2002, when the regulators found that the German group had received €572m of illegal state aid.The aid had been paid to Deutsche Post supposedly in connection with its public obligation to provide a universal postal service across Germany. But the Commission claimed that Deutsche Post covered a deficit in one part of its business – parcels – by improperly subsidising it with state aid. Deutsche Post denied the claim.In its decision, the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg found that the Commission had failed to check whether the total amount of the transfer payments at issue exceeded the net additional costs of providing “a service of general economic interest”. If the former were lower than the latter, the transfer payments would not have given Deutsche Post any advantage.The court also rejected the Commission’s justifications for not carrying out this check. Accordingly, it annulled the 2002 decision, and ordered the Commission to pay Deutsche Post’s costs.Werner Gatzer, Germany’s deputy finance minister, said last week that no provision had been made for the repayment in Germany’s budget plans for 2009, or in draft spending plans up to 2012, in the event that the Commission decision was overturned. But a finance ministry official was reported on Tuesday as saying there was an agreement with the company to pay the money back with interest, probably out of the 2008 budget.
353;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-07-01T20:42:32Z;GM helps dispel some of Wall Street gloom;;"US equity markets fought back tenaciously on Tuesday, throwing off fuel and financial worries to post modest gains after General Motors showed a smaller than expected decline in sales for June.The morning session proved volatile and gloomy as oil prices streaked higher, keeping up the pressure on consumer-facing and energy-dependent stocks while earnings downgrades hit the banking sector.New data showing an unexpected expansion in manufacturing activity in June helped limit losses. The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing index rose from 49.6 in May to 50.2 last month. Economists had expected the index to slip back in June.Markets swung into positive territory in mid-afternoon when General Motors reported that its sales in North America, seasonally adjusted, declined only 8.3 per cent in June – far less than expected.GM shares, which hit a 54 year low on Monday, overturned early losses to surge as much as 15 per cent. The shares closed 2.2 per cent ahead at $11.75. Ford lost 2.1 per cent to $4.71 after it posted a larger decline in sales.The picture for US auto makers in general looks challenging. Record high oil prices have encouraged buyers to purchase smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles, often made by foreign competitors.Investors also bought back into financial shares, picking up some of the most heavily sold stocks.Still, gains were limited by a slump in material stocks, which lost 1 per cent, while the consumer discretionary sector, of which automakers are a part, also lost ground.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,284.93 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent to 11,382.26 points while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 2,304.97 points.On Monday, most stocks fell, rounding off the S&P 500’s worst month in six years as rising oil prices and worries about the health of the leading financial institutions undermined investor confidence. The Dow showed its biggest June decline since 1930.Larry Smith, chief investment officer at Third Wave Global Investors, said: “These very poor equity numbers directly reflect the fact that, until oil comes down, we are going to continue to have growth that is weak and gets weaker.”The downward trend paused on Tuesday, but weak spots were evident.In materials, energy-intensive steel producers were among the biggest fallers. AK Steel , US Steel and Nucor lost 4.9 per cent to $65.59; 5.1 per cent to $175.35; and 3.3 per cent to $72.23, respectively.In the industrial sector, railway stocks CSX and Union Pacific lost 3 per cent to $60.93 and 2.5 per cent to $73.65, while package delivery companies FedEx and UPS slipped 3.1 per cent to $76.37 and 1.5 per cent to $60.55.A rally in GE and Deere shares helped counterbalance those losses at the close however. The pair added 1.6 per cent to $27.12 and 1.8 per cent to $73.42 respectively.Meanwhile, consumer discretionary stocks also fell slightly as fuel prices rose. Dillard’s, the department store operator, fell 6.2 per cent to $10.85 while Jones Apparelslipped 1.9 per cent to $13.49.The biggest loser was Fortune Brands. The home products maker gave up 13.3 per cent to $54.13 after second-quarter profit fell more than it forecast, in part because of the US housing slump.Energy stocks made up for those losses. Schlumberger, the oil services company, added 2.3 per cent to $109.86 while the sector as whole gained 0.6 per cent. The refiners struggled however. Tesoro lost 2.2 per cent to $19.37.Banking stocks proved surprisingly resilient, looking past a UBS note in which the firm slashed its earnings forecasts for US banks for 2008 and 2009 by up to 30 per cent.The sector overturned losses of as much as 2.8 per cent to gain 1 per cent and snap a three day losing streak. JPMorganand Citigroup recovered from early losses to gain 0.3 per cent to $34.02 and 2.2 per cent to $17.13.Lehman Brothers also made ground, rebounding 5.8 per cent to $20.96 after Morgan Stanley rated the firm “overweight” in new coverage.CIT Group the loss-making business lender, was the leading sector gainer however, rising 30 per cent to $8.83 after it agreed to sell its manufactured housing and home-loan businesses for $1.8bn to focus on commercial lending."
354;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-06-30T18:03:14Z;Wall Street ends month on dismal note;;New York stocks bounced back modestly on Monday as soaring oil prices boosted energy stocks but the rally was too little, too late to prevent the S&P 500 from registering its worst month since September 2002.The relentless rise in oil prices has been the scourge of stock markets this month, undercutting investor confidence with the threat of inflation and turning modest gains in April and May into significant losses in June.Oil, which hit $143 a barrel in early trading before easing back, took its toll on consumer-facing stocks again on Monday.Expedia which was also knocked by a price target cut from Citigroup, fell back 3.4 per cent to $18.51, while Hasbro also lost 1.3 per cent to $35.59. Ford and General Motorswere also hard hit tumbling 4.8 per cent to $4.74 and 3.5 per cent to $11.13 respectively. The consumer discretionary sector gave up 0.4 per cent.Gains for oil producers however helped broader indices advance. Exxon Mobiland Conoco­Phillips added 1.1 per cent to $87.52 and 2.5 per cent to $94.13 respectively, while the sector climbed 1.6 per cent.The positive momentum was reinforced after the National Association of Purchasing Management said its measure of business activity in the Midwest improved in June, calming fears that output would collapse as the slowdown takes its toll.Industrials rallied 0.7 per cent on the news. UPS added 1.7 per cent to $61.38 and Cummins climbed 2.8 per cent to $66.16.Strength in the telecommunications and healthcare sectors, which added 3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively, helped offset further weakness in financials. The benchmark S&P 500 closed the day 0.1 per cent ahead at 1,280 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was roughly flat at 11,350.01. The Nasdaq Composite fell back 1 per cent to 2,292.98Last week, surging oil prices, poor earnings reports from the technology sector and a slump in financials pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Index into bear market territory and the S&P 500 to within a hair’s breadth of its March lows.That pattern was repeated yesterday. The Dow fell to its lowest level since September 2006 – down more than 20 per cent from its October highs – before recovering. The index is down 7.2 per cent over the quarter and 10 per cent so far this month – its worst June performance since the Great Depression.The S&P 500 fared little better. Technical analysts had warned that if the index broke through its March lows, it could retest its 2002 depths, but the recent bottom held. However, the index is still down 8.4 per cent over the month so far and 3 per cent over the quarter.One bright spot yesterday morning though was better-than-expected results from H&R Block. The US tax preparer reported its first quarterly profit in two years, thanks to the sale of its loan servicing unit. H&R rose 3.2 per cent to $21.49.Campbell Soup also cheered investors with news that it plans to buy back up to $1.2bn of stock by 2011. The shares climbed 5.2 per cent to $33.86.Analysts expect second quarter earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole to decline 11.3 per cent – marking the first time that the index has recorded four consecutive quarters of negative growth since 2002. At the start of the year, analysts were forecasting growth of 4.7 per cent.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, says that, even with those revisions, full-year earnings predictions are too high as tighter credit conditions will have an impact on industrial activity.Telecoms were the leading gainers on the S&P 500. Sprint Nextel led the pack, adding 4.9 per cent to $9.35 after reports that its Instinct phone was proving popular. Verizon rose 2.5 per cent to $35.13, while AT&T gained 1.3 per cent to $33.19.The travails of the financial sector continued to weigh on sentiment. Bond insurer MBIA was among the biggest fallers, dropping 8.9 per cent to $3.80 after a report that it is selling municipal bonds to raise cash. Peer Ambac slumped 22.4 per cent to $1.25.Wachovia was the worst performing bank, dropping 4.9 per cent to $15.43 after analysts said it might cut its dividend.
355;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-06-27T20:35:26Z;Wall St shares slide almost to March lows;;Surging oil prices, poor earnings reports from the technology sector and a slump in financials pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Index briefly into bear market territory and the S&P 500 to within a hair’s breadth of its March lows on Friday.The Dow fell to its lowest level since September 2006 – down more than 20 per cent from its October highs – before recovering slightly.The index is on course for its worst June since the Great Depression, down 10.2 per cent.The S&P 500 fared little better. Technical analysts warned that if the index broke through its March lows it could retest its 2002 lows at 1,172 points. The S&P is set for its worst monthly performance since September 2002, down 8.7 per cent.Friday began positively after the US Department of Commerce released data showed that consumer spending doubled in May while personal income also jumped, in part thanks to government tax rebates.Observers warned that tax rebates would have only a short-term effect and one already largely priced into the market.Leo Kamp, chief economist of TIAA-CREF, the financial services company, said: “Markets are seeing through this transitory increase in demand and consumption and are expecting a very slow economy afterwards.”New data on sentiment suggested that consumers had largely discounted the rebates as well. The University of Michigan index showed consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in 28 years in June.Consumer facing stocks initially stabilised but fell back. Dillards fell 3.4 per cent to $11.58 while ConAgra fell 6 per cent to $19.67. The consumer discretionary sector fell 0.7 per cent while consumer staples fell 1.2 per cent.Poor earnings results in the technology sector added to the gloomy mood. Micron Technology and Palm came under pressure following disappointing earnings reports after the close on Thursday. Micron slipped 12.7 per cent to $6.10 on Friday while Palm fell 8.3 per cent to $6. The sector lost 0.4 per cent.Financials were the biggest laggards as they were all week. JPMorgan lost 3.5 per cent to $35.05. Morgan Stanley fell 0.1 per cent to $36.81 after Moody’s said it might cut the brokerage’s credit rating.The benchmark S&P 500 pared losses at the close but ended the day down 0.4 per cent at 1,278.49 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent lower at 11,348.96. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3 per cent to 2,315.63. Equities had been volatile during the week, stoked and stymied in equal measure by the fluctuating price of oil and the fortunes of corporate America.Negative earnings reports from the likes of UPS and Oracle had weighed on sentiment. Over the week, UPS lost 10 per cent to $60.37 while Oracle gave up 3.7 per cent to $21.29.Markets had to contend with rising inflation expectations. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold, noting the risk of rising inflation due to surging oil prices.Stocks rallied on the news but fell back sharply a day later as the dollar weakened, oil prices rocketed and analysts warned of further writedowns at leading banks and brokerages such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.Citigroup lost 10.6 per cent to $17.25 over the week and Merrill dropped 9 per cent to $32.70, dragging the sector down 6.6 per cent – its biggest drop since February.Over the week the S&P 500 lost 3 per cent for its fourth consecutive weekly drop while the Dow Jones dropped 4.1 per cent.On Friday as oil advanced, energy stocks made gains. Chevron rose 0.7 per cent to $98.08 while Schlumberger added 0.9 per cent to $105.90. The broader sector advanced 0.9 per cent.Healthcare stocks rose 0.6 per cent after Senate Republicans blocked a bill to cut billions of dollars off health plans tied to Medicare. Humana rose 3.1 per cent, Tenet Healthcare 1.1 per cent and Coventry Health Care 2.9 per cent.
356;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-06-25T22:12:51Z;Cargo version of TGV to court air traffic;;The company that designed and built France’s high-speed TGV trains is developing a cargo version that could see short-haul air cargo shifted to Europe’s growing high-speed rail network.Philippe Mellier, president of Paris-based Alstom Transport, told the Financial Times the plan was to win over from air the express parcel business of companies such as UPS and FedEx.“I think that very high-speed trains in the future could be a good alternative to the UPS and FedEx fleet of planes today,” he said.The area is one of several which Alstom aims to capture for rail business created by the rising cost of other, more fuel-intensive means of transport.A single-deck version of the new train could be based on the 360kph AGV model unveiled earlier this year. A double-deck variant could be based on the 320kph TGV Duplex used on France’s busiest high-speed routes.FedEx said it continued to support the Carex group, which is examining the viability of high-speed rail freight, which it helped to found two years ago. UPS, which currently avoids using European rail because of the priority given to passenger trains, said it would monitor developments in the area.High-speed freight’s potential is growing as new lines such as France’s LGV Est – which opened last year to near the German border – link up once-separate national high-speed networks. Many air cargo hubs also have high-speed rail connections.“There’s a high-speed train stop at Roissy,” Mr Mellier said, referring to Paris’s main Charles de Gaulle airport.“From there, you could run to London, to Marseilles, to wherever.”
357;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-06-24T21:29:15Z;US stocks hit lowest level in three months;;US stocks hit their lowest level in three months on Tuesday as investors weighed a handful of mixed earnings reports, a rally in financials and new data showing the continuation of a slump in house prices and consumer confidence.The day began in downbeat fashion after UPS, the world’s largest shipping carrier, cut its earnings expectations for the second quarter, blaming slowing US growth and higher fuel costs. UPS is often seen as an industrial bellwether because its business depends on the levels of activity in the broader economy.Last week, rival FedExsimilarly disappointed markets when it posted an unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss. Together, these results will heighten fears about the impact of elevated oil prices on the wider economy.UPS lost 6 per cent to $62.26 while FedEx slipped 0.2 per cent to $79.98, helping to drag the industrials sector down 1.3 per cent.Markets took another downward leg after the release of data showing a further record decline in house prices and tumbling consumer confidence.Estimate-beating first-quarter results and full-year forecasts from food retailer Kroger helped offset some of that bad news, boosting the consumer staples sector and broader equity indices – but only for a time.Kroger added 7 per cent to $27.82 and was followed higher by Safeway and Supervalu which climbed 2.6 per cent to $29.65 and 3 per cent to $31.35 respectively. The consumer staples sector rose 0.2 per cent as a whole.The benchmark S&P 500 wavered between gains and losses but eventually closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,314.29 points – its lowest level since mid-March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 11,807.43 while the Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.7 per cent to 2,368.28.Analysts had expected trading to be subdued ahead of Wednesday’s decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve but the main indices have instead been notably choppy so far this week.In spite of the volatility, some observers found reason for optimism. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said recent market weakness could be a prelude to a recovery in the second half as the lagged impact of Fed easing, the fiscal stimulus and attractive valuations took effect.“We are in the middle of a healthy seasonal correction but if we retest the mid-March lows and bounce back we will have set up a nice triple bottom . . . and I think we could see record highs for equity markets in the next six to 12 months.”In the background, financials provided a rare fillip to market sentiment, shrugging off another round of analyst downgrades to climb 2.5 per cent after retesting five-year lows.The most heavily sold banks and brokerages were among the biggest gainers. SunTrust Bank advanced 4.1 per cent to $37.40, Lehman Brothers rose 6.8 per cent to $24.35 and Wells Fargo climbed 3.9 per cent to $25.20. Wachovia also made ground, rising 5.6 per cent to $17.86 after it said it had hired Goldman Sachs to assess its loan portfolio.Even the consumer discretionary sector, initially hit hard by the latest data, just about held its own. Eastman Kodak led the way, soaring 13.7 per cent to $14.03 after the photography company said its board had authorised a $1bn share repurchase. Over the past year, however, Eastman shares have lost about half of their value.Starbucks and Darden Restaurants were also among the gainers, adding 1.7 per cent to $16.57 and 3.1 per cent to $31.60 respectively.Homebuilders proved im­pervious to the housing statistics, rallying after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on the sector with an outperform rating on Centex, DR Horton and others. Centex and DR Horton advanced 7.5 per cent to $15.15 and 7.3 per cent to $12.62 respectively.But inflation worries have become increasingly acute in recent weeks, a trend that looks set to continue as producers pass on higher input costs.Dow Chemical said it would raise prices by up to 25 per cent and institute freight surcharges to combat high energy prices. The price rises are the second in a month. Dow fell 2.8 per cent to $36.58 while the material sector was the worst performer in the S&P 500, losing 2.5 per cent – its biggest one day loss since the start of the month.
358;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-06-18T20:34:48Z;US stocks fall as oil prices surge;;US stocks fell for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices surged in late trading while poor results from FedEx underscored the challenges of rising energy prices and crumbling profitability facing the broader economy and equity markets.FedEx said it had lost $241m in the fourth quarter after rising fuel costs and a writedown on FedEx Kinko, its copy centre unit, took their toll. The company’s outlook statement for 2009 was also downbeat.The results will further heighten fears about the impact of elevated oil prices on the wider economy.The parcel delivery firm is often seen as a bellwether because its business depends on the levels of activity in the economy.FedEx shares fell 2.1 per cent to $82.60 while rival UPS lost 2.3 per cent to $65.80, dragging the industrials sector down 1 per cent.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said profit dropped 57 per cent in the second quarter due to weak performances at its trading and investment banking units. The stock initially fell as much as 7.8 per cent, weighing on sentiment, only to swing back into the black in late trading.Still, the rally had little effect on the broader financial sector.On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs undermined market sentiment, in spite of posting better-than-expected results, after its analysts warned that US banks might have to raise as much as $65bn in additional capital to shore up balance sheets weakened by the mortgage crisis.As if to confirm those predictions, Fifth Third Bancorp said on Wednesday that it would raise $2bn by selling shares and assets to shore up its balance sheet after nine quarters of declining profit. The Ohio-based bank will also cut its dividend.Morgan added 0.5 per cent to $40.80, Goldman rose 1.9 per cent to $182.77 but Fifth Third slumped 27.3 per cent to $9.26.The S&P 500 financials sector slipped 1.2 per cent while the KBW banking index hit a six-year low.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent at 1,337.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.1 per cent to 12,029.06, hitting a three-month low, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,429.71.On Tuesday, equity markets ended a weak three-day rally, led lower by the financial sector and economic data that triggered further worries about inflation and the housing market.Regional bank shares were sold particularly hard after some negative analyst comments. That trend continued on Wednesday as Fifth Third’s capital-raising weighed on the sector.SunTrust Banks fell 9 per cent to $36.95, Regions Financial dropped 10.4 per cent to $11.40 while Huntington Bancshares slipped 9.5 per cent to $5.52.The FedEx results cast a pall over equity markets and by the end of the day, all 10 leading industrial groups on the S&P 500 retreated into the red.A rise in oil prices did little to help, and the consumer discretionary and staples sectors were among the leading fallers, dropping 1.9 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively.Carmakers led the way down after analysts predicted that US vehicle sales could slump to their lowest in more than 15 years this month as buyers shun the gas-guzzling vehicles that are their bread and butter. General Motors lost 5.9 per cent to $14.89 while Ford slid 5.8 per cent to $6.22.Tyson Foods, the chicken producer, also fell back, slumping 8.2 per cent to $13.68 after Fitch cut its debt to non-investment grade.In other corporate news, MF Global, the broker of exchange-traded futures contracts, tumbled 41 per cent to $7.83 after it said revenues would come in below analysts’ estimates. It added that it planned to sell shares to pay down debt.There were bright spots. Union Pacific said in the week that flooding in the Midwest had disrupted services and damaged its infrastructure – it estimated that the weather would trim second-quarter earnings. However, its shares still rose 4.6 per cent to $75.82 on Wednesday following an upbeat report from Morgan Stanley said rising productivity would offset higher oil prices and boost profit.Peer CSX added 1.3 per cent to $64.20 while trucking company YRC Worldwide added 5.4 per cent to $17.68 after reaffirming its second- quarter guidance.
359;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-05-28T18:24:42Z;D Post adamant on Postbank sale;;Frank Appel, chief executive of Deutsche Post, has accepted that the group must sell its Postbank subsidiary, subject to a good offer for Germany’s biggest retail bank.”I have said that Postbank should participate in consolidation of this industry …and I think we should not increase the exposure of this company to that industry,” Mr Appel told the Financial Times. “If that is the case, we cannot keep Postbank forever. I cannot tell my shareholders to increase their exposure to banking.”Deutsche Post has previously said it was exploring all its options for Postbank and Mr Appel’s comments show the group does want to sell the bank.But he cautioned that a sale did not have to happen “with immediate effect”.”We are seriously considering a potential sale…there has to be a buyer who offers us a good price,” said Mr Appel.He said Deutsche Post would not be forced into a “firesale” of Postbank, which contributes about €1bn of the logistics group’s operating profit.Deutsche Post owns 50 per cent plus one share of Postbank and Wolfgang Klein, chief executive of Postbank, has expressed frustration that the bank’s ability to plan is being hampered by speculation over a sale.“He wants a decision – and I want a decision as well,” said Mr Appel. “We will tell the market when we have made a decision.”Mr Appel refused to comment on what talks have been held with potential buyers.Several banks are interested in Postbank including Commerzbank, Germany’s second-largest bank, which has considered a three-way tie up that would involve Postbank and Dresdner Bank, owned by Allianz, the insurer.Postbank is considered non-core to Deutsche Post’s main logistics business, which the company moved to restructure yesterday by revealing plans to outsource some of its DHL express business in North America to UPS, an industry rival.Mr Appel said he had “no negative sentiments” about a deal with UPS but admitted Deutsche Post had made ”wrong assumptions” about its ability to compete in the US.“We have now to change direction massively,” he said. “We will not go for market share …we are downsizing and making it more profitable.”Shares in Deutsche Post fell by up to 5 per cent after the company announced its restructuring, which will cost up to $2bn and should cut annual losses from its US express business by $1bn by 2011.Mr Appel admitted he had been “negatively surprised” by the reaction. ”The market demanded radical steps – we have taken radical steps,” he said.Mr Appel, who has previously called the losses in the business “unacceptable”, said losses could be tolerated as long as DHL express operations were covering their cost of capital – which under the restructuring plan should happen in 2010.The company warned of widening losses this year in the US express business because of the upheaval but Mr Appel said outside the US economic conditions were holding up well. “We are far away from having a recession in Europe and Asia,” he said.
360;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-05-28T15:21:06Z;D Post enlists UPS in ‘radical’ delivery deal;;DHL’s parent company has turned to an arch-rival to help salvage its lossmaking US express-delivery business, agreeing to pay United Parcel Service $1bn annually to fly customers’ packages between North American cities.Deutsche Post will also shut down 30 per cent of DHL’s US infrastructure and pull out of some areas as part of a restructuring plan that will cost $2bn. The effort aims to stem years of losses at the US express business that may widen this year.For UPS, the arrangement will help ensure its fleet of aircraft remains full even if more of its customers opt for cheaper shipping options than overnight delivery.DHL’s decision to abandon its own air network reflects the company’s failure to loosen UPS’s and FedEx’s grip on the US market, as well as the spiralling cost of jet fuel.Deutsche Post said its underlying earnings would improve by $1bn annually by 2011. Frank Appel, chief executive, said the move was a “radical” solution that would maintain a strong US presence for DHL. Less than 4 per cent of shipments would be affected by the plans to cut infrastructure, the company said.John Mullen, chief executive of DHL Express, said: “We have modelled this extremely carefully …for most customers it will have very little impact.” But up to 10 per cent of the 18,000 staff at DHL’s US Express division could lose their jobs.Both companies will retain their brands under a 10-year contract, with UPS ferrying DHL’s express, deferred and international packages between airports within the US, Canada and Mexico.DHL will still make pick-ups and deliveries, although it will do so using the US Postal Service in some sparsely-populated areas.Shares in Deutsche Post fell by 5 per cent after the announcement of the plan. UPS’s shares jumped 3.4 per cent in midday US trading.The outsourcing agreement would end DHL’s reliance on an ageing and inefficient fleet, according to Deutsche Post.Deutsche Post now expects the underlying loss for its US Express business to widen to $1.3bn before interest and tax. That would be reduced to $500m by 2010 and $300m by 2011 through the restructuring, the company said. Mr Appel did not say the US express business would eventually be profitable, saying it was “not a standalone business”.John Allan, chief financial officer, said the company expected “further erosion” in its US business this year. Deutsche Post cut guidance for underlying earnings before interest and tax this year by 2 per cent to €4.1bn ($6.4bn), but left estimates for 2009 unchanged. “The rest of the group is trading well,” Mr Allan said.
361;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;Korean carriers urge higher fuel surcharges;;South Korea’s two major airlines have asked the government to allow them to raise further fuel surcharges on international routes to offset record high oil prices.Korean Air, the country’s flagship carrier, and Asiana Airlines said they called on the government this month to raise the upper limit of the fuel surcharge system to pass on rising fuel costs to passengers.The government has not responded to the requests yet. Their demand comes as airlines worldwide struggle to cope with fuel costs after oil recently breached $130 per barrel. Jet fuel, the airlines’ biggest expense, has surged nearly 60 per cent this year.Korean Air swung to a net loss of Won325.4bn ($311m) in the first three months of this year and announced on Monday that it would cut or halt some passenger flights on a dozen international routes to reduce costs.Peter Harbison, executive chairman at the Sydney-based Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, said the moves in Korea suggested the Asian sector was “at the beginning of a rationalisation”.Still, UPS, the international delivery company, said on Tuesday that it expected to outpace this year’s anticipated growth of 8 per cent in the Asian air freight sector.Derek Woodward, UPS president for the Asia-Pacific region, said that improved business was being led by booming intra-Asian trade. As an example, UPS has started with better-than-expected demand on the Asian leg of a new Anchorage-Nagoya-Shanghai service that started last week.UPS is not only adding routes but also boosting its fleet capacity in Asia this year by upgrading aircraft. “We’re adding capacity while the passenger side is pulling back,” he said.Still, several legacy carriers have recently posted earnings that showed weakness in their cargo business, including Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong airline, and EVA of Taiwan.Korean Air, which has the world’s largest cargo business among passenger airlines, said on Monday that it would cut flights on some US routes as well as suspending five international routes – one to Vietnam and four to China – from June to mid-July. Most of the Chinese routes suspended depart from provincial cities in Korea.The plight of Korean airlines has been compounded by the weaker won. The local currency has lost about 10 per cent of its value this year against the dollar, increasing the value of the airlines’ dollar-denominated debts and other expenses.
362;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-05-13T06:01:41Z;Event processing: A monitor that can set alarms ringing;;Complex event processing (CEP) is a nascent three-letter acronym for an old concept: a way of sifting masses of business data in real time to enable patterns to be discerned and better business decisions made.It can be thought of, along with Service Oriented Architecture and Business Activity Monitoring, as an essential component of a Business Process Management suite of software.A white paper from BEA Systems, the middleware group now in the process of being taken over by Oracle, says the goal of CEP is to enable information contained in the events flowing through all layers of the organisation to be discovered, understood in terms of its macro-level impact and acted upon in real time.Put together business process management and complex event processing and you get intelligent business processes that react to changing conditions in real time, providing continuous visibility, BEA says.Signals that cause the CEP system to raise an alarm can come either from the outside – a particular item of data causes a reaction – or from the inside, where the system itself polls its sources on a regular basis looking for significant change. Legacy systems are not typically event-driven: this additional layer of software is needed to coordinate their activities.Traditionally, CEP has been the preserve of the financial community, used to support algorithmic trading, where computers are programmed to make automated decisions on when to buy and sell and how to execute a set of orders.Computer systems can act at a speed that would be impossible for any human trader tasked with monitoring separate flows of information – stock prices on one set of screens, for example, and world news on another – looking for correlations that might suggest a trade is desirable.CEP, business activity monitoring and business process management are spreading well beyond the financial services industries, however. Phil Gilbert, president of Lombardi, a specialist US-based BPM software group, says the company has been working with Dell Computer for several years.“With Fedex and UPS we are coordinating Dell’s global computer shipments,” he says. “We receive real-time feeds from third-party logistics carriers for the status of every single shipment.“The moment any of those goes into a ‘distressed’ state, the software fires off a dispatch in real time to people in the call centre based on who the customer is and in what geography. Humans can then deal with the exception and ensure the computer is delivered. Over the course of the past four or five years, this has saved Dell hundreds of millions of dollars.”Dr Giles Nelson, director of technology for the European arm of the US-based group Progress Software, says systems of this kind have been around – but with disadvantages.“Either people would have had to build a bespoke system tailored for a particular use (and therefore expensive and inflexible) or they would have used a database management system,” he says.“All the data would have been brought in and stored in the DBMS which would have been structured to provide answers to queries easily. It would not have scaled. With the quantities of data involved, you would not have been able to get an answer quickly enough.“An event processing system turns the DBMS concept on its head, saying: ‘We know pretty well what question we want, we know what pattern of behaviour we are looking at in all this data’. CEP enables you to do that better.”Dr Nelson objects to use of the term “complex” and last month IBM renamed it “business event processing” in an attempt to demystify the subject. But whatever it is called, it is becoming critical to modern business.Colin Clarke, vice-president for customers at the event processing company StreamBase Systems, points to the dangers that CEP addresses.“Recent high-profile examples such as the meltdown at Société Générale have shown the dangers inherent in relying on anything less than monitoring profit and loss and risk-based exposure in real time, “ he says.“Trading systems that monitor not only for anomalies but also for risks inherent in trading must trigger affirmative, swift action.”He acknowledges the problem of the sheer volume of data modern businesses have to deal with.“Real time profit and loss systems and portfolio stress-testing require platforms able not only to handle tremendous volumes but also to incorporate complicated pricing algorithms that correctly price complex securities while capturing intricate interactions between diverse asset classes,” he argues.Indeed, research across Europe commissioned this year by Progress Software indicated that 75 per cent of business managers are expected to absorb data from at least 11 regions.The demand for comprehensive, accurate and current business information was also found to be acute and 88 per cent of businesses said they needed better information flow up and down the supply chain. Only 50 per cent of businesses canvassed had access to information in real-time.“In a world where large enterprises are bombarded with 1m events a second,” BEA Systems concludes, “CEP is the only technology able to filter out unnecessary data, recognise patterns and aggregate, process and derive composite events that matter.”
363;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-04-23T20:42:20Z;Wall St edges up amid positive results;;Wall Street stocks wobbled back into the black on Wednesday as positive earnings news from technology companies and Boeing helped offset weak results and forecasts from Ambac and UPS.A round of decent quarterly earnings helped make the technology sector one of the leading gainers in the S&P 500.Any momentum for the broader indices, however, was undercut by a pull-back in commodities prices, which encouraged investors to sell related stocks.Dismal results from Ambac, the punch-drunk bond insurer, dragged down financials although acquisitions news helped limit the declines.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,379.98 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.2 per cent at 2,405.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent to 12,763.22.Wednesday’s hesitant advance broke a two-day losing streak triggered by a batch of below-par reports but analysts are beginning to suggest that the worst fears for first-quarter earnings season were unfounded.Doug Peta, market strategist at J&W Seligman, said: “Earnings have been a pleasant surprise since we got past GE’s results …Markets always overshoot at the top and bottom and perhaps pessimism got overdone.”In technology, Molex, the electrical parts maker, surged 15.2 per cent to $28.56, VMware, the software company, gained 4.9 per cent to $60.84 and Broadcom, which makes chips for Nintendo’s Wii video-game console, jumped 16.3 per cent to $27.39.Meanwhile, Apple shares hit $162.70, adding 1.6 per cent to to its recent run after the company confirmed it had bought PA Semi, a microprocessor designer, for $278m in cash.After the close, the positive trend moderated somewhat as Amazon beat first-quarter earnings forecasts but said full-year operating income may be less than earlier predicted. Its shares fell 6.9 per cent to $75.40 in after- hours trading.In materials, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the second-largest copper producer, said first-quarter profit more than doubled but still dropped 2.2 per cent to $116.08 as gold prices fell back. Peers Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold, also lost 1.8 per cent to $43.85 and 4.5 per cent to $40.78, respectively.Aircraft maker Boeing advanced after it said profit rose 38 per cent to $1.2bn in the first quarter as its backlog of orders grew to a record $346bn. Revenue rose 4 per cent to $16bn and the shares added 4.6 per cent to $82.19.Leading the negative surprises on Wednesday was Ambac Financial.The company undershot Wall Street’s worst expectations, posting a net loss of $1.7bn after a $3.1bn charge for subprime mortgage securities.Ambac shares, which have lost 93 per cent of their value in the past year, plunged 41.8 per cent to $3.51. Peer MBIA dived 33.6 per cent to $8.82.However, news that Liberty Mutual Group, the property and casualty insurer, had agreed to buy Safeco, a home and automobile insurer on the West Coast, for about $6.2bn in cash, helped limit the downside in the financial sector. Safeco shares jumped 45.8 per cent to $65.94.Better-than-expected results from Moody’s, the credit rating company, also helped steady the sector. Moody’s shares gained 2.6 per cent to $37.46 while McGraw-Hill, owner of rival Standard & Poor’s, added 3.3 per cent to $39.41.Downbeat results and comments on the US economy from UPS, the industrial bellwether, left investors largely unmoved. Its shares fell just 0.3 per cent to $71.67.The healthcare sector was in focus after results from WellPoint, the health insurer, and drugmaker Schering-Plough.WellPoint climbed 7.3 per cent to $49.94 after it said it would take aggressive remedial action to address a decline in first-quarter profit due to higher claims.Schering-Plough said profit declined 48 per cent to $291m because of costs associated with buying Organon Biosciences for $16bn in November – but the figure was ahead of most analysts’ estimates. Schering gained 6.6 per cent to $18.27.The day’s biggest gainer was the telecommunications sector, which added 2.2 per cent led by Sprint Nextel. Sprint climbed 8.8 per cent to $7.67 in what some analysts called a relief rally after AT&T’s solid results on Tuesday.
364;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;UPS downbeat on outlook for economy;;UPS, the largest package delivery company in the world, cut its earnings forecast after a “dramatic” weakening in the US economy hit its first quarter earnings and said that conditions were not expected to pick up in the near future.The company, which is seen as a bellwether for the US economy, said that domestic shipments of packages had fallen in the quarter and US customers were also opting less for costlier services such as overnight delivery.Net income rose to $906m, or 87 cents a share, in line with projections the company issued in an earnings warning earlier this month. The year before UPS earned $843m, or 78 cents, when one-off costs hit net income. Revenues rose 6.7 per cent to $12.7bn from $11.9bn.“UPS’s first quarter results illustrate the dramatic slowing in the US economy,” said Scott Davis, UPS chairman and chief executive in call with analysts.The company said it was cutting its earnings outlook on expectations of continued economic weakness - only the third time it has done so since going public in 1999.UPS said it was also moving to cut costs - restricting hiring, stopping all “non critical” projects and limiting discretionary spending including business travel to run the business “as tightly as we possibly can”, according to Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer.“We see no signs of economic strengthening in the second quarter,” said Mr Kuehn.UPS forecast earnings per share of $3.90 to $4.20 for the full year, lower than its previous outlook of $4.30 to $4.50 a share.“UPS is hunkering down and tightening its belt,” said UBS analysts in a note. The company is “too exposed to the US economy, with nowhere to hide.”In the domestic business, average daily volume fell by 0.3 per cent to 13.25m packages from 13.29m in the same quarter last year. The fall in volume and a shift to cheaper options hit profit margins, which slipped to 12.4 per cent from an adjusted profit margin of 15.3 per cent in the previous year. Operating profit was down 17 per cent at $959m.“Many of our customers have tightened their belts resulting in a shift away from our premium air products to ground shipments,” said Mr Davis.UPS’ smaller international delivery business also seemed to have suffered, although export volume growth from the US was “strong”. Although average daily volume was up 2.1 per cent at 1.88m packages, operating profit fell to $421m from an adjusted $440m last year, as profit margins fell. The company said it had been hit by higher fuel costs in the quarter.Mr Davis said the company would continue to invest in infrastructure and new products and services in spite of the slowdown.“UPS has successfully managed its operations through many economic cycles and we will do so again,” Mr Davis said.Shares in UPS were little changed in morning trading at $71.85.
365;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-04-15T09:36:49Z;Energy stocks lead mild Asia gains;;Asia-Pacific stock markets failed to find any firm direction on Tuesday, though most managed to close a touch higher. Anxiety about earnings later this week from US banks Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JP Morgan kept the mood cautious, as did disappointing results from UPS overnight.Energy-related stocks across the region, particularly those of Australian resources companies and Japanese trading houses, rallied after US crude oil set a new record high of $112.48 in Asia amid supply disruptions and a weaker dollar. Oil was recently trading around $112.28 per barrel.Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed up 0.6 per cent at 12,990.58 after rising as much as 1 per cent initially. The broader Topix rose 0.8 per cent to 1,255.97. JGBs pulled back after Monday’s gains, with 10-year June futures dropping 0.27 point to 139.63.The yen was initially weaker in the Asian session, trading below Y101 to the dollar. But the Japanese currency strengthened later in the day and recently traded at Y100.90.Trading company Mitsui & Co. gained 2.1 per cent to Y2,460 and rival Mitsubishi Corp. rose 2.3 per cent to Y3,590. Australia’s Woodside Petroleum rallied 2.7 per cent to A$55.77. Oil Search surged 4.6 per cent to A$4.99 after saying it would sell its Middle East and North African unit to Kuwait Energy Co for US$200m plus working capital.Gold rose in Asia, trading around $934.60 from $925.70 late in New York, spurring the shares of precious metal miners. Sumitomo Metal Mining gained 4.6 per cent to Y2,025, while Australia’s Newcrest Mining climbed 2.7 per cent to A$33.47.Australian stocks closed up 1.1 per cent at 5,400.4, with the biggest news for the bourse being insurance company IAG’s rejection of larger rival QBE Insurance’s takeover bid as being too low. IAG shares surged 8.6 per cent to A$4.19 while QBE dropped 1.3 per cent to A$22.90.The higher oil price was not good news for airlines. China Southern Airlines slid 3.3 per cent to HK$5.00, Qantas dropped 3 per cent to A$3.51, and JAL fell 2 per cent to Y240.Trading in Hong Kong was choppy. The Hang Seng managed to recoup early losses to end up 0.3 per cent at 23,888.55.

366;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:15:04+0000;US earnings;;Springtime has arrived on Wall Street and the clouds are gathering. By the end of April, almost two-thirds of S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents will have reported their first-quarter results. Performance so far has been uninspiring. Wachovia’s surprise loss on Monday came on the heels of General Electric missing analysts’ estimates and cutting its guidance for the year. Investors had not discounted such outcomes – both stocks plunged by double digits in percentage terms on the news.There is a lingering view in the market that the rot is confined to the financial sector. Poor performance in GE’s financial business was the main reason for the group missing forecasts, but its industrial and healthcare divisions also disappointed. Last week, Alcoa, which ought to be riding high amid the commodities boom, missed the consensus estimate. Meanwhile, UPS cut its first-quarter guidance on a gloomier outlook for the US economy and high fuel prices.Wall Street has slashed second-half estimates for the financial sector, but forecasts for the rest of the S&P 500 have barely moved. For the index as a whole, analysts still expect earnings growth of 11.6 per cent this year and 16.8 per cent in 2009, according to Thomson Research. Tighter credit, however, is a leading indicator of problems in the wider economy. Citigroup sees the lag between credit conditions beginning to worsen and industrial activity slowing down at about nine months.At 14 times 2008 earnings, bulls argue the S&P 500 trades at trough valuation levels. Morgan Stanley, however, calculates that in the past two recessions, annual consensus forecasts ended up being revised downwards by 30 per cent or more from their original levels. Apply that scenario to the current consensus and the S&P 500’s forward price/earnings ratio leaps to a much less appetising 19 times.Post and read comments on this Lex
367;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-04-11T20:34:23Z;Wall Street soured by poor GE results;;Wall Street stocks slumped on Friday and were down for the week after results from industrial bellwether General Electric missed estimates, re-igniting concerns that corporate profits would not escape financial market turmoil.GE blamed disruptions in global capital markets for poor performance at its finance divisions, which had the sharpest first-quarter profit declines.Investors and analysts were unimpressed. Goldman Sachs downgraded GE’s shares, saying the decline in profit raised “credibility concerns”, given that the chief executive reassured the market that the company was on target in mid-March.GE was the leading faller in the S&P500, sliding 12.8 per cent, its biggest one-day drop since 1987, to $32.05.The results were particularly unnerving for investors who bought into diversified and globalised industrial conglomerates in the hope that they would offer a haven from the problems of the US economy.Tyco International fell 3.5 per cent to $44.28, while United Technologies lost 3.2 per cent to $69.53 and Paccar, the truck manufacturer, sagged 3.7 per cent to $44.63. Those losses made industrials the worst performing sector of the week.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 2 per cent lower at 1,332.86 points and lost 2.7 per cent over the week, its worst performance in over a month.The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.6 per cent on Friday, and 3.4 per cent over the week, to 2,290.24 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2 per cent, and 2.3 per cent over the week, to 12,325.59 points.GE’s results squashed any lingering optimism after improved forecasts by Wal-Mart helped stocks to rally on Thursday.Randy Frederick, director or derivatives at Charles Schwab, said: “Much as some economists would like to believe that the Fed has solved all of these problems and that the worst is over, I am not convinced. I think this earnings season is going to be fairly weak.”“Volatility indices have been trickling lower but eventually bad news will compound and markets won’t be able to shrug it off any more. I think you have seen the start of that with GE’s results today.”Over the week, an index of financials fell 4.6 per cent.Washington Mutual, the largest US savings and loan group, secured a $7bn dollar capital infusion but also forecast $1.1bn first-quarter losses.WaMu fell on Friday, slipping 4.1 per cent after Goldman Sachs analysts cut their earnings estimates for the bank and recommended selling the shares short.But the stock ended the week 7.7 per cent ahead at $10.95.An index of investment banking stocks was down 6.3 per cent over the week, led by Lehman Brothers, which fell 9.5 per cent in the period to $39.87.The first-quarter earnings season kicked off with disappointing results from Alcoa, the aluminium producer, on Monday.It worsened on Wednesday, when United Parcel Service, another bellwether of the US economy, predicted that profits would fall as a domestic slowdown took effect and rising energy prices increased costs.Alcoa fell 9.9 per cent to $35.15 over the week, while UPS’s shares gave up 4.7 per cent to $71.89 and dragged down related stocks such a transport companies.Since the new year analysts have consistently revised down their forecasts but at the start of the week they were still predicting earnings growth of about 7 per cent for the S&P 500, excluding financials.In a week light on data, what emerged was mostly negative. Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan, dropped again and in March sales at comparable chain stores fell 0.5 per cent, while clothing and department store sales tumbled by much more.Gap lost 5.8 per cent to $17.95, Dillards shed 8.9 per cent to $20.07, while Bed Bath & Beyond, which reported disappointing forecasts earlier in the week, slipped 4.3 per cent to $30.23 over the week.Still, there were winners. Wal-Mart shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $54.80 over the week after the world’s biggest retailer announced improved sales and forecasts as consumers downshifted to value-brands.Energy stocks were only ones to find a modicum of consistent growth however, as oil hit new record prices before easing back and coal producers pushed through significant price increases.Over the week, Peabody Energy added, 7 per cent to $61.07 while Halliburton climbed 6 per cent to $43.52 and Apache rose 4.4 per cent to $131.93.Semiconductor firms Micron Technology and LSI held their ground after upgrades and news that a competitor had successfully increased its prices.Micron added 2.1 per cent to $6.90 over the weekwhile LSI slipped 0.5 per cent to $5.46.
368;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-04-11T18:21:59Z;Investors’ nerves take toll in Europe;;A nervous week for Europe’s stock markets ended badly after US conglomerate General Electric revealed a sharp drop in profits, exacerbating investors’ fears that the impending earnings season will be bleak.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.4 per cent Friday to 1,284.71, its fourth successive decline and its worst one-day drop since mid-March.The index shed 2.6 per cent over the week.Patrik Schowitz, European equities strategist at HSBC, said investors were preoccupied with the impending first-quarter earnings season, which gathers pace in the US next week when major banks report results.“If the earnings are okay, then the market is very attractively valued,” he said.“But it’s hard to know how earnings will pan out, especially with financials, which is where everyone’s looking.”European banks and insurers had another choppy week but slammed into negative territory after GE said the primary reason for results missing expectations was its financial services businesses.Commerzbank fell 6.9 per cent to €20.54, Allied Irish Banks shed 5.6 per cent to €13.17 and Credit Suisse lost 3.9 per cent to SFr54.10.Several other US bellwethers reported disappointing results this week and their impact rippled quickly across the Atlantic.Postal companies Deutsche Post and TNT fell after UPS, their US competitor, cut its quarterly earnings outlook, citing worsening economic conditions and high fuel costs.Deutsche Post lost 1.5 per cent to €20.05 while Dutch group TNT shed 2.9 per cent to €24.13.Europe’s tech stocks fell foul of the same phenomenon after a set of grim results from Advanced Micro Devices in the US.Infineon fell 5.6 per cent to €4.73, also hampered by a downgrade from Credit Suisse.STMicroelectronics fell 6.5 per cent to €6.82. The chipmaker said on Thursday it would merge its wireless chip business with its Dutch rival NXP, “creating scale in a market with too many players”. But rating agencies Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch put STM on watch for possible downgrade afterthe company said it would pay NXP $1.55bn to own 80 per cent of the new venture.Oil stocks surged in mid-week after the price of crude oil spiked above $112 dollars a barrel. In spite of it tailing off Friday afternoon, Galp Energia added 2.1 per cent to €15.56 and Statoil Hydro gained 4.6 per cent to NKr164.60.Investors have begun to see the stocks as a temporary haven ahead of the earnings season, analysts said, because their earnings are expected to grow 25 per cent.The energy sector enjoyed a week in the spotlight as Europe’s big energy companies stalked British Energy, sparking hopes of a bidding war.RWE, Centrica and EDF Energy were all looking at buying the company, with RWE proposing an offer of just under 700p a share.British Energy’s shares were the main beneficiary, while RWE was driven down 4.1 per cent to €77.90 and EDF ended the week 0.1 per cent lower at €60.50.The retail sector had a difficult week. Carrefour’s shares were hit after Jose Luis Duran, chief executive, said retailers were facing their “most significant challenge in a generation”.Carrefour shares fell 7.6 per cent to €45.87, although the company reiterated its target to grow sales by between 6 and 8 per cent.
369;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
370;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-04-09T20:49:57Z;Wall St sags after disappointing earnings;;Wall Street stocks fell the most in eleven days as the unfolding first-quarter earnings season highlighted mounting concerns about the outlook for the US economy while record oil prices also weighed on sentiment.United Parcel Service, the logistics and package-delivery group, dropped 3.7 per cent to $70.57 after it cut its first-quarter earnings estimate, saying that domestic shipments were slowing as the US economy weakens.The company is seen as a bellwether of the wider business environment and its pre-announcement will add to concerns that the US economic slowdown, long debated by experts, is starting to be felt in the corporate world.“We think UPS’s numbers are clearly saying ‘recession’,” Rick Paterson, an analyst at UBS said.“UPS is the big dog in the transport space, hence we think FedEx will also take it on the chin and this profit warning will also resonate with US trucking, railroad, and logistics equities.” FedEx shares fell 3.1 per cent to $93.11.A broad-based sell off sent the benchmark S&P 500 index down for a second succesive session. It lost 0.8 per cent to 1,354.49 points. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,322.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4 per cent to 12,527.26.Retailers were in focus after Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings group, said fourth quarter profit fell as declining home values hit consumer spending.The company also forecast first-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ estimates.Bed Bath shares fell 4.7 per cent to $29.47 in the run up to the annoucement. Earlier in the day analysts at Piper Jaffray downgraded from “neutral” to “sell”.Amazon, the online retailer, lost 3.8 per cent to $74.39 and Google fell 0.8 per cent to $464.19 after Lehman Brothers said its first-quarter profits were at risk from an economic slowdown.Circuit City, the harassed electronics retailer, swung unexpectedly into profit in the fourth quarter, thanks to a round of cost-cutting. But it said it expected to post a loss in the first quarter, reinforcing impressions that plummeting consumer confidence is begging to take its toll on the high street. Shares in the group, which have lost more than three-quarters of their value in the past year, fell 1.8 per cent to $4.45.Homebuilders dragged on the consumer discretionary sector for a second day. Lennar dropped 7.3 per cent to $18.54 while Pulte Homes lost 6.2 per cent to $14.01.The news was not all bad though. Sealy, the bedding manufacturer, and California Pizza Kitchen, the chain restaurant operator, jumped after beating analysts’ earning estimates with their reported and forecast first quarter results.Sealy jumped 9 per cent to $7.74 while California bounced 5 per cent to $15.Industrial conglomerates, which were downgraded by analysts on Tuesday, were mixed. Boeing shares rose 4.8 per cent to $78.60, after it said delays to the 787 Dreamliner would not impact on its 2008 profit forecasts. But UPS’s outlook weighed on the sector and knocked transport stocks. Ryder System fell 4.4 per cent to $61.29.On Tuesday technology stocks bore the brunt of investor irritation, after a number of companies posted disappointing first-quarter results and forecasts.That trend continued on Wednesday with poor results and forecasts from FormFactor, a maker of chip-testing equipment, and Spansion, a maker of memory chips for mobile phones. FormFactor dropped 2.9 per cent to $18.90 while Spansion lost 0.3 per cent to $2.99.Still, news that a Japanese memory maker had raised prices helped buoy US peers. Micron advanced 3.5 per cent to $6.77. SanDisk climbed 6.5 per cent to $27.21.Downtrodden financial stocks fell again on Wednesday, hitting their lowest levels this month after a number of companies reported increased holdings of hard to value securities.An index of financial stocks dipped 1.8 per cent, while the S&P 500 investment banking index dopped 3 per cent, led by Lehman Brothers, which fell 7.2 per cent to $40.54.The three largest US mortgage insurers also tumbled after Standard & Poor’s cut their ratings. MGIC Investment fell 5.1 per cent to $10.90, PMI Group slipped 8.3 per cent to $5.66 and Radian Group plunged 12.6 per cent to $5.14.Even Citigroup, initially made ground on reports that it planned to sell nearly $12bn in leveraged loans, closed down 0.8 per cent at $23.58.Energy stocks were the only ones to end the day in the black. The sector gained for its eighth session in a row after oil prices hit record highs. Chevron added 0.8 per cent to $89.95, while Exxon Mobil rose 0.1 per cent to $89.70.
371;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-03-25T10:20:11Z;Logistics: Big three seek ways to keep delivering;;For the first three weeks of 2008, US businesses and consumers continued to ship packages and parcels ahead of the pace they set a year earlier, undaunted by a spate of gloomy headlines and government reports on the weakening health of the nation’s economy.By late January, as though corporate America’s optimism that the downturn would soon pass had drained, they began to slow, according to United Parcel Service. UPS, the world’s biggest package-delivery company, announced on March 12 that volume at its domestic business was mired in a six-week slump.UPS, FedEx and Deutsche Post’s DHL, the trio of big integrated logistics companies, pride themselves on their vast global reach and indispensable role in facilitating international trade. But UPS’s warning served as the latest reminder that their fortunes remain closely tied to that of the world’s largest economy. More than 45 per cent of the world’s shipments are tied to American companies, says John Mullen, chief executive of DHL Express. “The greatest worry for us is the US,” he says. “The general US economic situation is of particular concern.”The country’s gross domestic product, which expanded at a rate of 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, may have slowed further during the first three months of 2008. Housing prices have declined, employers are trimming payrolls, and consumer confidence has slipped to its lowest level since the start of the Iraq War in 2003.If the malaise does not lift soon, UPS says, the company will fall short of its quarterly profit forecast of 94-98 cents a share. The Atlanta-based group’s international-package and supply-chain arms remained on track to meet their goals.UPS today produces about 30 per cent of its revenue and profit outside the US.“Our goal obviously is to increase that,” says Scott Davis, UPS chief executive.In a strategy adopted more than 10 years ago, UPS has sought to reduce its dependence on the fleet of brown trucks that ferry packages in the US. Through acquisitions, partnerships and organic expansion, UPS’s package operations serve more than 200 countries.By 2010, the company expects to generate 40 per cent of its operating profit from its international, supply-chain management and freight divisions.UPS first sold stock to the public in 1999 after almost 100 years under private ownership. Mr Davis, elevated to the top post in January, is the first UPS chief executive who has not spent his entire career at the company.Investors expect that Mr Davis, a former chief financial officer, will help redefine UPS as an “enabler of global commerce” that is “standing on the doorstep of tremendous opportunity”, as he said during a March presentation.That will mean shaking UPS’s reputation as a stodgy company unwilling to flex its financial muscles to pursue opportunities for growth. Its shares have trailed those of arch-rival FedEx in six of the past eight years.Less than two weeks after Mr Davis’s promotion, UPS unveiled a new balance-sheet strategy in which the company will take on more debt to buy back stock and make acquisitions. For years it maintained the highest corporate investment grade, a strategy that investors argued no longer made sense given its financial strength and potential for higher growth.As the company that invented the overnight-delivery industry in 1971, FedEx executives have not had to persuade Wall Street that they will move boldly to spur growth. Like UPS, the company has braced for a slowdown in the US.FedEx twice trimmed its fiscal-year earnings forecast in late 2007, in part because of weakening demand for US freight. To avoid another warning, the company will count on cost controls and growth from its international express delivery arm.FedEx has also faced a slew of lawsuits from contracted drivers claiming the company treats them as full-time employees without the same benefits, and a US Internal Revenue Service audit on the way those drivers were classified. The company has said it does not expect that the IRS’s rulings will result in losses.“We’re not getting any resolution any time soon,” says Jon Langenfeld, an analyst with Robert W Baird.The same cannot be said for DHL’s future in the US. Deutsche Post said it would reveal its plan for the business in May.Deutsche Post furthered its push into the US with the 2003 purchase of Airborne Express, an overnight-delivery company, and has invested more than €2bn ($3bn) on the network, according to HSBC Global Research analysts.“We have our own specific issues,” Mr Mullen says. “We tried to enter a market, where we have been pretty successful. But it has come at a huge financial price.”The business, which remains a distant third in market share behind UPS and FedEx, continues to lose money. The mounting losses, including a fourth-quarter charge of $922m, has compelled Deutsche Post to review its options for the business and encouraged speculation that the German postal group will withdraw from the US.After the writedown, Deutsche Post’s quarterly net income fell from €649m to €255m. Annual profit dropped from €1.92bn to €1.39bn.The company says it does not intend to exit the market completely.“We invested a huge amount of money in building a third alternative in the US,” Mr Mullen says. “We’re not about to walk away from that.“We have to find a solution that allows us to maybe scale back our ambitions from trying to be all things to all people, to match them in every zip code, every product.”
372;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Entrepreneurial way to deliver a package;;When Scott Davis sold II Morrow, a “little technology company in Oregon”, to United Parcel Service, he figured it would not be long before he left the package-delivery behemoth for another startup.“I really had no intention of staying at a big company like UPS,” Mr Davis told the Financial Times. “I’m an entrepreneur.”Mr Davis’s restlessness faded quickly, however, once he began to recognise the opportunities that lay ahead for his new employer, and his own career, as UPS began its transformation from a stodgy domestic courier to one of corporate America’s truly global companies.His perseverance has paid off. In January, Mr Davis became the first UPS chief executive who did not start his career at the company handling packages or driving one of its ubiquitous brown trucks.Twenty-two years after the II Morrow deal, Mr Davis stood before a roomful of investors and analysts at New York’s Grand Hyatt hotel hoping to persuade his audience to give UPS a chance, too.Wall Street has high hopes for Mr Davis, a known quantity from his years as chief financial officer.He is expected to continue to extend UPS’s reach abroad, reducing the company’s dependence on a domestic package business that ebbs and flows with the US economy, and shake up a culture whose conservative sensibilities, some say, has at times hindered its growth.The company’s shares have trailed those of archrival FedEx in six of the past eight full years since UPS first sold stock to the public in 1999, following almost a 100 years under private ownership.Mr Davis sees his role as merely executing a plan his predecessors, including his immediate one, Mike Eskew, helped shape.“Mike Eskew was the architect for where we are today,” Mr Davis said.“He did all the hard work, he did the acquisitions, the integrations. We’re in a position now where we’re hopefully able to reap the rewards.”UPS now operates in more than 200 countries, boasts the world’s ninth-largest fleet of aircraft and manages the supply chains of corporate clients ranging from retailers to technology equipment manufacturers.And analysts say Mr Davis has begun to make a mark.Less than two weeks after he succeeded Mr Eskew as chief executive, UPS unveiled plans to borrow as much as $10bn to buy back stock and make acquisitions.UPS’s once-stodgy culture may also continue to evolve under Mr Davis. A visitor to the cafeteria in the company’s airy Atlanta headquarters last year could not help but notice the prevalence of men sporting white shirts and ties – a by-product of UPS’s buttoned-down culture.Mr Davis said he would also take steps to assure more women and foreign nationals hold key management posts, so that they, as he once did, were able to see a path to the top.While Mr Davis and his colleagues may never be accused of mimicking the candour of Fred Smith, the celebrated entrepreneur who runs FedEx, the UPS team’s detailed overview of their businesses at the company’s investor meeting this month pleased analysts.“They’re starting to thaw,” Dan Ortwerth, an Edward Jones analyst, said of UPS.“The change of leadership turned up the dial on the gas burner on the stove, increasing the rate of that thaw.”
373;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-03-24T22:10:09Z;UPS chief urges investment;;The US must reinvest in its ageing, overused transportation networks or risk losing ground to the world’s other leading economies, United Parcel Service’s chief executive said.Scott Davis told the Financial Times that the nation’s private sector should seek out opportunities to partner with transportation authorities to help modernise the infrastructure that underpins the US economy.“We’ve got to work very closely with the government to look ahead and take a candid look at where we are,” said Mr Davis, who took over as chief executive of UPS, the world’s largest package-delivery company, in January. “It’s so critical to the future competitiveness of the US that we build the transportation infrastructure that we need.”The US may need to spend $1,600bn in the next five years to restore its infrastructure to good condition, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.While some state and local governments have sought investors to help fund infrastructure improvements, the programmes often meet resistance from politicians and consumer advocates concerned that the arrangements cede control of a steady source of revenue to private entities.Repairing and upgrading ageing roads and bridges, antiquated air-traffic control systems and overcrowded ports and railways would help ensure the US remains a viable trading partner, Mr Davis said. Total cross-border transactions may swell to more than $70bn by 2025, compared with $10bn last year.“If we sit still, we may get left out of global trade,” Mr Davis said. “That’s the danger for the US. Just think of the problems we’re going to have with the ports and the highways and the airports and the rails.”In spite of its global reach, the US remains the Atlanta-based company’s biggest and most important market.UPS underscored its continued dependence on the US this month, warning that a drop in demand for domestic package deliveries, which had set in by February, may leave the company short of its quarterly profit forecast in spite of growth from its international and supply-chain management businesses. FedEx, UPS’s arch-rival, cited the same concerns for the US economy last week.
374;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;FedEx warns of fuel costs and weak economy;;FedEx warned that mounting fuel costs and a weak US economy, which crimped quarterly profit, may weigh on the package-delievery company’s results well into its next fiscal year.The company’s outlook echoed that of arch-rival United Parcel Service, whose executives noted last week that domestic shipments began to ebb in late January.“FedEx faces a challenging economic environment that includes persistently high oil prices, sluggish US growth and continued concerns in the credit markets,” Fred Smith, FedEx’s chief executive, said in a statement.Net income for the fiscal third quarter slipped 6 per cent to $393m, or $1.26 a share, as fuel costs and other operating expenses outpaced a 10 per cent increase in revenue. Demand slackened for US express packages, less-than-truckload shipments, and copy and printing services.The Memphis-based company, which forecast that fourth-quarter profit will fall to $1.60-$1.80 from $1.96, trimmed its annual capital-spending budget to $3bn.“Looking ahead to our fiscal 2009, we are expecting a continuation of fourth-quarter trends, which would result in limited earnings growth next year,” Alan Graf, FedEx chief financial officer said. “We are scrutinising all expenses and investments to realign them with the current environment.”
375;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Deutsche Post set to reveal plan for DHL arm;;Deutsche Post is to reveal in May how it intends to sort out its troubled US express delivery business, the logistics group’s new chief executive said after an impairment charge of almost €600m ($922m) reduced fourth-quarter profits.Losses in the “flawed” business were “unacceptable”, while the faltering US economy had caused further problems at the end of the year, Frank Appel said.But Deutsche Post said it expected group pre-tax profits to reach €3.2bn this year, against €2.19bn last year – the first time it has given guidance for this measure. It reiterated that underlying earnings before interest and tax should be €4.2bn.Two weeks after taking over as chief executive, a cautious Mr Appel said he would not be pressured into judgments about the future of Postbank, the German retail bank in which Deutsche Post holds a majority stake.Deutsche Post is expected to initiate a sale of Postbank this year and interest would be expected to be strong from German rivals lacking a strong retail banking base.Postbank, which gained 1m customers last year, was “a luxury problem” that would allow Deutsche Post to play an active role in German banking consolidation, said Mr Appel, who refused to set a timetable for a possible sale.DHL, Deutsche Post’s express subsidiary, has only a small market share in the US behind UPS and FedEx.But Mr Appel, who was propelled into the top job after Klaus Zumwinkel stepped down last month amid a probe into his tax affairs, said pulling out of the US express business was not an option.Axel Funhoff, an analyst at ING, said Deutsche Post might seek a cost-cutting tie-up with FedEx that would allow it to maintain international deliveries in the US and outsource its domestic service.After a €594m write-down in the US express business, group fourth-quarter net income fell from €649m to €255m, while annual net income declined from €1.92bn to €1.39bn.Underlying earnings rose 7.6 per cent to €3.76bn and should reach €4.7bn in 2009, Deutsche Post said.Annual revenues rose almost 5 per cent to €63.5bn. Earnings per share fell from 1.6p to 1.15p.John Allan, chief financial officer, said Deutsche Post remained committed to returning more cash to shareholders via an increased dividend and had agreed property sales of €350m since November.Acquisition spending of €300m in 2007 was “the lowest for many years”, Mr Allan said.

By Philip Roth
Meridian Fiction 1959
Cover by Paul RandThe designer of this cover, Paul Rand (1914-1996), was one of America’s most celebrated modernist graphic designers. He is best known for the corporate logos he designed for IBM, the United Parcel Services, Westinghouse, Chanel and Armani among others, which were in use for decades.Rand taught design at Yale University, was art director at Esquire magazine and authored several design manifestos proclaiming that good ideas, while hard to come by, are a designer’s raison d’etre. But Rand also designed dozens of book covers. His 1959 jacket for the Meridian edition of Goodbye, Columbus and 5 Short Stories – Philip Roth’s first book, is Rand at his peak. The title novella is about a summer romance between two young Jewish-Americans in 1950s New Jersey.The cover is split horizontally into two equally sized panels. The top half shows a woman’s lipstick print, her lips parted in anticipation, set against a plain background. Below are blue, asymmetrical stars adorning handwritten, cursive lettering. The lipstick traces, which Rand is said to have laboured over, are suggestive not only of the novella’s lusty contents, but also absence – Roth’s lovers eventually part. The patriotic red and blue colours are fitting for a novel essentially about class differences in postwar America.The cover was made when Rand was at the vanguard of the US modernist design movement and known for typefaces that were both legible and communicative; here, script enhances the physicality of the cover. It is the embodiment of Rand’s conceit that a cover should be informed by and also embellish the books contents. “Visual communications of any kind,” Rand wrote in his influential Thoughts on Design from 1945, “from billboards to birth announcements, should be seen as the embodiment of form and function: the integration of the beautiful and the useful.”"

It lost its triple-A rating from Moody’s Investors Service last month after paying more than $6bn to exit an employee pension plan.That payment, along with a contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, gave UPS the clarity it needed on future cash needs to take on additional debt, UPS said.The company has said it wants to expand its small-package delivery network internationally and recently struck deals in the UK, China and Poland.S&P cut UPS’s rating three notches, from triple-A to AA on Wednesday, following the company’s announcement.The new policy marks the first large initiative unveiled during the nine-day-old Scott Davis era. The former UPS chief financial officer succeeded Mike Eskew as chief executive this month.
378;UPS;United Parcel Service;2008-01-03T07:39:15Z;Lessons from Nestleé’s coffee break;;It is the New Year: time to make resolutions and decide which Christmas presents we actually want to keep. The best thing Santa brought this year was a gadget I want to show off to friends: not an iPod or a Wii, but a Nespresso machine.Nestlé’s star product has pride of place beside our kettle and I enjoy sliding aluminium pods of coffee into the slot at the top, pushing a green-lit button and watching a rather nice shot of espresso gurgle out and into a cup, covered with Crema that I used only to get at Starbucks or other coffee bars.That thrill may soon disappear, but there are other things to appreciate. One is the dozen shiny-coloured “grand cru” pods the machine takes. When I buy them online (as one of 3.1m members of the Nespresso club) they will be delivered to our home by a UPS man in a uniform of a similar brown to the “Livanto” pod, which holds a “uniquely rounded and well-balanced espresso characterised by delicate woody and cereal notes”.Then there are the Nespresso boutiques – not just plain bars – where I can feed my Nespresso habit. I visited the one in Bloomingdale’s in Soho, New York, this week and was served a seasonal almond espresso shot (not as bad as it sounds). The boutique itself, one of 40 intended for the US, has the feel of Switzerland rather than Seattle. Instead of velvet sofas and comfy music, it has hard surfaces, bright colours and European hostesses.Stop there, you may think. I want to drink coffee, not join a cult. And there is something about all this – matching machines and pods, George Clooney advertisements in Europe, Sharon Stone’s unveiling of its flagship boutique on the Champs Elysées – that is totalitarian. Nespresso is “an experience” rather than coffee, Nestlé told analysts last year and, boy, is it all-enveloping.But one cannot argue with success. Nobody forced Santa to spend $229 on the Nespresso Essenza machine in my home, nor me to buy pods at $5.40 for 10. Yet Nestlé leads the global market in “single-serve coffee”, as the burgeoning category is known, and its customers bought 1.4m Nespresso machines and 2.3bn pods in 2006.There must be lessons here.One is that there is surprisingly strong demand for goods and services that are a step below luxury but a cut above the ordinary – call them premium, luxe or “affordable luxury”. It did not occur to me before the Nespresso came along that I ever needed such a thing. Now that I have it, however, I am attached to it.The trick is to make such goods alluring and to set a price that is steep but affordable. UK newspaper executives sometimes moan that consumers refuse to pay 50p for a newspaper when they spend £2 on a coffee at Starbucks, but a newspaper is not the same thing as a Starbucks espresso. A shot of Nespresso – essentially – is the same.“People can have their own coffee shop at home. They save because, even though it is more expensive than drip coffee, it is still a third of the price of Starbucks,” says Jay Brewer, founder of singleservecoffee.com, a website devoted entirely to, well, you get the idea.A second lesson is that you can make more money with a combination of goods and services than by simply selling objects alone. Nestlé is only one among many companies that saw the opportunity for pod coffee machines. Philips and Douwe Egberts produce the Senseo machine, Kraft and Braun the Tassimo and Keurig, the US office coffee machine maker, has its own range of home devices.Nespresso is not only the most expensive contender, but the most proprietary. Many roasters make “K-Cup” pods to fit in Keurig machines and other machines are, to differing degrees, open to other pod-makers. But the only pods which fit a Nespresso machine are Nespresso pods and you can only buy them through Nespresso.There is an obvious similarity between this and Apple’s iPod/iTunes combination, which comprises a physical device and an online service to fill it up. But Nestlé does not even have to share its revenues with others in the way that Apple does with music companies, apart from paying coffee growers for beans and film stars for endorsements.A third lesson is that some products are tricky to launch because they require co-operation between various industries – iPod/iTunes being an example. Since you need both a machine and coffee to make espresso, all kinds of partnerships and joint ventures have been launched by food companies and device makers.Nestlé did not make machines, nor did it have an established espresso brand – it was most famous, when I was young, for making Nescafé freeze-dried instant coffee. But it launched a new brand in Italy and Switzerland, made deals with machine manufacturers and steadily extended its presence around the world.That leads to my final lesson, which is that successes usually do not occur overnight. Nestlé patented some of its pod technology in 1976 and did not start making Nespresso machines until 1986. Even then, it largely confined its efforts to commercial machines: a decade ago, it was selling only 75,000 machines a year.By the time manufacturers were able to turn out high-pressure espresso machines for less than $300 each, it had the technology and the brand to sell direct to consumers. That has left companies with more established espresso and cappuccino brands – including Starbucks and Illy – trying to catch up.Thus, despite the naff eurotrash marketing and unsettling boutique decor, there is a lot to emulate about how Nespresso has inveigled itself into my home (and those of a few others in New York this Christmas, to judge by a straw poll).With that, it is time for my morning cappuccino.john.gapper@ft.comPost and read comments at John Gapper’s blog

All it was doing was making the decision legally binding so it could not be reversed. Sensitive sectors such as domestic delivery and storage at ports and airports would remain closed.“There will be no effect on the terms of competition and no supplier of such delivery services will receive any advantage,” said spokeswoman Susan Schwab, the day after the deal. It would not involve “any change in US law and practice”.An official added that this had “real value” and the EU agreed. “It gives the sector legal certainty. There is real value in binding the commitments,” said a spokesman for Peter Mandelson, the EU trade commissioner.However, company officials and their lobbyists on both sides of the Atlantic are not so sure. “To us, this market was already liberalised and we have been operating in it for many years. It is too early to evaluate what long-term benefits this decision would have,” said a spokesman for the German courier.TNT, the Dutch operator that has a 1 per cent hold in the US market, said: “De facto nothing really changes although current affairs are legally better backed through the WTO.”Market leader UPS declined to comment. “We’re looking into the details,” FedEx spokesman Howard Clabo said.A USTR official said it was “a rebalancing of legal commitments”. Nao Matsukata, a former USTR official who is now policy adviser at Alston & Bird, the law firm, said his old office appeared to be attempting to stop short of legal changes that would require congressional sanction. “If they have agreed legally binding commitments that must have the approval of Congress as they do not have fast-track authority. I would expect to see congressional leaders taking a look at this,” he said. His firm works for a financial services company with interest in the case.World Trade Organisation officials said that it was up to the US and trading partners to agree adequate compensation between them. Washington would then notify the WTO of changes to US services commitments.Additional reporting by Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington
380;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-12-19T16:03:28Z;Going undercover in the corporate workplace;;"Curious to know what happens behind the ”employees only” doors of some of America’s biggest companies, business journalist Alex Frankel went undercover to find out how these giants try to win the hearts and minds of their thousands of retail and service employees.His book, Punching In, is reviewed by the FT here. and recounts his experiences at half-dozen companies including UPS, Gap, Starbucks and the Apple Store. He answered your questions on corporate culture on Wednesday 19 December.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..After your experiences, did you admire the people who do those jobs all the time, or think that they were being exploited?
Trudy, LondonAlex Frankel: I came away feeling admiration for most of the people with whom I worked. The places where I worked tended to spend a bit more per hour on their employees than other employers and this made them workplaces where the focus on people was higher than in other lower paid places. Also, because of the transient nature of the front-line jobs where I worked, I found that if people were truly unhappy they would often leave for other better offers. (If Gap was not working out, people would leave for H&M.)Enterprise Rent-A-Car was the one workplace out of the five where I worked where I found the employer to be a bit disingenuous in terms of what it promised employees and what those employees got in return. A lot of the new hires I met seemed to understand this discrepancy so I did not view them as exploited as much as playing along with a less than ideal system with the hopes of eventually profiting from their commitment to the rather long hours and demands of the job.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Isn¹t most of the reason people work hard or not innate? Can a corporate culture really transform a lazy, clockwatcher into employee of the month?
Sergei, FranceAlex Frankel: It is probably rare that a corporate culture will transform a lazy person into a shining example of an employee. That said, if a person who might have not applied themselves in other jobs finds a workplace where he or she really feels as if he or she fits in and feels as if the job has meaning and makes life worthwhile, then that person may indeed rise to the occasion and give more to the job than he or she might have elsewhere.Companies that are in tune with their hiring and development of workers know that selection of workers is key so that the ranks of workers are chiefly filled with people who match the spirit of the organisation. This was a key finding I had in working at five retail companies.From the outside if might have appeared that places like Gap, The Apple Store, and Starbucks were all hiring from the same talent pool, what I found was that each company had its own criteria for finding people.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..If you were creating a retail chain today, what would be the essential elements of the workplace you would have to ensure all your staff worked hard and effectively. Are there examples of companies that already do these things?
AnonAlex Frankel: Great question. I would start by identifying what made my new retail chain new, exciting, and different both in terms of what we were selling, how we were selling it, and who the customers would be. With those key factors defined, I could then communicate these things clearly and effectively to possible applicants. Ideally those applicants would be attracted to my company by the way in which I was going to distinguish myself and do business and they would self-select for my particular retail chain.I would then have a good way to identify the best people to hire through a creative selection technique. I would then focus on creating a training system (like that seen in the Apple Store) which treated new hires as adults and allowed them to shadow veteran workers while learning the new job.For a quick example, let’s say my new retail chain will be solar-powered eco-friendly pizza stores that offer incredibly fast service and a high tech computer back end for ordering. Having communicated this message using my branding I will then hope to attract those employees who care about what I am doing and want to get involved. The best applicants will arrive at their interviews very much subscribed to my business approach.To your question, yes, many companies do a lot of these things right, though they may not get every piece perfect. The Apple Store, Starbucks, Whole Foods (the grocery chain), and Pret a Manger are all good examples.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Do you think that the corporate culture has to be defined around the core values of a single corporation or this is a broad phenomena, which may be cultivated across different industries?
Viktor O. Ledenyov, UkraineAlex Frankel: I think that any corporate culture, no matter what industry, simply has to represent some distinguishing characteristic about a given company. This seems basic, but many companies fail by trying to be like their competitors instead of fashioning their own identity.The most common way I found that corporate cultures are built is by aligning the company with the ideals of a founder. This makes sense, as presumably that founder had a new vision which was articulated and which laid the ground work for the new company.As a new Starbucks barista, for example, you learn about the values of its chairman Howard Schultz. He is not the founder but is treated as such. Enterprise Rent-A-Car teaches employees about its founder Jack Taylor and Gap tells new hires about founder Don Fisher. So though core values of companies may differ, as long as they are able to isolate what makes them unique, they will be able to design a lasting, strong culture.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..My question is about individuality and innovation. Doesn’t the successful introduction of a uniform corporate culture across a big company mean that the employees ability to contribute new ideas is squashed? How can they express the new ideas important to keeping a company moving forward?
Harjit Singh, IndiaAlex Frankel: In the best cases, a uniform corporate culture will still be one in which organic changes by employees will still be possible. A good example here is UPS. My perception of UPS, as a worker there, was largely shaped by the people I worked with. To me they were the purveyors of the culture as much, or more than, the corporation. As an employee I got messages and information from the company in terms of dress codes and manners of operating but a lot of what I learned was channelled by the people who I worked alongside.UPS, a 100-year-old company this year, certainly has prescribed ways of operating but I found that though the central tenets of the company were fairly set, the employees had a bit of latitude and could take the culture in new and different directions.A place with hard and fast rules and regulations can still have a loose, adaptable culture. One thing lacking in most of the front-line workplaces was a feedback loop, however, that allowed employees to share much information with headquarters and in this regard the ability of these workers to share ideas is not promoted as it should be.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..With a workforce mobility that now sees employees constantly moving to new employers, because of opportunities or reorganisations, loyalty to employers must be affected. How has this influenced the indoctrination of employees into their corporate cultures?
Charles Kreidl, Chicago, Illinois, USAlex Frankel: There is no doubt that loyalty and turnover are huge issues in the front-line retail environments where I worked (Starbucks, Gap, et al.) as well as across the board. Those companies which really focus on creating a place where people want to work and which match a workplace culture with an employee style are ahead of the game. Also, companies that offer benefits to even entry level employees that are better than the competition have a major advantage.A noteworthy example here is Starbucks which is well known for offering solid health insurance benefits to employees who work more than 20 hours per week. What this means is that even if a given employee may move cities, he or she often stays with the company and simply starts working at a new location when he or she moves.This type of loyalty has tangible benefits to the company by lowering acquisition and training costs and boosting employee morale. The trick here for companies is to trust that the expense of good training and culture building will pay off in the long run by building a staff of committed, loyal employees.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..What were the dumbest things you were asked to do during applications? What is your opinion of the selection processes you went through?
AnonAlex Frankel: Selection for the front-line workplaces where I applied was a quite varied experience. Chiefly applications broke down into two approaches - either paper or online applications. A paper application, such as the one provided by Starbucks, was fairly straightforward and online applications went from simple to more complex.The most in-depth online applications had me answer up to 200 personality-related questions such as ”Do you engage in gossip” and ”Do you like to be among large crowds.” These high tech applications would then evaluate my answers using algorithms and presumably determine whether I would make a good match at the place where I was applying. The electronics retailer Best Buy was one company that used these screening tools. Interviews were also interesting, including group interviews in which up to ten applicants were interviewed en masse.Companies such as Gap that did nothing creative in the interview process were less interesting than a place such as The Container Store (a chain of some 30 stores) which included very creative ”auditions” to determine which applicants were the best.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Is there really such thing as corporate culture in multinational corporations or are there merely many sub-cultures under the single umbrella of the corporation?
Ajay MalhotraAlex Frankel: I think in the most effective of the multinational corporations there is certainly a uniformity in the corporate culture so that it is fairly similar whether you might be in New York, London, or San Francisco.Starbucks, for example, may have slightly different rules and codes in Europe and the US, but by and large the experience a worker will have working in a store in one location and another will be fairly similar. This uniformity is a key part of the Starbucks approach and promotes both a similarity of experience for customers as well as employees who may end up moving work locations. At less organised companies there are likely more regional differences.I myself worked primarily in the San Francisco area to do the research for my book so I was not able to directly compare workplaces in different places but research seems to show that a specific corporate culture tends to permeate a given company if that company is focused on expanding that culture (as is the case at Starbucks).…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..What were the most important corporate qualities you experienced that created the most efficient working environment, i.e. in terms of a drive to perform, employee loyalty and willingness to go beyond the standard task at hand?
Adam Keats, LondonAlex Frankel: For me, the best corporate environments in which to work were those in which the corporate culture or spirit was communicated clearly by the company or, ideally, communicated from one employee to another.In terms of what made a particular workplace one in which I felt as if I wanted to work harder and stay longer, one of the key pieces for me was how the training was conducted. If the tone and manner and information conveyed during training was clear and also came across in a way that did not talk down to employees I was most interested in paying attention.The Apple Store in which I worked was notable for its strong training and for giving the newly hired employees the time to digest.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..About the expertAlex Frankel is a writer based in San Francisco.

381;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-12-12T19:32:31Z;On the customer frontline;;"Punching In: The Unauthorised Adventures of a Front-Line EmployeeBy Alex FrankelCollins, $24.95/£14.99They must be slapping themselves on the back at the Texas headquarters of Container Store, retailer of boxes, shelves and other “storage solutions”. For when Alex Frankel, author of Punching In, tried to get a job at Container Store by posing as a storage fanatic, he failed to get past the first interview.When it comes to staffing, Container Store – which prides itself on the thoroughness and intensity of its training – has decided to spend what it takes to get the committed storage fanatics it wants to interact with its customers. It has some of the lowest turnover rates in the sector and famously good customer service.For most mass-retailers, however, the challenge is to find the right balance between costs and quality of service – while remembering that their vast enterprises are ultimately at the mercy of employees who face the customers.But how do you motivate the staff who constitute a retailer’s chief expense? And how do you prevent a surly employee from leaving a potential customer either indifferent or, worse, hostile? Mr Frankel’s entertaining and well-written book offers some grass-roots insights. A business journalist, he decided to seek work at some of America’s leading customer-service companies in an attempt to find out what works, and why – and what does not.Container Store did not want him after a preliminary interview. At Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, and at Whole Foods Market, the organic and natural grocer, he did not even get past an online questionnaire, apparently failing some kind of credibility algorithm in his attempts to answer a range of ethical and personal questions.But luckily UPS needed seasonal workers in San Francisco, launching a project that then took Mr Frankel into jobs at Starbucks, Gap and Apple, as well as a stint at Enterprise, the car rental company.It is anecdotal, but fascinating. As they fight the Christmas rush, it becomes apparent that UPS’s drivers are the core of its esprit de corps – they serve as empowered non-commissioned officers who have risen through the ranks, and who pull it all together when things start to
go pear-shaped on the beaches.Mr Frankel gets minimal training before going out on his truck, but he is sucked into the corporate values by the drivers and feels guilty about taking a day off.Starbucks, on the other hand, sounds more like a ship with a panicking crew in a storm of caramel-flavoured Frappacinos. There are vast manuals of staff instruction, but no time to read them. New staff learn largely on the job from any colleagues who are nice enough to help them, before being thrust in front of a queue of customers demanding ever-more-baroque confections.Perhaps the biggest shock of the book is Enterprise, a company that has gained attention for its support of the Net Promoter Score-based system for assessing how well it is doing with its customers.The formula, developed with Bain consultant Fred Reichheld, relies upon customers rating the company according to whether or not they would recommend the service to a friend.But it turns out Enterprise’s well-trained staff – many of them recent college graduates – are probably more concerned about selling add-on insurance than they are about their scores. Insurance is the main factor that determines whether or not they will rise through the ranks of what sounds like a parody of entrepreneurial culture, which preaches that everyone can succeed if they only try hard enough. Clearly, Frankel did not buy it – although it seems to work with most of his colleagues, at least those that do not burn out and start sharing their disgruntlement at www.failingenterprise.com.There may be no great revelations about management training theory in this book,
but it does lift the veil that conceals the other side of the counter.And in the unlikely event of armed hostilities ever breaking out between UPS and Starbucks, I know which side I would back."
382;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-12-05T04:40:27Z;Delivery technology: Fixing retail’s weakest link;;"The annual Christmas ritual of braving a packed high street for gifts does little to encourage a festive frame of mind.Hence it is no surprise that 90 per cent of shoppers plan to do at least some of this year’s shopping online, according to the recent American Express 2007 Retail Monitor survey. Respondents said buying online provides a welcome respite from crowds (82 per cent), parking problems (60 per cent) and Christmas music (28 per cent).That is great news for online retailers. As early as October, analysts from Forrester, the IT market research firm, forecast final-quarter sales for European e-retailers for Christmas 2007 to reach €51bn, or 39 per cent of total annual online sales.For shoppers, buying online could hardly be less stressful: prices are competitive and choice is unrestricted. Security may still be a worry, but convenience overrides the fears – provided, that is, goods can be delivered without fuss. Anyone who has bought large items will be familiar with the card through the door saying: “You were out when we called.” So how can IT help mend this weakest link in the delivery chain?Those who really feel the strain of the online Christmas shopping spree are shipment and courier companies charged with delivering the packages.Take UPS, for example. On an average day, the company will deliver 15m packages worldwide – but on its biggest delivery day of the year (December 19), that is likely to rise by 45 per cent to 22m, according to Donna Barrett, the company’s technology representative.A large proportion of those packages contain goods purchased online, as UPS boasts that it delivers for 21 of the world’s top 25 online retailers, including Amazon.com. For that reason, delivery companies such as UPS and its rival FedEx now make it possible for customers to schedule a time for delivery and to track a package’s progress online, either via the delivery company’s website or increasingly, using application programming interfaces (APIs), via the website of the online retailer.That has involved investment in technology, and in particular, in “smart labels” that mean
a parcel can be “swiped” by a reader at key stages in the
delivery process, such as leaving the warehouse, boarding a
truck or aircraft, or at its final destination.This information lays a trail of information about a parcel’s whereabouts that can be presented online to the recipient.Likewise, vehicles and drivers can now be tracked and controlled using global positioning systems (GPS), says Fran Howarth, an analyst at research firm Quocirca: “Vehicles transmit signals
via on-board GPS devices, which are transmitted to a central server via satellite, allowing
courier companies to keep track of where all their vehicles are
at a particular time,” she explains.They can also send out alerts when problems occur, such as traffic jams or breakdowns, she adds, so that an alternative route can be planned and customers kept informed of the new delivery schedule.Meanwhile, the increasing sophistication of handheld devices – giving drivers out on the road the ability to upload information about packages in real time as well as record
details of their handover – has transformed the delivery business, says Rob Carter, CIO of FedEx.His company has 70,000 handheld devices in the field, capturing and uploading information on 6m daily shipments worldwide. “There’s no question in our minds that the information about a package is as important as the package itself – that’s how we stay competitive,” he says.But the ability to track a package online does not mean someone is at home to receive it. And what happens if the item is too large or valuable to go through the letterbox? Either is inconvenient for both parties, certainly, but for the delivery company, it also means incurring the cost of arranging re-delivery.Fortunately, new technologies designed to smooth the delivery process still further are constantly emerging, says Evan Puzey, global vice-president of sales and marketing at Kewill Systems, a specialist in global trade management systems that works with FedEx and competitors such as TNT.One option, already proving popular in the US, is coded lock boxes outside a customer’s home, he says. “The recipient enters the code online when buying a product and the driver is supplied with this code for the delivery to open the lock box and deposit the parcel,” he explains.Another option, says Ms Howarth of Quocirca, is the use of automated text or e-mail alerts, “stating when a parcel is due to arrive, or where it has been dropped off”.Voice, however, offers a more personal approach, argues JJ Kett, CEO of VoiceSage. His company, a spin-off from the University of Cork, Ireland, provides a hosted messaging service. Indesit, the white goods manufacturer, uses it to remind customers that their washing machine or dishwasher is scheduled for delivery next day.A recorded message, detailing the scheduled delivery time, is sent to VoiceSage’s hosted system by an Indesit customer service representative using a microphone on their PC, accompanied by a list of the phone numbers of intended recipients. That message is then sent by VoiceSage to recipients at the specified time.On receiving the call, customers are prompted by the recording to press 1 if they are happy with the stated delivery arrangement, or 2 to be diverted to a
call centre if they need to reschedule it.The results speak for themselves, says Mr Kett. Only 4 per cent of those “called” by Indesit using VoiceSage need to press 2, vastly reducing the burden on call centre staff. And the failure rate, he adds, has plummeted.“The company delivers 5,000 units per day, and prior to using VoiceSage’s technology, it had a 4.8 per cent non-delivery rate. Each day, that meant that approximately 240 units could not be delivered, resulting in a huge waste of labour,” he says. Since using the new technology, he adds, this no-show rate has dropped to 0.7 per cent – just 30 deliveries a day.VoiceSage is currently in discussions to supply similar technology to Royal Mail and to DHL in Ireland, as well as a number of leading mail-order catalogue companies, Mr Kett says.And this suggests the “nobody home” scenario is increasingly unpalatable to both customers and couriers, at Christmas or any other time.

383;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-11-22T22:00:43Z;Investors cool to US multinationals;;Investors are losing their appetite for US multinationals amid mounting worries that the weak dollar and growth in the rest of the world will fail to offset a slowing domestic economy.The market’s lack of enthusiasm for companies that had underpinned recent rallies highlights growing pessimism over the prospect that exports and global trade would help large US companies weather a slowdown in their home market.With US-focused sectors such as financial services and consumer products reeling from the housing downturn and credit squeeze, the new concerns over multinationals are forcing analysts to further downgrade their earnings forecasts.In the first six months of the year, corporate America’s foreign profits rose at an annual rate of 15 per cent, outpacing domestic earnings growth and prompting investors to buy into multinationals as a hedge against a US slowdown.But over the past month shares of international companies such as General Electric, 3M, UPS, Exxon Mobil and Intel have suffered some of the biggest losses among large-cap companies.“Large-cap US multinationals, the darlings of the investment world for most of this year, have been roughed up over the past few weeks. More trouble lies ahead,” wrote Joseph Quinlan, chief investment strategist at Bank of America, in a note to clients this week. “US corporate earnings, supported earlier by strong global growth and a weak US dollar, succumbed to …deteriorating economic conditions at home”.Investors blame disappointing earnings and forecasts from large companies such as the heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, the logistics giant FedEx, and the technology group Cisco, for the change in sentiment.The results dashed hopes that overseas earnings might help companies compensate for falling consumer confidence and business spending in the US – a key reason for investor flight to multinationals earlier this year.Wall Street expects earnings of S&P 500 companies to have risen just 3.1 per cent in the last three months of 2007, according to Bespoke Investment Group.At the start of October, analysts were expecting fourth quarter earnings to increase more than 11 per cent, according to Thomson Financial.Some economists argue that the prospects of an export-led recovery in the US were always remote given the domestic economy’s reliance on consumer spending.

385;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-10-23T18:03:21Z;US results point to weaker economy;;US companies on Tuesday underlined the resilience of their international operations but failed to dispel fears that the slowing domestic economy would weigh on future earnings.Third quarter results released by a raft of large US groups showed that the weaker dollar and global economic growth are helping parts of corporate America to cushion the blow of the housing downturn and liquidity squeeze.The chemical maker DuPont became the latest company with large overseas sales to report strong profit growth and a bullish outlook for next year.The company said that, although it expected the US housing market to remain depressed in 2008, profit growth would come from rising international demand, particularly for its agricultural products.The stock market took heart from DuPont’s comments, as well as strong results released by Apple and American Express on Monday after the closing. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.16 per cent higher in midday New York trading, while the S&P 500 was also in positive territory.However, Whirlpool, the world’s largest appliance maker, saw its shares slip five per cent after missing analysts’ estimates on weak US sales and issuing bearish predictions for the near-term future of its domestic business.Meanwhile, UPS, the world’s biggest package-delivery company, predicted that domestic retail sales would rise at its slowest pace in four years.Scott Davis, UPS chief financial officer, who is to become chief executive on January 1, told the FT that high energy prices and falling housing prices are “bound to put pressure on the consumer”.However, UPS said a gradual rebound in industrial production would quicken the pace of US economic expansion to around 2.5 per cent in 2008.Other companies, such as the heavy equipment maker Caterpillar, have been less sanguine, warning the economy was heading for a recession.Unlike its arch-rival FedEx, which cut its earnings forecasts for the rest of the year due to the slowing US economy, UPS expects to earn $4.13 to $4.19 a share in 2007, within the range of estimates provided to investors at the start of the year.
386;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;UPS predicts sluggish holiday retail sales;;UPS, the world’s biggest package-delivery company, spread little cheer about this year’s US holiday shopping season, predicting domestic retail sales would rise at their slowest pace in four years.Volume on US shipments should slow in the fourth quarter, restrained by only a “modest increase” in retail sales, said UPS, whose results can provide investors with an early glimpse on the health of the economy.The company’s push to expand its freight and international package-delivery businesses helped counter meager growth in US shipments during the third quarter, a trend its executives said would continue in the last three months of 2007.“It’s got to be combination of high energy prices and falling housing prices,” UPS finance chief Scott Davis said in an interview. “It’s bound to put pressure on the consumer.”Net income rose 3.7 per cent to $1.08bn, or $1.02 a share, in the third period, from $1.04bn, or 96 cents, a year ago. Excluding a $31m charge UPS set aside to restructure its supply-chain and freight unit in France, the company earned $1.05 per share, exceeding analysts’ average estimates.Revenue climbed 4.7 per cent to $12.2bn, paced by a 12 per cent gain from the Atlanta-based company’s international package unit.US package revenue increased 1.9 per cent.UPS expects to earn $4.13 to $4.19 a share in 2007, within the range of estimates the company provided to investors at the start of the year.The company also predicted that industrial production would rebound in the fourth quarter.“Any time you look at the fourth quarter, the focus is on the holiday season,” said Davis, who is slated to succeed Mike Eskew as UPS’s chief executive on January 1.
387;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-10-15T22:39:35Z;UPS chief steps down after 6 years;;"Mike Eskew, chairman and chief executive of UPS, is to step down after six years at the helm of the world’s largest package-delivery company.Scott Davis, UPS’s 55-year-old finance chief, will succeed Mr Eskew on January 1. Mr Eskew, 58, will keep his seat on the company’s board.His decision to retire comes less than a month after the company reached a new contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the labour union that represents 240,000 of UPS’s 360,000 US workers.Mr Davis will inherit a company facing an uncertain economic outlook in the US and struggling to persuade investors its future is as bright as that of its arch-rival, FedEx.Under Mr Eskew’s direction, UPS sought to expand beyond its traditional package business. He strengthened the company’s presence overseas, and made dozens of acquisitions to establish a freight division.The moves, designed in part to counter market-share gains by FedEx in the US, did not help UPS shares keep pace with those of its rival.The stock has climbed 40 per cent since Mr Eskew was elevated to the top job; in that same period, FedEx’s shares have doubled.Mr Davis will be the first chief executive who has not spent his entire career with the company, having joined through its acquisition in 1986 of II Morrow.Kurt Kuehn, a management committee member and senior vice president of global sales and marketing, will replace Mr Davis as chief financial officer."
388;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;FedEx;;FedEx burned through $3.53bn of fuel last year in its quest to deliver packages on time. With oil prices near $83 a barrel and growing demand for international shipping, that number is all but guaranteed to rise. In the US, however, the world’s largest air cargo carrier risks getting squeezed between higher fuel prices and slowing demand.Although FedEx beat expectations in the first quarter, its shares fell after the potential squeeze forced it to cut forecasts. The heady market triggered by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut has done little to boost the shares, which reacted negatively to the fear that looser monetary policy would push record fuel prices even higher.Energy costs could also create a $32bn drag on consumer spending in 2008, according to Goldman Sachs. That could hit FedEx and its arch-rival UPS with a painful double-whammy, inflating shipping expenses while helping to deflate demand. Combine that with an even bigger hit to overall consumer spending power from mortgage resets, and FedEx may be in for a bumpy ride into – and perhaps beyond – the key holiday season.FedEx based its earlier guidance on hopes of a rebound in volumes. Indeed, its critical ground and express parcel divisions have remained strong, helped by an uptick in international demand. But a drop in freight trucking profits and a shift by US customers to cheaper services may signal tougher times ahead.The real question is whether stronger exports, express shipping demand, and productivity improvements can offset FedEx’s hit from fuel. The shipper has made decisive moves into China, and bought room for manoeuvre by indicating it could slow capital spending. Its recent move to slash fuel surcharges was aimed at building market share. But with customers responding more slowly than expected, that initiative now seems ill-timed, or at least, overly optimistic.
389;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-09-16T21:49:06Z;FedEx gives stamp of approval;;“From the M66 to Route 66 by 10.30 next day” is the promise to northern businesses made by FedEx, which is to expand its operations in Manchester by starting its first direct express freight flight from the region to the US.Good news for Ramsbottom, Lancashire, where the less-celebrated of those two highways reaches its northern end after only eight miles. It is also a vote of confidence by the US transportation company in the economic prospects of the wider north-west.Availability of quick and important logistics connections is a badge of honour for a region. The north of England has felt under-served, even taking into account its economic underdevelopment relative to London and the south-east.FedEx has had “feeder” flights from Manchester but its other two direct services from the UK to the US use Stansted. UPS and DHL, FedEx’s well-known rivals, have built operations at East Midlands airport, the UK’s biggest “pure” freight airport, which is considered well-placed for the national motorway network and has plenty of space to expand.DHL has already this year announced improvements to its services to give better “next day” service to the US from many regional cities. TNT, a fourth “integrator”, flies from UK airports including Liverpool to a European hub in Belgium.Robert Elliott, FedEx’s president for Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa, said Manchester was a logical place to expand as one of the largest industrial areas in the UK.FedEx’s decision means companies and people accounting for 70 per cent of UK output now have access to its next-day delivery in the US, compared with only 40 per cent previously.“We just took a quantum leap in our competitive position,” Mr Elliott said. “It was the place to have the biggest impact for local customers as well as for customers downstream in the US.” FedEx says customers from north Wales to Yorkshire and the north-east will now get a next-day service to the US.Other customers in the north-west will get later cut-off times for deliveries and say the improvement should help their business.Graham Moss, warehouse and logistics manager of Zetex, a maker of semiconductors based in Oldham, said: “It will help to cut turnround times for orders to the US. The more you can shave off long lead times the better.”Paul Hillier, finance director of Character Options, the maker of toys such as Robosapien and Doctor Who spin-offs, said it could help his company – also based in Oldham – to expedite the back-and-forth process of finessing toy designs and prototypes with international partners. “That can give you more sales days in important periods leading up to Christmas, for example. There is a point in the process where things become time-critical.”A study last year by Oxford Economic Forecasting bears out the idea that business values quick access to express services. Its report on East Midlands Airport, which is owned by Manchester Airport Group, concluded access to its services was vital or very important for one in 10 companies that decides to locate to the region, with the express industry helping to catalyse the competitiveness of other sectors of the economy.The express freight industry in the UK is poised to expand by about 6.7 per cent a year – nearly three times as fast as the economy – until 2014, says the Oxford Economic Forecasting study.Manchester’s direct US air freight link is sure to be used as a lure for further inward investment. Sir Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester council, says FedEx’s investment “tells us the level of maturity Manchester has reached in business terms”.FedEx’s expansion, adding 40 jobs, is part of a build-up of cargo services in recent months at Manchester airport. Two Asian cargo carriers have begun services there within the past year, while Air China and Aeroflot also inaugurated freight services this month at Manchester.Tim McDermott, Manchester’s aviation development director, says: “There has been a step-change in the number of dedicated freight operators wanting to come to Manchester. A lot of these have taken years to come to fruition.”Monthly cargo movements passed 15,000 tonnes for the first time in July and are 29 per cent higher than a year ago. The greater part of the movements is accounted for by imports.
390;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:15:04+0000;US and Japan expand air services pact;;The US and Japan have agreed to expand their air services agreement for the first time in a decade in a move that provides additional access for direct passenger and cargo flights and connecting services to other parts of Asia.The first amendment to the landmark US-Japan deal reached in 1998 offers additional opportunities for cargo carriers in the fast-growing transpacific market, as well as limited expansion for the passenger airline alliances which now dominate the industry.UPS, the world’s largest package freight operator, will be able to add six daily flights to Nagoya to its existing daily services to Tokyo and Osaka, and connect these to its regional hub in Shanghai. Polar Air Cargo, another freight operator, is being allowed to start services to Osaka.The US-Japan bilateral remains one of the most restrictive in the complex web of deals governing the global aviation industry, despite recent moves to liberalise the sector such as this year’s accord between the US and the European Union.Japan has long resisted US efforts to press for an “open skies” agreement which would allow carriers from either country to fly to any point in the other – and onwards to other countries – without limits on capacity, fares and alliance deals.The US transportation department said more talks aimed at further liberalisation are slated for no later than next summer, and some observers believe Japan faces more pressure to consider an open skies-type deal.The emergence of competing airports in China and South Korea which could capture some of the transpacific traffic now traveling through Tokyo, while new longer-range aircraft can also fly more direct services between North America and Asia.“The two sides agreed to resume negotiations no later than the summer of 2008 to look at additional ways to expand air service between the US and Japan,” said the Department of Transport.The Japanese transporation ministry said America should not expect anything ”too dramatic”. Japan is likely to reject demands for more access to Tokyo’s Haneda airport until at least 2010, when a new runway is completed at what is now a mostly domestic hub, he said.In addition to its negotiations with the US, Japan has signaled its intention to expand access for Asian carriers to regional airports outside Tokyo, under its Asian Gateway Plan to increase tourist and business links with the region, though there has been little progress so far.The open-skies approach has been pushed by the US in negotiations with a variety of countries since 1993, though critics maintain it is imbalanced as Congressional resistance continues to prevent overseas carriers from flying within the large US domestic market.The liberalisation of cargo services has often served as a template for more comprehensive reform of air transport agreements. Many industry experts believe opening the freight sector offers an opportunity to push for comprehensive reform of the industry’s bilateral-based system by providing a multilateral platform which countries could sign up to.The US signed a new aviation deal with China earlier this year which will more than double the number of passenger flights by 2012, and the awarding of routes and access to new entrants will be accelerated. Beijing also agreed to an open skies deal for cargo from 2011, but would discuss a similar deal for passenger services only from March 25 2011.The gains for passenger flights in the US-Japan agreement reached on Thursday are more modest than in the cargo arena, and retains the current level of scheduled departures, which are constrained by congestion at Tokyo’s Narita airport, the country’s main international gateway. However, carriers will be able to offer more code-share services through their alliance partners, and there is also provision for more flexible fares.A ceiling on charter flights has also been increased.
391;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Iberia soars on talk of takeover;;Bid speculation helped prop up the main indices on Thursday in a cautious session as investors became wary of pushing fragile European equity markets too high.Early uncertainty on Wall Street ensured the FTSE Eurofirst 300 gave up much of its gains, and the benchmark index finished the session 0.3 per cent higher at 1,509.39.Iberia, the Spanish airline, rose 2.5 per cent to €3.30 on rising speculation that private equity group TPG and British Airways were poised to launch an offer following reports the partnership were wrapping up due diligence on Iberia’s accounts.Strategists thought a takeover would make sense for BA, which has been left out of previous rounds of consolidation in the airline industry. “This would be enhancing to BA’s position in Europe and Latin America,” said Howard Wheeldon at BGC Partners. “BA needs partnerships, otherwise it is a sitting duck for a takeover.”German mail and logistics group Deutsche Post rose 2.3 per cent to €21.31 on talk that US parcel delivery service UPS – with private equity backing from Apax Partners – was interested in buying the 30.6 per cent stake held by state-owned bank KfW Group for about €28 a share.Strategists said a deal would throw open other avenues of opportunity, particularly in Deutsche Postbank, which is majority owned by Deutsche Post.In June, Commerzbank said it would launch a bid for Deutsche Postbank if it were up for sale. However, Deutsche Post has repeatedly said it was not interested in selling its stake. Deutsche Postbank shares rose 0.9 per cent to €53.94.Banking stocks were the subject of much broker scrutiny. Goldman Sachs reduced its forecasts on capital markets-linked profits and removed Deutsche Bank from its pan-European “buy” list. Deutsche Bank shares fell 2.1 per cent to €91.16.National Bank of Greece, however, rose 3.3 per cent to €42.98 after Goldman added it to its “conviction buy” list due to the bank’s “strong deposit franchise and exposure to healthy credit growth”.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a note on German banks, said it preferred business models not dependent on securitisation and saw retail deposits as a more stable funding source.Deutsche Postbank was among the stocks preferred by KBW, as were Aareal Bank, which rose 1.4 per cent to €33.75, and Hypo Real Estate, which climbed 1.8 per cent to €40.50.Truckmakers were buoyed by a report from Standard & Poor’s. The ratings agency forecast demand for heavy-duty trucks in central and eastern Europe to double over the next four years as the region’s economy expands, prompting higher investment in infrastructure.Shares in Germany’s MAN, which already has a plant in Poland, rose 0.9 per cent to €99.15 and Sweden’s Volvo, which has a new plant in Russia, rose 0.2 per cent to SKr119. Scania, also of Sweden, climbed 3.2 per cent to SKr160, and DaimlerChrysler, which manufactures trucks under its Mercedes brand, added 0.4 per cent to €63.08.Ahold, the Dutch retailer, rose 0.9 per cent to €9.44 after it announced the completion of its 5-4 reverse stock split. The date for the capital repayment of €1.89 per existing share will be August 28, it said.Holcim, the Swiss cement maker, rose 0.8 per cent to SFr122.70 after reporting that first half net profit nearly tripled. The result included a one-off capital gain from the sale of a stake in its South African division.Umicore, the Belgian metals and materials group, rose 3.1 per cent to €162.92 after announcing a forecast-beating rise in first half profit.
392;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-08-15T18:38:57Z;Global outlook pays dividends;;When Isaac Merritt Singer set up a branch of his sewing machine maker in Paris in 1855, he probably did not think he was blazing a trail US companies would still be following more than 150 years later. Singer’s expansion in France turned the New York-based company into the first US multinational, pioneering a business model that would be adopted by other icons of American capitalism, from Ford to Standard Oil to General Electric.But perhaps the most important legacy of Singer’s daring move was that it worked: within six years of the French opening, foreign sales had exceeded US revenues. It is a lesson not lost on today’s corporate leaders.As the US economy is squeezed by a housing slump, credit turmoil and higher fuel prices, a gap has opened up between companies with large overseas operations and those focused on the domestic market. The second-quarter results season drawing to a close has provided the starkest evidence yet of this trend.Over the past three months, blue-chips such as General Electric, the conglomerate, IBM, the technology giant, and UPS, the logistics group, have hitched a ride on a global economy growing faster than the US. By contrast, companies that depend on dom­estic consumers such as Wal-Mart, the retail bell-wether, and Home Depot, the do-it-yourself chain, have released disappointing results and gloomy predictions.“US companies are in the midst of an unprecedented boom in global earnings,” wrote Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist for Bank of America, in a recent note to clients. “The second-quarter earnings season was a tale of two earnings: robust overseas earnings …versus weak/soft domestic earnings”.This dichotomy has been reflected in US stock markets, particularly during the past few weeks as investors have run for cover from domestic woes. After monitoring more than 40 stock-picking techniques, Merrill Lynch analysts concluded that buying shares in S&P500 companies with the highest percentage of international sales was the second-best performing investment strategy this year.But if foreign earnings have helped US multinationals stave off a fall in profitability, the question is whether the current reliance on the rest of the world is just a cyclical phase or the harbinger of a transformation in corporate America.Could the importance of overseas markets destroy – as Sam Palmisano, IBM’s chief executive, has argued – the old multinational model whereby companies decentralised manufacturing and sales operations but kept key functions such as the executive office, research and product design in the “home country”? And if so, are some US companies ready to become truly “transnational” by scattering their top executives around the world?At first sight, there are significant cyclical forces behind the recent rise of US multinationals – forces, in other words, that could change in the near future.First, the dollar has lost nearly a third of its value against America’s largest trading partners over the past seven years, making it easier for US exporters to sell to the world and boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings.Second, US multinationals have been boosted by global economic growth, which has largely been driven by emerging markets hungry for infrastructure and consumer goods – two of America Inc’s strongest suits.But macro-economic and trade factors are only part of the reason overseas profits of US companies are about to register a record 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. US executives argue that they are reaping the benefits of decades of investment aimed at shifting their companies’ centre of gravity away from the domestic market.“This is not something that has just happened,” says David Abney, chief operating officer of UPS, a company that, with its main rival FedEx, is both a chief beneficiary and key facilitator of global trade. “We first saw it coming 30 years ago and began redoubling our efforts after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent collapse of trade barriers around the world.”Building a business that spans time zones and countries, not to mention myriad customers, government regulations and cultures, is neither easy nor quick. Alexander Cutler, chief executive of Eaton, the diversified manufacturer, recalls that when he took over in 2000, its overseas operations were struggling. “We had these foreign outposts that were supposed to defeat the cyclicality of the US business but we had soldiers dying on the ramparts every day,” he recalls. After an extensive period of rebuilding, Eaton now derives nearly half of its revenues from outside the US.For some experts, such radical transformations have been more common among US companies than their foreign rivals for two key reasons: corporate America’s constant need to satisfy demanding investors and the presence of fewer regulatory and labour constraints in a country renowned for its free-market spirit.But even if economic changes and internal revolutions at companies mean, in the words of Steve Mills, head of IBM’s global software business, that “things cannot go back to the way they were”, will more companies abandon national allegiance and become truly “a-national”?“Big Blue” – as IBM is known – claims to be just that, with operations in more than 150 countries and key functions spread around the world. Its head of procurement, for example, is based in Shenzhen, China, half a world away from Mr Palmisano’s headquarters in Armonk, New York. “Ours is a boundary-less way of thinking,” says Mr Mills.”Halliburton, the oil services group run by Dick Cheney before he became US vice-president, recently followed the petrodollars trail and moved its chief executive from Houston to Dubai.However, many US chief executives regard such moves as impractical, if not outright dangerous. They argue that being rooted in the US is not only an insurance policy in case the globalisation tide turns, but also a way of maintaining order and focus in increasingly complex and dispersed enterprises – of letting everybody know where the buck stops and who is in charge.Jeffrey Immelt, who heads GE, one of the most “global” companies in the US, recently distilled this view: “We’re an American company but in order to be successful we’ve got to win in every corner of the world.”In other words, global aspirations tinged with national pride – which Singer would have understood – is just as recognisable to­­d­ay among US business leaders.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
394;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-08-06T19:49:32Z;FedEx views struggling Kinko’s as ‘critical’;;The head of Kinko’s on Monday defended the struggling retail chain after a poor string of results, saying it was “critical” to the future of parent company FedEx.As he announced plans to accelerate store openings in the next year, Ken May, FedEx Kinko’s chief executive, said in an interview with the FT: “Most people at FedEx understand [the importance of Kinko’s]. I know that Fred Smith [FedEx chief executive] understands it. He spends a lot of time talking to me about it. He feels like this is one of the most critical things going on at FedEx Corp.”The opening of 300 fresh outlets by next summer marks a step up in the pace of FedEx Kinko’s expansion, after the addition of 200 stores since last August. Kinko’s provides printing and photocopying, access to FedEx delivery services and sells office supplies.FedEx acquired Kinko’s for $2.4bn in February 2004 from Clayton Dubilier and Rice, private equity firm, but results at the retailer have consistently deteriorated.The company has committed to an aggressive expansion in retail outlets as it seeks to improve the reach of its core business of package delivery and to offer a challenge to the 5,800 branches of the UPS Store run by UPS, its chief US competitor.The new stores will take the total in the US to more than 2000. FedEx wants a total of 4000 Kinko’s stores, including 1000 outside the US. It currently has 159 international stores, and will add 20 next year.Analysts say that the Kinko’s shops offer a “customer contact point” that helps boost the volume of packages sent through FedEx by providing a convenient local option for customers. “We want to become the local print provider and local drop off point for every community in America,” said Mr May.FedEx now makes $840m in annual revenue for packages which are sent from Kinko’s stores, a figure which is “growing rapidly” according to Mr May.But in the last year, Kinko’s revenues fell 2 per cent to $2.04bn. Operating income has fallen for the last two years as the company has invested in opening stores, retraining staff and promoting the Kinko’s brand.Rising numbers of packages sent through its stores have partially offset lost income from falling demand for photocopying.“Kinko’s has been a challenging acquisition,” said James Corridore, an analyst at Standard & Poors. “The integration has gone less smoothly and it has been less profitable than expected. But it’s a strong strategic piece for FedEx.”
395;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-08-05T21:05:06Z;Concerns over Chinese postal law;;China should improve transparency of a new law governing the country’s $6bn-a-year express delivery market, say executives at UPS, the package delivery group.An updated version of China’s Postal Law, which was promulgated in 1986, is in its ninth version and has been a source of concern for foreign and domestic courier companies pitted against China Post, the incumbent.US-based UPS, its international peers and upstart Chinese express companies are in the awkward position of having to “compete with our regulator”, Mike Eskew, UPS chairman and chief executive, said in an interview with the Financial Times.Ken Torok, UPS Asia Pacific president, noted that transparency surrounding the law’s most recent drafts had deteriorated. There are concerns China could introduce a “universal tax” of 4 per cent on overseas entrants.“We would look at that as a form of double taxation,” Mr Torok said. “We are just looking for a level playing field in the industry.”Mr Torok contrasted the opacity of China’s new postal law with a more open process in India, which is also revising its antiquated regulatory regime and posts drafts on the internet.“When they do that everyone has visibility,” Mr Torok said. “We’d like to see more of that [in China].”Uncertainty also surrounds how China intends to “carve out the monopoly”. According to an earlier draft of the law, only China Post’s express delivery arm would be allowed to deliver parcels weighing less than 150g – a restriction of particular concern to the incumbent’s domestic competitors.UPS currently does not accept packages of less than 2kg for delivery in China.Last October, an increasingly vocal domestic lobby of state-owned and private courier companies that compete against China Post took issue with the proposed limit. The Conference of Asia Pacific Express Carriers – which represents UPS, DHL, Fedex and TNT – has also been critical of the drafting process.Booz Allen Hamilton, a consultancy, estimates China’s express delivery market will reach $5.8bn this year and $7.4bn next, making it a coveted destination for international courier companies.UPS was the first of the “big four” international couriers to wholly own its China operations, as allowed under the terms of the country’s accession agreement to the World Trade Organisation. The company bought out Sinotrans, its state-owned joint venture partner, for $100m in 2005.It employs 4,500 people in China and is building an international hub in Shanghai. UPS is now applying for trucking and freight forwarding licences in China. But it must secure national, provincial and even municipal approvals.
396;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-07-24T20:53:56Z;Foreign earnings save US blue chips;;"Foreign earnings came to the rescue of a slew of US multinationals on Tuesday, offsetting weakness in the domestic economy and highlighting their growing reliance on the rest of the world.Several blue chips that reported second-quarter earnings said their international business had outshone their US operations. They included UPS, the logistics group; DuPont, the chemical maker; PepsiCo, the soft-drinks maker; and United Airlines.The one sector that bucked the trend was defence, with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, among the biggest suppliers of aircraft, missiles and information systems to the Pentagon, beating Wall Street estimates.But the results season has been characterised by the increased importance of US companies’ international operations, which have been helped by the weakness in the dollar and rapid growth in emerging markets.General Electric, the industrial conglomerate, derives about half its sales from overseas and Caterpillar and IBM have both shown strong growth in international sales.UPS, often cited as a bellwether for the US economy, reported better-than-expected profits, lifted by strong performance in its international business. The 4.6 per cent rise in the daily number of packages it delivered internationally helped compensate for a decline of 0.2 per cent in the US.Rival FedEx has also been buoyed by growth abroad.DuPont cited weakness in the US housing and car markets as factors in second-quarter earnings missing analysts’ expectations. Its shares fell 6.4 per cent in late afternoon trading.The second-biggest US chemical company, which sells insulation and paints to the housing and motor industries, suffered a 2 per cent decrease in sales domestically while its overseas volumes grew by 4 per cent.PepsiCo profits beat analysts’ expectations thanks to growing demand for soft drinks in China and Europe and potato chips in Russia and Mexico.An increase in international revenues helped United Airlines shrug off concerns about over-capacity and lower domestic demand to report bullish second-quarter earnings. While passenger revenues in the Americas declined slightly, transatlantic and transpacific flights generated 25.5 per cent and 12.2 per cent more revenue respectively."
397;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-07-23T20:38:32Z;US stocks rally on earnings, deals;;US stocks rallied on Monday as a raft of better-than-expected second-quarter company earnings reports and fresh mergers activity helped investors shrug off Friday’s sell-off.Pharmaceuticals led the upbeat earnings line-up. Merck said second-quarter net income rose 12 per cent, sending the Dow component 6.8 per cent higher to $52.33 at the close of trading in New York.Schering-Plough more than doubled its quarterly profit, but the stock fell back 0.6 per cent to $31.30 despite rising earlier in the session.Halliburton, the oil services firm, reported a 19 per cent rise in quarterly profit, which sent its share price up 3.2 per cent to $37.74.The steep rise came after the spin-off of its engineering firm KBR earlier this year.The Houston-based company earned $1.53bn, or $1.62 a share, up from $591m, or 55 cents a share, in the same period last year.In deals news, the oil drilling sector grabbed the spotlight as Transocean and GlobalSantaFe agreed to merge. The companies have a combined market capitalisation of $48bn. Transocean was up 5.5 per cent at $115.96, while GlobalSantaFe had jumped 4.8 per cent to $78.33 by the close. If the transaction goes through, it would create the second largest company in the sector behind Schlumberger.Many are betting that the world’s supply of cheap crude oil is running out and energy companies will be reliant on new and more expensive methods to produce and transport energy.Hewlett-Packard agreed to acquire Opsware in a deal worth $1.6bn, according to a company statement.The move, one among several recent business technology buy-outs by HP, is intended to help automate the company’s data centre.HP shares fell 0.2 per cent to $48.43 while Opsware shares soared 36.19 per cent to $14.00.Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity house, said it would buy United Rentals for $6.6bn, including debt. The stock was up 1.9 per cent at $32.98.But analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that financial stocks, and specifically brokerage stocks, continued to trade poorly. “Even after generally positive earnings news, investors want nothing to do with the group,” they said.Toymaker Hasbro also bucked the buoyant mood. Second-quarter profit fell 82 per cent, as a charge of $36.5m linked to warrants purchased from Lucasfilm outweighed the effect of a licensing deal for Spider-Man 3 toys and sales of Transformer toys. Its shares fell 5.4 per cent to $30.80.Nonetheless, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,541.52 at the close in New York, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.1 per cent firmer at 2,690.58The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent higher at 13,943.42.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.81, or 0.58 per cent, to 841.25.“We still have a very positive supply demand ratio with a lot of money on the sidelines that wants in at the moment,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.“The fact is that investors are in a ‘glass half full’ mood and are generally prepared to look beyond problems such as the subprime mortgage market debacle and wider geopolitical risks.”He added that most agreed that the market continued to display largely sound fundamentals, describing the prevailing mood as one of cautious optimism rather than of irrational exuberance.In other news, VeraSun Energy agreed to pay $725m for three ethanol plants with annual production capacity of 300 million gallons a year. Shares were 4.9 per cent higher at $14.4.Shares of Tellabs rose 3 per cent to $12.20 after media reports that the communications equipment company is entertaining a $7bn takeover offer from Nokia Siemens Networks.Shares in Netflix, which was scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell on Monday, tumbled 12 per cent to $17.27 after the video rental company cut prices over the weekend on two of its subscription plans by $1.American Express and Texas Instruments were due to report their latest earnings after the closing bell in New York on Monday.The latest quarterly earnings from McDonald’s, AT&T, UPS and Amazon are due on Tuesday.Boeing and Apple results are due later this week.
398;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Deutsche Post revives US air cargo ambition;;Deutsche Post, the German postal and logistics group, has quietly revived a plan to invest in the US air cargo industry which was dropped four years ago in the face of regulatory opposition.The company last month acquired a 49 per cent stake in Miami-based Astar Air Cargo, which in turn launched an unsolicited bid for Ohio-based ABX Air. Both companies derive most of their business from long-term contracts with DHL.The proposed deal follows years of wrangling over Deutsche Post’s role in the US air cargo business, which is subject to the same constraints over foreign ownership as passenger airlines.Deutsche Post’s DHL Worldwide Express unit agreed to sell its 25 per cent stake in Astar – then known as DHL Airways – to a group of US investors in 2003 after rivals such as UPS and FedEx claimed it had broken the ownership laws.DHL’s $1.05bn purchase of Airborne Express was also subjected to similar scrutiny, and the air cargo company was spun off to shareholders and renamed ABX, while the German group kept the ground-based parcel business.Astar, which is headed by former Northwest Airlines chief executive John Dasburg, also tried to acquire ABX in 2003, and the talks were revived last December before the Miami-based group last week made an unsolicited $7.75 a share proposal to acquire its rival, citing “unusual volume and pricing activity” in ABX stock.ABX was asked to respond by yesterday to a proposal which valued the company at $454m. Its shares climbed 12 per cent in the wake of the announcement and were trading just above $8, fuelling speculation of a rival offer from management.DHL has struggled to break the dominance of UPS and FedEx in the US market, scaling back its ambitions to become what one executive described as “a viable third competitor”, though it acquired a minority stake in Polar Air Cargo to gain access to the fast-growing transpacific market.Combining its two largest US contractors – which operate a hub at the same Ohio airport – would provide economies of scale at a time when the slowdown in the domestic economy has produced gloomy outlooks in recent weeks from FedEx and UPS.DHL said it expected no problems in securing regulatory backing for the two deals involving its suppliers.
399;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:15:04+0000;Big four hope expansion will deliver the goods;;UPS is counting on information-related services to give the international delivery company an edge in China’s highly fragment domestic express market, a growing industry battleground.“The data that’s wrapped around the shipment is becoming just as important as the goods themselves,” said Ken Torok, president of UPS Asia Pacific. “Our strategy is to add capability and a lot of that has been around the information piece.”Services such as shipment tracking and guaranteed-time deliveries that are common in Europe and the US are still rare in China. FedEx, UPS’ US rival, will only begin offering its signature guaranteed next-day express service within China next week.The push to provide value-added logistics services come largely from multi-national retailers such as Wal-Mart who are adopting a just-in-time model for sourcing from Chinese factories, says UPS. The vast scale and the complexity of supplying huge numbers of components to manufacturers on time is creating the need for advanced services.“One of the things we are working on is the ability to intercept and re-route shipments in transit,” said Mr Torok. He said multinationals are interested in such a service, which the company introduced for US domestic shipments in March.The ability to offer sophisticated logistics services is seen as a competitive advantage the “big four” international operators – UPS, FedEx, DHL and TNT – hold over domestic counterparts. “For the local players, [these services] are still relatively new,” said Edward Tse, greater China managing director for consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton.China’s express market was valued at about $4.4bn in 2006, with $3.1bn of that accounted for by the domestic market, according to a report by Booz Allen.It estimated that former monopoly China Post still holds about 40 per cent of the domestic express market but only about a 20 per cent share of deliveries in and out of China.The report put the big four’s share of international China shipments at about 75 per cent, with DHL in the lead with nearly a third of the market and UPS and FedEx each matching China Post’s share. The overall market is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 30 per cent and reach $7.4bn by 2008.The big four are all investing to expand their presence in China. FedEx’s guaranteed service will be run out of its new domestic hub in Hangzhou, a city near Shanghai. The company is also is building a $150m Asia hub in the south-eastern province of Guangzhou and last year paid $400m to take full control of its Chinese joint venture with Tianjin Datian W. Group.UPS signed an agreement last month to invest $20m in a new international air hub in Shanghai. DHL is in the process of choosing between Shanghai and Seoul for a new hub.China’s domestic market was liberalised only last year under the terms of the country’s World Trade Organisation accession agreement. It remains fragmented, with the big four holding about the same market share as thousands of small and mid-sized local companies.The big four are also anxious about a proposed new postal law. A seventh draft of the bill, now in front of the State Council, is , believed to contain a clause that would restore China Post’s monopoly over the delivery of parcels weighing less than 150g.“Right now the priority [for the Big Four] is still on the international market because it is still growing very fast,” said Mr Tse. “But they are all seriously looking at the domestic market.”
400;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;UPS blames economy for earnings drop;;UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, on Wednesday sounded a warning on the US economy, saying that “sluggish” growth had contributed to a drop in earnings in the first three months of the year.The comments by one of the most reliable US economic bellwethers, highlight the challenges posed by the slowing economy to American companies with a large proportion of sales in the domestic market.UPS, which derives about two-thirds of revenues from the US and dominates the market for small package delivery, said the strength of its international operations had helped to cushion the effect of a flat domestic market.“Strong gains in our international package and supply chain and freight businesses helped offset the impact of a slowing US economy,” said Mike Eskew, UPS chairman and chief executive.The resilience of the global economy, driven by strong growth emerging markets, has been important in bolstering US companies’ earnings in the face of a faltering domestic economy. This has been augmented by a sharp fall in the dollar against the euro and the pound.However, Scott Davis, UPS chief financial officer, said the US economy was likely to remain weak in the near term. “I expect it to remain sluggish for the next couple of quarters,” he told the Financial Times.US GDP first-quarter data, due on Friday, are expected to show growth weakening from 2.5 per cent (annualised) in the fourth quarter to 1.7 per cent, partly because of a slowdown in the housing market and business spending.The weakness in the economy hit UPS’s domestic package business, as lower demand for their goods prompted companies to cut back on deliveries, Mr Davis said. However, he added that the first quarter should be the low point for the year, with growth in the domestic package business expected to pick up.His comments came as UPS reported a 13.5 per cent drop in earnings in the three months to March. The results were hit by a $289m pretax charge to scrap some ageing aircraft and pay for voluntary redundancies.
401;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-03-12T15:54:55Z;EADS hit by Airbus losses;;EADS, Europe’s biggest aerospace and defence group, suffered an 86 per cent fall in operating profits last year, as its Airbus division plunged heavily into loss.It warned that Airbus would be hit by “another substantial loss” in 2007.The group barely broke even at the net level, as net profits fell by 94 per cent from €1.68bn to €99m, despite a 15 per cent rise in turnover to €39.4bn.The sales increase followed record deliveries of commercial aircraft and a 30 per cent increase in defence turnover, which for the first time reached €10bn.The EADS results, the worst since the company was formed in 2000 from a merger of a large part of the French, German and Spanish aerospace and defence industries, were dominated, however, by the debacle at Airbus.The division, which accounts for 64 per cent of group sales, fell to an operating loss of €572m from an operating profit of €2.3bn a year earlier, a €2.9bn reverse in its fortunes.Airbus fell steeply into loss chiefly under the disastrous impact of the two-year delays in first deliveries of its flagship A380 superjumbo. The group has incurred heavy costs to rescue the project in order eventually to be able to start series production.It has been hit too by the settlement of penalty claims from its A380 airline customers and the cancellation of orders for 20 A380 cargo aircraft from FedEx and UPS, the US express parcel delivery groups.EADS said that the total financial impact of the A380 problems amounted to €2.5bn, of which €1.2bn was for extra costs and loss making contracts, and €800m was to settle penalty claims.A further charge of €500m was incurred largely to write down the assets of the freighter version of the A380, where Airbus announced last week that it had stopped development work in the face of the order cancellations and delays.It has also been forced to transfer overstretched engineering resources from the freighter version to the rescue of the passenger A380, the biggest commercial jet ever built, as well as to the €10bn development of the A350, a new family of 270-350 seat, long range aircraft.The Airbus loss was further increased by €500m of charges related to the A350, a project, which was only approved last December after long delays and where the specifications were radically changed, long after initial orders were placed, as Airbus struggled to make the aircraft competitive with the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner.The 787 is due to make its maiden flight in August and to enter commercial service with Japan’s All Nippon Airways in May next year, about five years ahead of the planned entry into service of the A350 in 2013.EADS said the Airbus division had also been forced to make a €352m provision to cover “the risk and technical challenges” in its A400M military transport aircraft project, where concerns are growing that the development will be delayed and over budget.EADS failed to make any dividend proposal along with the disclosure of its results but said this would be considered at the group’s next board meeting.The Airbus division has been facing strikes and protests at some of its plants in France and Germany in recent days, as the group seeks to its implement a drastic restructuring programme aimed at cutting 10,000 jobs during the next four years and at cutting costs by €2.1bn a year by 2010.EADS said that Airbus would remain heavily in loss in 2007 under the impact of the costs of the restructuring programme, further costs to support the A380 programme, potential A350 launch charges, higher research and development expenses, as well as the impact of the weakening of the US Dollar against the euro.It forecast that its combined helicopters, space and defence businesses would achieve an operating profit of close to €1bn this year.The group has abandoned its previous ambitions of maintaining 10 per cent operating margins at Airbus and said that in the medium term it was targeting “mid-single digit” operating profit margins.Airbus revenues would “most likely be affected by a deterioration of mix and of pricing for recent orders, partly due to competitive pressure.”EADS indicated that the problems at Airbus were expected to undermine the group’s profitability for the long term.It said it was committed to restoring group wide operating profit margins, “although at levels lower than the margin achieved in 2005.”Despite the grave problems in its new aircraft development programmes, Airbus production of existing programmes is at a record level driven by the rising deliveries of its A320 family of single aisle short-haul aircraft.Total aircraft deliveries rose last year from 378 to 434, still ahead of Boeing for the fourth year in succession, and EADS said that deliveries in 2007 were forecast to rise further to between 440 and 450 aircraft. Boeing deliveries are forecast to rise this year from 398 to 445.
402;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-02-26T18:13:18Z;Easy appeal of quick win will lead to losses in the end;;"Louis Gallois needs a quick win. The problems facing the chief executive of Airbus, the troubled European aeroplane manufacturer, are stacking up like delayed flights over Heathrow.Not only is the company’s A380 superjumbo still not ready to be operated by any commercial airline, but UPS, the package courier, said on Friday that it now has the option to cancel its order for 10 A380s should there be any further delays. UPS’s rival Fedex cancelled its order for 10 A380s last November, and chose to buy 15 Boeing 777s instead. Mr Gallois’s next challenge? Persuading unions to agree to extend the 35-hour working week.George W. Bush needs a quick win. Although he tried to characterise last week’s announcement of an initial withdrawal of British troops from southern Iraq as a sign of success, few people shared this interpretation of events. A bigger, less equivocal success would help lift the president’s grim approval ratings.Steve McClaren needs a quick win. His England football team travels to Israel next month for a vital Euro 2008 group qualifier in Tel Aviv. The England manager is coming under pressure to recall his superstar midfielder David Beckham into the squad. But while the global fashion icon remains a pretty good footballer, let’s face it: he’s not the Messiah.Managers are constantly being asked, or told, to deliver “quick wins”. It is a familiar phrase, made up of two of the most seductive syllables in business.Who could possibly object to the idea of solving some problem expeditiously? Quick wins boost morale and build momentum. They get critical colleagues off your back, for the time being at least. How on earth are you going to calm down the analysts and ward off that private equity bid? A few quick wins should do the trick.And yet, take a closer look at our three leaders under pressure. To what extent can their underlying problems really be settled with a speedy answer? Airbus’s A380 project has been under way for over a decade. I remember attending a rather pleasant lunch at Aérospatiale in Toulouse in 1993, during which drawings of a super-jumbo were unveiled. Had I not been enjoying the excellent hospitality and charm of the French operation that day, I might have thought to ask some sharp questions about the project’s viability. Anyway, it is now far too late to turn around the A380’s problems just like that.In Iraq, meanwhile, there are few meaningful quick wins to be had. “Freedom’s untidy . . . stuff happens,” as Donald Rumsfeld, the former US secretary of defence, observed in April 2003. It would have been better for Mr Bush had this observation been made in advance of the US invasion, which has created a situation of appalling complexity.Nor will English football’s long-term malaise be cured by a happy result in Tel Aviv next month. The national side needs not only one quick win but a further five or six, followed by a serious rethink of the way the game is run in this country.“The only problems that have simple solutions are simple problems,” says the great “systems thinker” Russell Ackoff in his new book Management f-Laws – how organisations really work. “Problems that arise in organisations are almost always the product of interactions of parts, never the action of a single part. Complex problems do not have simple solutions.”Prof Ackoff’s underappreciated insight is that businesses and organisations need to be studied and understood as complete systems. Their different units do not operate in isolation from each other. That is why so-called quick wins in one part of the system will often have inevitable and unintended consequences in another part. A call centre bolted on to a business to provide better “customer service” may turn out to do no such thing. Improvements in one area can actually make everything else worse. It is like putting a Ferrari engine into a Hyundai car: the thing is not going to work. “It is futile doing things in isolation,” Prof Ackoff says.This analysis is shared by Jamie Bonomo and Richard Balaban of management consultancy Mercer, who argue in a discussion paper that “sooner or later one-off fixes lead to a poorly functioning business design”. They suggest that two fundamental steps are required before you can set about improving the performance of a business: first, you need to form an integrated view of how the business actually makes money; and second, you need to understand not only your value chain, but also your customers’ and your suppliers’ value chains.As soon as it becomes clear that a quick fix has not delivered the simple solutions that were promised, it will be thrown onto the growing pile of previously discarded management fads. Never mind – like the proverbial London bus, another one will be along in a minute.A recent policy paper from the international aid organisation Care looked at the ongoing problem of the opium trade in Afghanistan, and came to this mature, Ackoffian conclusion: “The desire for rapid reductions in illicit crop cultivation is leading to the demand for and adoption of heavy-handed, quick-fix strategies. Such short-term strategies, however – including outright bans, forced eradication and aerial spraying – do not address the drivers behind the planting of opium poppy and have often proven to be ineffective, expensive and even counterproductive.”The next time you are tempted to call for (or are instructed to deliver) a quick win, remember those other two, slightly longer words: Afghanistan and heroin."
403;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:15:04+0000;Wall Street rallies amid earnings;;US stocks rallied on Tuesday, as investors digested an array of earnings reports, a sharp jump in oil prices and waited for the Federal Reserve to conclude its policy meeting later on Wednesday.Hopes of a rate cut, potentially offsetting slower earnings growth, have dulled bullish momentum on equity markets.The Fed meeting is expected to reinforce expectations of little early change in policy.The current pace of fourth quarter earnings growth suggests an average increase of about 10 per cent, down from 19 per cent during the third quarter.“The fourth quarter should be seen as an important transition to a period of lower earnings,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.“Single-digit earnings growth remains consistent with respectable, if not stellar, equity market returns and the ongoing out-performance of equities against bonds,” he said.At the close in New York, the S&P 500 had risen 0.6 per cent to 1,428.82, helped by a 2.1 per cent gain in energy stocks.The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,448.64. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 0.3 per cent to 12,523.31.Motorola shares jumped 6.9 per cent to $19.58 on news that Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor, was interested in joining the company’s directors.The earnings season shifted into a higher gear on Tuesday. Mixed results and guidance from a number of companies sparked choppy trading.US Steel rose 4.4 per cent to $80.27 as it beat quarterly estimates but warned that profit growth would slow this quarter.3M reported fourth quarter results that beat forecasts, but the diversified manufacturing company said a slower global economy could lower its 2007 results.Shares in 3M fell 5.4 per cent to $74.70.UPS delivered fourth quarter earnings of $1.04 a share that matched estimates. Its shares fell 2.4 per cent to $72.70 as the company warned that growth could slow in 2007.Procter & Gamble beat earnings forecasts, but its shares fell 0.45 per cent to $64.59.Colgate-Palmolive also exceeded the expectations of analysts and its shares rose 1.1 per cent to $67.42.Merck said fourth quarter profits fell 58 per cent and the results just missed forecasts. Its stock fell 1.3 per cent to $44.91.US Airways and JetBlue, both returned to profitability during the fourth quarter, but investors sold shares after they rose in early trade. US Airways fell 2.4 per cent to $53.10 and JetBlue slumped 4.5 per cent to $13.85.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell 1.3 per cent to $568.25, as a 33 per cent rise in quarterly profit missed estimates due to lower trading margins.
404;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;Aircastle in $1.6bn deal to buy 38 aircraft;;Aircastle, the aircraft leasing group, announced plans on Monday to buy 38 planes from a Chicago-based investment group for $1.6bn in a move which highlights the improving prospects of the cargo market.The portfolio includes 12 Boeing 747-400 freighters, the largest commercial cargo aircraft, with UPS expected to confirm this week that it has cancelled the sole remaining order for the Airbus A380F.The proposed deal will almost double the size of Connecticut-based Aircastle, which was floated last year by Fortress, the private equity group. The company is buying the 12 cargo aircraft and 26 passenger aircraft from Guggenheim Aviation Partners to add to an existing portfolio valued at $2bn.Steve Rimmer, Guggenheim Aviation’s chief executive, described the move as an “opportunistic sale”, though the group will remain in the sector through a fleet of 19 aircraft which it owns or has on order.Aircastle described the move as “transformational”, providing it with scale at a time when leasing companies are expanding their 30 per cent share of the global aircraft fleet as airlines look for more flexible financing options.The sector is led by General Electric’s Gecas unit and the ILFC operation owned by American International Group. While private equity firms have increased their exposure to aircraft and leasing in recent years, some executives believe the sector may have reached the top of its cycle, leading some to explore exit strategies.Bank of China last month paid $965m for Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise, while Avion, the Icelandic investment group, sold its UK charter airline and part of its aircraft trading business last October to a management buy-out group for $501m.GATX, the US financial services group, last year sold its aircraft leasing business in two parts to Macquarie, the Australian investment group, and AerCap, a publicly listed lessor controlled by Cerberus, the private equity firm.Terra Firma, the buyout group led by Guy Hands, is understood to be exploring a potential IPO of the Awas leasing business acquired last year for $2.6bn from Morgan Stanley.
405;UPS;United Parcel Service;2007-01-17T18:21:12Z;Europe grounded after EADS profit warning;;European equity markets failed to gain positive momentum on Wednesday, falling as weakness in the aerospace and industrial sectors weighed on sentiment.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.5 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 1,510.37.However, ASML was the leading gainer on the FTSE Eurofirst 300, charging 8.4 per cent higher to €20.39 after the Dutch chip-making equipment manufacturer outlined plans for an additional share buy-back programme. It also said sales would rise next year as it moved towards its target of €5bn for annual revenues.ABN Amro upgraded its recommendation from “sell” to “buy” and raised its price target from €16 to €22.4.EADS fell 2.8 per cent to €25.01 after the aircraft maker was forced to make its second profits warning in four months.Some one-off costs, originally expected to occur in 2007, will be booked in the 2006 accounts. Some traders thought earlier recognition of the already known charges was a non-event but noted that EADS has said further charges could be necessary.Bid speculation continues to surround TNT, the Dutch logistics group, up 3.7 per cent to €36.08. Deutsche Post was also well bid, up 2.4 per cent to €23.66, buoyed by Tuesday’s rumours that Blackstone, the private equity group, was trying to buy a part of the 30.6 per cent stake currently owned by KfW, the German state bank.However, traders said that private equity bidders would be likely to face significanrt political opposition as Deutsche Post is Germany’s largest employer with an aggressive union while TNT retains a “poison pill” which could be activated by its trustees. UPS is also seen as a potential bidder for TNT and could afford a higher price as it could generate synergies not available to a private equity buyer.Remy Cointreau rose 4.4 per cent to €51.40 as the drinks group was lifted by fresh bid speculation, with Diageo named as a possible predator.Beiersdorf fell 4.1 per cent to €47.81 with the sale of a large stake weighing on the maker of Nivea skin cream. Deutsche Bank placed 10 per cent of Beiersdorf at between €48 and €50 per share on behalf of the City of Hamburg.Market talk suggested an eventual sale of Beiersdorf was more likely but Andrew Woods of Sandford Bernstein said an imminent deal was unlikely as major shareholder Tchibo had not indicated that it wants to sell its stake.Telefonica eased 0.9 per cent to €16.70 after UBS downgraded its recommendation on the Spanish telecoms company from “neutral” to “reduce” but held its price target at €15.70. UBS said increasing competition could lead to a decline in the top-line and profits for both Telefónica’s mobile and fixed line operations in Spain.Speculation has suggested Telefónica could buy Telecom Italia but UBS said a full acquisition would require a possible 40 per cent capital increase for Telefónica and could be politically controversial.Vallourec retreated 2 per cent to €196.40 amid rumours that Vincent Bollore, the French financier, was considering selling some of his 7 per cent stake in the French steel pipe maker.Bid speculation continues to swirl around Alitalia as the Italian government prepares to sell its 49 per cent stake in the airline. Jean-Cyril Spinetta, the head of Air France-KLM has resigned form the board of Alitalia, which traders said could suggest a bid was imminent. Alitalia rose 2.6 per cent to €1.06 while Air France-KLM firmed 0.5 per cent at €34.31.Sandvik rose 3 per cent to SKr103.00 after the Swedish industrial group agreed to buy Shark Abrasion Systems, a small Australian engineering concern, for an undisclosed sum.Peder Frolen of Handelsbanken Capital Markets said the deal was immaterial and Sanvik was playing catch-up with its peers as investors woke up to its attractive valuation and exposure to fast growing segments of capital goods markets.Bank Sarasin rose 2.6 per cent to SFr3,980 after Credit Suisse upgraded its recommendation from “neutral” to ”outperform” and raised its price target from SFr3,080 to SFr4600. Credit Suisse said Rabobank acquisition of a majority stake could have a substantial impact on Sarasin’s strategy.The European online advertising market remains highly fragmented and hopes for further consolidation have been raised by this week’s $900m bid for TradeDoubler by AOL of America.Adrian Hopkinson of West LB said the bid highlighted valuation anomalies elsewhere in the sector and reiterated his “buy” recommendations on both Adlink Internet Media, up 5.7 per cent to €16.70 and Tomorrow Focus, 0.4 per cent firmer at €2.56. Ad Pepper Media, unchanged at 10.85, is also seen as an interesting play.
406;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Bush urged to break US oil dependence;;The Bush administration should act decisively to break America’s dependence on oil, said a group of leading US business executives and senior military officers in a report presented on Wednesday to the White House and Congress.The bipartisan group, which includes the chief executives of Fedex, UPS, Dow Chemicals and some of America’s best known retired generals, urged Washington to recognise that “pure market economics will never solve the problem” of US oil dependency.The report poured cold water on the Bush administration’s goal of reducing America’s dependence on foreign oil, rather than on oil in general. It urged Mr Bush and the new Democrat-controlled Congress to set up a plan to halve the American economy’s oil-intensity by 2030.George W. Bush has repeatedly identified “energy independence” and immigration reform as two of the issues most likely to attract bipartisan support following the Republican loss of control of Capitol Hill in mid-term elections last month.“Events affecting supply or demand anywhere will affect consumers everywhere,” said the report, brought out by the Energy Security Leadership Council, a think tank. “Exposure to price shocks is a function of how much oil a nation consumes and is not significantly affected by the ratio of “domestic oil” to so-called “foreign oil”.The report also warned Mr Bush, who is expected to announce new energy independence measures in his annual State of the Union address to Congress next month, that America’s oil dependence makes it acutely vulnerable to terrorist attacks.America’s transport system is 97 per cent dependent on oil. More than 90 per cent of world oil supply is controlled by foreign governments. “America must address this critical weakness.” Said P.X. Kelley, a retired Marine Corps general. “An oil supply interruption cannot be reasonably dismissed as improbable.”However, there is deep-seated scepticism about the willingness of the Bush administration, which has yet to endorse the theory of global warming, to take the tough steps most energy experts say are necessary to reduce America’s dependence on oil.Last January Mr Bush declared that America was “addicted to oil”. But Mr Bush’s announcement was not followed by any significant change in energy strategy. “There is very little reason to believe that the White House will take the tough measures necessary to make this happen,” said a Washington-based energy lobbyist. “There is no appetite, say, to impose a carbon tax or for putting a floor under the price of oil that would incentivise investors to put their money into alternative energy.”However, the US administration wants to step up co-operation with China on energy efficiency and the use of alternative fuels. Energy and the environment will be among the topics addressed in Friday’s final session of the US-China strategic economic dialogue involving top officials meeting in Beijing.The dialogue is the brainchild of Hank Paulson, US Treasury Secretary, who has a strong track record as an environmentalist and is treated with suspicion by some US conservatives as a result. Lack of binding targets for China and other big emerging market countries such as India to limit their greenhouse gas emissions was one of America’s principal reasons for refusing to ratify the Kyoto accord.
407;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;German business gloom at odds with rest of EU;;Business leaders in Germany and France are markedly less optimistic about their companies’ economic prospects next year than other large European countries, according to a survey published on Monday.The poll of 1,450 senior directors in some of Europe’s biggest companies reveals Germany as the only country to be less optimistic than a year ago about future business prospects.The UPS Europe Business Monitor, was conducted by TNS, the market research group, on behalf of UPS, the parcels company, during September and October. It shows that, overall, 58 per cent of business directors in seven European countries think their company will be in a better position in a year’s time and 7 per cent expect it to be worse, giving a net optimism score of 51 per cent.Germany was the only country in which net corporate optimism dropped compared to last year. The survey’s findings are at odds with German business confidence indicators - the latest survey results from the Munich-based Ifo Institute showed optimism at a 15-year high - but could indicate concern about the effect of January’s three percentage point rise in value added tax.Optimism was highest in the Netherlands, followed by Italy, Spain and the UK, on an equal footing. Business leaders in France were the least optimistic but were still more optimistic than a year ago.In the UK, senior executives were more optimistic on increasing their workforce than at any time in the past 16 years, with more than a third reporting plans to increase hiring over the next 12 months.When asked to name which countries had benefited most from EU membership, Spain came top, followed by Poland and Portugal. The UK was identified as among the countries to have least benefitedThe UK also emerged as the only country to cite reform of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy as a priority. Asked what the top reform priority should be after the next round of EU enlargement, 52 per cent of those surveyed chose ensuring compliance with regulations, followed by harmonising internal market taxation. Extending EU membership was identified as the lowest priority.
408;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-12-06T22:04:49Z;Lufthansa orders Boeing 747-8s;;Lufthansa on Wednesday agreed to become the launch customer for the passenger version of Boeing’s new 747-8I jumbo jet, but insisted there was no conflict with its existing order for Airbus A380 aircraft.The German flag carrier announced orders for 20 747-8 Intercontinentals, with the first arriving in 2010, a year after its initial A380 delivery.Nico Bucholz, Lufthansa’s senior vice-president for fleet development, said the 400-seat aircraft would fill a gap between its existing range of 300-seat jets and the 500-plus offered by its A380s.Mr Buchholz declined to identify where the two aircraft would fly, though said they would be focused on long-range routes served by its existing fleet of older 747s. LufthansaBoeing has spent a year seeking the launch customer for the passenger version of the 747-8, stretching the aircraft to add more seats and adding new engines and wings to improve its economics.The US manufacturer has secured more than 40 orders for the freighter version of the aircraft, while Airbus is left with just one customer for the cargo version of the A380. ILFC, the leasing company, this week opted to convert its freighter orders to the passenger version. UPS is the sole customer for the A380F after FedEx, its rival package delivery group, cancelled its orders because of the production delays with the new aircraft.Lufthansa has previously ordered 15 A380s, the biggest order from a European carrier, but the first deliveries have been hit by severe delays of at last two years due to the production problems at Airbus and are unlikely to reach Lufthansa before mid-2009.The news came as Thai Airways on Wednesday said it would cancel its order for six A380s if talks on compensation for delayed delivery failed. Thai Airways said it would make a final decision after its board meets on December 19. Boeing launched the 747-8 programme a year ago on the basis of initial orders for18 freighters worth around $5bn from two all-cargo airlines, Cargolux of Luxembourg and Japan’s Nippon Cargo Airlines, which will take delivery of their first aircraft in 2009.The US group claims that there is growing interest from existing operators of the current 747-400, version in particular in Asia and Europe. The five largest 747-400 operators are Japan Airlines, British Airways, Northwest Airlines, Korean Air and Cathay Pacific.Recently British Airways opened negotiations with both Boeing and Airbus on purchases of new aircraft worth around $10bn during the coming decade, including the 747-8 and the A380, as it embarks on the costly process of renewing and expanding its long-haul fleet.BA, one of the most influential aircraft buyers, currently operates an all-Boeing fleet of long-haul aircraft, but it has launched a contest, which is pitting the Airbus A330, A350XWB and A380 against the Boeing 787, 777 and 747-8.Airbus is desperate to re-establish its credibility as a supplier of long-haul passenger jets after the debacle it has suffered over the A380 and the long delay in officially launching the development of the A350XWB family of long range, medium capacity jets, which finally took place last week.The first A380 is now due to be delivered to Singapore Airlines in October 2007 with full production of four a month only due by 2010.It won a small consolation prize on Wednesday from Lufthansa, which placed an order for a further seven Airbus A340-600s. Orders for the four-engined A340-600 have virtually dried up during the last two years with most airlines preferring the more fuel efficient two-engined rival 777 from Boeing.

We tend to forget a third haven for the lyric muse: the academic Juilliard Opera Center. We remembered on Wednesday.The bill was Offenbach’s Orphée aux enfers (Orpheus in the Underworld), a parody of ancient mythology seldom ventured by American companies. For many, the chief attraction was the conductor, Anne Manson. She untied every rhythmic and melodic knot of this naughty opéra bouffon with flair that buoyed both a splendid orchestra and an eager cast.She imposed fast tempos that never seemed rushed, transparent textures that never seemed precious. She sustained propulsion without leaving anyone breathless. It was an elegant achievement.John Pascoe, who staged and designed this economic, sometimes cinematic production, was less consistent. At his best he offered amusing whimsy.At his worst he introduced heavy-footed vulgarity. He set the action in a middle-American never-neverland where a cornfield consists of rows of golden letters that repeatedly spell out corn. Funny. He also toyed with icons.Public Opinion resembled Oprah Winfrey. Eurydice became Marilyn of Hollywood, her skirt in a constant trademark billow (we hadn’t seen that since Stephen Lawless turned Handel’s Semele into the same superstar at the City Opera).Cupid bore a striking resemblance to Fonzie, the quasi-hero of Happy Days. Mercury impersonated a UPS delivery-man. More enigmatic: Mars re-imagined as an amputee in a wheelchair and Minerva reduced to a head minus a torso on a hospital bed.All the singers exuded promise. Three did more than that. Brenda Rae fused rare vivacity with virtuosity as Eurydice Monroe. Jeffrey Behrens brought canny bravado to the connivances of Pluto, flashing an exquisite diminuendo in the process.Isabel Leonard oozed charm as Cupid Winkler. Everyone articulated the French text, both sung and spoken, with care. Still, an English translation might have made better sense.

410;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-11-09T19:29:34Z;Extra serving of praise (for some);;The danger of deciding to “name and praise” is that those not named might feel shamed by implication. This may have been the intention of Markos Kyprianou, Europe’s health commissioner, when he lauded various junk – sorry, convenience – food and drinks companies for their commitments to fight Europe’s obesity epidemic.Kraft was named for agreeing not to advertise its products in primary schools (and might be a bit ashamed it ever did) and not to market certain products to under-12s. Unilever’s European boss Kees van der Graaf said that it had eliminated 2,000 tons of salt from its soups – that’s the amount found in 57 Olympic-sized swimming pools, apparently.McDonald’s, meanwhile, was commended for labelling products with details of how much of the recommended daily intake of fat, salt and so on they contain. Its European president, Denis Hennequin, was only too delighted to bask in his moment on stage.Earlier in the day, the people at Kellogg’s, the cereal company, had announced to the world that they were pleased to be recognised for a very similar labelling scheme.However, Kyprianou did not mention them at all.Were they sore? Not at all.“We have been doing this for rather longer than some companies,” a Kelloggs spokesman snapped, crackled and popped.What women wantAt Fiat’s two-day investor presentation in Turin, the Italian industrial powerhouse talked about a bright future. A new sparkling Fiat would sell shiny, sexy cars to young, sexy and shiny people.Luca De Meo, marketing chief of the car division, outlined some of the new models and added, of some of the customers the company was wooing: “We will have a lot of arguments to attract young people, women, young women.” The company might have more success attracting young women if it promoted any. On stage yesterday were the 26 most senior executives in Fiat’s car division and every one was male. Only one was not wearing a tie and that was Sergio Marchionne, chief executive.Brown is backDHL, the German package delivery company, announced its ambition to become a serious player in the US two years ago with a brazen advertising campaign, declaring that yellow, its corporate colour, was “the new brown”.The slogan referred to the famous livery of UPS, the US market leader. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that UPS is now crowing about DHL’s failure to fulfil its own hype.The German company has lost more than $1bn (€780m) in the US over the past two years and remains just a fraction of its rival’s size. Addressing an investor conference this week, Scott Davis, UPS’s chief financial officer, said DHL was good at “self-promotion” but showed no sign of becoming more competitive. “We’re not hearing anything from our customers about them,” added John Beystehner, chief operating officer.Mike Eskew, chief executive, acknowledged that DHL had initially won some customers. “We usually got them back after not very long.”Stubb’s snubAmong the many recent targets of French President Jacques Chirac was Finnish food. After Parma defeated Helsinki in the race to host the European food safety agency, Chirac quipped to Vladimir Putin that Finland was the only EU country that had worse grub than Britain.That prompted Alex Stubb, a Finnish member of the European parliament who is married to a Brit, to invite him round for an Anglo-Finnish dinner. Alas, Stubb has waited a year without a reply. On Thursday he said he had worked out why. “It is a protocol, issue,” he said. “We invited him alone. Now we are writing to the president and Mrs Chirac and I am sure they will come.”Observer does not share his confidence. Chirac will not be able to escape one Finnish meal, however, when he attends the summit of European leaders in Brussels next month. As holder of the rotating presidency, Finland is in charge of the agenda and the menu.Off the hookOne of the most notorious video clips to have circulated over the internet recently features Disneyland Paris employees pretending to rut with each other while dressed as Disney cartoon characters. Those participating in the backstage lewdness include Minnie and Mickey Mouse, Goofy and a snowman. Now it looks like the perpetrators of the simulated inter-species couplings have escaped punishment. Karl Holz, chairman and chief executive of Euro Disney, the theme park’s operator, wearily suggested as much when questioned about the affair at the group’s annual results this week.Holz said the “inappropriate” frolicking happened “months ago”. “It probably happened sometime during the Christmas season last year. At the point in time we became aware of the video those involved had left the employment of the company.”Already goneTo Brussels, where there was evidence on Thursday that Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, is taking seriously his vow to step back from his role at the software company to focus on his philanthropy.The world’s richest man was asked by a journalist about a deal Microsoft had just announced in which it would pay a percentage of sales of its soon-to-be released Zune device, a rival to Apple’s iPod, to Universal Music. A smiling Gates confessed that he knew nothing about the agreement. Told that Universal was expected to receive more than $1 in royalties per Zune, he mused that Microsoft must have some “great exclusive rights” as a result.
411;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:12:40+0000;A380 delays push EADS into the red;;EADS, the leading European aerospace and defence group, fell heavily into loss in its third quarter under the burden of the rising costs for the long delays in deliveries of the A380 and the weakness of the US dollar.It suffered an operating loss of €239m compared with a profit of €559m a year ago and said that it was still unable to give guidance on its outlook for the full year.The group issued last month a €4.8bn profits warning for the years to 2010 and announced that delays in the A380 programme had increased to at least two years.The group suffered a further blow this week, when FedEx, the world’s largest express delivery group, scrapped its order for 10 freighter versions of the A380 in favour of Boeing, the first cancellation since the series of disclosures of damaging production delays, which has cast doubts on the whole future of the cargo version.UPS, FedEx’s rival, also has orders for 10 aircraft and ILFC, the leasing group, has orders for five freighters, but Hans Peter Ring, chief financial officer said these were “all in the cancellation zone” given the delays.In the third quarter EADS fell to a net loss of €195m from a net profit of €279m a year ago.Airbus, which is 100 per cent owned by EADS since last month’s acquisition of the remaining 20 per cent stake from BAE Systems of the UK, suffered a fall to an operating loss of €350m from a profit of €410m a year ago.EADS turnover rose by 14 per cent to €8.48bn in the third quarter supported by record deliveries of Airbus aircraft, which are forecast to reach 430 this year, up from 378 in the whole of 2005.Airbus orders have fallen sharply during 2006, however, as the group struggles to re-establish credibility with its customers, with the value of Airbus orders in the first nine months dropping by 49 per cent to €14.7bn from €28.6bn a year ago.In a joint statement Tom Enders and Louis Gallois, the German and French co-chief executives, said “the struggle to reverse the A380 problems imposes a severe burden on our financial performance. This together with the dollar devaluation requires drastic measures to remain competitive.”In the first nine months operating profits fell by 34 per cent from €2.1bn to €1.4bn. Net income declined from €1.3bn to €848m with earnings per share falling from €1.60 to €1.06. Turnover rose by 17 per cent to €27.5bn.In addition to the extra costs from the A380 programme with charges of €1bn in the nine months EADS is being hit by the unwinding of its protective currency hedges, a €750m deterioration in the nine months, as it becomes more exposed to the weakness of the US dollar against the euro.It is also being hit by rising research and technology costs, as it prepares the future technologies needed to support the development of a new generation single aisle aircraft to replace the current highly successful A320 family in the next decade. The group had to undertake extensive retraining of its engineers to prepare the switch from metal to composites in manufacturing.EADS is facing too heavy losses and charges, probably amounting to at least €350m in the full year from the restructuring, including partial disposal and closure of its Sogerma aircraft maintenance and repair business. Losses at Sogerma totalled €227m in the first nine months.Mr Ring said that the EADS board was expected to make a decision “in the weeks to come” on the future of the Airbus A350XWB programme to develop a new generation family of long range, medium capacity jets urgently needed to compete against the highly successful Boeing 787 and 777 aircraft.He said the “major headaches” for the board in deciding whether to go ahead with the industrial launch of the A350 concerned the financing and engineering resources.He said the planned Power8 restructuring programme at Airbus aimed at cutting costs by €2bn a year by 2010 was “a pre-condition” and was “crucial” to the group’s ability to generate the cashflow to help fund the A350 development costs, which are expected to exceed $12bn.The board also had to be satisfied whether Airbus had the engineering resources to develop the A350 without undermining the delivery of its other programmes.In other areas of the EADS group Eurocopter, the world’s leading helicopter maker, won new orders for 471 aircraft in the first nine months, more than it has ever sold before in a full year, while the space division doubled its order intake.The impact of the problems at Airbus is overshadowing the improvement in profitability in other sectors of EADS including defence, helicopters, space and military transport aircraft.
412;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-11-08T03:20:57Z;A380 blow as FedEx switches to Boeing;;Airbus suffered a further blow to its troubled A380 superjumbo programme when for the first time an order for the aircraft was cancelled and Boeing aircraft ordered instead.On Tuesday FedEx, the world’s largest express delivery group, cancelled its order for 10 freighter variants of the aircraft, opting instead for Boeing 777s.Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, said the A380 was a “terrific aeroplane”, but the group could not afford to wait for it any longer. FedEx had been due to receive the first freighter by 2009, but the A380’s recent production problems had pushed that back to beyond 2010.“The problem simply became that with two delays and the continued growth in the marketplace we were in danger of not being able to continue to expand our network and meet customer demand,” Mr Smith told the FT.Airbus said on Tuesday that it regretted the decision but added but it understood FedEx’s “urgent need to address capacity growth”.The Toulouse-based aircraft manufacturer insisted that there was still a strong market for its troubled superjumbo aircraft, which has recently seen two big customers increase their orders for the passenger variant.“Demand for the A380 is high as evidenced by recent repeat commitments from airlines such as Qantas and Singapore,” said an Airbus spokesperson. However, Virgin Atlantic last month said it was delaying delivery of the first of its six A380s by four years to 2013.Singapore Airlines told Bloomberg on Wednesday morning that it would keep its orders for the superjumbo.But the FedEx decision remains a severe blow for the struggling aircraft maker. Not only does it call into doubt the future of the freighter version but it makes it more difficult to meet the A380’s break-even target of 420 aircraft. The cancellation cuts the number of confirmed orders for both variants of the superjumbo from 159 to 149.Fedex was the launch customer for the freighter, which was designed in close collaboration with the express carrier. Analysts on Tuesday questioned whether FedEx’s move could jeopardise further commitments from rival logistics group UPS, which has 10 on order.“It will be very interesting to see if UPS, which tends to mirror everything that FedEx does, continues to take the aircraft,” said one leading aerospace analyst. However, he suggested that FedEx would return to place orders for the A380 after its immediate needs for extra capacity had been addressed. “They were just making a very strong point very cheaply,” he said.Mr Smith, however, seemed to exclude a return to the A380, saying it was “not in our best interest to operate too many different types of aircraft.”Industrial problems with the A380 project have delayed delivery of the world’s largest commercial aircraft by at least two years and forced Airbus’s parent EADS to issue a €4.8bn profit warning in September.Doubts over its efficiency had already led Emirates to convert its two orders into passenger aircraft. International Lease Finance Corporation, one of the world’s largest aircraft leasing companies, still has five freighters on order, but these were thought to be on behalf of Emirates.■ EADS, Airbus’s Franco-German parent, is due on Wednesday to announce third quarter results. A board meeting on Tuesday discussed whether to go ahead with the launch of the A350XWB long range aircraft, but no decision is expected before the end of the month. The aircraft is expected to cost more than $10bn, while the group is also facing heavy penalties over the delays to its A380 superjumbo.
413;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-10-12T14:36:58Z;Company staff earn bonus in disaster relief;;The earthquake in Pakistan a year ago killed more than 73,000 people, injured more than 128,000 and left more than 3m homeless. While many companies round the world made financial donations, logistics companies such as TNT, DHL, PWC Logistics and UPS were able to offer direct help in the form of trained staff, transport and equipment as a natural extension of their day-to-day operations.The central motive for their efforts was to bring vital help to the needy. But the endeavours of private sector companies – and the relationships they built with non-governmental organisations along the way – had profound benefits for employee skills and morale.With their sophisticated supply chain networks, fleets of aircraft and trucks, logistics companies are ideal partners for disaster relief agencies, says Professor Alyson Warhurst, director of the corporate citizenship unit at Warwick Business School.This is why, when UPS announced a $2m (£1.1m) donation for victims of the Pakistan earthquake, half the gift consisted of in-kind services such as transport of medical and health supplies.Yet co-operating with humanitarian organisations also brings benefits to participating businesses. Lynnette McIntire of UPS says helping disaster victims reinvigorates the workforce.“It gives them a whole new perspective on their jobs. They learn how to solve problems quickly and, because it is a crisis situation, it builds relationships.”It also improves employees’ skills, says Mariam Al Foudery of Kuwait-based PWC Logistics. “Humanitarian organisations are dem-anding customers – they know what they want and their standards are exacting. If we can respond to their needs in a very short time frame, we are likely to do a good job elsewhere.”Logistics companies are using their experience of each disaster to improve their response to the next one. In the aftermath of the Pakistan earthquake, the Airport Emergency Team swung into action at Chaklala air base in Islamabad, handling 9,000 tons of relief supplies from 230 aircraft in three weeks. The AET, based at Dubai airport, is made up of 40 volunteers from nearby companies, including DHL, TNT and the airline Emirates, who are trained in team building, disaster awareness, security, ramp operations and first aid.It was set up after a review of the relief operation for the 2003 earthquake in Bam, Iran, and the Al Hoceima, Morocco, quake in 2004, showed that airports close to the scene of a disaster are a critical bottleneck in the provision of aid. When many relief flights arrived in short order, airports were unable to cope. Aircraft loaded with supplies blocked the apron and runway, so incoming aircraft carrying further supplies were unable to land.In these situations the AET can help by immediately being deployed to the airport closest to the disaster-affected area.“In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, this kind of help is better than any money can buy and it gives [us] the edge in moving aid fast,” says James Morris, executive director of the United Nations’ World Food Programme.The WFP has been working with Dutch group TNT since 2002. Meanwhile, Deutsche Post World Net, the German company that owns DHL, has links with the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UN Development Programme.Mike Goodhand, head of international logistics for the British Red Cross, says many business skills are transferable to humanitarian relief and the secondment of company logistics staff benefits both sides.“The logisticians pick up new ways of working in a different environment and it exposes us to the latest corporate thinking and business tools such as software,” he says.The Red Cross is looking beyond the logistics sector, too. “There are sectors where logistics is not the prime role but it is an important part of the business – areas such as clothing and retail where companies may have to find supplies very quickly in reaction to changing fashions – whose skills are very relevant to disaster relief,” says Mr Goodhand.Companies are also looking for ways to help communities be better prepared when disaster does strike – not simply for altruistic reasons. “We have employees all over the world – from our point of view, getting businesses back on their feet is good for us and for our workers,” says UPS’s Ms McIntire.The key to minimising the impact of disasters on those affected is to make them less vulnerable. In Pakistan, for instance, construction companies can “build back better” by making new homes earthquake-proof for those displaced in last year’s quake.Elsewhere, financial services companies offer micro-insurance products that help those who have lost everything get back on their feet.
414;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-09-22T15:41:35Z;On the defensive in an ever-changing world;;"Q. I have been running a family property business for the past 20 years and have been told that the need for the “building in resilience” for offices, shops and other facilities, since the London terrorist attacks of July 7, has become a big issue. Would you tell me exactly what “resilience” means, how necessary it is and what kind of buildings would be affected? Does it mean that I will have to re-evaluate construction work generally and construction work that is currently in progress? And is there such a thing as insurance against terrorism, and if so is it an alternative answer?Name withheldA. “Resilience” in relation to construction means the ability of offices, shops and other structures to withstand a wide range of conditions. We already construct to withstand expected weather conditions and the use of the structure. When people talk about resilience now, they mean withstanding more hostile activities such as the attacks of 9/11 and of July 7. Constructing to accommodate special risks is not new; a jeweller’s shop, for instance, will normally have special blinds, possibly laminated glass windows, and the street furniture positioned so as to deter ram raiding. Building in resilience is an extension of this concept.Constructing to deal with the risk of terrorist attacks can include a more robust construction such as thicker walls, or UPS (an uninterruptible power supply that will automatically start if the conventional power supply is cut off). This is usually provided by large batteries, so extra space and provision for connecting them up to the electricity cabling is required.It is important to design in resilience measures from the start. Installing them as a retrofit is much more expensive, so it is not appropriate to treat them as part of the tenant’s fit out.The buildings likely to need resilience include those that must not fail even in an emergency. The government has recently advertised for a developer in relation to a regional control centre for the London Fire & Emergency Planning Authority, which requires a high degree of security and resilience. There are other fairly obvious targets, such as airports and therefore the buildings close to them. Apart from these, evaluation must be on a case-by-case basis.It is not cheap to incorporate extra resilience into buildings already under construction or in the very late stages of design. Is it better, therefore, to approach the situation from the other end, and rely on insurance against terrorism? At the moment this insurance is generally available. The government has effectively underwritten insurers for providing insurance against “acts of terrorism” but you need to check exactly what is included in your insurance and be aware that cover could be withdrawn at any time.Gillian Birkby is a partner at Fladgate Fielder, the law firmQ. I run a small fashion PR agency aimed at the younger end of the market, and most of the consultants that I employ are therefore in their 20’s to early 30’s. I understand that from October 1 new laws will be introduced to outlaw ageism in the workplace. How will I be affected by these new laws and do I have a justifiable reason in law for not employing older staff given the nature of my business?Name withheldA. From October 1 2006, the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 will come into effect, outlawing discrimination on grounds of age, in relation to employment and vocational training, throughout the UK. The new law is designed to protect workers in all aspects of their employment, including recruitment, terms and conditions, promotion/demotion, transfers and dismissals. As an employer, this will therefore affect you significantly, since it applies to all of your dealings with your staff.Additionally, you should be aware that this protection applies not only to those already in work, but also to job-seekers. If you treat one job-seeker less favourably than another on grounds of their age, or the age they appear to be, this will amount to discrimination. As a result, if you choose not to recruit a job-applicant for such reasons, that person would be entitled to bring a claim for age discrimination against your agency.However, the law does recognise that difference in treatment may be necessary in certain circumstances, and there is therefore a potential defence to the claim, if you can show that the discrimination is “objectively justified”. This means that a claim would be likely to succeed against you unless you could establish that the discrimination was absolutely necessary for a legitimate reason, and there was no other, less detrimental, way forward. Legitimate reasons will include health and safety issues or particular training requirements of the job. Assuming that a younger person will be ‘trendier’ than an older person, or have better fashion sense, is unlikely to meet this criteria, particularly when the government has said this is intended to be a tough test for employers.Best practice would be to adopt an age-neutral recruitment policy. You should be careful to consider what the real requirements of the job are, and base your assessments of candidates on this, rather than their age. It would be wise to review your advertisements to ensure that they do not suggest that age is a factor in your recruitment decisions.Samantha Mangwana is a solicitor in the award-winning employment law team at Russell Jones & Walker."

The Philadelphia Stock Exchange’s semiconductor index has risen more than 7 per cent in the past three days.Broadcom leapt 8.9 per cent to $30.38 on news that the International Trade Commission had extended by 50 days an investigation into the alleged infringement of a Broadcom patent by wireless technology group Qualcomm.Qualcomm was not adversely affected, instead jumping 6.7 per cent to $37.83 following bullish comments by Merrill Lynch.Another chipmaker, Xilinx, announced late on Tuesday that it had uncovered no evidence of fraud in its stock options grants. Its shares rose 10 per cent to $22.71.PMC-Sierra gained 9.5 per cent to $6.11 after a Taiwanese company said it would use PMC processors for its internet telephony service.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent, or 9.85 points, at 1,295.43, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.6 per cent, or 34.53 points, at 2,149.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent, or 96.86 points, at 11,327.12.However, Merrill Lynch’s Mary Ann Bartels sounded a cautionary note about recent gains in equity markets.“We continue to believe that while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are positioned for a rally that could carry these indexes to or through their May highs, the technical underpinnings for the rally are weak,” she said.“The possibility exists that the highs for the year and the bull market are in, and that a cyclical correction that could approach 15-20 per cent has begun, with the Nasdaq at risk for a 25-30 per cent pullback.”The only main sector to show weakness was oil, which sank as crude fell to its lowest level in six weeks. Chevron tumbled 1.4 per cent to $65.11, and Hess dropped 2.2 per cent to $49.20.Energy’s one bright spot was coal, which steamed higher after television stock commentator Jim Cramer said the sector was poised for a bounce. Peabody Energy leapt 7.1 per cent to $47.83 and Arch Coal rose 5 per cent to $36.42.Lower oil buoyed transport stocks. United Parcel Service added 4.5 per cent to $72.13, and the S&P airlines index had its best day in a month, with Continental Airlines gaining 6 per cent to $24.50.In spite of data showing a slowdown in new housing starts for July, homebuilders rallied. The stocks were boosted by a fall in 10-year bond yields to four-month lows. Pulte gained 5 per cent to $29.75, while Toll Brothers added 3.9 per cent to $25.49.
416;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-07-30T18:40:48Z;Forecasts cool US earnings joy;;US companies have celebrated better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, keeping alive a streak of double-figure profits growth that has lasted for three years.However, there is growing sentiment that the growth in corporate profits, like the economy, is ready to slow.So far, nearly two-thirds of the S&P 500 companies have announced second quarter earnings. Of these 69 per cent beat expectations, up from the 60 per cent norm.However, many companies announcing second quarter earnings warned investors they were lowering forecasts for the rest of the year.Friday’s release of the government’s estimate that the economy grew only 2.5 per cent in the second quarter – far below market expectations – intensified sentiment that corporate America was heading for a slowdown.“On the one hand, earnings have generally come in better than expected, with 83 per cent of companies meeting or beating numbers,” said Henry McVey, chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. “On the other hand, forward guidance has been punk, with the ratio of positive to negative pre-announcements at 0.34 versus 0.59 a year ago and 0.54 last quarter.”Companies announcing disappointing results, or bearish forecasts, suffered aggressive sell-offs. Principal victims have included Yahoo, the search engine, which is down 30 per cent for the year, health insurer Aetna, down 32 per cent this year, postal service UPS, whose share price suffered its worst ever daily fall when it announced earnings last week, and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, down 55 per cent since January.Investors’ downbeat mood became even more apparent at the end of last week when ExxonMobil reported the second-highest quarterly profit in US corporate history and still saw its shares end the day lower.According to UBS research of recent results, 45 per cent of companies that surprised Wall Street analysts with better-than-expected earnings saw their share price fall.“Investors thought those stocks’ good second quarter fundamentals were ‘old news’ and that the next shift in fundamentals would be down,” wrote UBS strategist Larry Hatheway.For the current quarter, downward revisions to earnings estimates are sharpest among technology and consumer discretionary stocks.Among the latter, the downward revision for third quarter earnings growth estimates has also been sharp, tumbling from 20 per cent two weeks ago to 15 per cent.
417;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-07-28T20:43:31Z;Wall Street jumps on positive earnings;;Wall Street jumped sharply on Friday as investors took heart from another week of mostly strong earnings and hopes that the US Federal Reserve might be closer to calling a halt to the current cycle of interest rate rises.The big stock market indices had their best week in six months.General Motors gained in spite of reporting a $3.2bn quarterly loss due to charges from the carmaker’s employee buy-out programme. Excluding the charges, GM’s operating profit was $1.2bn, better than analysts had expected, pushing shares up 11.6 per cent over the week to a 10-month high of $32.35.Ford was pulled up 9.7 per cent to $6.89 on the news. The S&P car manufacturing index is now at its highest level since November.It was a good week for pharmaceuticals. Merck rose 10.1 per cent to $41.12 after it raised its outlook for 2006 and reported that profit nearly doubled in the second quarter. Generic drug maker Mylan Laboratories added 15.2 per cent to $22.00 as quarterly earnings rose 76 per cent. Pfizer gained 9.6 per cent to $26.11. Pfizer and Merck have been the best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in July.AT&T reported an 81 per cent rise in second quarter earnings boosted by its Cingular Wireless unit. Its shares rose 9.9 per cent for the week to $30.06.Corning lost 12.6 per cent to $19.13 after it warned that sales in the third quarter would fall short of analysts’ expectations due to a build-up in stocks of its liquid crystal display glass, used in computer monitors and television screens. The news overshadowed a tripling of profit in the second quarter.Oil services companies posted strong advances, buoyed by robust earnings from continued high oil prices. Nabors Industries added 15.7 per cent to $34.00, after announcing a 77 per cent increase in quarterly profit, while BJ Services increased quarterly profit by 86 per cent, pushing shares up 15.8 per cent to $34.80.ExxonMobil added 4.8 per cent to $67.00 after it reported more than $10bn in quarterly profit, a quarterly gain of 36 per cent.At the close on Friday, the S&P500 was up 3.1 per cent for the week, at 1,278.55, its best week since January. It was 1.2 per cent, or 15.35 points, higher for the day.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.9 per cent, or 39.67 points on the day, and was 3.7 per cent higher for the week at 2,094.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent or 113.88 points higher on the day at 11,219.70, a weekly gain of 3.2 per cent - its best week since May 2005.“Second quarter earnings results have come in better than expected, although forward guidance for the third quarter of 2006 has been disappointing at best,” said Henry McVey, chief US investment strategist at Morgan Stanley in a note to investors.“We are definitely seeing higher ratios of negative to positive [third quarter forecasts],” said John Butters, senior research analyst at Thomson Financial, who says the proportion of negative forecasts is now at its highest level in two years.According to Thomson, the blended year-on-year growth rate for second quarter earnings now stands at 14.8 per cent, up from 13.6 per cent last week. With only about a third of the S&P 500 still to report, earnings are on track for a twelfth consecutive quarter of double digit gains.Online retailer Amazon fell precipitously after it reported a 58 per cent drop in quarterly earnings. The stock fell 18.1 per cent to $27.17 on the news, its lowest level in more than three years. It is down 42 per cent since the start of the year.It was not all bad news for the technology sector. Sandisk, maker of flash memory chips for mobile phones and digital cameras, beat analyst forecasts with a 36 per cent increase in quarterly profit, pushing shares up 25.7 per cent to $47.14.Graphics chip maker Nvidia added 27.6 per cent to $22.67 on news that its main competitor ATI Technologies would be bought by Advanced Micro Devices.Health insurer Aetna slashed its forecast for membership growth for 2006 as it reported a 1 per cent drop in quarterly earnings. Investors were also nervous about rising medical costs. This triggered a sell-off that pushed the stock down 17.5 per cent to $32.17.United Parcel Service lost 11.1 per cent to $70.01 after its quarterly profits fell shy of analyst estimates and the company warned that full-year earnings would be at the low-end of forecasts.
418;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
419;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-07-27T19:31:47Z;Dow Chemical;;Earnings forecasts are always more of an art than a science, especially when the economy is at an inflection point. Companies, however, can expect little leniency when they miss expectations. Dow Chemical became the latest victim on Thursday, with its shares sliding by 10 per cent.As the largest US chemicals maker, Dow’s profits have been squeezed by rising energy and raw material costs. While its share price has been heading south since early 2005, it is hard to quibble with market assessments that conditions for the sector are likely to get worse before they get any better. Dow itself doubts it can improve on last year’s bumper profits.Along with the stumble of United Parcel Services earlier in the week, that is a reminder that the sectors most directly affected by higher oil prices are already feeling the squeeze. Signs of trouble in chemicals and transport are always disconcerting in terms of the implications for the broader economy.But a closer look at Dow and other bellwether stocks suggests some potentially even more worrying trends. Notably, the 7 per cent increase in Dow’s US revenues was exclusively due to price hikes, while volumes remained flat. By contrast, volume growth in other parts of the world was fairly healthy, while price rises were more subdued.Others, notably Dow’s rival Du Pont and diversified manufacturer 3M, have already reported similar movements, with volumes weaker and prices rising more swiftly in the US than much of the rest of the world. Taken at face value, that suggests US companies providing key inputs still have a bit of pricing power at home, even in the face of weaker demand. It is hard to think of a worse combination for monetary policy makers – or investors still expecting market-wide earnings momentum to remain strong over the medium term.
420;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;UPS battered by retail weakness;;Shares in UPS plunged nearly 16 per cent in early trading on Tuesday after the package delivery group reported disappointing second-quarter earnings and warned of a worsening economic outlook for the remainder of the year.UPS and other express delivery groups are viewed as important economic bellwethers because of their increasingly central role in global supply chains.Scott Davis, chief financial officer, said the group did not expect a severe downturn but it was becoming clear that a slowdown was under way.“Every indication says there are some challenges and headwinds out there, but we’re not saying the sky is falling in,” he told investors. “We’re saying that growth is going to moderate from the levels we’ve seen.”Mr Davis said shipments by manufacturers remained strong but some of the group’s retail customers were showing signs of weakness.Express delivery groups such as UPS and FedEx have enjoyed several years of rapid expansion on the back of soaring global trade and increasing demand for just-in-time services.But Tuesday’s results and guidance from UPS triggered a sell-off throughout the US freight transportation sector in expectation of slower growth.BNSF, the second-largest US rail operator, saw its stock fall nearly 5 per cent despite reporting a forecast-beating 28 per cent increase in second-quarter net profits.All the other big US rail companies, such as Union Pacific and CSX, have also reported strong results over the past week, but investors have preferred to focus on the uncertain outlook.UPS’s net earnings were up 7 per cent at $1.06bn, or 97 cents a share, but missed Wall Street’s consensus forecast of $1 a share, in part because of surging fuel prices.Jet fuel prices increased by 14 per cent and diesel fuel by 11 per cent during the quarter, causing $21m in unexpected costs, according to Mr Davis.Like most freight carriers, UPS recovers some of its fuel costs through a customer surcharge, but there is a 41-day lag before increased prices are factored into the rate.Mr Davis warned that full-year earnings growth would be at the lower end of the group’s 11-16 per cent target, but stressed that demand for express delivery services remained solid.Mr Davis indicated that he did not expect a prolonged economic slowdown and forecast that UPS would return to stronger growth next year.Shares in UPS closed 10.25 per cent lower on Tuesday at $71.80 - up from an intraday low of $67.25.
421;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-07-25T21:20:46Z;Market Overview: Concerns over US economy and Middle East send equities lower;;Global equity markets wobbled on Tuesday, underlining the weak state of investor confidence, before Wall Street enjoyed an afternoon bounce.While all the main US indices were down for the day at one point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied to close up 0.6 per cent, as did the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.After a strong rally on Monday, US share prices initially fell again as geopolitical concerns flared up and worries over the US economy rose.European markets had a patchy day, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index edged up 0.09 per cent to 1,315.53.Asian shares rallied with the Nikkei 225 Average gaining 1.4 per cent in Tokyo and the BSE 30 index jumping 2 per cent in Mumbai.Oil prices initially pushed further above $75 a barrel as investors appeared to take a more pessimistic view of the outcome of the conflict in Lebanon and Israel. These worries were reinforced by a stark warning from Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah that if peace moves failed, the Middle East could be engulfed in a “conflict that would spare no one”.But the volatile oil market shifted sharply as rumours swept dealing rooms that some form of prisoner release was imminent from Hizbollah forces in Lebanon. In New York, WTI crude settled down $1.25 at $73.40.It was the move in the oil price that appeared to fuel Wall Street’s afternoon resurgence. Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “The moment [the market] changed was when crude closed on a low of the day. When it closed, the market started to improve. For the most part, the big picture is that the news is not as bad as the market has priced in.”However, he cautioned that the move was in part technical, with buyers bringing the main indices back close to their long-term moving averages, and that the afternoon rally had concentrated in relatively defensive sectors, rather than in companies strongly exposed to the overall economy.“Badly beaten stocks like housing and tech got a bounce, but consumer defensive stocks also did well. Drugs and consumer staples are at new record highs here. Yes the market is rallying, but if you look at what they are buying, they are buying defensive.” Mr Pado said that the rally did not show “total conviction” from investors.Wall Street’s bad morning was driven by downbeat statements on the economic outlook from manufacturer 3M and United Parcel Service.Both companies – considered barometers of the US economy – missed estimates for their second-quarter earnings.Scott Davis, UPS chief financial officer, said there were a “lot of signs the economy is moderating”. He added that “unexpectedly high fuel costs” had hit profits.George Buckley, 3M chief executive, said that uncertainty was creeping into the US economy.However, Altria, Kraft, DuPont, McDonald’s and AT&T posted positive or better-than-expected second-quarter results. The afternoon rally was led by healthcare companies.They were also lifted by the release of stronger-than-forecast consumer confidence data. The New York-based Conference Board said that its confidence index rose to 106.5 from a revised 105.4 in June. Analysts had expected the index to fall slightly to 104. However, this was offset by news that sales of existing US homes fell 1.3 per cent in June from May.“The big problem for the market is the lack of confidence in the economic outlook,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. “The market doesn’t know whether we are going to get a hard landing or a soft landing to the economy.”Mr Goldman said US equities were not in a bull or bear market but were in a “turtle” mode – not moving very fast and mired in the mud of uncertainties.Mike Buchanan, global economist at Goldman Sachs, also warned that growth expectations embedded in US equity markets remained too high.US Treasuries weakened across the curve, as the markets continued to take on board that last week’s burst of optimism about the prospects for an imminent end to interest rate tightening from the federal reserve had been overdone. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose by 2 basis points, while the 2-year rose by 3bps.Federal Funds futures lost a little more ground, to signal a probability of slightly more than 50 per cent that the Fed will raise rates again next month.The shifting expectations on the Fed also helped the dollar to rally.

423;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-07-25T18:29:04Z;UPS;;During the internet bubble, logistics stocks were seen as one of the old economy’s bigger winners. Somebody, after all, would have to deliver all those goods ordered online. Compared with most dotcom growth stories, that thesis has shown remarkable staying power until now. Take United Parcel Services, whose shares fell by nearly 16 per cent in early trading on Tuesday, the largest slump since it floated in 1999.On the face of it, this appears a little harsh. UPS missed second-quarter earnings estimates by about $30m and now expects profits in the third quarter to be about $90m lower than analysts had hoped. Meanwhile, its market capitalisation has shrunk by almost $13bn.The trouble is that the US package delivery company is still valued at about 1.75 times last year’s sales and almost 18 times 2006 earnings, based on its latest guidance. In absolute terms, that looks punchy given the risk that even online shoppers might turn stingy during a downturn. While demand for its domestic business has held up well, UPS is right so see macroeconomic hazards ahead. Meanwhile, cost pressures, mainly from fuel, are strong. UPS seems to be anticipating another hit to its margins, which raises questions over their longer-term sustainability.The picture is much clearer though, when comparing UPS with some of its peers in other parts of the world. Deutsche Post, for example, costs just 10.5 times 2006 earnings. While the German postal service faces plenty of risks, its DHL unit is also a competitor to the international package operations of UPS, where profitability has already come under pressure. Hopes for continued strong growth at UPS must, moreover, largely rest on the expectation that the rest of the world will swiftly follow the path of US e-shopaholics. However, even if it does, UPS hardly looks like the smartest way to bet on that happening.
424;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-07-18T21:03:19Z;Giants of the road in drive to be green;;The eighteen-wheeler truck, with a 500hp tractor pulling a 53ft long trailer, is the workhorse of the US economy – and the bane of environmentalists.Every day thousands barrel across the US interstate highway system, consuming diesel fuel at the rate of around 6 miles per gallon – compared to around 55mpg of petrol for an, admittedly, far smaller Toyota Prius, the best selling electric hybrid car.In 2003, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, heavy duty trucks accounted for around 15 per cent of of total US greenhouse gas emissions.But now Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is working on making its fleet of over 7,000 trucks just a little more like a four door Prius, supporting the development of the first-ever hybrid system for America’s largest trucks.Brian Wynne, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, sees Wal-Mart’s interest as part of a “second wave” of the development of the hybrid power systems that capture and store energy generated by braking, using it to augment engine power.“The commercial applications are following after the technology has being proven in the consumer sector. Now we’ve got commercial fleet operators looking at it, and saying what’s in it for me,” he says.In the past two years, FedEx and UPS, the delivery services, have both developed limited production hybrid electric medium sized trucks to handle urban delivery routes, where the constant starting and stopping is particularly suited to hybrid technology.Prototype hybrid heavy duty garbage and utility trucks have also been produced, demonstrating, says Mr Wynne, that it is easier to make a business case for commercial trucks than it is for passenger cars – with long vehicle usage, and the ability to use stored power for specific work-related purposes. Traditionally the industry has not regarded long-haul heavy duty trucks – built for cruising efficiently at fixed speeds – as potential candidates for hybrid technologies, given their reliance on braking.But Kevin Beaty of Eaton Hybrid Power Systems, which developed hybrid applications for both FedEx and UPS, says his company has concluded from looking at actual driving conditions, that the consensus is wrong. “Just to drive across Iowa, for instance, on Interstate 80, creates lots of opportunity from braking on the downhills. And from just passenger cars entering the freeway, that causes a truck to brake, or to change lanes.”Eaton announced last month that it had developed a prototype hybrid-electric heavy duty tractor that reduced fuel consumption by 5-7 per cent, as well as saving a gallon an hour on supporting the cab while the trucks was parked.It also said it expected to be able to make a heavy duty system available “well before 2010”, estimating that it could save a truck operator $9,500 a year.Hybrid cars deliver far higher fuel efficiency rates of around 50 per cent. But a single heavy duty hybrid truck, driving 100,000 miles a year, would deliver far greater overall reduction in fuel use and emissions.Mr Beaty said the heavy duty system had evolved from work on medium-sized trucks, based in turn on technologies developed for FedEx, working in a project with Environmental Defense, the not-for-profit group that is also working with Wal-Mart.“They really put the pressure on Eaton to move quickly,” he says of FedEx. “And they pulled very hard on demand for product on a timeline …I would safely say they accelerated our work.”He also says FedEx was open about sharing information on its project – something Lee Scott says Wal-Mart will also do as part of its commitment to develop energy efficient technology.Mitch Jackson, head of FedEx’s environmental programmes, says making the technology open to others is aimed at increasing the environmental impact and reducing eventual costs through economies of scale.“We didn’t want to own the technology …we wanted clean vehicles that made economic sense,” he said.
425;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-06-23T20:33:35Z;Airbus plans for US dealt blow;;The troubled Airbus A380 programme was dealt a potential blow on Friday when an influential US congressmen said federal funds should not be used to upgrade US airports to accommodate the world’s largest passenger aircraft.John Mica, chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, claimed it could cost as much as much as $1bn to refit up to 18 airports to handle the 550-seat A380, which is due to enter service next year despite ongoing production delays.The congressman said any use of federal funds from the Airport Improvement Programme to allow A380 operations would be “patently unfair” in the wake of the controversy over European state subsidies for the aircraft’s development.However, aviation experts said such estimates were inflated, while A380-related improvements were also needed to handle new Boeing aircraft.Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and New York’s JFK are expected to be the first four US airports to handle A380s. The size of the aircraft will require the municipally-owned airports build stronger runways and air bridges, as well as enlarge some terminal facilities.Mr Mica commissioned a report on the costs from the Government Accountability Office, with the $1bn he cited relating to the 18 airports which may eventually handle the A380.“The costs have traditionally been overestimated,” said Dick Marchi, senior advisor for policy and regulatory affairs at ACI North America, a trade group. He said the GAO had assumed all of the airports would choose a more expensive path to modernise their runways, while most had so far not gone down this route.Mr Mica said he planned to introduce legislation that would bar federal funds from being used in A380-related projects, noting that no US passenger airlines have ordered the aircraft.“Until a US airline chooses to acquire and operate the passenger version of the A380, foreign airlines that operate A380 passenger service to and from the US should pay for any needed infrastructure improvements at the airports they serve,” he said in a statement.However, Mr Marchi said the runway-strengthening work would also be required for Boeing’s new 747-800 model, which holds less passengers than the A380 but has a similar wingspan.The federal airport programme gives around $3.6bn a year in grants, though much of this goes to smaller airports, and larger gateways have tended to use the bond markets for large-scale investments. Mr Marchi said federal funds accounted for around 15 per cent of capital spending at the large US hubs.While airport operators cast doubt on the practicality of Mr Mica’s plan, any efforts to thwart the A380 would impact US companies, despite the absence of any orders for the passenger model.FedEx and UPS have ordered the cargo version, and Los Angeles-based ILFC, a leasing group, has 10 orders. Moreover a large number of US companies are key suppliers of components for the A380.However, any delay to fitting out airports for the A380 comes at a sensitive time for Airbus. The programme has already run into production problemswhich will delay the first deliveries and could see Airbus – co-owned by Eads and BAE Systems – facing millions of dollars in compensation payments to customers. ILFC has threatened to cancel ordersif the production delays persist.Mr Mica’s intervention also comes amid the long-running spat between the US and European governments over launch-aid to commercial aircraft projects. The dispute is currently before the World Trade Organisation, and threatens to expand into an order for new tankers for the US Air Force on which Airbus and Boeing have rival offerings.

428;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-04-24T21:01:20Z;Couriers to fight India’s levy plans;;DHL, Federal Express and other global courier companies will take legal action against India’s postal authority if it pushes ahead with an amendment to a law that they fear could shut down some courier businesses.The executives of the courier companies were “shocked and surprised by the dramatic changes” proposed by the Department of Posts, “which we will fight all the way”, said a senior executive of the Express Industry Council of India (EICI) after a meeting in Mumbai.The postal department wants to amend India’s 108-year-old law to set up a regulator and impose a levy on courier company revenues to underwrite publicly-run services to remote areas.The amendment would also redefine what constitutes a letter in a long-heralded reform that would impose a state monopoly on the fastest growing segment of the courier industry.There is currently no statutory definition of what is a “letter”, other than something that constitutes “communication between two parties”, said a senior official in the industry. Under the proposal, documents weighing less than 300 grams would be designated as “letters” and would be deliverable only by the Department of Posts.India’s courier and express industry is valued at about Rs40bn ($890m) and is growing about 20 per cent a year.It has been the subject of a wave of new investment and consolidation in recent years.DHL, part of Deutsche Post, has invested $250m over the past decade, including making a major local acquisition, that of Blue Dart, while rivals TNT, UPS and Federal Express have also aggressively expanded.“The letter re-definition catches us,” said Chris Callen, country manager for DHL Worldwide Express. Documents, including letters, are the larger part of DHL’s Indian business, which is growing 25 per cent a year.He said the mood in the industry was one of “deep concern” though he welcomed the government’s invitation for discussions. The industry is “covering all bases”, he said referring to the legal option. The Department of Posts argued it was necessary to retain a segment of letter traffic “as its exclusive privilege”.A senior executive at the EICI said the 10 per cent levy on private courier companies’ total revenues seemed to be an unfair penalty to ensure the provision of a universal service that covered the countryside.People in the industry concede the need to reform the current law given the revolution in communications. But, as one person said, “we are angry that the government should come out with such one-sided rules after having let the industry mushroom for the past three decades”.
429;UPS;United Parcel Service;2006-02-15T04:10:47Z;Airlines raided in worldwide cargo cartel probe;;A worldwide cartel probe has seen European, US and South Korean antitrust officials jointly raiding the offices of British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and several other air cargo companies.Airline officials said the investigation focused on the way in which the industry imposes surcharges for items such as fuel and security, a process that some shippers said lacked transparency.The European Commission said its officials had ?carried out unannounced inspections at the premises of several air cargo carriers in several EU member states?. The Brussels-based regulator added that it had ?reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated? European rules that prohibit price-fixing agreements and other cartel abuses.The US Department of Justice said it was also investigating the industry. Some US freight operators such as American Airlines have received subpoenas and were co-operating with the authorities, though American ? which partners BA in the oneworld alliance ? said it was not the target of the investigation.?I can confirm that the antitrust division is investigating the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the air cargo industry. We are co-ordinating with the EU and other foreign competition authorities,? a spokeswoman for the department said.Japan Airlines, Asia?s leading carrier, confirmed on Wednesday that officials from both the EC and the DoJ had visited one of its cargo offices in Frankfurt, Germany, and a cargo branch office New York?s John F Kennedy airport.?We will full cooperate with any investigation,? said a JAL spokesman in Tokyo. The airline said that its operations in Japan were running as usual, and that no inquiries or visits had been made by Japan?s Fair Trade Commission, the local anti-monopoly watchdog.JAL is ranked twelve in the international cargo industry, in terms of tonnes carried, by the International Air Transport Association.All Nippon Airways, Japan?s second-biggest carrier, said that its cargo operations abroad had not been questioned by officials.Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline, said on Wednesday that EC and DoJ officials visited its Frankfurt, Los Angeles and San Francisco offices.?Cathay Pacific Airways is in cooperation with the European Commission and United States Department of Justine in respect of their investigation into air cargo operations?, it said in a statement.In South Korea, the local antitrust commission raided the offices of the country?s two airlines as part of the worldwide investigation. Korean Air and its smaller rival Asiana Airlines said officials from the Korean Fair Trade Commission made an unscheduled visit to their cargo offices in Seoul on Tuesday to inquire over freight shipment charges. But they said their overseas offices had not been investigated by either European or US officials.An Asiana spokesman said the KFTC officials carried out inspections into fuel surcharges on cargo shipments. A KFTC spokesman declined to comment on the details of the investigation but said that the targeted airlines could face corrective measures or financial penalties of up to 10 per cent of sales if they were found guilty of operating a price-fixing or market-sharing cartel.The EC does not reveal the names of the companies it has raided, but several groups said they were under investigation or had received ?requests for information?.BA said that it had received information requests both from the EC and the DoJ. It is understood that antitrust officials raided the British carrier?s offices at Heathrow airport and in New York, while United said that its cargo office in Frankfurt was targeted by European officials.Lufthansa, United?s partner in the Star airline alliance, issued a statement saying that cartel authorities were investigating the air cargo sector and that the group would ?fully support? the inquiries. It did not say explicitly whether Lufthansa offices had been raided.SAS, the Scandinavian carrier and another member of Star, also confirmed it was part of the investigation as did Cargolux, the Luxembourg-based group, and Air-France-KLM, though its US partners ? Delta and Northwest ? have not been notified.FedEx and UPS, the world?s largest air cargo operators by revenue, said they had not been contacted in the probe, and Deutsche Post said its carrier, DHL, was not targeted.The rise in fuel prices over the past 18 months has pushed up passenger and freight charges across the airline industry, leading operators to impose surcharges on customers.Lobby groups such as the European Shippers? Council have expressed concern about the methodology used in calculating extra fees, noting that in some cases last year the surcharge exceeded the transport cost.Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, has said repeatedly that she wants to make the fight against cartels a ?priority? of her five-year tenure. At present, cartel probes normally last several years before the Commission imposes a fine. The regulator stressed on Tuesdat that the ?fact that the European Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anticompetitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation?.
430;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T06:57:47+0000;FedEx ups guidance after strong quarter;;Solid economic growth in the US and Asia helped FedEx increase second quarter earnings by 33 per cent and lift its full-year earnings guidance.Fred Smith, chief executive of the US package delivery group, said he expected the positive economic trends to continue in 2006.Increased margins also contributed to the strong results, aided by greater operating efficiency and rapid growth in highly-profitable international shipments.Surging international trade has been driving expansion in express delivery companies, such as FedEx and UPS, for the past few years as corporate supply chains become more global.FedEx said its international package volume increased by 8 per cent in the quarter, compared to an average increase of 3 per cent across all shipments.Growth in FedEx’s domestic ground delivery business was weaker than expected but gathered momentum towards the end of the quarter as it entered the crucial Christmas season.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said the ground business had continued to accelerate in the third quarter.Jon Langenfeld, analyst at RW Baird, said FedEx’s margin improvements were impressive but volume trends were mixed.The weakest performance came from FedEx Kinko’s, the group’s retail division, which saw operating profits decline and revenues stagnate amid falling prices for its photocopying services.Group net profits increased to $471m, or $1.53 a share, up from $354m, or $1.15 a share, in the same period last year. Revenue grew by 10 per cent to $8.09bn.
431;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;Oracle revamps its software pricing;;Oracle has switched to a new method of charging for its software, responding to growing criticism from customers that the sector has been slow to adapt to technologies that are changing the face of corporate computing.The US software maker has announced a new price list for customers that run its database software on computers using multi-core processors – chips that combine a number of separate processing units, or “brains”. All the big chipmakers either produce or are planning to make such chips, reflecting a shift away from the race for ever-faster computer processors towards more flexible machines that combine multiple processors to handle a number of tasks simultaneously.“The pace of change in [software] pricing models is accelerating,” said Dave Edwards, chief information officer of UPS, the US logistics group. “A lot of software companies are still trying to figure out how to do multi-core processors . . . and still get the same level of profitability they had before.”Oracle has drawn criticism in recent months for continuing to base its software pricing on the number of processing cores used by a computer. That has pushed up software costs for companies that buy the newer machines.“Technology is going to shift – the megahertz war is over with,” said Mr Edwards. “It’s shifting towards other technology and part of it is cores on chip – and it’s not just two, it’s multiple cores. If software companies do not change their pricing structures, the software cost rises faster than the hardware [cost and] defeats the concept.”Oracle said that, under its new plan, it would continue to charge by the core – but that it would give discounts for computers using multi-core processors. Sun Microsystems’ new eight-core chip, for instance, will attract a discount of 75 per cent, meaning that customers will need to buy only two Oracle software licences for each processor.Sun welcomed the new Oracle pricing approach, which it predicted would also be adopted by other companies. “They tend to set the trend” for other software companies, said Larry Singer, Sun senior vice-president.Software companies are also struggling with how to set the balance between fees for new licences – their traditional source of revenue – and maintenance and support, which have grown to represent the majority of income at most companies.
432;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-12-13T20:58:52Z;Pilots in demand at US airlines;;The major US airlines are expected to recruit about 2,500 new pilots next year, with the demand pushing up wage levels in spite of recent personnel and salary cuts at bankrupt carriers.The US commercial sector is expected to take on 10,000-11,000 new flight crew in 2006, a return to the levels seen prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, driven by the expansion of low-fare carriers and rapid growth in segments such as regional airlines and business jets.Airline labour experts said the recent focus on pilot cuts at Delta and Northwest, which on Wednesday enter their fourth month in bankruptcy protection, masks the buoyancy of the sector.“There are really two sides to the market,” said Kit Darby, president of AIR Inc, an Atlanta-based pilot recruitment specialist who estimates that half of the 16 majors, defined as companies with annual revenues of $1bn or more, are hiring.Southwest, the biggest of the low-fare operators, plans to add 460 new pilots next year, and rivals such as JetBlue and AirTran are expanding rapidly, while start-ups such as Virgin America will add to demand.However, the buoyancy of the pilot market has not improved the bargaining power of employees at the bankrupt carriers. Pilot leaders at Delta agreed at the weekend to a temporary 15 per cent wage cut while they attempt to thrash out a new contract, with management seeking steeper reductions in a bid to restore profitability by 2007.Pilots are due to vote on the proposal by the end of the year. Meanwhile, flight crew at Northwest elected by a margin of two-to-one to take a temporary cut in the face of a management threat to impose a new deal.Mr Darby said the pilots’ resolve was diluted by the recognition that their current jobs were not very portable because of different pay scales and seniority levels at more solvent rival carriers. “There really is no comparison out there to what they currently have,” he said, referring to the reluctance of pilots to return to what some refer to as the “boot camp” of retraining at another carrier.The major airlines have more than 8,000 pilots on furlough, some 12 per cent of the total roster, with more expected to join the ranks from Northwest and Delta as they shrink during restructuring.However, profitable operators such as FedEx, UPS and Southwest are lifting wage levels, and there is intensifying competition from the “fractional” operators of business aircraft, which have recently agreed to wage increases of 40-60 per cent and are expected to recruit 800-1,000 pilots next year.The tightness of the market has amplified the calls for the mandatory retirement age to be raised from 60, particularly as the bubble of military-trained flight crew who served in Vietnam is now reaching maturity.
433;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;The German experience: Long road to a successful ending;;Few embodied the conflicting goals of German privatisation – securing revenues for the state while fostering competition among companies – more than Manfred Overhaus, a civil service mandarin, who oversaw the budgets of governments on both right and left from 1993 until last year.Faced with shrinking government finances, he was instrumental in privatising Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Post in the 1990s – a project ostensibly dedicated to European Union principles of free markets and competition.The greying, slender Mr Overhaus was in an effusive mood before Christmas 2001. The initial public offering of 28.7 per cent of the government’s stake in Deutsche Post had just netted €8bn for a budget creaking under the strain of financing generous welfare.Yes, he admitted, the successful flotation was due partly to Berlin’s willingness to protect until 2007 Deutsche Post’s highly profitable monopoly over delivery of standard letters. And yes, competitors were not pleased, he said with a frown that turned into smile.But the move would not block the liberalisation of postal services, he soothed. It would merely ensure Deutsche Post could compete with “global players” such as UPS or FedEx.Mr Overhaus’ justification speaks volumes about the priorities of the governments of Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schröder. Selling assets was more financing tool than ideology: free markets were good, but only once the ex-monopoly could compete with rivals.This was more fear of destroying the status quo than an expression of French-style economic nationalism. For one thing, the ministry of postal services employed 600,000 in the 1990s and their unions had immense clout.Talks about transferring job guarantees, pension rights and working conditions from a bureaucracy to the new entities started in 1990, when Klaus Zumwinkel became head of the postal service with the mandate to forge “a modern, service-orientated company”.With the communications revolution gaining speed, Telekom was to float first. But because Mr Kohl, contentiously, wanted to give the company the entire fixed-line network he needed the support of the opposition Socials Democrats. Their doubts delayed the process for four years.In 1995, Mr Zumwinkel became chief executive of Deutsche Post, a position he still holds. Ron Sommer, lured from Sony, was to prepare Deutsche Telekom for flotation.Equally important for the float were the problems of the government. Rising unemployment after unification was straining state coffers. At the same time, Mr Kohl was demanding strict EU-wide fiscal rules as a prelude to introduction of the euro.Banking on the DT flotation, Theo Waigel, finance minister, earmarked privatisation proceeds of €6.5bn for his 1996 budget. In the 14 years before, the government had collected no more than €9bn via asset sales. The flotation was a success. Investors ordered 3.6bn shares when only 690m were on offer. A share-owning culture had finally gained a foothold.It was to take four years and a change of government to bring Deutsche Post to market. Much as the Kohl government had given DT the fixed line network as a solid revenue source so it wanted to give the post the monopoly for delivering normal letters.Karel van Miert, then EU competition commissioner, objected that the post had used this moneyspinner to subsidise its loss making parcel service. A drawn-out conflict ensued, which resulted in the member states agreeing to end monopolies for letter delivery the year after next.Today, the federal government owns only a minority stake in both companies. They have had their ups and downs. DT, in particular, was hit when the dotcom bubble burst. Mr Sommer left in summer 2002.But both have grown to a size that makes them predators rather than targets. DT set Germany’s takeover record with its $26bn purchase of Voicestream, the US mobile operator, in 2001. Deutsche Post bought DHL and Airborne, the US freight forwarders, and Excel, the UK logistics company.Both employ as many as they did 15 years ago – 240,000 at DT and 380,000 at the post. These numbers mask more than 200,000 voluntary redundancies in Germany, which have in turn lowered prices for telephony and postage.
434;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-12-06T19:45:23Z;Lex: TNT;;"Putting a match to TNT has yielded an explosion of sorts. In reality, investor Cornelius Geber’s takeover ambitions, signalled last month, always faced a big obstacle in the shape of the Dutch government’s stake in the mail and logistics group.That said, TNT’s management is clearly under pressure. The costs arising from potential tax irregularities are still unknown. CVC’s purchase of a stake in Post Danmark in June showed that private equity is serious about the sector.TNT’s management has now responded in the time-honoured way: admitting guilt, promising improvement and offering a bribe. It will jettison the bulk of the underperforming logistics business. European Mail Networks revenues are now forecast to grow at 10-15 per cent a year, as against the previous target of “high single digits”. TNT will buy back €1bn worth of shares.All of this is welcome, but is it enough? Both EMN and the Express courier business are growing nicely. Overall, without logistics, TNT presents a more attractive profile to any buyer ready to wrestle with the political risk of the mature but highly cash generative Dutch mail business. US competitors Federal Express and UPS both want to build scale in Europe. Deutsche Bank reckons a full break-up of TNT could yield €25.90 a share – still a premium to the current price, despite it having shot up by a fifth since Mr Geber made his interest known. Investors can look forward to a leaner group, and the potential for more fireworks down the road.- Click here to add your comments

435;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-12-06T18:12:09Z;Ericsson helps Europe hit fresh 3½ year high;;The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,267.62 on Tuesday, a fresh 3½-year high, as upbeat guidance from US chipmaker Altera inspired gains for its European peers.But it was Dutch mail and logistics group TNT that topped the list of Eurofirst 300 risers with a gain of 6.3 per cent to €24.99 after it announced plans for the sale of most of its underperforming logistics unit and a €1bn share buyback.The logistics disposal could raise €1.5bn but some analysts believe it is also partly designed as an appetiser to attract interest in TNT’s Express delivery business - potentially worth €5.5bn to €8.3bn - from numerous potential suitors including FedEx and UPS.Credit Agricole added 4.7 per cent to €27.02 after Deutsche Bank said it expected the French bank to unveil financial and strategic targets next week that would guide the market towards earnings per share of €3.5 for 2007, some 20 per cent above above current consensus forecasts. Deutsche said its sum of the parts valuation could rise to €32 from €30.5 per share by 2007.Ericsson rose 3.7 per cent to SKr27.80 after the Swedish telecoms equipment company won its biggest-ever managed services order, potentially worth SKr15bn to SKr20bn over seven-years.“We estimate Ericsson’s top line could be boosted by at least 2 per cent, with further upside provided by potential equipment sales,” said Richard Winslade of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.STMicroelectronics added 1.2 per cent at €15.74 after Europe’s number two chip maker agreed to work with Intel on a common mobile-phone memory chip in a move aimed at winning greater market share from Spansion, the main competitor.The rest of the chip sector also performed strongly after Altera’s improved guidance, with ASML 2.2 per cent stronger at €16.89 and Infineon up 1.8 per cent at €7.87.Alstom gained 3.6 per cent to €49.80 after the engineering company said it had won a €450m order for two gas turbine-fired power plants. The train company Connex ordered three Alstom locomotives on Monday with an option for 20 more.Deutsche Borse rose 1.3 per cent to €86.80 on reports that it does not plan to close its subsidiary Eurex US immediately but would look for partners instead, with the International Secutities Exchange seen as one potential partner.Bayer fell 0.7 per cent to €34.52 after the German chemicals and drugs company settled a number of US lawsuits relating to price fixing issues at its polymers business. A provision of €275m (tax deductable) will be required in the fourth quarter but Bayer warned it could incur additional costs, potentially of material importance.WestLB estimated the settlement could hit earnings by 11 per cent and downgraded Bayer from “ buy” to “neutral” as the shares are trading close to their €35.20 price target.Eniro rose 6.2 per cent to SKr93.50 after UBS raised its price target to SKr120 from SKr100 and reiterated its “buy” recommendation for the Swedish phone directory company. UBS said the recent acquisition of Findexa, its smaller Norwegian rival, was strategically sound and that the market had missed the significant enhancement in cash flows from operating synergies.LVMH rose 2.1 per cent to €75.50 after Citigroup initiated coverage on the luxury goods group with a “buy” recommendation and an €84 price target. Citigroup said currency pressures would ease and its positive view was supported by the huge appetite of Chinese consumers for luxury goods.Richemont rose 1.9 per cent to SFr53.10 after UBS said the the world’s second-biggest luxury goods group was benefiting from a major step-up in product innovation and that it would sustain industry-beating growth rates as the premium watch market remained buoyant. UBS reiterated its “buy” recommendation and raised its target price to SFr59Adecco fell 1.7 per cent to SFr59.25 on fears that a stock overhang could be created after news that the family of chief executive Klaus Jacobs was selling about SFr767m of bonds, convertible into equity if the share price rises by about 25 per cent from the current level.Finmeccanica rose 1.2 per cent to €16.17 after UBS upgraded the Italian aerospace company from “reduce” to “neutral” due to a better than expected earnings outlook.
436;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;UPS upbeat as profits rise 7%;;UPS increased its third quarter net profits by 7.1 per cent, led by expansion in the company's international package delivery business and robust growth in the US.Rapid expansion in the company's supply chain and freight services was another factor in the solid performance.“We have tremendous momentum right now in the US and around the world and we see it continuing,” said Mike Eskew, chairman and chief executive.Net profits were $953m, or 86 cents a share, compared to $890m, or 78 cents, in the same period last year.Revenues were up nearly 18 per cent at $10.55bn, from $8.95bn last year.The results were in line with analysts' expectations.Scott Davis, chief financial officer, said the company should meet its full-year target of 18-20 per cent earnings growth. He forecast an addition 11-16 per cent lift in earnings next year.“The global small package business should remain strong resulting in exceptional operating profit in both the domestic and international segments,” he said.Mr Davis also predicted continued growth in the supply chain and freight businesses, following the acquisitions of Overnite, a US trucking company, and Menlo, a global freight forwarder, over the past two years.UPS, in common with its German rival Deutsche Post, has been expanding beyond small package delivery into a broader range of freight and logistics services.“Our guidance for 2006, following an excellent performance in 2005, demonstrates our confidence in the soundness of our business strategy and our ability to execute,” said Mr Davis.Surging global trade, particularly exports from Asia, have been driving growth throughout the package delivery industry for the past several quarters.UPS's international package volume increased 11.2 per cent during the quarter, lifting international revenues by 14.5 per cent to $1.92bn.Export volume out of Asia rose 26 per cent, including 34 per cent growth from China.Domestic package revenue, which still accounts for more than two-thirds of total sales, was up 6.9 per cent at $7.03bn, as volume grew 4 per cent.Volume growth was strongest in next-day air deliveries - a category dominated by the company's main rival, FedEx.UPS has increased its focus on the domestic market this year, aggressively targeting small and medium-sized customers in particular, after a sluggish performance in the US last year.Revenues from supply chain and freight services more than doubled to $1.6bn.
437;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-10-19T21:09:21Z;FedEx dares to keep the status quo;;Go behind the scenes at some of Manhattan’s top restaurants and the revolutionary impact of FedEx can be found staring straight back at you – in the clear, glistening eyes of truly fresh fish.Thanks to the company’s global delivery network, gourmet chefs are increasingly bypassing the traditional fish market and sourcing their best fish directly from individual fishermen thousands of miles away.Turning business models upside down in this way is something the express parcel carrier does quietly all the time. When Apple sold one million new iPod nano music players in 17 days last month, the customised models bought online barely saw the inside of a warehouse but were fed directly from factories in China into the FedEx delivery system.The efficiencies made possible by such low-inventory supply chains even play a key role in the flexibility and resilience of the US economy – most recently lauded by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.But while FedEx continues to change the world of business, a curious stasis is apparent in its own business model. Fred Smith, the former US marine who largely invented the overnight airborne delivery industry by founding Federal Express in 1971, is sitting out the latest revolution sweeping the package delivery industry.The company’s biggest rivals – United Parcel Service, Deutsche Post and TNT – are expanding into an ever-wider range of logistics services but FedEx remains doggedly focused on its core small package and light road-freight businesses.While Michael Dell now sells printers and Bill Gates chairs a software company that produces games consoles, Mr Smith is a rare example of a successful entrepreneur choosing to stick to what he knows. “We have looked long and hard at whether we want to be a big player in the contract logistics sector,” he says. “We have chosen not to do so because it is a low margin business and it is not clear to us that there is the type of synergies there that our competitors hope to find.”Mr Smith has never previously been one to cling to the status quo. So it is tempting to wonder whether, after 34 years at the industry’s cutting edge, FedEx is becoming a more conservative company, and Mr Smith, at 61, is losing his eye for the new opportunity.Deutsche Post, which owns the DHL parcel delivery network, believes that in an era of complex global supply chains, there is an opportunity for it to provide a “one-stop shop” for all the logistics needs of its corporate customers. The group already has the capability, following a series of acquisitions, to deliver anything from the lightest package to the heaviest freight by land, sea or air anywhere in the world.The German group’s offering will be strengthened further if its £3.7bn ($6.5bn) agreed takeover of Exel, the British contract logistics group, is completed as planned. In addition to co-ordinating the movement of its customers’ goods around the world, Exel does everything from managing warehouses to sub-assembling parts for manufacturers.UPS, the largest US package delivery group, has been more cautious in its expansion. But its acquisition last year of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, a global air and sea freight company, suggests it broadly shares Deutsche Post’s vision.TNT, the Dutch post and package group, has also developed a powerful contract logistics and freight forwarding business.FedEx, in contrast, has limited itself to a small, home-grown supply chain services division and Mr Smith says there are no plans for a large acquisition in the sector. The group’s only serious exposure to heavier goods is through its domestic road freight division. But even that is limited to the so-called “less than truckload” segment, transporting relatively light loads over short distances.Mr Smith believes the small package and light freight markets are fundamentally different from – and more attractive than – the logistics and heavy freight businesses being pursued by Deutsche Post, UPS and TNT.The former, he says, are high-margin activities fo-cused on delivering small, high-value products, such as iPods or Louis Vuitton handbags, to their point of consumption. The latter, by contrast, is a lower-margin business, typically involving lower-value, larger-scale goods destined for earlier stages in the production process.While small package customers include many small and medium-sized businesses and consumers with weak pricing power, the heavier freight and contract logistics markets are dominated by large retailers and manufacturers with the leverage to squeeze margins. “We’ve seen no reason to get into that sector,” says Mr Smith.His scepticism about diversification is at odds, not only with FedEx’s rivals, but also with many investors. Jon Langelfeld, analyst at RW Baird, says an acquisition by FedEx in the freight forwarding sector “would be well received by investors”.Mr Smith has never been afraid to go against investor sentiment. But he insists he would not hesitate to change the strategy if the company started losing business because of its lack of logistics services. “If we start to hear people saying ‘we want a one-stop shop, we’re going to take away your small shipment business’, then we’ll have another look,” he says. “But, so far, we’ve seen very little leakage.”Mr Smith is equally cautious in his approach to international expansion. FedEx remains, at heart, a cargo airline. As such, it eagerly snaps up every additional take-off and landing slot it can secure in the plum parts of Asia and Europe. But the group is more hesitant about acquiring assets on the ground.While UPS recently joined DHL in offering a domestic parcel service in China, FedEx has stuck with imports and exports. In Europe, too, the group has shown little interest in competing domestically.Mr Smith says the reason for the caution is simple: the inter-continental express market, with its high margins and strong growth, remains a more attractive business than either China’s nascent domestic market or Europe’s fragmented and fiercely competitive road-based markets.Instead of sinking hundreds of millions of dollars into fleets of branded delivery trucks around the world, FedEx has in many places preferred to forge partnerships with local delivery companies. In the UK, for example, FedEx uses Business Post, a British courier company, to access parts of the country not covered by its own vehicles.“We would not be afraid to invest $5bn-$6bn [in an overseas acquisition],” says Mr Smith. “But we are not going to make any investments of that magnitude unless there were wonderful financial returns.”There are clearly risks to FedEx’s take-it-or-leave-it approach to geographical and sectoral expansion. If Deutsche Post’s one-stop logistics shop turns out to be a winning strategy, FedEx will have a lot of catching up to do. Likewise, opting out of European and Asian domestic markets leaves holes in its global network that DHL and UPS could exploit.Until then, Mr Smith’s simple strategy of using a hub-and-spokes air network to deliver packages with speed and reliability remains as effective today as it was when the first FedEx aircraft left a runway in Memphis 34 years ago.When you have a model that produces results, says Alan Graf, chief financial officer, it is best not to tinker. “What we haven’t done,” he says, “is just as important as what we have done.”HOW FRED SMITH TRANSFORMED A MARKET■ The idea: As a student at Yale University in the 1960s, Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, explained in an economics paper how a hub-and-spoke distribution network was 100 times more efficient than point-to-point networks. After a spell serving as a US marine in Vietnam, Mr Smith decided to apply his theory to the parcel delivery business.■ The company: Federal Express was founded by Mr Smith in 1971, with the launch of 14 small aircraft from Memphis. On its first night, the company delivered 186 packages to 25 US cities. Today, FedEx makes 6m shipments a day, using a fleet of 674 aircraft serving 375 airports in 220 countries.■ The strategy: While its biggest rival UPS dominates the US road-based delivery market, FedEx has focused on airborne express delivery. Its core business involves shuttling small, high-value products, such as electronics and luxury goods, between manufacturers, retailers and consumers at high speed with great reliability.
438;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-10-06T10:52:48Z;DHL to make HK largest hub outside US;;DHL, the German express group, is investing $110m to double the capacity of its cargo handling hub in Hong Kong six years ahead of schedule, as its business in mainland China grows.The move, announced on Thursday and due to be completed in 2007, will make Hong Kong DHL’s largest hub outside the US, with capacity to move 75,000 pieces an hour.Scott Price, DHL Express chief executive for Asia Pacific, called the expansion a “very significant, long-term commitment to Hong Kong.”DHL’s investment is the latest development in an increasingly fierce competition among the world’s largest express carriers in China. In July, FedEx announced plans to spend $150m to move its Asia Pacific hub from Subic Bay in the Philippines to Guangzhou, 174km north of Hong Kong in mainland China. United Parcel Service unveiled plans to build a hub in Shanghai the same month.DHL’s move also represents a victory for Hong Kong, which is keen to further develop its logistics sector.DHL and FedEx have chosen to locate their hubs in the south to be closer to the Pearl River Delta, the string of industrial cities that were first opened to foreign investors after economic reforms began in 1978. The region now produces about a third of China’s exports and is home to Wal-Mart’s global sourcing headquarters.Mr Price said the company saw 50-60 per cent revenue growth in China last year, compared with an average of 35-45 per cent in the previous several years.“We believe that China, even at an average will still look at 7-8 per cent GDP growth over the next decade. The outsourcing of manufacturing, in particular industries like high-tech, textiles, automotive … is going to be huge,” he said.Hong Kong is one of three global “SuperHubs”, processing goods from around Asia. The others are in Wilmington, Delaware, and Brussels, although this facility is moving to Leipzig, Germany. DHL also has five smaller hubs around Asia.The group, a unit of Deutsche Post, plans to increase the level of automation as it expands the hub from 18,200 square metres to 35,000 square metres so that it can move shipments more quickly.DHL opened the facility, which cost $100m to build, last year. It had originally planned to enlarge it in two phases in 2009 and 2013.The group, which is owned by Deutsche Post, has a joint venture with Air Hong Kong, a joint venture cargo airline with Cathay Pacific Airways.
439;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-10-05T22:53:01Z;FedEx to raise express shipping rates 5.5%;;FedEx on Wednesday announced a 5.5 per cent increase in its express shipping rates for next year to take account of record fuel prices and robust demand.The bigger-than-average increase reflects continued strength in the package delivery services as global trade expands.Analysts said United Parcel Service, the largest US parcel courier, is likely to follow with a similar rate hike in the next few weeks.The increase will ease fears among investors that mounting competition between FedEx, UPS and their German rival DHL could weaken pricing.For customers, however, the higher prices will add to upward pressure on supply chain costs, amid record fuel prices and transportation bottlenecks.FedEx stressed that the 5.5 per cent increase would be offset by a 2 per cent reduction in the company’s variable fuel surcharge, resulting in an overall average increase of 3.5 per cent.By sharply increasing standard rates and reducing the fuel surcharge, FedEx is effectively locking higher fuel prices into its standard rates. This signals that the company expects fuel prices to remain high for the foreseeable future.In an interview with the FT, Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive of FedEx, said he expected fuel prices to ease back from their recent peaks as supply recovered following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and new refining capacity gradually came online. But he said a sharp decline was unlikely.Mr Smith said global trade continued to grow stronglty despite high fuel prices and that customers were reducing spending on transportation only at the margins.Under the new pricing structure, FedEx has increased its base fuel price to $31 a barrel and will impose a surcharge on prices above that level.The new rates, which come into effect on January 2, 2006, affect US express air deliveries. The company has not yet announced any changes to its ground rates or international prices.
440;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-09-28T21:37:39Z;Dell transfers deliveries to US Postal Service;;"Dell is to shift some of its computer deliveries from private parcel shippers to the US Postal Service, underlining the growing competitive threat posed by the government-owned organisation to companies such as United Parcel Service and FedEx.The computer maker plans to drop off some newly-bought computers at US post offices for customer pick-up rather than delivering them directly to people's homes through private couriers. companies.Any loss of business from Dell would be a particular blow to UPS, which counts the company among its 20 largest customers.Analysts have been warning for months that the US Postal Service is becoming a more powerful force in the US parcel market.The additional competition comes at a time when UPS, the world's largest parcel shipper, is facing growing competition from FedEx and German-owned DHL in its domestic market.Dell said the change in shipping arrangements would initially affect only the company's most basic products, with the majority of shipments continuing to be made through UPS. However, a spokeswoman said Dell planned to eventually offer the choice of home delivery or post office pick-up to all customers.""For many working people, it is more convenient to pick up a parcel at the local post office than it is to wait at home for a delivery,"" she said.Under the new scheme, starting next month, Dell will use an independent logistics company, APX, to ship computers to about 5,000 of the country's 38,000 post offices. Analysts said the plan appeared to be , at least in part, a cost-saving measure by Dell.UPS said it was relaxed about Dell's decision. “We continue to have a great relationship with Dell and our business with them is continuing to grow,” said a spokeswoman.She said the postal service would struggle to match the deep relationship that UPS had developed with Dell and its other large customers. “We are plugged into their customer service operation,” said the spokeswoman. “We don't believe the postal service has the technology or service levels to do that.”James Valentine, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the postal service was often overlooked as a competitive threat to UPS, despite it having the second-largest share of the domestic ground parcel market. UPS commands more than 60 per cent of the $29bn market, followed by the postal service with 22 per cent and FedEx with 15 per cent.The postal service's parcel business had been declining for years but has entered a revival revived over recent months, with parcel volume up 13 per cent in 2004, compared to 1.1 per cent growth in UPS's comparable business.“The postal service has increased its management attention on its package operations over the past 2-3 years which has improved service,” wrote Mr Valentine, in a report.Competition from the postal service could be blunted next year, when it is expected to increase its parcel prices 5.4 per cent. But Mr Valentine said the rise was not much greater than UPS's typical annual rate hike.“The postal service is the low-price leader in many markets and so its improved service is putting pressure on UPS's pricing in those lanes in which it competes,” he said. , highlighting light-weight business-to-consumer shipments.UPS has become increasingly reliant on its fast-expanding international business to offset sluggish domestic sales. Meanwhile, it It has sought to revive US growth through a n aggressive push to win more business from small and medium-sized customers.The postal service generates $65bn in annual revenues, compared to UPS's $37bn and FedEx's $30bn but most of it comes from its monopoly mail service. About 10 per cent of sales come from the two areas in which it cometes with UPS and FedEx: priority mail and parcel deliveries."
441;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-09-21T22:10:15Z;FedEx raises forecasts as earnings rise;;FedEx, the package delivery and freight group, on Wednesday increased its full-year earnings forecast following a stronger-than-expected first fiscal quarter.The upbeat announcement erased much of the concern sparked among investors by more sluggish results in the fourth quarter of last year.Shares in the company rose nearly 8 per cent to $83.15 in response.Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive, said he remained optimistic about the US and world economy despite the impact of record fuel prices and Hurricane Katrina. FedEx and other logistics companies are considered economic bellwethers because of their central role in global trade.“We see continued improvement in the global economy. Trade is deepening and global trade is growing faster than [US] gross domestic product,” he said.First-quarter net profit increased by a modest 3 per cent to $339m, or $1.10 a share. However, those figures were depressed by a $79m one-off charge related to accounting changes.Excluding the charge, earnings per share would have been $1.25, better than the $1.17 consensus forecast among analysts polled by Thomson First Call.FedEx had missed Wall Street expectations in the fourth quarter. The improved results were driven by double-digit revenue growth in all three of the company’s main delivery businesses: express, ground and freight.Competition has been intensifying in the package delivery industry as UPS, the biggest operator, seeks to stem losses in its market share to FedEx, German-owned DHL and the United States Postal Service.But Mike Glenn, FedEx’s executive vice-president of market development, eased fears of a price war, saying that, although there were some cases of “aggressive” pricing, the market remained broadly firm.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the city of New Orleans and part of the US Gulf coast, had “no significant effect” on results.Total sales in the three months ended August 31 were $7.7bn, up 10 per cent.Full-year earnings guidance was lifted to $5.25-$5.50 a share, compared to the $5.28 consensus forecast by analysts.
442;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-09-19T20:25:18Z;Lex: Deutsche Post/Exel;;If Deutsche Post and Exel handle the logistics of their merger as deftly as the logistics that led to it, the deal will be a great success. The negotiations were wrapped up within three weeks and every conceivable detail has been leaked along the way to keep shareholders, customers and regulators on board.As expected, Deutsche Post is offering a handsome price.The £4.1bn (€6.1bn) enterprise value equates to a 48 per cent premium to Exel's undisturbed share price and a stiff 21 times estimated 2006 earnings. Including the €220m (£150m) of expected cost savings, the acquisition should exceed Deutsche Post's 7 per cent cost of capital in the second year – not bad for a “strategic” deal.The business rationale is indeed compelling. Global logistics volumes are growing by a healthy 7 per cent a year and the combined group will be the clear market leader in ocean and air freight, as well as supply chain management – the clever bit that Exel specialises in. Having paid up to secure a recommendation, Deutsche Post will retain Exel's management, which should reduce integration risk. That will also make it harder for the likes of UPS to launch a counterbid, though this is still possible.Finally, Deutsche Post claims tax losses to shield some Exel profits, helping its economics. Unless a rival bid emerges, Exel shareholders should be content to accept this offer, while Deutsche Post's investors must lie back and think of the strategic logic of logistics.
443;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-09-16T21:00:30Z;Deutsche Post moves on Exel;;Deutsche Post is set to announce an agreed takeover of Exel on Monday that values the UK logistics company at about £3.6bn ($6.5bn) and could create the world’s biggest logistics group.The German group was holding a supervisory board meeting on Friday to approve the deal, according to people close to the situation. Exel board members are due to convene on Sunday to agree to the terms of the deal.Deutsche Post is offering a mix of cash and shares that values Exel at around £12.40 a share – considered to be at the higher end of expectations. The shares component will be 25-30 per cent.The German group is also proposing cost synergies of €200m ($244m) a year.John Allan, chief executive of Exel, will be made head of the enhanced logistics division which will be run out of Bracknell in the UK. He has also been offered a place on the management board.The deal reflects the German group’s determination to expand internationally as the end of its monopoly in its domestic market looms in 2007.It would give Deutsche Post a leading position in supply-chain management, known as contract logistics, and would be its largest acquisition ahead of its takeover of parcel group DHL.Deutsche Post has been anxious to diversify away from its core postage and package businesses into a broader range of logistics services. It is already the world leader in air and sea freight.The agreement of the deal could flush out counter-bidders, with UPS of the US considered the most likely suitor.Analysts have suggested UPS’ rival Federal Express might also be interested once Deutsche Post reveals its offer.However, the price could alarm some investors such as DWS and Cominvest, two of the largest German fund managers, who have warned the group not to pay over £12. But the likelihood of a shareholder revolt is limited, not least because of the 45 per cent stake held by the government-run bank, KfW.“In the end investors will probably put up with this deal. We are not likely to see another Deutsche Börse, although things could change if there is a counter bid,” said a leading German shareholder.Andrew Beh, analyst at ING, said: “Through this deal Deutsche Post will go from being number one in air freight and sea freight to being a much larger freight operator that is also number one in contract logistics.“This is a radically consolidating industry and there is not much left of size to buy, particularly in contract logistics.
444;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
445;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-09-08T16:57:04Z;London eases as builders fall;;The future direction of Rentokil remained unclear as investors took a breather from the bout of acquisition talk in London on Thursday.The FTSE 100 slid 25.2 points, 0.6 per cent, at 5,340.7 while the FTSE 250 index lost 43.1 points, 0.6 per cent, at 7,807.2. Volume was a moderate 2.7bn shares, with more than one trader distracted by the cricket.The market was unmoved by the Bank of England’s decision, as expected, to leave interest rates unchanged at 4.5 per cent.Sir Gerry Robinson’s bid for Rentokil Initial took another twist as his investment vehicle announced its plans for the support services group. Moves included making Sir Gerry executive chairman and returning 35p per share to shareholders but stopped short of a takeover approach.Raphoe was responding to gossip that Sir Gerry was ready to walk away from making an approach, worried about the size of Rentokil’s pension fund deficit.In response, Rentokil said it would consider the offer and advised shareholders to take no action. The market remained undecided by the latest statements, with shares up just 0.6 per cent at 164p.Amvescap, the Anglo-American fund manager, was 2.7 per cent stronger at 377½p as takeover talk once more returned, with traders talking of an approach from a US predator. It received an approach from Canadian group CI Financial earlier in the summer but rebuffed the move.Clothing retailer Next lost 1.5 per cent to £14.62 on talk that next week’s interim results would be disappointing.Logistics group Exel rose 1.4 per cent to £12.06, nearing the price on talk that Germay’s Deutsche Post is rumoured to be interested in paying for the UK group. Dealers speculated that US group UPS may make a counter-bid. The American group has already appointed Goldman Sachs to assess a possible bid for Exel.Hanson, the building supplies group, fell 2.6 per cent to 592½p, after a weaker than expected series of numbers from its French peer Lafarge worried UK investors about its prospects in the same marketplace.Global infomation provider Reuters, subject in recent days to some wild speculation internet search engine Google may be looking to buy it, added 1.3 per cent to 378¼p as bullish comments from UBS backed the shares for more tangible reasons.Moving its rating to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’ and raising his price target to 475p from 450p, analyst Polo Tang said the market had overlooked the £150m of savings from its new Core Plus strategy. He pointed out that although the savings take time to show through, “management has a good track record in this year.”FKI, the engineering group, added 6.6 per cent to 113p after receiving a boost from analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston following a lunch with the chief executive.The broker said the meeting reinforced its view of a recovery in earnings per share in FKI’s Logistex, Lifting Hardware and and Energy Technology divisions.VT Group, the shipbuilder formerly known as Vosper Thorneycroft, gained 4.7 per cent to 360p as Numis Securities analyst Clive Forestier-Walker advised buying shares in a quiet period. He reminded clients of several possible announcements in the coming months, including a potential order from Oman and three Private Finance Initiative contracts.MFI Furniture, the home furnishings group, gave further evidence of a slowdown on UK consumer spending as it admitted core UK orders were 15 per cent lower than a year earlier owing to deteriorating trading conditions. The shares fell 4 per cent to 114½p.Reinsurer Benfield Group had a volatile day, dropping as low as 275¼p, before finishing down 0.6 per cent at 295p. Investors were initially concerned about falling volumes in a softening reinsurance market, and said the tough conditions would continue ‘for a while’.But sentiment gradually turned behind the stock, aided by comments from broker Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. Giving Benfield the benefit of the doubt, analyst William Hawkins raised his target price to 240p from 220p. But, he cautioned. “revenue growth performance, which is below the full-year target, is not reassuring.”Investors were also expecting Clipper Windpower, a wind turbine maker, to make a strong debut on Aim tomorrow. Shares are expected to start in the 180p-210p range, giving it a market capitalisation of around £200m. The company is understood to have raised £65m via Lehman Brothers.
446;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-09-02T19:51:36Z;Exel and Deutsche Post rush to make deal;;Top executives at Exel are set to meet their counterparts at Deutsche Post this weekend to try and hammer out the terms of a deal with the aim of launching a bid within the next two weeks.“Both sides are trying to get a deal done as fast as possible but nothing has yet been agreed,” one person close to the situation said.The push to accelerate talks between the UK logistics company, which has a market valuation of £3.44bn, and Europe’s biggest postal group came as investment bankers scrambled to try and interest counterbidders in a potential deal.Analysts considered UPS of the US to be the most likely candidate. UPS refused to rule itself out, saying: “We look for opportunities and evaluate options for UPS continually.” At the end of last year, UPS had $5bn (£2.7bn) of cash on its books. Its rival, FedEx, could also be interested once Deutsche Post reveals its offer.Some of Deutsche Post’s biggest shareholders have already expressed reservations about it overpaying for Exel, which has been the subject of takeover speculation since the beginning of the year. “The uncertainty is very high at the moment and we are highly sceptical of a deal at the current price,” a leading German shareholder said.Deutsche Post is cash-rich and low in debt but there are concerns as to how it would finance a deal. Fitch recently became the second credit rating agency, after Standard Poor’s, to place its rating on negative outlook. The German shareholder said it was worried that the group could raise the money by issuing new shares, for which Deutsche Post already has the authority, rather than making an all-cash bid.Deutsche Post also said it could convince its shareholders of the deal’s strategic rationale.Backed by a 44 per cent stake of KfW, the state-run bank, it expected little real opposition to materialise.A deal would make Deutsche Post the world’s leading logistics company. It would dominate the field of contract logistics, which enjoys much higher margins than its current focus on mail.Deutsche Post is being advised by Morgan Stanley. UBS and Merrill Lynch are advising Exel.
447;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Delivering from a position of strength;;During preliminary takeover talks with Deutsche Post, which started on Monday, Exel will have been negotiating from a strong vantage point.The group is the world’s largest stand-alone provider of supply chain management and freight forwarding services. It moves freight in 14 of the 15 largest economies and its customers include 75 per cent of the world’s 250 largest non-financial companies. For example, Exel runs warehouses for Marks Spencer, the retailer. It also ships car parts for DaimlerChrysler.“There was inevitably going to be somebody bigger than Exel wanting to consolidate them. Exel has a scale advantage and a critical mass,” says Alastair Gunn, analyst at Arbuthnot Securities.Last year the group’s annual turnover was £6.3bn ($11.5bn). It is the largest company of its kind, employing 110,000 people in more than 130 countries. In the UK it is a behemoth.One analyst says: “Exel is a monster, an attractive monster and a very well-run monster at that.”Deutsche Post has made a series of acquisitions in the freight management sector over the past few years as it seeks to diversify from its core postage and package businesses into a broader range of logistics services.Its DHL Danzas Air Ocean business is one of the top two in both sea and airborne freight. But in another part of contract logistics, DHL Solutions is in an uncharacteristic fifth place, behind Exel, the market leader.In that respect any deal has a simple logic of bulking up the German group in the weakest of its main areas by adding Exel’s expertise in the UK and the US in particular to its focus on continental Europe and Asia.“The two businesses fit. Exel is a high quality asset. But now the details need to be checked,” says Tim Albrecht, fund manager at DWS, a shareholder in Deutsche Post.In particular, he is sceptical the German group should pay more than 1,000p for Exel unless it wants to face shareholder discontent.Another analyst says: “If Deutsche Post really wants Exel they are going to have to offer a very good price. A minimum would be £12 and they may even have to stretch to £13 a share depending on who else comes into the frame.”Other companies rumoured to be interested in Exel include UPS, the US package delivery group, and TPG, the Dutch logistics group.The business of logistics is no longer a simple matter of moving containers from one place to another. As large customers, such as Tesco, increase their global reach, logistics groups are developing more sophisticated and integrated solutions.Exel’s model is different from other providers such as Deutsche Post and UPS. The group does not own aircraft or delivery trucks. Instead it uses third-party carriers to ship its customers freight.The thinking behind the model is that in the event of disruption Exel can adapt more easily by not being heavily invested in assets within any one country.Deutsche Post and UPS would argue that owning their own transport assets make them more reliable. Exel must compete for space on aircraft and trucks with other logistics providers and is exposed to capacity shortage and price fluctuations.Shares in Exel peaked in February when rumours circulated that Deutsche Post or UPS could be set to bid up to £1.6bn. Over the past 12 months the shares have risen 47 per cent.Analysts say growth is coming from the outsourcing of manufacturing to low- cost countries, which has increased demand for supply chain services.John Lawson, analyst at Investec, says: “Driving growth is the trend to outsource manufacturing. Exel’s markets in China are growing at about 20 per cent annually. Its strong Asia business is one of its attractions.”Exel’s underlying profits for the full year to December 2004 rose 15 per cent to £170.2m, compared to £148.4m last year, on higher sales of £6.3bn, compared to £5.1bn.One-third of the group’s revenues come from the Americas, 21 per cent from Europe, 16 per cent from Asia and the remainder from the UK and Ireland.But analysts yesterday raised concerns that Exel could lose some of its clients if taken over by Deutsche Post. Mr Lawson says: “It will be interesting to see what the customer reaction might be. There are change of ownership clauses in every contact. Some customers may not fancy having their supply chain managed by Deutsche Post.”The UK logistics market is fragmented and ripe for consolidation. Mr Gunn says: “The key question is what happens to the rest of the quoted UK logistics sector. Everyone else will have to scale up to compete with whoever wins Exel. That company will have a pricing advantage and will be able to price business more cheaply.”
448;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-09-01T16:33:45Z;Exel approach helps FTSE higher;;London markets made firm gains on Thursday as a bid for Exel reinvigorated investors.The FTSE 100 finished 31.6 points firmer, 0.6 per cent, at 5,328.5 while the FTSE 250 index jumped 49.3 points, 0.6 per cent, as it hit an all-time high of 7,798.5. Volume was 2.9bn shares.Weak US economic numbers knocked the benchmark index from its best levels, prompting some to worry that further market falls, often seen in September, were on the way.But others had a spring in their step as one of the City’s longest running rumours this year was finally confirmed. Exel, the logistics group, said it had received an approach from Deutsche Post, sending shares up 17.3 per cent to £11.78½p.But rather than ending speculation surrounding Exel’s future, the news only prompted further postulating.Alastair Gunn, an analyst at Arbuthnot Securities, advised shareholders to wait for a contested bid. He pointed out that Deutsche Post was driven by global ambitions and has a history of over-paying for businesses in Express and Logistics sector. He also said that “a bid would almost certainly require Deutsche Post to have a rights issue or offer cash/ shares to Exel investors.”At the same time, he saw the competition from US group UPS. “It could easily gazump any offer from Deutsche Post with a higher/ equivalent all cash offer.It is known to have looked at Exel in the past and recognises that its acquisition would give it the Global leading position it wants in one move,” he said.The move gave a lift to the rest of the transport sector, with Wincanton up 6.2 per cent to 288¼p and TDG gaining 3.1 per cent to 236p.With the Exel rumours finally coming true after eight months of speculation, investors began reassessing other takeover rumours, particularly ones with a German-UK slant. Consequently, chemicals group BOC, which has been linked with Linde, rose 3.5 per cent to £10.84.Utility Scottish Power, meanwhile, rose 2.1 per cent to 512p on talk that it was being stalked by German rival E.On, although others traders mentioned Scottish and Southern Energy as a target. Shares in the latter finished flat at 986p.Food and drink maker Cadbury Schweppes confirmed another longtime market rumour as it said it would sell its European drinks business.Andrew Wood, European consumer goods analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein said the price tag could be in the £1.4bn-£1.6bn range, the proceeds of which would be initially be used to pay down Cadbury’s debt.However, he saw few industry buyers. Coca-Cola was prohibited from buying the business in 1999 for anti-trust reasons and Mr Wood doubted the major European food companies of Nestle, Unilever, Danone would be interested. Mr Wood said that the only trade buyer was PepsiCo, although he admitted it would be a big strategic move.Private equity groups, notably Carlyle Group, have already been linked with a bid. Cadbury finished 2.6 per cent stronger at 561p.Leisure group Whitbread lost 1.7 per cent to 977½p as investors were more concerned about continued falling sales at its restaurants, which includes TGI Fridays and Pizza Hut, rather than news of another £400m to be returned to shareholders.“Whitbread’s restaurants continue to under perform. The share buy-back only buys time,” said Panmure Gordon analyst Stuart Price, cutting his rating to “hold” and reducing his price target by 100p to 950p.Lloyd’s insurers lost ground as the scale of the devastation in New Orleans from Hurricane Katrina began to hit home. Swiss Re forecast it would cost the insurance industry about $20bn, making it the most costly hurricane since Hurricane Andrew in 1992.Numis Securities warned the hurricane would take expected catastrophe losses at least close to budgeted amounts for the full year.Wellington Underwriting fell 4.5 per cent to 101¾p, Amlin lost 2.9 per cent to 177p, Catlin slipped 4.1 per cent to 439½p and Brit Insurance fell 2.8 per cent to 87½p.However, investors also moved in to stocks likely to benefit from the clean-up operation. Wolseley, the world’s largest distributor of plumbing supplies, gained 2.8 per cent to £11.59, while temporary power generator Aggreko rose 7.5 per cent to 225p and Ashtead added 7 per cent to 130½p.Matalan slipped 2.8 per cent to 196½p after Goldman Sachs said bid talk surrounding the discount retailer was overplayed and slashed its rating to ‘underperform’.
449;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-08-30T20:35:13Z;Stocks lower as Katrina damage is assessed;;Hurricane Katrina depressed Wall Street stocks on Tuesday with retailers and transportation companies suffering most as one of the worst hurricanes to hit the US continued to wreak havoc in the south of the country.The storm knocked the market both by helping to push oil prices to yet another record high and through catastrophic damage to infrastructure in the storm’s path, and therefore to the bottom lines of insurance companies.Nine and a half weeks after oil prices caused consternation by passing the $60 a barrel mark, crude soared past $70 to $70.85, sparking concerns that high energy costs could damage the US economy by slashing corporate profits and finally ending the spending spree of the country’s heavily indebted consumers. Nymex crude futures finished the day up $2.61 at $69.81.Retailers and restaurants dominated the top 10 fallers in the S&P 500 with Staples, the office supply chain, falling 2.9 per cent to $21.85 and Darden Restaurants fell 2.8 per cent to $30.61. Tiffany, the jewellers, fell 2.6 per cent to $33.31. Wal-Mart also fell 1 per cent to $45.19 after announcing that 123 stores had been shut down due to a power cut.Insurers and re-insurers suffered. Shares of American International Group fell 0.4 per cent $59.28 and Hartford Financial Services dropped almost 0.3 per cent to $73.15.The transport sector, another area of the US economy that will see profits squeezed by higher oil prices, was also well down. United Parcel Service was 1.1 per cent down at $70.42 and CSX, a rail freight company, slipped 1.7 per cent to $44.85.The oil price was bad news for long-suffering airlines with Delta Air Lines, the cash strapped carrier widely expected to be the next airline to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, down 5.5 per cent to $1.20. The Amex airline index dipped 3 per cent at 46.75.All of which left the indices lower by the close, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.5 per cent at 10,412.82 and the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent at 1,208.41. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent at 2,129.76.Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, said the bears need not despair, however, citing a “longer-term rally”.“That rally is a series of higher-lows. Even the weakest market average remains above its June low. If this decline bottoms out around these levels, it will appear to be just a normal pullback within the context of that ongoing rally.”The news that a measure of consumer confidence showed that Americans’ attitudes about the economy improved in August only gave the most brief of respites to indices. While the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence rose in August the US Commerce Department released a report showing a less than expected decline in factory orders in July.Oil producers continued to benefit from high prices with ConocoPhillips, the largest US refiner, gaining 2.1 per cent to $64.41. Halliburton, the world’s biggest oilfield services company, rose 3.5 per cent to $59.84.After rising, Sprint Nextel, the third largest US mobile-telephone company, which announced it had agreed to buy an affiliate for $427m, fell 1.3 per cent to $25.25.
450;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-08-17T19:19:53Z;Corporate computer networks suffer rash of viruses;;"Businesses on Wednesday rushed to secure computer systems as a rash of competing viruses targeted corporate networks around the world running some versions of Microsoft's software.Companies affected included CNN, ABC News, the New York Times and the Financial Times. Computers at DaimlerChrysler, Kraft and UPS were also reported to have been infected by the worms, known by several names including Zotob and Rbot.“We have grouped them into four main families,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at Finnish security software company F-Secure. “They're even fighting with each other; some versions are removing earlier versions. It seems like some fighting is going on within rival virus writing gangs.”By Wednesday night 12 variants of the worm had been identified and Mr Hyppönen said more strains would probably be released over the next few days. However, the threat was expected to recede as companies updated software.The impact is thought, so far, to be less than from similar attacks by Blaster in 2003 and Sasser last year.“As people patch their systems and start to take precautions, [the threat] will diminish,” said Les Fraser, security spokesman for the British Computing Society.However, Ken Allan, partner at Ernst & Young, said the cost could run into millions of pounds.The rash of worms was prompted by Microsoft's publication last week of details of a vulnerability in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003 and some versions of Windows XP. Microsoft frequently publishes details of vulnerabilities in its software as soon as “patches” to fix the flaws become available. However, virus writers are increasingly taking advantage of the information before computer network administrators have time to install the defences. The day after the vulnerability was publicised last week an anonymous computer programmer, believed to be based in Russia and using the name “houseofdabus”, published a computer code on the internet that made it easy for virus writers to exploit the flaw. The first virus to use the software was published on Sunday, and on Wednesday at least five more were released.“Houseofdabus” is thought to be responsible for a similar piece of code in early 2004 that led to the propagation of the Sasser virus. While viruses were traditionally used by hackers to assert their supremacy in “graphiti” style claims to fame, the past 18 months have seen worms such as the Zotob variant, which allows an intruder to control an infected computer, increasingly used by criminal groups for sending spam e-mail or for fraud.The worms exploit a security hole in the plug-and-play feature in the Windows 2000 operating system. Microsoft offered a fix for the bug as part of its monthly patching cycle last week. The software maker deemed the issue “critical”, its most serious rating.“Zotob has thus far had a low impact on customers and only targets Windows 2000. Customers running other versions such as Windows XP, or customers who have applied the MS05-039 update to Windows 2000 are not impacted by this attack,” the company announced on Wednesday.The worms appeared just days after Microsoft’s patch release, leaving users very little time to protect their systems and adding to fears that virus writers are becoming more adept at exploiting vulnerabilities. Many Windows 2000 users are unlikely to have patched yet since they need time to test the fixes before installing them.“Zero-Day Exploits - whereby virus writers and hackers exploit vulnerabilities within hours of their announcement - are on the rise, making vendors more and more cagey about announcing them,” said Graham Titterington, a security analyst at Ovum.Experts said that fully-patched terminals should be able to resist Zotob but that corporations had been slow to apply the latest patches.“If you are responsible for network security inside an organisation it’s time to wake up and smell the coffee: you need to patch your systems now against these security holes or not be surprised when hackers and worms blast their way through,” said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at IT security group Sophos.A spokeswoman for the New York Times said the newsroom and other corporate areas of the newspaper had been affected but that the problem had been rectified. “We introduced some software patches and we don’t expect it will affect production of today’s newspaper,” she said.A Royal Mail spokesman said some of the state-owned group’s offices, including its head office in Old Street, London, were hit by the worms but mail operations were unaffected.“All the indications are that the mail operations are going ahead as it should be today,” the spokesman said.A CNN spokeswoman said the worms caused disruptions to the New York and Atlanta offices for about one hour on Tuesday night, but that broadcasting continued as the offices used their London and Washington DC counterparts for backup.The Wall Street Journal published a notice to readers in its European edition on Wednesday alerting them to production issues overnight, but a spokesperson said the newspaper did not use the software that was affected by the worms.Mr Hartmann at Trend Micro said the outbreak at this point was still “controllable” because the malicious code targets older Windows 2000 software as opposed to newer Windows XP software. He said the number of machines vulnerable to this virus was much smaller than in previous outbreaks from viruses such as Code Red or Nimda.Symantec, the world’s leading IT security company, on Wednesday morning raised its potential damage rating to “medium” and warned that if left unpatched the virus could allow a remote attacker full control over a compromised computer. However, it was already offering a downloadable tool for its removal.LinksSecurity information from Microsoft about the Windows vulnerabilityInformation from anti-virus companies:F-SecureMcafee/Network AssociatesSymantecSophos"
451;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;London dealers focus on takeover talk;;With thoughts of the Ashes on hold until next week, London dealers were occupied instead with yet more takeover speculation.Some of the talk had a whiff of the silly season, but rumours of an imminent offer for Exel were strong enough to push the logistics group above £10 for the first time in five and a half years.Exel has long been seen as a target for UPS or Deutsche Post. But as talk subsided through the session, Exel slipped back to end the day 0.9 per cent higher at 995½p.Bid rumours also boosted insurer Royal & SunAlliance, the biggest gainer on the FTSE 100, up 4 per cent to 96½p.Zurich Financial Services was the name in the frame, although this was largely dismissed as traders pointed instead to positive comments from Goldman Sachs.“The benign claims environment, positive macro factors, management restructuring of the UK pension fund . . . has given positive momentum [to RSA], backed up by a solid first half result [last week],” Goldman wrote.Also being talked up – at least in the morning – was electronic and security company Laird Group. It rose 2.5 per cent to an intra-day high of 343½p on rumours of a possible bidder, but it closed down 0.3 per cent at 334p.Away from the gossip, weakness in heavyweight oils and miners saw the FTSE 100 slip 21.9 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5,322.3, while the broader FTSE 250 lost 9.6 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 7697.0. Volumes of 2.8bn were reasonable.The day’s biggest faller was Cable & Wireless as investors worried that the alternative telecoms operator was paying too much for smaller rival Energis.Although analysts have welcomed the logic of the tie-up, many believed paying up to £674m was excessive.Jim McCafferty at Seymour Pierce, said: “We question the valuation being attributed to Energis in the light of its low profitability ratios and lack of growth.”Meanwhile, confirmation that Deutsche Telekom and KPN would not make an offer for O2 sent the UK mobile group 2.6 per cent lower to 142¾p.Persistent bid speculation has helped O2’s shares double since the start of the year. Given that Deutsche and KPN were seen as two of the more likely suitors, dealers were surprised O2 shares did not fall further.A 70 per cent jump in interim profits could not stop Schroders falling 2.2 per cent to 875½p.Shares in the asset manager have performed well of late, outperforming the FTSE All-Share by 33 per cent in the past 12 months.Charles Stanley cut the group one notch to “hold”. It said Schroders had extracted all it can from its cost restructuring programme.Kingfisher firmed up 2.1 per cent to 255½p, helped by good figures from Home Depot, the US company seen by many as a possible suitor for the B&Q owner.Upgrades from Deutsche Bank helped newspaper groups Daily Mail & General Trust and Trinity Mirror 2.4 per cent to 671½p and 1.4 per cent to 617½p respectively. However, Daily Mail was unsettled late on by talk of a possible rights issue.In the media sector, television operator ITV added 2 per cent to 117¾p, Pearson, the Financial Times’ owners, rose 1 per cent to 686½p, information group Reuters gained 0.8 per cent to 365¼p and GCap Media, the radio group, rose 3.4 per cent to 317p. Flooring specialist Headlam Group gained 3.1 per cent to 433p after bucking the consumer spending downturn to report higher interim sales.This was in stark contrast to rival Carpetright, which saw a sharp fall in sales in the early part of the year. Carpetright shares have gained 12 per cent since May thanks to persistent bid talk. They closed a further 1.3 per cent higher at 937p yesterday.Bovis Homes rose 3.2 per cent to 621p after Panmure Gordon said the housebuilder’s shares to be oversold and upped its rating on the stock from “hold” to “buy”.
452;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;UPS to acquire Lynx Express for $96.5m;;United Parcel Service acquired Lynx Express, the package delivery business, for £55.5m ($96.5m) in a move that strengthens the US company’s position in one of Europe’s most fragmented package delivery markets.Lynx Express, one of the UK’s largest independent parcel carriers, is majority owned by the private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital (Nominees). In the year to October 2 2004, Lynx had turnover of £170m ($295m)UPS expects to complete the transaction in the second half of 2005.“Lynx Express is a well-established company whose network and capabilities strengthen our presence in the UK,” said Bill Caplan, managing director, UPS UK.“This acquisition is an ideal strategic fit for UPS where we have enjoyed strong business growth and a loyal customer base for many years. We will now be even better positioned to support companies across the UK with their domestic and international trade needs.”The acquisition underlines the ambition of UPS to increase its presence in Europe, where the Atlanta-based company is challenging the dominance of Germany’s DHL and TNT of the Netherlands.UPS has become increasingly reliant on international revenues to offset slowing growth and increasing competition in the US.The deal will signal an increase in foreign control over the fragmented UK market, which is divided between international competitors such as DHL and TNT, and smaller domestic companies.Most of the domestic companies are controlled by private equity groups which invested more than $500m in the industry in a wave of deals in the 1990s.The acquisition could also be the catalyst for the long-anticipated consolidation in the domestic market.UPS is not be the first foreign group to strike a deal in the UK market. Interlink Express and GeoPost are both controlled by La Poste, the French postal group, while Securicor Omega was bought by DHL, part of Deutsche Post. TNT also has a large express delivery operation in the UK.Initial City Link, another UK parcel delivery company, is owned by Rentokil Initial, the business services group
453;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-07-24T22:49:46Z;UPS purchase will strengthen position in UK;;United Parcel Service is poised to make an acquisition in the UK, strengthening the US company's position in one of Europe's most fragmented package delivery markets.People familiar with UPS said the medium-sized deal could be announced as early as Monday, although they would not identify the UK company involved. UPS declined to comment.The planned acquisition is believed to be in the package delivery sector, ruling out Exel, the large UK logistics group linked with a takeover by UPS this year.The most likely candidates are all privately-owned companies, including ANC and Lynx Express.Business Post, the biggest UK-listed company in the domestic market, said it was not involved in any deal with UPS. The Birmingham-based company has an alliance with FedEx, the other large US package delivery group, making it an unlikely target for UPS.Other companies in the sector include Target Express, Tuffnells, Amtrack Express and Nightfreight.An acquisition would underline the ambition of UPS to increase its presence in Europe, where the Atlanta-based company is challenging the dominance of Germany's DHL and TNT of the Netherlands.UPS has become increasingly reliant on international revenues to offset slowing growth and increasing competition in the US.The possible deal would signal an increase in foreign control over the fragmented UK market, which is divided between international competitors such as DHL and TNT, and smaller domestic companies.Most of the domestic companies are controlled by private equity groups which invested more than $500m in the industry in a wave of deals in the 1990s.An acquisition could be the catalyst for the long-anticipated consolidation in the domestic market.UPS would not be the first foreign group to strike a deal in the UK market. Interlink Express and GeoPost are both controlled by La Poste, the French postal group, while Securicor Omega was bought by DHL, part of Deutsche Post. TNT also has a large express delivery operation in the UK.Initial City Link, another UK parcel delivery company, is owned by Rentokil Initial, the business services group.The takeover of a package delivery company would mark a renewed focus by UPS on its core business following several deals in other parts of the logistics sector.UPS has been seeking to expand beyond package delivery into supply chain services, fuelling speculation that it could bid for Exel, the logistics group. UPS is close to completing a $1.2bn takeover of Overnite Corporation, a US truck company, and last year bought Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, an international freight forwarder.
454;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:15:04+0000;FedEx warns on fuel price fears;;Federal Express warned on Thursday that first-quarter earnings would be affected by high fuel prices and intense competition, after increasing net profits by 9 per cent in the fourth quarter.The cautious guidance appeared to signal a slowdown in the package delivery company's momentum, after several consecutive quarters as the industry's star performer.Michael Glenn, vice-president of market development, conceded that the industry was becoming more competitive but said pricing remained “rational”.United Parcel Service, which had been losing market share to FedEx, has fought back strongly from a weak 2004 and German-owned DHL is expanding in North America.James Valentine, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said FedEx's comments were confirmation that FedEx and UPS were “using price more aggressively”. But he dismissed fears that the market was descending into a price war.All of FedEx's business units grew solidly in the fourth quarter, generating net profits of $448m, or $1.46 a share, up from $412m, or $1.36, in the same period last year.But the results missed analysts' consensus expectation of $1.48.Shares in FedEx closed down more than 8 per cent on Thursday trading at $80.77. Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive, said he was optimistic about this year and forecast a double-digit earnings increase driven by steady economic growth in the US and internationalmarkets.But the forecast of first-quarter earnings per share in the range of $1.10-$1.25 and $5.20-$5.45 for the full year were at the low end of analysts' expectations.Mr Smith said the focus this year would be on controlling costs, with fuel prices expected to remain high. He said the long-term outlook for the company remained bright as globalisation increased demand for international supply chain services.● A federal mediator ordered an indefinite recess in supervised talks between United Parcel Service and its 2,500 pilots after the two sides failed to resolve a 32-month-old contract dispute during a round of talks in Washington, UPS said on Thursday, Reuters reports from San Francisco.
455;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:15:04+0000;Citi says missing data on 4m customers;;CitiFinancial, a consumer lending arm of New York’s Citigroup, said on Monday that UPS had lost computer tapes containing confidential information on 3.9m of its banking customers.Citigroup said it was notifying customers of the error, which occurred when computer tapes bound for the bank’s credit bureau were lost while in transit.The bank said the tapes contained information about CitiFinancial branch network customers in the US as well as customers with “closed accounts from CitiFinancial Retail Services”. However, the tapes did not contain any information from CitiFinancial Auto, CitiFinancial Mortgage or any other Citigroup business.CitiFinancial said there was no reason to believe that the information had been used inappropriately or that there had been any “unauthorised activity”.”We deeply regret this incident, which occurred in spite of the enhanced security procedures we require of our couriers,” said Kevin Kessinger, president of Consumer Finance North America. “There is little risk of the accounts being compromised because customers have already received their loans, and no additional credit may be obtained from CitiFinancial without prior approval of our customers, either by initiating a new application or by providing positive proof of identification.”The group said it was making every effort to inform customers and to help them protect their identity.
456;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-05-16T20:26:48Z;Wall Street climbs as mergers continue;;US stocks carved out strong gains on Monday, after a fresh round of merger activity and strong results from Lowe’s, the hardware group, put a spark into trading.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 10,252.29. The S&P 500 rose 1 per cent to 1,165.69, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 per cent to 1,994.43.The leading US indices fell slightly last week amid disappointing corporate reports and concerns about slowing economic growth. On Monday, the Federal Reserve’s “Empire State” index added to the economic uncertainty after it showed an unexpected drop in manufacturing activity in New York state last month.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said: “This is awful. The survey is much weaker than we expected, and it supports our view that the soft patch is not over.”Wall Street’s gains strengthened throughout the day, however, as most investors brushed off the downbeat report. Falling oil prices gave equities an early boost. Crude futures later recovered to trade modestly lower by the closing bell.On the merger front, attention turned to UPS, the express shipper, which revealed a deal to buy Overnite Transportation Corp, a US rival, for $1.3bn in cash. UPS agreed to pay $43.25 a share for Overnite – a 46 per cent premium over Friday’s closing price. The news sent Overnite shares up 43.8 per cent to $42.52. UPS shares rose 1.5 per cent to $73.20.Retailers led gainers after Lowe’s, the hardware chain, reported higher profits for the quarter. The company’s shares rose 5.6 per cent to $55.80 even though tearnings fell slightly short of some Wall Street estimates. Home Depot, Lowe’s biggest rival, rose 3 per cent to $37.37 ahead of its quarterly results on Tuesday.Energy groups were the biggest laggards of the day in spite of oil’s late recovery.Exxon Mobil, the oil producer, slipped 0.6 per cent to $53.35. Valero Energy, the refiner, fell 1.8 per cent to $60.66.Drug companies attracted attention after several groups published new clinical data during a big medical conference at the weekend. Celgene, the biotechnology group, rose 4.5 per cent to $38.65 after a blood cancer drug showed good results in clinical trials. Onyx, a rival, fell 14.3 per cent to $27.29 amid concerns that the company’s flagship cancer drug could face competition from a rival drug being produced by Pfizer, the US drugs group. Pfizer shares rose 1.3 per cent to $28.23.PanAmSat, the satellite operator, slipped 1.5 per cent to $18.12 after it reported a modest profit in its first set of quarterly results following the company’s initial public offering in March.Investors in Morgan Stanley were unmoved after a court ordered the bank to pay an aggreived client more than $600m in damages. The group’s shares rose 1.2 per cent to $48.80.Delphi, the auto components group, fell 7.6 per cent to $3.51 after it said several mid-level financial executives would resign amid an accounting probe by US regulators.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, rose 2.1 per cent to $11. Delta Air Lines, a rival, rose 4.3 per cent to $2.90.
457;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:15:04+0000;UPS agrees to buy Overnite for $1.25bn;;United Parcel Service on Monday agreed to acquire Overnite Corporation, a US trucking company, for $1.25bn in cash, further diversifying the group beyond its traditional parcel delivery business.The deal fills a strategic gap for UPS, which had been largely absent from the domestic ground transportation sector.FedEx, the other large US parcel delivery company, has had a fast-growing trucking business for the past few years putting UPS under pressure to enter the market.“Overnite is a perfect strategic fit for our company,” said Mike Eskew, UPS chairman and chief executive. “We want to offer our customers the broadest portfolio of transportation and logistics services available from a single source and this is an important capability that we needed to have.”The deal accelerates consolidation of the US trucking sector, less than three months after Yellow Roadway agreed to buy its rival USF for $1.37bn.Virginia-based Overnite is one of the biggest operators in the less-than-truckload (LTL) market, carrying smaller quantities of freight over shorter distances than the long-haul truckload (TL) operators.FedEx has become one of the most powerful companies in the LTL segment after Yellow Roadway, allowing it to deliver everything from small packages to heavy freight for its customers.The addition of a ground freight capability in the US appeared to complement UPS's acquisition last year of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, an international air freight operator.Both UPS and FedEx are seeking to build global transportation and logistics networks to service the increasingly complicated and lengthy supply chains of their corporate customers.There had been persistent speculation that UPS was looking to use some of its free cash flow, which stood at $3.5bn at the end of last year, on a large acquisition.The all-cash deal valued Overnite at $43.25 a share, a 46 per cent premium to Friday's closing price of $29.58. The shares soared 44 per cent to close at $42.52 on Monday, while shares in UPS closed up 1.43 per cent at $73.18.UPS said it expected the deal, which was unanimously approved by Overnite's board, to be closed during the third quarter of this year. Overnite reported net income of $63.3m in 2004 on revenue of $1.65bn. The carrier serves more than 60,000 customers in both the LTL and TL segments with operations in all 50 US states, Canada and Mexico.Bear Stearns advised UPS. Morgan Stanley advised Overnite.
458;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-04-21T20:45:27Z;Dow records biggest jump in two years;;US stocks surged yesterday as positive earnings reports lifted shares a day after two of the leading US indices hit fresh year-lows.The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 2.1 per cent to 10,218.60, its best single-day performance in more than two years. The S&P 500 rose 2 per cent to 1,159.95, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5 per cent to 1,962.41.A steep drop in jobless claims, falling oil prices, and an upbeat manufacturing report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve also gave Wall Street a boost.Gains strengthened throughout the day in spite of a warning from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chief, that rising deficits could cause the US economy to stagnate.In spite of the day’s gains, US indices were still down substantially from monthly highs.Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services, said that, with bulls and bears locked in an increasingly volatile tug-of-war over investor sentiment, the market’s short-term fortunes may hinge on whether the indices can break through critical upward resistance points today. “If they fail here and this rally doesn’t succeed, it’s going to become more apparent that the bears are correct.”Motorolasurprised analysts with a 13.6 per cent increase in quarterly earnings. The mobile handset maker also raised its second-quarter guidance. Shares in the company rose 6.7 per cent to $15.93Transport finished higher after UPS, the express shipping company, reported higher first-quarter profits and forecast stronger growth this year. UPS shares rose 4.9 per cent to $70.56Yum Brands, owner of the KFC and Taco Bell fast-food chains, fell 4.3 per cent in spite of higher earnings amid concerns about food safety in China. McDonald’s fell 0.3 per cent to $29.85.Elsewhere, Anheuser-Busch, the brewer, jumped 6.5 per cent to $48.04 amid reports that Warren Buffett, the billionaire fund manager, had bought an undisclosed stake in the company.Archipelago Holdings, the electronic trading group, surged 60 per cent to $29.96 a day after it agreed to merge with the New York Stock Exchange to form a new for-profit company.Mergers and acquisitions were in focus as Time Warner and Comcast, the cable groups, agreed to buy Adelphia, a bankrupt rival, for $17.6bn. Time Warner shares rose 3.5 per cent to $17.53. Comcast shares rose 2.4 per cent to $32.25.Google, the world’s biggest search engine company, rose 3.1 per cent to $204.22 ahead of its quarterly results, revealed after the close.Qualcomm, the chipmaker, rose 4.5 per cent to $34.71 after an analyst upgrade. Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, rose 3.1 per cent to $23.36.Delta Air Lines rose 5.8 per cent in spite of a $1.1bn quarterly loss. Continental Airlinesrose 3.2 per cent.
459;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Overview: Wall St bounce helped by earnings;;The gyrations continued on Wall Street on Thursday with shares bouncing back strongly as Corporate America delivered some forecast-beating results.Strong manufacturing data and healthy earnings reports from Motorola, United Parcel Service and Whirlpool helped offset concerns about weakness in the economy, rising interest rates and the threat of higher inflation.“It is turning out to be a stellar quarter for earnings with even expectations of a week ago being beaten,” said David Dropsey, analyst at Thomson Financial.Thomson Financial estimated that of the 188 companies of the S&P 500 companies to report first-quarter results by midday yesterday, 125 or 66 per cent had beaten expectations. In a typical completed quarter, about 59 per cent companies exceed consensus forecasts.Mr Dropsey said there had been a sharp increase in earnings expectations since the start of the year. At January 1, earnings growth of 7.6 per cent had expected for the S&P 500 constituents by the market for the first-quarter. This had now risen to 11.9 per cent.For the full-year, the consensus of forecasts was for 11.2 per cent growth compared with 10.6 per cent at the start of the year.At the same, time, the “surprise factor” - how much companies exceed expectations - had risen 6.7 per cent on average for the first-quarter results so far reported compared with a typical level for a quarter of 3 per cent.Further support to the market was provided by comments from Alan Greenspan, the US Federal Reserve chairman, to a Senate budget committee. Mr Greenspan said the domestic economy was growing at a “reasonably good pace”.The market appeared to focus on these comments rather than Mr Greenspan’s more negative assessment that US budget deficits were growing at an “unsustainable” rate.Sentiment on Wall Street was also boosted by much stronger-than-expected manufacturing data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The so-called Philly Fed index rose to 25.3 in April from 11.4 in March. This was well above economist expectations of a slight increase to 11.9.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 to 10,133.55 at midsession, retracing the heavy losses made on Wednesday on higher-than-expected US inflation data. The S&P 500 gained 1.6 to 1,943.79 while the Nasdaq Composite advanced.A resurgent Wall Street, however, failed to lift European markets out of the doldrums. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 0.4 per cent to 1064.20. In Asia, shares initially fell heavily as they followed Wall Street’s losses on Wednesday but rallied as the session progressed, boosted by a rally in the technology sector.Anais Faraj, strategist at Nomura, said the markets appeared to be taking the view that potential rises in interest rates and a downturn in the economy had been factored into valuations.This bullish view contrasted with a gloomy assessment from Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. Albert Edwards, house strategist, said deteriorating economic and profits data had been giving the equity market some indigestion.“The bulls would have us believe that equities are cheap enough to resist any slowdown. We are not so sure. As investors begin to appreciate that the Fed cannot normalise rates, due to the legacy of the late 1990’s bubble, we would continue to favour a very heavy bond exposure,” he said.
460;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-03-17T14:32:16Z;FedEx profits up but warns on margins;;"FedEx, the world's second-largest package delivery company, increased its third quarter net earnings by a better-than-expected 53 per cent but warned that high oil prices would erode profits in the fourth quarter.Alan Graf, chief financial officer, said this year's renewed increase in fuel prices was having a ""significant impact"" on margins.US light crude on Thursday rose above $57 a barrel for the first time, amid strong global demand and tight supply.However, Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive of FedEx, said he remained confident about prospects for the company and the world economy.""We have solid momentum in the business and customer demand is strong,"" he said. ""Economic conditions remain favourable, and we are optimistic about future growth.""FedEx has been winning a share of US ground deliveries from United Parcel Service, the market leader, while also enjoying rapid growth in international express traffic as global trade increases, especially between Asia and North America.Mr Smith said FedEx had enjoyed an ""extraordinary"" peak shipping season, in contrast to the weak Christmas period encountered by UPS.All three of FedEx's main businesses - air express, ground and freight - registered double digit percentage increases in revenues and operating profits, underlining its status as the best-performing of the big package delivery companies.However, FedEx said pricing in the domestic express and ground markets was becoming more competitive, suggesting that UPS was fighting back, while DHL, owned by Germany's Deutsche Post, continues to expand in the US.Net profits were $317m, or $1.03 a share, compared with $207m, or 68 cents a share, last year. Analysts polled by Thomson First Call had expected 98 cents.However, Mr Graf said fourth quarter profits would be at the lower end of analysts' expectations, forecasting earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50, compared to the Wall Street consensus of $1.49.Jon Langenfeld, analyst at Baird Research, said strong growth in international express and domestic ground sales was expected but the 6 per cent volume increase in domestic express - FedEx's most mature business - was a ""positive surprise"".Mr Graf said FedEx would invest $2.3bn in the 2005 fiscal year. The company has been ordering more long-range aircraft, including up to 20 Airbus A380 superjumbos, to cope with surging global trade between Asia, North America and Europe.It has also been expanding its facilities in China, as it vies with UPS and DHL for leadership in the world's most populous country."
461;UPS;United Parcel Service;2005-03-08T17:56:49Z;The battle for parcel supremacy;;"Whenever David Abney looks up from his desk on the executive floor of United Parcel Service's headquarters in Atlanta, he sees a large map of China mounted on the wall. ""I have it right in my line of sight,"" he says. ""It reminds me and visitors to my office of the size of the place and the opportunity it provides for us.""As president of the package delivery company's international business, Mr Abney is quick to stress that Europe, South America and the rest of Asia are also important markets. But the fact that only China is granted its own map shows where his priorities lie.""China is the largest and most exciting opportunity in the 30 years I've been with UPS,"" he says. ""It's not a case of 'should we' or 'can we'. If you're going to be a global company in future you absolutely have to be a player in China.""Over the past few months, UPS has committed an additional $600m of investment in China as it vies with rivals FedEx, DHL and TNT for leadership of the market. The increased spending will expand the company's distribution network and secure full control of its express delivery joint-venture in the country.China is becoming an increasingly important source of growth to UPS as the US market slows. The company's export volume out of China more than doubled last year, compared with a 23 per cent increase in the whole international business and 6.6 per cent in the US.""In the past, UPS has relied on its domestic package business to drive growth,"" says Satish Jindel, president of SJ Consulting, a transport consultancy. ""But last year's weak performance in the US showed it must focus more on international business - especially in China.""UPS is expanding in the country on two fronts. The first is its traditional package business, shuttling small parcels between China and the rest of the world. The second is supply chain services, handling the export of larger-scale cargo from Chinese manufacturers to overseas markets.Last December, UPS agreed to pay Sinotrans, its Chinese partner, $100m to take full control of their express delivery joint venture when Beijing relaxes foreign ownership rules at the end of this year. The deal will make UPS the first foreign company in the sector to wholly-own its Chinese operation. ""Having full control will give us more flexibility in making investments and long-term strategic decisions and will give our brand a stronger presence,"" says Mr Abney.Meanwhile, the supply chain management business announced plans last month to increase its number of Chinese warehouses from 40 to 60 within two years. The facilities distribute goods such as textiles, technology and auto parts for import and export.However, Kurt Kuehn, UPS's senior vice-president of sales and marketing, says building a network inside China is only half the challenge. Just as important is connecting it to the rest of the world. ""Anyone can build a warehouse in China,"" he says. ""But it's useless unless you can get the goods to market in North America and Europe.""UPS believes it offers a more comprehensive global service to Chinese customers than any of its rivals. FedEx lacks the international freight-handling capability that UPS secured through its acquisition of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding last year, while DHL and TNT are relatively weak in North America. ""We have the best network in the US and a powerful presence in Europe, so we can connect China to the rest of the world better than our more regionally-focused competitors,"" says Mr Kuehn.DHL and FedEx, however, both have important advantages over UPS. DHL, owned by Deutsche Post, was the first foreign package delivery company to enter China in 1986 when it formed its own joint-venture with Sinotrans.While UPS and FedEx are limited to international deliveries in and out of China, DHL is the only one allowed to make domestic shipments. This will soon change as World Trade Organisation rules force Beijing to liberalise but DHL's 37 per cent share of the local market will be difficult to catch. FedEx, meanwhile, has had the best air access to China since its acquisition of Flying Tigers, an international cargo airline, in 1989. The company will this month increase its number of weekly flights to the country to 23, compared with UPS's 18. Both companies were recently awarded an additional six landing slots in China with the promise of a further three each next year, following an aviation agreement between Beijing and Washington. ""We fly into three different Chinese cities: Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai,"" says David Cunningham, FedEx's senior vice-president for Asia- Pacific. ""Nobody else does that."" In addition to its direct flights between the US and China, FedEx connects China to the rest of Asia through its Subic Bay hub in the Philippines and this month launched a service from Shanghai to Frankfurt - the first direct cargo service between China and Europe.The battle for dominance in China is part of a global parcel war raging between the package delivery giants, with DHL challenging UPS and FedEx in North America, while the US pair take on DHL and TNT in Europe.But the companies understand that they cannot win their battles elsewhere in the world without a strong presence in China.A CORPORATE CULTURE TO DIGESTOne day in January this year, a Chinese delegation visited the Atlanta headquarters of United Parcel Service to negotiate a business deal over a lavish Chinese meal.The meeting was a disaster as UPS executives committed a series of cultural gaffes that risked causing grave offence to their guests.Blunders included using first names instead of the formal titles favoured by Chinese businessmen and handing out clocks as gifts - a symbol of impending death in China.Fortunately for UPS, the meeting was a role-playing exercise designed to familiarise its executives with Chinese business culture.About 100 company officials attended the etiquette lesson, organised by Chinese-born Shiao Dong Han, UPS’s director for international retail services.Participants learned about the importance of building personal relationships with their Chinese counterparts before getting down to business. They were also advised to always leave a little food uneaten when dining in China because a clean plate implies hunger.Despite the executives’ disastrous performance, Mr Han said UPS’s corporate culture was well-suited to business in China because the company puts a premium on hard work and loyalty - qualities that are valued by the Chinese."
462;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:01:04+0000;David Bowen: The online transatlantic gap;;"I have been playing a game this week. Looking at corporate websites from several feet away, and seeing if I can guess which country they come from. Seven times out of 10 I can - which leads to me to the conclusion that the worldwide web is not that worldwide after all. It reflects the character of a country, just as interior decoration, car style or dress sense do.Inevitably this is most obvious when looking at the transatlantic gap, and I will start with a sweeping generalisation. Americans put practicality above looks; Europeans put looks above practicality.There is a serious point in this. Differences in look and feel reflect different attitudes to this adolescent medium. Americans are already thinking of it in a way that most Europeans would find odd. And I am not sure that as the web grows up, attitudes will necessary converge. Could we end up with an American web, a French web, a British web, alongside a truly Worldwide one? Possibly.So to the transatlantic gap - and before I start, I apologise to the three out of 10 companies that do not fit the stereotype. American sites are ugly, at least to European eyes. Look at Bristol-Myers Squibb (www.bms.com) - bright colours, flashing pictures. Look at Bell South (www.bellsouth.com) or Merck (www.merck.com). The giveaway here is the ‘smiling face’ count. Well-coiffed people displaying their perfect teeth – it’s all a bit Dallas or Dynasty, isn’t it? As for Boeing (www.boeing.com), why does it look like a hangover from the Sixties? Something to do with the typefaces, I think.Then there is the use of brand colours. This is an issue that starts offline. I can’t imagine a European company painting its delivery vans chocolate brown, as UPS does, so it is not surprising that its website (www.ups.com) looks drab to me, a European. More subtly, Abbott Laboratories (www.abbott.com) uses a drab green background throughout its site. To me its looks like the colour of an unhealthy pond. To Americans it presumably gives off an other, more positive, vibe.But before you think I am yet another anti-American zealot, let me point out the flip side of all this. I reckon the Americans have stopped paying much attention to the look of their websites because they have come to see them as working tools rather than ornaments. Or to use the interior decoration analogy, as workshops rather than drawing rooms.The Merck sites contains a quite astonishing set of information, the Merck Manuals. There are five of these encyclopaedias, two for patients, two for medical professionals and one for vets. They are translated into up to six languages. Merck says they are provided ‘on a not-for-profit basis as a service to the community’. As they are free, I would have thought not-for-profit was a euphemism for ‘expensive for us’. Suddenly the smiley face count does not seem to matter any more.Or take Boeing, with its comprehensive sections for suppliers, employees, retirees, and even people it has made redundant. This is material that you will struggle to find on any European corporate website, because Europeans see websites much more in terms of marketing and image.They certainly have a more sophisticated design. The best-looking corporate sites of all are in my view European. Maybe it is because I am a European, but there is no denying that real thought has gone into the look of Novartis (www.novartis.com). The shading of colour to avoid a blocky feel, the placing of images, the apparently random pattern in the top bar. All these have been very carefully thought out by graphic designers who wanted to transmit a particular image on a website, and who understood the medium well enough to make that happen. Or take BP (www.bp.com), which is burdened with two unpromising colours for a computer screen – green and yellow - but has made them work.At a less elevated level, and returning to my game, I can spot many French sites a mile (sorry kilometre) off. They just love using bright pastel colours. Look at France Telecom (www.francetelecom.fr), Bouygues (www.bouygues.fr) or Danone (www.danone.com). They all look like kids’ playrooms.Quite refreshing really – certainly more fun than the other regional European look. What is it about dark blue and Germans/northern Europeans? Deutsche Bank (www.db.com), SCA (www.sca.com), Handelsbanken (www.handelsbanken.com): all sensible, sophisticated and terribly boring. UBS (www.ubs.com) has the blue tendency, but has had the good sense to cheer it up with a little well-placed colour.But as I have said, the Europeans are giving much less thought than Americans to what they should actually be doing with their websites. Most of their sites are giant electronic brochures. Brochures have their use - good ones attract customers, investors and recruits - but there come a point when the finance director will want to see a rather harder return on investment.What should happen is that European sites become more useful, while American sites get better-looking. But I am not sure they will. Even though the web is the only medium that has no recognition of borders, and what is done here can so easily be copied and followed there, I suspect the gap will remain, and perhaps widen. I don’t care if it does. Vive la différence, godammit.David Bowen is a website effectiveness consultant for Bowen Craggs Co (www.bowencraggs.com).dbowen@bowencraggs.com"
463;UPS;United Parcel Service;2020-04-24T07:15:04+0000;UPS chief warns of rising hostility towards free trade;;The top executive at United Parcel Service warned on Wednesday that opponents of globalisation were winning the battle for the hearts and minds of the American people and urged business leaders to promote free trade.Mike Eskew, UPS chairman and chief executive, said widespread hostility towards globalisation was threatening a revival of isolationism, with potentially “disastrous” consequences for the US economy.“Everyone who believes in free and fair trade is in risk of losing a significant battle,” he told a business audience in Atlanta. “There is a small but vocal anti-globalisation movement that has pushed its message forward with great force and tenacity.” He cited research that showed 54 per cent of Americans believed global trade was bad for the US economy, reflecting a “disconnect” between the pro-trade lobby and the public.“We in the business community have not done a very good job promoting the benefits of international trade,” he said, urging business leaders to launch a public relations offensive. Mr Eskew acknowledged concern about the loss of jobs to low-cost countries, such as China and India, but said the benefits of globalisation exceeded the costs.“There's no greater force working for expanding markets, economic and social improvement, competition that encourages innovation and geopolitical harmony, than the force of trade among nations,” he said.UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, claims that 2 per cent of the world's gross domestic product is carried by its distribution system and depends upon free movement of goods around the globe.Mr Eskew said globalisation was not well understood because “trade and economic literacy has never ranked as a national priority”.

Belgium wants a minority partner to modernise its service: TPG and France's La Poste are rumoured to be considering bidding jointly.Cross-border consolidation so far has been held back by slow liberalisation and national sensitivity. Austria balked last year at partial privatisation for fear its service would land in German hands.Change has to come. Under EU pressure, the legally permissible monopoly on letters dropped from 350 to 100 grams in 2003 and falls to 50 next year. Markets are supposed to be open completely by 2009, though several may not be ready.Pain is already felt. France has seen strikes over plans to cut jobs and close branches. Deutsche Post, Europe's biggest mail carrier, was ordered by Germany's Cartel Office this week to allow competitors to pre-sort types of letters, which it will fight in court.The question is - will all this deepen competition, or will operators extend their dominance? The Dutch and Germans have aggressively expanded into new businesses and other countries. La Poste also wants to be a European player.TPG has efficiency on its side, though it could eventually be a takeover target. Deutsche Post, which clashed in the past with European competition authorities, will be a powerful player. America's UPS is eyeing the European bulk business mail market.Governments and regulators must be tough. Politicians fear controversy over rural branch closures and threats to the universal service obligation, but there is a real opportunity to cut costs and expand business.Eighty per cent of letter mail comes from companies. Traditional mail may be declining but innovations in direct marketing, along with e-commerce parcel deliveries, can create growth if competition flowers.Brussels curbed againBrussels' power over mergers remains deeply contentious, in spite of sweeping reforms since the European Commission had three merger prohibitions overturned by the Court of First Instance in 2002.Yesterday's European Court of Justice ruling, upholding the lower court's judgment in the merger between packaging groups Tetra Laval and Sidel, leaves that power looking distinctly weakened.The Commission appealed in this case because, it said, the ruling set a dangerous precedent that would make it virtually impossible to block future mergers. But the court rejected the Brussels body's claim that judges exceeded their duty in second-guessing the facts as well as the Commission's analysis. This reinforces effective judicial review.Yesterday's ruling also raises the bar for the Commission to prove that mergers between companies in different markets harm competition, which could affect the ruling due later this year on the blocking of General Electric's merger with Honeywell. The Commission argued that GE would use its aircraft leasing strength to gain advantage in Honeywell's aircraft equipment markets.If yesterday's decision was a further setback for the Commission, a defeat over GE - the highest profile merger decision by Mario Monti, former commissioner - would be a severe blow.Many lawyers and companies are happy that the Commission, once seen as ""judge, jury and executioner"", is now subject to greater checks. There are dangers, though. A regulator that is continually overturned may lack the strength to safeguard consumer interests.european.comment@ft.com"

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
471;UPS;United Parcel Service;2004-12-21T21:40:51Z;Wall St hits three-and-a-half year high;;"Wall Street steamed ahead on Tuesday, boosted by strong gains in transportation stocks and an upbeat report from the chip sector. Pharmaceuticals were also in the spotlight after a new study raised fresh questions about painkiller safety.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 10,759.43 - a 3½-year high - while the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent at 1,205.45. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,150.91.A strong rally in October and November has left shares in the leading US indices hovering near their highest levels since 2001, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq touching 3½-year highs last week. The strong gains that came in the wake of the US presidential election have given way this month to slower progress on Wall Street, however, leaving stocks trading mostly flat in spite of a slew of year-end merger and acquisition activity.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co, said an expected slowdown in corporate earnings growth seemed to be the biggest factor keeping gains in check.Earnings among companies in the S&P 500 grew by 19 per cent this year, while forecasts for next year are 10 per cent.""I would argue that stock valuations still are relatively attractive, especially given the interest rate environment,"" said Mr Hogan.Most analysts predict that the stock market will continue to creep higher until the year's end, as bullish investors look to the first post-Christmas trading sessions for signs of sustained vigour. One analyst said he expected to increased volatility in share prices this week as Wall Street gradually empties ahead of the Christmas holiday.Transport stocks led gainers on what is traditionally the busiest shipping day of the year. FedEx, the biggest express shipper, rose 0.4 per cent to $100.53, while rival UPS climbed 1 per cent to $86.48.Railroad shares rallied as Union Pacific, the country's biggest independent rail operator, raised its fourth-quarter outlook. Union Pacific shares jumped 5.5 per cent to $65.67. Shares in Norfolk Southern, the third-biggest rail operator by market capitalisation, were up 3 per cent at $36.21, while CSX, the rail freight group, rose 2 per cent to $39.82.Railroads have seen record shipping volumes this year, driven by a booming harvest in the midwest and soaring demand for US exports.Semiconductor stocks jumped as investors welcomed a report from Gartner saying that worldwide chipmaker revenue should grow by 23 per cent this year in spite of a slowdown in growth in the second half. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 0.7 per cent to 422.48. Intel, the world's biggest microchip company, received an additional boost following a Lehman Brothers upgrade. Intel's shares rose 3.5 per cent to $23.49. Intel's chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices, fell 0.5 per cent to $21.73.Pharmaceutical stocks remained in the spotlight after clinical studies raised new questions about the safety of two popular painkillers. Pfizer rebounded after falling more than 16 per cent following Friday's news that its Celebrex arthritis drug increased the risk of heart attacks in patients. Shares in the drugs group rose 2.8 per cent to $24.97 after US health regulators said that Alzheimer's patients taking Celebrex in a separate study did not show elevated cardiac risk. Merck, whose withdrawn Vioxx painkiller uses an active ingredient similar to the one in Celebrex, rose 1.5 per cent to $31.98.The US-listed shares of Bayer, the German drugs group, rose 0.5 per cent in spite of warnings that Naproxen, the active ingredient in Bayer's Aleve painkiller, had increased the risk of heart attacks in the same Alzheimer's trials.Elsewhere, IAC InterActivecorp, the media and travel group run by Barry Diller, jumped 5.9 per cent to $27.41 after it said it would spin off its Expedia online travel service.Investors were also focused on financial stocks on Tuesday after earnings reports by two big US investment banks. Morgan Stanley, the biggest US investment bank by volume, rose 1.6 per cent to $54.50 as earnings beat expectations. Bear Stearns gave up early gains to fall 1.7 per cent to $102.70 after it reported sharply higher quarterly profits.Energy stocks were the laggards among the S&P 500, with Sunoco shares down 0.1 per cent to $82.88. John Herrlin, vice president at Merrill Lynch, said petroleum prices were likely to remain volatile in the short term."
472;UPS;United Parcel Service;2004-11-08T16:22:48Z;DHL buys controlling stake in India?s Blue Dart;;"DHL, the international logistics group, has acquired a majority stake in India's largest domestic courier company, only days after its troubled expansion in the US caused it to shake up senior management.DHL, a subsidiary of Deutsche Post, will buy 68 per cent in Blue Dart by picking up a 51 per cent stake from its three founding directors for Rs4.2bn and a 17 per cent stake from Schroders Capital, a private equity fund, for Rs1.2bn. DHL will follow with a mandatory open offer for an additional 20 per cent of Blue Dart's equity.The deal comes after Deutsche Post reshuffled its management board at the weekend with the head of DHL in the US, Asia and emerging markets being replaced.Analysts said Uwe D?rken's departure - to be replaced by John Mullen, head of DHL in Asia Pacific - could be seen as Deutsche Post trying to blame somebody for its disappointing performance in the US. The German group said earlier this year that mounting losses at DHL Express Americas meant the unit would not break even until 2006, a year later than planned.""It's a very Anglo-Saxon approach and very radical,"" said Menno Sanderse, analyst at Morgan Stanley. ""It shows they are determined.""Under the all cash deal announced on Monday, DHL will pay Rs350 for each share of Blue Dart. Blue Dart's share price rose to an intra-day high of Rs331 on the Bombay stock exchange on Monday before easing back.Market observers described DHL's valuation as generous, reflecting its desire to pay a strategic premium to prevent FedEx and UPS - which both have a presence in India's Rs15bn courier-services market - from trying to bid.The deal gives DHL a dominant share in the Indian sub-continent's premium domestic and international door-to-door delivery segment. Blue Dart has a 40 per cent share of the market, which is growing by a third annually, according to bankers involved in the transaction.Mr Sanderse said: ""DHL Asia-Pacific is very profitable so maybe it's not bad to have exposure to an operator that is only domestic…But a more cautious view would be that they have to sort out the problems in the US first.""Blue Dart and DHL already co-operate on some express and logistics services in India. People familiar with the transaction say, however, that DHL is expected to allow Blue Dart to continue running autonomously."
473;UPS;United Parcel Service;2004-08-08T17:40:48Z;Midnight in Memphis, new dawn in China;;High over the Pacific Ocean, flight FX 24 from Shanghai to Memphis is one of the most closely monitored aircraft entering US airspace. Every night the Federal Express cargo jet is packed with 77 tonnes of digital cameras, mobile phones and other high-value electronics that make it the company's single largest source of revenue and a significant contributor to America's ballooning trade deficit.Until recently the top priority route for FedEx was its daily flight from Tokyo, which carries express packages from all over Asia. But as with most big US companies, FedEx's attention is increasingly focused on one market: China.Corporate America's interest in the world's most populous nation is nothing new - China's dramatic economic boom has aroused growing curiosity from US boardrooms for several years. But lately the level of interest has begun to feel more like an obsession.During Wall Street's last round of quarterly earnings announcements, few large companies got very far into their conference calls with analysts before the subject of China came up. From iconic multinationals such as General Motors, General Electric and Goldman Sachs, to specialists such as Home Depot or Avon, almost every significant chief executive has Chinese expansion plans at the top of his or her to-do list.As domestic US growth shows signs of slowing and Europe's recovery remains relatively subdued, business leaders in the world's largest economy are determined not to miss China's potential contribution to the bottom line. Rising profits from China play an essential part in many analysts' financial modelling for this year and next.There are plenty of potential problems. Many smaller companies still view China predominantly as a threat. European and Japanese multinationals are queueing to claim their share of the prize. And it is not yet clear how far Beijing may be prepared to welcome foreign competition for Chinese companies in some sectors. One way to take the pulse of corporate America's love affair with all things Chinese is to watch the elaborate mating game being played out by companies such as FedEx.Express cargo aircraft are the clipper ships of the modern age, carrying 2 per cent of international trade measured by volume but 50 per cent measured by value. In the early hours of a sticky Tennessee night more than 80 of these aircraft an hour descend into FedEx's global hub at Memphis, making it the busiest cargo airport in the world. A military-style “command and control” centre ensures that, no matter how bad the thunderstorms get over the Midwest, the valuable flights from Asia are always the last to be diverted or cancelled.But the express logistics industry is about more than just ferrying cargo back and forth. A global hub-and-spoke network is designed to link hundreds of towns and cities with an overnight communications infrastructure that keeps the world's “just-in-time” supply chain taut. In developed markets such as the US, the ability to guarantee overnight shipment of parts and finished goods has allowed companies to reduce average inventory levels by a fifth over the last decade and is thought to have played a significant role in improving productivity across the economy (see charts).It is for this reason, above all else, that FedEx and rivals such as United Parcel Service and DHL are paying so much attention to China. As it becomes the workshop of the world, teeming factories along the Pearl and Yangtze river deltas represent both the start of the world's supply chain and the source of some its biggest transport bottlenecks.Growing recognition of this fact has also helped to spark interest among Chinese government officials. Despite the relatively immature state of its own competing airlines, Beijing last month signed an unusually liberal agreement with the US allowing a fivefold increase in the number of cargo and passenger flights between the two countries. A key part of this air services agreement was permission for carriers such as FedEx to open cargo hubs from 2007 and begin building the kind of logistics infrastructure demanded by companies with local manufacturing operations.The progress in opening up China's airspace illustrates an approach being taken by many of the more successful US multinationals. By targeting sophisticated markets where there is relatively little domestic competition - whether it be electricity generating equipment from GE or logistics expertise from FedEx - infrastructure providers are able to secure the kind of welcome in China that other manufacturers or service sector companies struggle to achieve.Fred Smith, FedEx chairman and chief executive, describes the lobbying process to increase access to China as considerably more straightforward than in supposedly liberalised markets such as Britain. “We had all this independent research that showed how important the fast movement of freight was to the development of the economy,” he says. “But we didn't have to make much of a sale - they [the Beijing officials] got it.”The speed at which Chinese markets for air services and the like are opening up also illustrates the value of the prize for those multinationals that can get in first. Not only is this a huge market, it is one of the last significant markets in the world to liberalise. “China is the important issue of the 21st century,” adds Mr Smith. “Its inexhaustible supply of labour and engineering talent is going to be an incredible part of the economic story of the world.”This is far from a winning situation for all concerned. Fierce battles remain, particularly over which companies should get to use the coveted new flight allocations. Some 39 weekly slots between China and the US become available between now and March for four US cargo carriers to share. Yet seven companies are demanding up to 53 flights between them. The US Department of Transportation has given them until today to make their case and is expected to make a final decision in September.With so much business at stake, operators already in China, such as FedEx and UPS, argue that landing rights should go to those most able to take advantage of them immediately. Those wanting entry counter that they should be given the chance to stimulate greater competition.Tussles over landing rights are standard fare in the express cargo business, which has lobbied for deregulation of the airways throughout most of its short life. But even by these standards, the scramble to gain a toehold in China has generated some heated exchanges. UPS, for example, has accused FedEx of seeking to hog slots that it does not need. In response FedEx has called UPS the “Don Quixote” of the case for tilting at windmills and accused its rival of seeking to create a “pseudo- hub” rather than invest in genuine infrastructure.Petty as such squabbles can seem from the outside, they are part of a great game being played out by multinationals in China. While FedEx and UPS fight among themselves, DHL - their European rival owned by Deutsche Post - is pressing ahead with opening a $100m cargo terminal in Hong Kong. Similar epic battles are being fought in the car industry, where General Motors is seeking to overtake Volkswagen's early market lead, and in the power and transport markets, where GE and Siemens compete for billions of dollars of new infrastructure orders.The outcome of this rivalry is watched keenly by cities seeking foreign investment. In the case of the express cargo industry, the economic prize sought is the location of regional distribution hubs, which can make surrounding areas much more attractive for further inward investment.FedEx, for example, has generated intense local interest by announcing talks with airport authorities in Guangzhou, the southern Chinese city at the heart of the Pearl River delta's manufacturing boom. Though unlikely to result in a completed hub until perhaps 2010, the talks are a coup for Guangzhou, which has built a new airport after years of struggling with overcrowded transport infrastructure. It also represents a challenge to Shenzhen and Hong Kong, nearby ports that have long prided themselves as the gateways to the Pearl River.FedEx insists the talks are not yet finalised, suggesting it wants to continue haggling over terms while retaining the option of going elsewhere. Both UPS and DHL hope to establish facilities in Shanghai, where the Yangtze River delta rivals its southern neighbour as China's export powerhouse.Elsewhere in Asia the competition is viewed with concern. FedEx and UPS have both invested heavily in hubs in the Philippines, where the Guangzhou talks have led to fears that China's growth may undermine FedEx's plans to expand its hub at Subic Bay, near Manila.FedEx rejects the argument, pointing out that, just as it maintains a number of different hubs in Europe and the US, there is no reason it cannot continue simultaneously to expand regional Asian facilities in Japan, the Philippines and China. Nevertheless the same hub-and-spoke system that makes the overnight cargo industry economically viable also tends to concentrate secondary economic benefits at the busiest points of the network. Memphis, for example, is Fed Ex's only hub with direct flights to all other points in the US network as well as many international destinations. Economists at the Stanford Research Institute have calculated that, as a result, 130 foreign-owned companies from 22 countries employing 17,200 workers have clustered around Memphis to take advantage of later pick-up times for overnight deliveries.It is far from easy to open a hub. The Memphis hub has been described as one of the world's most complex works of industrial choreography. Up to 5m individual packages must be unloaded, sorted and reloaded during a four-hour window so planes have time to reach their destinations by dawn. As the Chinese economy matures beyond its early reliance on labour-intensive manufacturing, infrastructure investment of this type becomes ever more important. In a world of global supply chains, sophisticated distribution centres are likely to become a sine qua non for successful economies.An assessment of the advantages that China can derive from foreign investment influences Beijing's bargaining with many multinationals. Goldman Sachs, which recently won approval for an investment banking venture in China, has even been encouraged to make a “donation” to help a troubled domestic firm. One worry for many multinationals is that different arms of the government might not view their presence in the same light, undermining whatever deals are reached. In the case of express deliveries, for example, opposition from China's state-owed postal service and its airlines remains a serious concern (see left). “The Chinese bureaucracy is big and there are lots of different interests,” says Rush O'Keefe, the FedEx lawyer leading its entry.Yet multinationals cannot afford to ignore the rewards. While growth rates in most markets are measured in single digits, FedEx boasts annual growth in China of more than 50 per cent. UPS says year-on-year growth was running at almost 70 per cent in the second quarter. In boardrooms across America, the common refrain is that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.“There are hundreds of millions of people who are finding it glorious to get rich,” concludes Mr Smith in a self-conscious echo of the phrase Deng Xiaoping used to ignite China's boom. The assumption behind his enthusiasm is that it will be US multinationals that will help them do so.Checks on the postWhen DHL, the German-owned parcel carrier, launched a domestic express service in China in May, Beijing's State Postal Bureau declared it had never approved the move, writesAlexandra Harney.The reaction from the bureau - which also runs China Post, the national postal service and dominant parcel delivery company - gave an insight into a heated, behind-the-scenes debate about the regulation of parcel deliveries in China. DHL said it had all the necessary government approvals.As international express carriers begin to expand into China's vast domestic market they are running into some obstacles. The way in which these issues are resolved will have substantial consequences for the industry. China offers both rapid economic growth and a huge market at a time when many of other markets are maturing. “There aren't many countries that have a big enough geographical range and enough people that you can really have a domestic express product that will compete with the national post,” says one industry executive.So far international express carriers have enjoyed essentially unfettered access to the market - a key factor, they say, in their rapid growth in China. But in 2002 Chinese officials began revising the 18-year-old postal law, mapping out what would be the monopoly preserve of China Post. International executives, who have been allowed unusual access to the revision process, are chiefly concerned about China Post's dual role as competitor and regulator. “That is not a level playing field,” says David Cunningham, FedEx's Asia Pacific president. “We're happy to compete with anyone but we want to do it on a level playing field.”The discussions have been complicated by the fact that Express Mail Service, China Post's parcel delivery service, has seen its share of international express shipments fall to less than 30 per cent, largely because of the international carriers.At the same time, local express carriers are cropping up across China to challenge China Post at home.With the postal law in its sixth draft and the monopoly question still in flux, clashes like the one between DHL and the State Postal Bureau are not surprising. But the logic behind them is sometimes difficult to understand.China Domestic, DHL's domestic express service and the first of its kind from a foreign company, only delivers goods weighing more than 2kg. At the time that DHL started the service the draft law said foreign companies could deliver anything above 500g.Chinese officials have also countered international carriers' requests for access to the domestic market with concerns that they would deliver illegal materials such as literature from Falun Gong, a spiritual movement banned in China, according to a person familiar with the talks. Chinese officials did not respond to a request for comment.A study by the US-China Business Council published last September estimated that an unrestricted air express industry would generate $3bn in additional investment and $84bn in increased manufacturing output, and create 800,000 jobs for China's export industry.Even as the debate continues, executives say they are pleased with the progress China has made in opening up its market. The latest draft of the postal law allows foreign companies to deliver anything weighing more than 350g, according to Mr Cunningham.The landmark US-China aviation agreement signed last month has also significantly widened the opportunities for international carriers. Out of the 195 additional weekly flights that will be added between the US and China over the next six years, 111 are reserved for cargo carriers. Under its 2001 accession commitments to the World Trade Organisation, China has to allow foreign companies majority ownership of freight transport companies within three years.
