0;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2018-05-29T19:23:12Z;Canada attempts to boost controversial oil sands pipeline;C$4.5bn deal has been criticised by environmental campaigners and taxpayer groups;The Canadian government has taken a radical step in its attempt to increase the country’s oil export capacity, agreeing to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline from Kinder Morgan of the US for C$4.5bn.The deal is intended to help advance a proposed C$7.4bn expansion of the pipeline, which runs from the oil sands region of Alberta to a terminal in British Columbia on Canada’s west coast.The expansion, which would increase Trans Mountain’s capacity from 300,000 barrels a day to 890,000 b/d, had run into intense opposition in British Columbia. Canada’s government, which backs the expansion, is buying the pipeline to support it through legal and political challenges.Bill Morneau, Canada’s finance minister, described the deal “an investment in Canada’s future”.He added: “We believe that this is the best way to protect thousands of good well-paying jobs, and the safest and the most effective way to get our natural resources to world markets.”The government aims to find other investors or buyers for the pipeline. Mr Morneau said “many” had already an expressed an interest, including Canadian pension funds and First Nations groups of indigenous Canadians.Canada’s oil production has been rising steadily, from 4.1m barrels a day in 2013 to 5m b/d last year, putting strain on its export capacity. The continued delays holding back the proposed Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta into the US have increased the significance of alternative routes. Transport constraints meant that the discount for heavy Western Canada Select oil compared to benchmark US crude widened to more than $30 a barrel earlier this year, although it has subsequently narrowed again.The Trans Mountain expansion was one of two projects approved by Canada’s federal authorities to ease the bottlenecks, the other being the replacement and expansion of Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline to Wisconsin.However, the premier of British Columbia, the city of Vancouver, some First Nations groups and environmental campaigners have opposed the Trans Mountain plan, particularly because of concerns about increased oil tanker traffic heading out to the Pacific.Kinder Morgan has been forced to fight a series of legal battles to defend the project, and eventually set a deadline of May 31 for a resolution of the uncertainty over whether the expansion would be allowed to go ahead.Steve Kean, Kinder Morgan’s chief executive, said the deal that would benefit the people of Canada, oil exporters and shareholders.He added: “The outcome reached represents the best opportunity to complete TMEP [Trans Mountain Expansion Project] and thereby realise the great economic benefits promised by that project.”The deal was criticised, however, both for undermining the government’s climate policy and for leaving the financial risk with taxpayers.Prime minister Justin Trudeau aims to cut Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions, and his government plans a carbon tax intended to start at an initial level of C$10 a tonne this September, for provinces that have not already introduced their own systems. But increasing the capacity of Trans Mountain is likely to lead to increased sales and production from Alberta’s oil sands, which can create higher greenhouse gas emissions in production than some other forms of crude.Hannah Martin of Greenpeace said: “Justin Trudeau is gambling billions of Canadian taxpayer dollars on an oil project that will never be built . . . His decision today is in stark contrast to his supposed climate credentials and his commitment to Indigenous rights.”Aaron Wudrick of the Canadian Taxpayers’ Federation said: “This decision represents both a colossal failure of the Trudeau government to enforce the law of the land, and a massive, unnecessary financial burden on Canadian taxpayers.”
1;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2018-05-29T14:21:05Z;Canada to buy controversial Trans Mountain pipeline for C$4.5bn;;The Canadian government has agreed to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline, a critical oil transport route, from Kinder Morgan for C$4.5bn, in an attempt to increase export capacity for the country’s heavy crude.The radical move is an attempt by the government to make progress with a proposed C$7.4bn expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which runs from the oil sands region of Alberta to a terminal near Vancouver on Canada’s west coast.Kinder Morgan, the US pipeline group, had been attempting to increase Trans Mountain’s capacity from 300,000 barrels a day to 890,000 b/d, but had faced strong opposition from British Columbia, the province where the pipeline ends. The federal government and the province of Alberta, which produces the oil carried by Trans Mountain, are strong supporters of the expansion project, and the disagreement had led to increasingly acrimonious political and legal disputes.Kinder Morgan had set a deadline of May 31 for a resolution of the uncertainty over whether the expansion would be allowed to go ahead.Steve Kean, Kinder Morgan’s chief executive, said he was pleased that the company and the government “were able to reach agreement on a transaction that benefits the people of Canada”, oil exporters and shareholders.He added: “The outcome reached represents the best opportunity to complete TMEP [Trans Mountain Expansion Project] and thereby realize the great economic benefits promised by that project.”
2;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2018-05-17T17:08:33Z;Corporate tax arbitrage: masters limited;2018 will be a year some companies decided to pay more in taxes;MLP RIP. 2018 should be remembered as the year a small but high-profile set of companies decided that paying more in taxes was the smart thing to do for shareholders. On Tuesday, three energy infrastructure companies — Williams, Enbridge and Cheniere — each announced multi-billon dollar simplification mergers around their master limited partnership (MLP) subsidiaries. Mind-bending corporate structures had been justified for years around onerous corporate taxes. But Trump tax cuts, an esoteric regulatory ruling and other accumulating problems for MLPs suddenly have made simple corporate forms the way to appeal to investors.MLPs perhaps were the ideal security just after the financial crisis. By owing no corporate tax, MLPs paid big dividends in an era of low interest rates. MLPs then had low cost of capital and could issue equity to fund the growth of oil and gas pipelines to exploit the shale gas boom. Between 2009 and 2014, the benchmark Alerian MLP index appreciated, on a total return basis, 257 per cent. But since then, the index is down more than a quarter. The collapse in commodity prices was the first trigger. However, investors figured out that MLP parent companies were siphoning off too much of the profit for themselves. The most famous MLP family, Kinder Morgan, collapsed its companies into a single corporation in 2014, leading to a string of rivals switching to the traditional corporate taxpaying form. The final straw for the companies converting on Thursday, however, was a March regulatory ruling that closed a loophole that had allowed MLPs to recover payments on taxes  they were not quite paying.Similar restructurings have occurred at private equity firms such as KKR who decided it was worth paying corporate taxes — at the lowered 21 per cent rate — to appeal to mutual funds wary of complex partnership structures. Companies are not the only beneficiaries. Those making business decisions less driven by tax arbitrage benefit the broader economy.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

It will vote on the matter on May 9.Kinder Morgan is among several pipeline companies that have been unnerved by grassroots protests against their projects. Opposition has already delayed its Mountain Expansion and TransCanada’s Keystone XL initiatives.Some campaigners have moved beyond conventional letter-writing, demonstrations and lawsuits. In 2016, a group of activists broke into pipeline flow stations in four states and shut off valves. “The tactics have changed and they’ve gone to an extreme level,” said Steve Kean, Kinder Morgan’s chief executive in early March.For the oil fund, this forms part of an increasingly familiar pattern, with rising pressure on oil companies from around the world to outline plans to cut emissions.“Around a decade ago we formulated our climate change expectations to the companies we are invested in. With our support for this proposal, we emphasise that our expectations also cover methane emissions”, says chief corporate governance officer Carine Smith Ihenacho.
4;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2017-11-18T05:02:40Z;It’s a case of buyer take note with Brookfield’s Bermuda vehicle;John Dizard examines the group’s investment in North American natural gas transmission;How about an investment vehicle sponsored in ultra-safe Canada with a dividend yield close to 4 per cent, which has appreciated 38 per cent in the past year? You would have the assurance that it is big ($17bn in market cap), and dedicated to the incredibly good, if flexibly defined, universe of infrastructure investing.Too good to be true? Yet there is Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP, established by Brookfield Asset Management of Toronto to “own and operate certain infrastructure assets on a global basis”. It actually lives in Bermuda, and is managed under a service agreement by the parent’s people. According to BIP’s own disclosure: “Our partnership and the Holding LP do not have any employees”.There is a certain ambiguity in Brookfield’s description of BIP. Is BIP an operating company? Or is it more like the US public utility holding companies that deflated or collapsed after the 1929 market crash? Those were multi-layered, leveraged structures that were stigmatised in the US, and became deleveraged and de-layered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.In case you think there might be some resemblance, BIP’s SEC 20-F filing for 2016 discloses that “we may be subject to the risks commonly associated with a separation of economic interest from control or the incurrence of debt at multiple levels within an organisational structure”. Also, the parent “may use its control rights in a manner that conflicts with the economic interests of our other unit holders”. Additionally, there are risks from “non-arms-length transactions”, and “an incentive to leverage our company and investments”.Also, Brookfield, BIP’s parent, is the successor company of Edper Enterprises, the highest-flying Canadian company of the 1980s. Edper was widely described as having “crashed” in 1993, but while its investors lost billions when its leveraged holding company structure imploded, it was never liquidated. Instead, Jack Cockwell, the genius accountant behind Edper, took control of his employer with his friends and colleagues and ultimately recreated it as Brookfield.There is also disclosure by BIP about how Bermuda’s Limited Partnership Act “does not impose fiduciary duties on a general partner of a limited partnership in the same manner that certain corporate statutes, such as the Canada Business Corporations Act impose fiduciary duties on directors of a corporation”.Let’s look at one BIP asset, the NGPL gas pipeline.In BIP’s SEC reports, NGPL is described as “North American natural gas transmission operation”. BIP, however, does not operate the pipeline. Kinder Morgan, the other 50 per cent holder, runs it. At the end of 2016, Brookfield carried NGPL on its books at an $806m valuation.Interestingly, Kinder Morgan carried NGPL at $475m, even though an operator might arguably have a more detailed understanding of the pipeline’s prospects.NGPL has not always been a happy asset. Kinder and BIP first bought into the pipeline in 2009. They had to deal with not only the increased importance of the north-east US as a gas-producing region, but with an investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that resulted in decreases in NGPL’s allowed earnings and even refunds to users.After the FERC’s rulings, and in the face of the challenging interstate gas transport market, Kinder wrote NGPL down to zero on its books.Brookfield did not take as large a writedown. During the hard times that followed FERC and the eastern US gas boom, the partners sold a majority position in NGPL to a Canadian investor group, Myria Holdings. They bought back Myria’s stake in December 2015. Then NGPL required more capital infusions for “growth capex”, and to ensure the pipeline’s financial viability.Brookfield AM’s initial response to my questions about BIP’s valuation of NGPL was that BIP “reports under IFRS [accounting standards] and therefore carries its PP & E [such as NGPL] at fair value, whereas Kinder Morgan applies US GAAP, which requires cost accounting”. It adds that Kinder is prohibited from reversing any impairment charges it previously recorded on its initial 20 per cent interest (currently held at nil value).Using their accounting methodology, Brookfield says that it is carrying NGPL at an EV/ebitda (enterprise to cash flow) valuation of about 10x on a last-12-months basis, which they assert is conservative, given how comparable US pipeline companies trade.However, NGPL has had more challenges in the past years than most US pipeline companies.Also, US pipeline companies, mostly master limited partnerships, are under US law, which is more restrictive than the Bermudian law governing BIP.In a call to Sam Pollock, the chief executive of BIP, and other BIP officers, I was told by chief financial officer Bahir Manios that “Sam is our chief decision-making officer. He makes the assessment about how we figure what to do with this business and so we have to follow disclosure accordingly.” For Mr Pollock, “from an operating perspective, we saw through the trough in 2015 . . . we had a lot of confidence. The short answer is that we didn’t agree with their [Kinder’s] view of value.”There are short sellers who have taken an interest in Brookfield and BIP over the years. Shorting BIP looks dicey. The dividend creates a negative cost of carry for short selling. The shares have been in a long upward trend, with no negative trigger event on the horizon.Use your own judgment.
5;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2017-07-19T21:03:00Z;Kinder Morgan looks to reverse dividend cut with 60% boost next year;;Kinder Morgan, the US oil and gas pipelines group, has said it expects to increase its dividend 60 per cent next year, to be followed by 25 per cent annual average increases in 2019-20, as it begins to reverse the 75 per cent cut it announced in 2015.It has also said it plans to buy back $2bn worth of its own shares, equivalent to about 5 per cent of its equity.The company said the plans reflected “substantial balance sheet improvement”.The next dividend payment will be 12.5 cents per share for the quarter, for shareholders on the register at the close of business on July 31. That is the same as the payment it has been making every quarter since the cut was announced in December 2015.The company said on Wednesday it planned to start significant increases next year, however, with a payout averaging 20 cents per quarter next year, 25 cents per quarter in 2019, and 31.25 cents per quarter in 2020.The last quarterly payment before the 2015 dividend cut was $0.51.Rich Kinder, executive chairman, said:“We are pleased to fulfill our pledge to return value to shareholders through this combination of an attractive and growing dividend as well as a sizable share repurchase program. In essence, we expect to return substantially all of our operating cash flow in excess of growth capital needs to our shareholders through increasing the dividend and repurchasing shares, while maintaining robust coverage of the dividend.”He added that the plans followed the successful initial public offering of Kinder Morgan’s Canadian business, which along with new joint ventures had contributed to a $5.8 billion net debt reduction since the end of the third quarter of 2015.Kinder Morgan’s shares have lost 54 per cent of their value since the start of 2015.
6;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2016-11-29T22:39:55Z;Trudeau approves two crude pipeline projects;;Two important pipeline projects for exporting crude from Alberta’s oil sands have been approved by the Canadian government, but a third has been rejected, in a compromise decision intended to create 22,000 new jobs while avoiding the most serious environmental risks.The rulings are good news for Kinder Morgan of the US, which has been given permission to add an extra pipeline along the route of its existing Trans Mountain system from Alberta to the port of Vancouver, but more mixed for Enbridge of Canada.The proposed upgrade of Line 3, an Enbridge pipeline running from Alberta into the US, has been approved, but the company’s planned Northern Gateway route to Kitimat on the coast of British Columbia has been blocked.Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, announced the decisions at a press conference in Ottawa. He said the C$6.8bn Trans Mountain expansion would create 15,000 new jobs during construction while the C$4.8bn Canadian section of the line 3 replacement would create 7,000.The decisions are also good news for companies operating in the oil sands: a shortage of pipeline export capacity out of Alberta had been starting to emerge as a constraint on output growth, and the new routes will make more production viable.
7;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2016-09-06T13:23:28Z;Enbridge to buy Spectra in $28bn pipeline deal;Merger of Canadian and US groups will create largest North American energy infrastructure company;Enbridge of Canada and Spectra Energy of the US have agreed a deal to create the largest oil and gas pipeline group in North America, with an enterprise value of $127bn, in the latest of a wave of deals sweeping through the industry.The deal comes as the slowdown in the North American oil and gas industry caused by the slump in prices has raised concerns about the growth prospects of pipeline operators.The all-share transaction values Spectra at about $28bn, or $40.33 per share, based on the closing prices on Friday evening. That valuation is at an 11.5 per cent premium to Spectra’s share price on Friday. The news was received favourably in the stock market, with Spectra’s shares up 13.4 per cent to $41 and Enbridge’s 5.1 per cent higher at $43.06 at the close of trade on Tuesday in New York.The deal would give Enbridge shareholders 57 per cent and Spectra shareholders 43 per cent of the merged group. It is scheduled to close in the first quarter of next year.Enbridge operates about 33,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines and 79 liquids terminals in Canada and the US. Spectra specialises in gas, with about 88,000 miles of pipelines and storage capacity of 300bn cubic feet.A person familiar with the deal said the companies had agreed a “customary” break-up fee — which is usually around 3 per cent of the transaction’s value.The person added that given little customer overlap between the companies — Enbridge services predominantly heavy industry companies, while Spectra provides gas to US utilities — regulatory risks were limited.In the year ended June, the two companies would have generated combined revenues of $31bn and earnings before interest and tax of $4.4bn.The deal is expected to generate ultimate cost savings of $415m a year from cost cuts, and a further $200m a year in tax benefits.Al Monaco, chief executive of Calgary-based Enbridge, said in a statement that the deal would be “transformational” for both companies, giving them “unmatched scale, diversity and financial flexibility with multiple platforms for organic growth”.He added that the merged group would have $20bn of projects under construction and another $37bn under development, allowing Enbridge to extend its planned annual dividend growth of 10 to 12 per cent out to 2024. It is proposing a 15 per cent increase in the payout next year.Greg Ebel, Spectra’s chief executive, said the strength of the combined company would “support a large capital programme to fund the continued development of Spectra Energy’s existing, pre-eminent project inventory”, as well as allowing the combined company to compete for the most attractive growth projects.Mr Monaco is intended to remain chief executive and president of the merged company, which will be called Enbridge and keep its headquarters in Calgary. Mr Ebel is to be non-executive chairman.The agreed deal follows a couple of years in which the pipeline business has been the most active sector of the North American oil and gas industry for merger and acquisition activity.Last year, MPLXbought MarkWest for $17.4bn including debt, and Energy Transfer Partners bought its affiliate Regency Energy Partners for $17bn.Williams agreed a deal to be bought by Energy Transfer Equity, which fell through, and subsequently rebuffed a takeover approach from Enterprise Products Partners.The slide in oil prices that began two years ago has raised investors’ fears that pipeline operators, which typically distribute a high proportion of their revenues to investors, may not be able to sustain their payouts. Kinder Morgan, the largest US pipeline company, cut its dividend last year.Enbridge and Spectra said the merged company would be able to deliver its dividend growth while maintaining a “conservative” payout of 50 to 60 per cent of available cash flow from operations.Mr Monaco said the deal would “preserve and enhance our shareholder value proposition, which centres on delivering consistent growth with a low-risk business model”.Credit Suisse and RBC Capital Markets were the financial advisers to Enbridge while Sullivan & Cromwell and McCarthy Tetrault LP acted as legal advisers.BMO Capital Markets and Citi acted as financial advisers to Spectra while Wachtell, Lipton Rosen & Katz and Goodmans provided legal advice.
8;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Landscape shifts for pipeline operators;Once-staid US sector knocked by volatility and uncertainty over high dividend levels;For an industry that has a reputation for being safe and steady — and that has made predictability a central component of its pitch to investors — the US oil and gas pipelines sector has had an exciting couple of years. Kinder Morgan, the industry’s largest group, reconfigured its corporate structure radically in a $70bn deal in 2014, then cut its dividend 75 per cent last December. Energy Transfer Equity, another of the leaders in the sector, spent months pursuing its peer Williams, agreed a $38bn takeover in September last year, then quickly changed its mind and spent months trying to get out of the deal, finally succeeding in June after a court battle. While these events were playing out, the market valuations of companies in the sector plunged. Enterprise Products Partners, for example, dropped 50 per cent between September 2014 and February of this year. This year, valuations have been bouncing back. Kinder Morgan’s shares are up 69 per cent from their low point in January. The past two years, however, have highlighted some fundamental issues with the pipeline companies’ standard business model that remain largely the same as before the crash. The potential for future volatility, depending on oil and gas prices and interest rates, is still there. The traditional investment case for pipeline businesses presented them as analogous to toll road operators, charging production and trading companies to use their pipes. As a result, they face very little commodity price risk, it was argued, and can pay out a high proportion of their earnings in dividends. The appeal of those high dividends, particularly compelling at a time of low interest rates, was reinforced for many investors by the use of a tax advantaged structure called a Master Limited Partnership. The US shale oil and gas production boom of the past decade also created a need for additional pipeline infrastructure, meaning the pipeline operators could offer the prospect of growth as well as income. The crash in oil prices that began two years ago has punctured those assumptions. Matt Sallee, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, a fund management company that specialises in energy and invests in pipeline MLPs, says the slump in pipeline companies’ shares was in part a result of generalist portfolio managers selling all energy stocks indiscriminately. He acknowledges, though, that there are reasons why pipeline operators are affected by oil and gas prices, including credit risk in their customers. Oil and gas production companies that have gone bankrupt have attempted to drop some of their pipeline contracts, and in one landmark case in New York succeeded. Some pipeline companies have other sources of commodity price exposure, such as processing plants that sell the natural gas liquids they collect. Kinder Morgan sells carbon dioxide, used to squeeze extra production out of oilfields, which has become less valuable as the crude price has fallen. Net income for 2015 fell 10 per cent at Enterprise Products Partners and 70 per cent at Kinder Morgan, while Williams went from a $2.1bn profit to a $571m loss. Those weak results have called attention to a longer-term problem: the rate at which pipeline companies have been distributing cash. Kevin Kaiser, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management who has been raising concerns about MLPs since before the crash, argues that it is a widespread issue across the sector: cash distributions are unsustainably high. “There is this misunderstanding around that these companies are great cash cows,” he says. “If you look into the numbers, they aren’t.” There is this misunderstanding around that these companies are great cash cows. If you look into the numbers, they aren’tMany pipeline companies have capital spending that is higher than the cash they generate from operations. They have to sell shares and borrow money to finance their pay-outs. Energy Transfer Partners, for example, had capital spending of $9.1bn last year and paid out $3.7bn, but earned cash from operations of just $2.7bn. The gap was filled by share issues and borrowing. The equity issuance is typically linked to acquisitions that are expected to generate growth. As dealmaking for oil and gas assets overall has slowed since 2014, the US pipeline industry has remained active. Borrowings, too, are presented to investors as ways to finance growth. Launching two issues of senior notes to raise a total of $5.5bn last year, Energy Transfer Partners said that one of the purposes was “to fund growth capital expenditures”. If the companies are no longer growing, however, those justifications for increased debt and equity issuance become harder to maintain. Kinder Morgan’s dividend cut last year showed that expectations can be self-fulfilling. Investors’ fears that the dividend might be cut drove down the share price, which made raising equity financing more expensive, which meant the dividend had to be cut. High yields in the sector, including 6.8 per cent for Energy Transfer Equity and 10.4 per cent for Williams, suggest the market sees a significant risk that other companies will follow Kinder Morgan’s example. For now, the inflows of capital are still coming. US pipeline companies have raised $9bn from share sales so far in 2016, compared with $13.5bn in the whole of last year, according to Dealogic. Low interest rates continue to make the high-yielding shares and units look attractive to some investors. If they lose their access to financing, though, many companies would face difficulties maintaining their investment programmes, let alone paying their dividends. The supposedly staid pipeline industry could see yet more interesting times.
9;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2016-04-26T08:28:52Z;Husky Energy: shaggy dog story;More connections for the connected;"Every dog has its day. Canada-based Husky Energy, part of the sprawling empire of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, had one on Monday. It is to receive a $1.3bn cash-and-debt injection in return for a majority stake in several midstream oil assets — courtesy of fellow Li kennelmates Cheung Kong Infrastructure and Power Assets Holdings. They will take 16 and 49 per cent of the assets, respectively.Keeping it in the family does not stop the deal from being messy. Not only does Mr Li hold direct or indirect stakes in the three, but CKI also owns 39 per cent of PAH; an offer to buy the rest was rebuffed last year. Although the buyers have other joint projects, this new overlap creates awkward duplication for CKI shareholders. (It also contrasts with last year’s deal that unravelled Mr Li’s flagships Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa.)The acquisition will suck nearly $1bn out of PAH, between its stake in the Husky assets and capital expenditure commitments. Small relative to the company’s $7.5bn net cash pile at the end of 2015, but the deal terms are not compelling. The target assets’ value has been set at nearly 15 times Husky’s 2016 target for their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Similar midstream pipeline companies such as US-listed Kinder Morgan trade on 11 times. Husky itself, an integrated player, is on 10. Oil transmission is often more stable than production, but the share performance of big US pipeline groups shows this is not always so.That is lucky for Mr Li, who owns more of Husky, which benefits from the cash injection, than he does of the other two. Minorities in CKI and PAH, who will not get to vote on the deal because the size falls below necessary thresholds, may disagree. Minorities may also take issue with Husky’s assertion that it “set a high bar” in its search for partners that shared its objectives. It may have done so, but that Husky’s kennelmates leapt over it with such alacrity is disappointing.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
10;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2016-03-08T22:42:06Z;Pipeline investors shaken by bankruptcy ruling;US judge allows Sabine Oil & Gas to abandon contracts;A judge has allowed a US oil and gas company to abandon pipeline contracts while in bankruptcy, in a first-of-its-kind decision that has rattled investors in energy infrastructure.Sabine Oil & Gas, a shale energy producer under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, sought permission to break contracts with two pipeline companies so it could pursue better deals and save as much as $115m.On Tuesday a judge ruled in its favour. “The court defers to the business judgment of the debtors to reject the agreements,” Judge Shelley Chapman said at a hearing in US bankruptcy court in Manhattan.The decision has important implications for the midstream energy sector, which gathers, processes, transports and stores oil and gas. Income-hungry investors had flocked to midstream companies on the belief that their generous payouts were backed by long-term, immutable contracts with customers.As they suffer low gas and oil prices, bankrupt producers are challenging these contracts in court. Some midstream companies have warned of “counterparty risk” in reference to their less creditworthy customers.After the ruling, investors dumped shares and units of pipeline companies and partnerships, with Kinder Morgan down 5.3 per cent, Plains All American off 5.9 per cent and Williams Companies dropping 9.4 per cent.However, it would be hard to draw broad precedents from any single case, lawyers and analysts said.“While this is an important decision, it’s one of those decisions that is state specific, fact specific and play specific,” said David Karp, partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel, a law firm, who is not involved with the case. “There are many other agreements out there that this decision will not cover.”Lawyers for Sabine had argued in a court filing that one of the pipeline companies was “searching for a loophole to allow midstream gatherers, unlike all other participants in the oil and gas industry, to become immune to industry-wide credit risk under the conditions that have led to this and other oil and gas bankruptcies.”Haynes and Boone, a law firm, said 48 North American oil and gas producers filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and more will follow this year.In a case in Delaware bankruptcy court, producer Quicksilver Resources has sought to reject gas-gathering contracts with Crestwood Midstream Partners. Two trade groups have intervened, warning that a ruling in Quicksilver’s favour could disrupt the midstream industry.Sabine filed for bankruptcy protection last July with $2.9bn in debt. In September it filed a motion to reject gathering contracts with the two companies, calling them “unnecessarily burdensome” as it seeks to reorganise.Two of the contracts committed Sabine to deliver Texas gas and condensate to a unit of New York-listed Cheniere Energy or pay a penalty. The contracts, signed months before the oil market crash in January 2014, were supposed to last a decade. Cheniere had no immediate comment.Sabine now seeks to use a different gatherer that will not demand minimum volumes, according to a court filing. The pipeline companies have objected, arguing that the contracts “run with the land” that Sabine has been drilling and cannot be torn up in bankruptcy.Judge Chapman disagreed, but issued a non-binding ruling on that question for procedural reasons.Robert Burns, a lawyer at Bracewell who represents the Cheniere subsidiary, acknowledged efforts were under way to resolve the dispute through commercial avenues. “A redoubling of those efforts is in order,” he told the judge.
11;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Chevron slashes spending plans (again);;Chevron, the US oil and gas group, has lowered its capital spending plans for 2017 once again, in a sign that it expects the downturn in global crude prices to continue despite the recent rally.The company, which announced in December plans to cut its spending on production and exploration for this year by 24 per cent to $26.6bn, said on Tuesday that it will continue to cut back on spending next year.It is now targeting $17bn-$22bn in capital expenditure for 2017, down from the $20bn-$24bn range it forecast when it issued third quarter earnings back in October.John Watson, Chevron’s chairman and chief executive officer, said:We’re completing major projects that have been under construction for several years. This enables us to grow production and reduce spending at the same time, which should improve our net cash flow significantly.Like other energy companies around the world, Chevron has been hard hit by the savage 72 per cent drop in crude prices over the past 19 months. Revenue last year tumbled by more than a third to $129bn, while net income collapsed by 75 per cent to $4.8bn.And while smaller energy companies – such as Kinder Morgan – has resorted to cutting dividends, Chevron and other Big Oil companies have largely resisted such a move, preferring instead to cut investments, jobs, sell assets or borrow to cover the payouts.Mr Watson said on Tuesday that maintaining dividend growth and a strong balance sheet are the Chevron’s financial priorities at the moment and noted the company’s record of 28 consecutive years of dividend increases.He said:Industry conditions are tough right now, with low oil and natural gas prices.

12;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2016-03-03T14:41:25Z;Oil crash takes heavy toll on midstream energy companies;Pipeline operators, once seen as steady revenue earners, grapple with tumbling prices;This week the Cushing Marketlink pipeline, a central artery in the North American oil market, dropped its already-discounted rate for shipping light crude by a further 10 per cent to $2.50 a barrel.But this wasn’t the real bargain. As the pipeline lowered the official rate, shippers were subletting space on Marketlink for just $0.50 a barrel, industry executives say.The cheap capacity is evidence of a reckoning taking hold among midstream energy companies, which move, store and process oil and gas. Once advertised to investors as toll collectors, safe from the ups and downs of commodity prices, they are instead strained by the energy crash.The Alerian MLP index, a basket of 49 energy logistics companies, has declined by half since August 2014 as investors take fright at the prospect of falling payouts from the master limited partnerships (MLPs) that dominate the business. The shock prompted an Evercore ISI analyst to invoke psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s five stages of grief, with MLP investors “teetering somewhere between ‘depression’ and ‘acceptance’”.Amid mounting debt loads and repudiation by equity markets, pipeline companies have been cutting distributions or threatening to. Kinder Morgan, the largest, has slashed its dividend by 75 per cent.As drillers tapped shale reserves in states such as North Dakota, Texas and Pennsylvania, pipeline companies invested heavily to bring oil and gas to market. With oil now down to about $35 a barrel, US crude production has gone in reverse, meaning fewer barrels to move. Traders have been shoving excess oil into storage tanks, also diminishing volumes on some pipelines.TransCanada opened the $2.3bn Marketlink pipeline in 2014, linking the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma to the Texas coast hundreds of miles south.Today, Marketlink is only about 60 per cent full, according to Genscape, an energy intelligence service. TransCanada last month warned of lower earnings in its liquids business as some contracts to use Marketlink expire.Greg Armstrong, chief executive of Plains All American, a big oil pipeline company, compares the situation with “an overbuilt real estate market” in which landlords compete for business with tenants who sublet space. “We believe the massive pipeline infrastructure expansion in crude oil is over for a while,” he told the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston last week.Shippers often sign “take-or-pay” pipeline contracts, which compel them to send agreed volumes or pay a penalty. As damage spreads in the oil industry, these are proving vulnerable.On the BridgeTex crude oil pipeline in Texas, co-owned by Plains and Magellan Midstream Partners, the companies have told analysts one customer will probably fail to meet its commitments. “We’ve assumed that they’re going to default,” Aaron Milford, Magellan chief financial officer, said on a conference call last month.If a production company goes bankrupt and seeks to abandon its pipeline contracts, the legal position is still unclear. A Delaware court on Friday is scheduled to hear a motion by Quicksilver Resources, a producer in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, to reject gas gathering contracts with Crestwood Midstream Partners. Two trade groups have sought to intervene, warning a ruling in Quicksilver’s favour could “disrupt the foundational principles underpinning the midstream industry”.“The big problem is these contracts have not yet been tested in prior cycles. They are being tested for the first time,” says Trey Wood, a lawyer at Bracewell, a Houston-based firm, who is not involved in the case.The structure of MLPs enables them to distribute most of their cash flow, endearing them to small investors seeking income amid depressed interest rates. During the growth years they funded expansion by raising capital — and investors were happy to oblige.Now, “most midstream companies are finding it more difficult or even impossible to access the debt and equity markets”, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services says. MLPs, writes S&P analyst Michael Grande, will need to reduce capital spending, find new sources of financing, sell assets or cut distributions.After their equity prices plunged, many midstream names sport double-digit yields. Some investors, apparently well into the acceptance stage, contend it is time to own them.“The fundamental outlook is still intact for pipeline companies,” says Matt Sallee, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, which has about $12bn invested in energy. “It’s not as strong as it was two years ago, and there are a couple of unique challenges,” namely their ability to raise capital and counterparty risks, he adds.Additional reporting by Ed Crooks

Rich Kinder, the company’s chairman, is its majority stakeholder with an 11 per cent stake.Berkshire owned 26.5m shares worth about $395.9m at the end of December, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late on Tuesday. Berkshire owns and operates a utility, and pipelines are a business that Mr Buffett is said to understand well.Mr Buffett’s blessing can buoy shares in a company, but the octogenarian wasn’t the only high-profile investor to have disclosed a stake in Kinder Morgan. David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management bought 9.4m shares at $140.9m in the fourth quarter, a filing late last week showed.Houston-based Kinder has been hit by the protracted swoon in crude that’s sent prices down more than 70 per cent over the last 18 months. Kinder’s profits fell 70 per cent last year, forcing the company to cut its dividend in December.Kinder shares have declined nearly 60 per cent since the start of 2015.
14;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2016-02-12T19:26:21Z;US stocks rally as financials race higher;;US stocks posted big gains on Friday after five-straight days of selling as financial shares leaped.Bank stocks led the way into the green on the day after JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon bought $26m worth of the big US bank’s stock and Deutsche Bank confirmed plans to buy back several billion dollars in debt — both shows of confidence amid a rout for lenders this year.The S&P 500 banks group soared 5.3 per cent, although it remains down 19 per cent for the year. JPMorgan tacked on 7.3 per cent, Bank of America rallied 5.6 per cent and Citigroup climbed 6 per cent.Traders also scooped up energy shares as the price of oil spiked more than 10 per cent. Among the gainers was Kinder Morgan, a large energy pipeline operator, which climbed 5.6 per cent.On the other end of the spectrum, traders trimmed bets on haven plays. Gold fell 0.63 per cent, eating into the yellow metal’s gains for the week. Meanwhile, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose 8.7 basis points to 1.75 per cent.

It now expects to spend $6.4bn, down from a planned $7.7bn.ConocoPhillips shares tumbled 4.3 per cent on the news in pre-market trading.Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive officer, said:While we don’t know how far commodity prices will fall, or the duration of the downturn, we believe it’s prudent to plan for lower prices for a longer period of time. The actions we have announced will improve net cash flow by $4.4 billion in 2016.The decision to reduce the dividend was a difficult one. The dividend has been, and will continue to be, a top priority. We still intend to provide a competitive dividend, while significantly lowering the breakeven price for the company and substantially reducing the level of borrowing in 2016. Our actions also position us to deliver strong absolute and relative performance as prices recover.Shares in the big US oil companies have come under pressure in the run-up to the fourth quarter earnings season amid fears that they would cut their dividends.And while smaller energy companies – such as Kinder Morgan – has cut payout, Big Oil has largely resisted such a move, preferring instead to cut investments, jobs, sell assets or borrow to cover dividend paymentsJust this week Exxon Mobil and BP have both vowed to protect their payout policy despite oil prices having falling more than 70 per cent from their mid-2014 highs.The dividend move by ConocoPhillips comes as the company reported a net loss of $3.45bn for the last three months of last year. The loss included $2.7bn charge for asset writedowns.Sales tumbled 42 per cent to $11.8bn for the quarter.Having said just three months ago that it expects production to grow in 2016 through a ramp up of oil sands production in Canada and startup projects in Alaska, ConocoPhillips said on Thursday that it now expects production to be “essentially flat” this year.Earlier this week, Standard & Poor’s ConocoPhillips on watch for a possible downgrade within 90 days. S&P said this would depend on the company’s ability to achieve cost savings and asset sales, and to cut capital spending without hurting production rates.

Sales slid 4.6 per cent to $566.2m. Analysts had forecast earnings of 49 cents a share, on sales of $554.6m.Alongside its results, Xilinx also indicated a change in control provision — which allows for some protections for employees in the event of a change in ownership — for its key executives, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.“We believe the change in control provision significantly raises the probability of Xilinx being acquired by another company,” said Ambrish Srivastava, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “The last time we saw such a provision in our coverage was by Xilinx’s rival Altera, which ended up getting acquired by Intel, for a significant premium.”He noted that Qualcomm and Tsinghua Holdings could be potential acquirers but that Qualcomm would be the more likely buyer and that such a deal could help it diversify away from handsets.The semiconductor industry has seen a wave of consolidation as companies try to boost growth and cut costs in the wake of weaker PC demand and increasing competition.Xilinx was upgraded to “outperform” from “market perform” by BMO Capital which raised the price target on the stock to $57 from $44. Xilinx shares advanced 9 per cent last year.Union Pacific fell 3.55 per cent to $71.00, after the railroad operator reported fourth-quarter results that missed analysts forecasts amid weakening freight demand.Net income fell to $1.1bn or $1.31 a share, compared with $1.4bn or $1.61 a share in the year ago period. Sales fell 15 per cent to $5.2bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.43 a share, on sales of $5.4bn.Shares in FireEye, which sells cyber security products, climbed after the company said it would pay $200m in cash to acquire iSight Partners. “This acquisition extends FireEye’s intelligence lead with an offering no one else in the industry can match,” chief executive David DeWalt said. By the close its shares were off 0.54 per cent at $14.79.A rally in crude prices sent the S&P 500 energy index 2.8 per cent higher.Kinder Morgan shares jumped 15.57 per cent to $13.88, even as the company said it had swung to a loss in the fourth quarter.Shares in Southwestern Energy jumped 19.24 per cent to $8.80, while Transocean shares climbed 7.05 per cent to $9.72.The rally in energy stocks helped US markets rebound on Thursday, following a tumultuous session the previous day, although they lost some of their gains in later trading.The S&P 500 was up 0.52 per cent to 1,868.99, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.74 per cent higher to 15,882.68.

17;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Cheniere Energy’s shipment turns US into gas exporter;Momentous step for US energy industry that is marred by poor LNG pricing amid oil rout;"The Energy Atlantic, a 290-metre tanker steaming slowly through the Gulf of Mexico, is about to make history. It is scheduled to arrive on Tuesday at Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas plant on the coast of Louisiana, to be loaded with the first cargo of LNG to be exported from the “lower 48” contiguous states of the US.The shipment is a momentous event for energy markets, marking the arrival of the US as a gas supplier to the world.The plunge in oil prices since the summer of 2014 has dragged down the value of LNG, which is often sold on crude-linked contracts, and damped the excitement over US exports. The economics of shipping gas from the US were compelling two years ago, but are now marginal. Deteriorating market conditions have put the brake on any new investments in US LNG.Even so, US LNG exports are likely to have a significant impact, holding down energy costs for consumers in Europe, Latin America and Asia. They will also provide tough competition for anyone hoping to build rival LNG plants, such as the proposed projects in east Africa, the west of Canada, or Russia. By the end of the decade, the US is likely to be the world’s third-largest exporter of LNG, after Qatar and Australia.Combined with the new supplies from Chevron’s huge Gorgon and Wheatstone projects in Australia, which are scheduled to come on stream this year, exports from the US are making it a buyers’ market for LNG.“There is an awful lot of LNG sloshing around the world at the moment, with even more to come,” says Frank Harris of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. “And that is putting downward pressure on prices.”A decade ago, this prospect seemed wildly unlikely. US gas production was in decline and by the 2010s the country was expected to be a large importer of LNG, not an exporter.The shale revolution, the result of advances in production techniques that made it possible to extract gas at commercially viable rates from previously unyielding rocks, meant that US production started rising again in 2006, and since 2011 it has been breaking new records every year.Charif Souki, Cheniere’s visionary founder who was ejected from the company at the end of last year, was one of the first to see the potential for LNG exports from the US. In 2010, he submitted the first application to regulators to convert the LNG import terminal that Cheniere had built at Sabine Pass, which was being barely used because US domestic gas production was so strong, into a liquefaction plant.Many in the industry were sceptical that the project could be made to work but the plan took a decisive step forward in October 2011 when Britain’s BG Group signed a 20-year contract to buy most of the production from Sabine Pass’s first “train”, as LNG production units are known. After that contract was signed, the trickle of proposals for similar projects turned into a flood.The US Department of Energy has received applications to export LNG for 54 projects. If they all went ahead, they would have the capacity to liquefy about 60 per cent of the entire gas production of the US.So far, however, just five plants have started construction: Cheniere’s Sabine Pass and its Corpus Christi project in Texas; Freeport LNG, also in Texas; Cameron LNG in Louisiana; and Cove Point LNG, on the east coast in Maryland.Those projects have been able to make progress because they were fast enough at signing up customers on long-term contracts that guarantee their revenues. Since the end of 2014 those customers, mostly utilities in Europe and Asia, have been reluctant to make any further commitments.The price of LNG delivered in north-east Asia, including Japan and South Korea, the world’s two largest markets, has fallen along with oil. It has dropped to about $6.65 per million British thermal units, just a third of its price of almost $19 per mBTU two years ago, according to Argus, the information service.At that price, with benchmark US gas at about $2.40 per mBTU, plus liquefaction costs of $3 to $3.50 per mBTU, plus transport at about $2 per mBTU, LNG from Louisiana or Texas does not look commercially attractive.Similar calculations apply in Europe. Benchmark UK National Balancing Point gas has dropped by almost a half since 2013 to about $5.20 per mBTU, meaning that LNG exports from the US to Britain are unlikely to cover all of their costs.Since 2013, most of the new LNG projects launched worldwide have been in the US. However, the deteriorating economics make it unlikely that any new plants will be approved for a while.The plants that have already started construction, though, are highly unlikely to be stopped. This is because the companies buying LNG from one of these plants have typically made firm commitments for 20 years under which they have to pay the charges they have promised, even if they do not use the capacity.The US LNG projects will add to global oversupply. Bernstein Research has estimated that the world’s liquefaction capacity will in the next three years rise by 90m tonnes per annum, which is about 35 per cent of present demand.Nikos Tsafos of Enalytica, a research company, says US LNG should help hold gas prices down for a few years at least.When the global oversupply is finally absorbed by rising demand, the next wave of plants in the US, including projects backed by ExxonMobil and Kinder Morgan, will be poised to benefit.There are other promising potential new sources of LNG in the world, including the projects to develop large gas discoveries off the coast of Mozambique.But those are relatively unknown quantities compared to the familiar patterns of development in Texas and Louisiana.“If those other projects don’t happen, we can always resort to the US,” says Mr Tsafos.For Charif Souki, the founder and former chief executive of Cheniere Energy who was ousted by the board last month, the first shipment of LNG from Sabine Pass will be a source of mixed emotions.“I’m very proud of the group of people we put together,” he says from Aspen, Colorado, where he has been skiing. “After the first cargo goes, I’ll say it was a nice story.”It will also be a signal that it is time for him to move on. He is still involved with Cheniere: for the time being he has a seat on the board, and will be attending meetings, and he is also a shareholder. “I am curious to know where they will take the company,” he says. But he is also starting to think about what comes next.The board’s decision to remove him was understandable, he says, after directors rejected his plans for ambitious expansion, including broadening the company’s scope beyond LNG. His ejection was supported by Carl Icahn, the activist investor who revealed a stake in Cheniere last August and now controls 13.8 per cent.“The board said ‘In this set of circumstances, we don’t think you’re the right person to lead the company’, and I don’t necessarily disagree with that,” says Mr Souki.“If they want to consolidate on seven trains [LNG production units], I don’t want to manage the company.”The oil and gas industry today, with crude below $35 per barrel, offers “the most fantastic opportunities”, he adds.“Especially in today’s fragmented industry, there is so much opportunity, and I would have found it extremely frustrating to sit on the sidelines while running a boring utility-style company.”In the spring Mr Souki plans to decide how he will take advantage of those opportunities. For now, he says, he will be taking advantage of this winter’s excellent snow conditions."

The sector led the way higher on Wednesday as oil prices jumped.The S&P 500 energy sector zipped higher by 1.8 per cent in morning trading, easily out-pacing the broader US markets, which were up 0.7 per cent.The gains for the sector, which has shed almost a quarter of its value this year, come on the back of a rally in crude oil prices.US crude oil jumped 2.4 per cent, while Brent crude tacked on 2.1 per cent. The move came as traders took a bullish stance ahead of the closely-watched US crude oil inventory report, which is due out at 10:30am ET.Among the gainers on Wednesday was Kinder Morgan, the biggest North American energy infrastructure company, which roared higher by 4.2 per cent. Marathon Oil, an oil exploration and production company, tacked on 3.8 per cent. ExxonMobil and Chevron, both oil integrated energy giants, added more than 1 per cent each.

Shares of the biggest North American energy infrastructure operator have declined 62.2 per cent for the year.Murphy Oil, an oil exploration and production company, dropped 1.4 per cent to $22.26.The ongoing pressure on the price of oil and other commodities has weighed heavily on profits across the energy sector.Brent crude, the international standard, fell 4.5 per cent to $37.76 a barrel, the lowest level since December 2008, while US crude oil skidded as much as 3.1 per cent before paring back gains to end the day 1.8 per cent higher at $36.25.Elsewhere, DuPont and Dow Chemical weighed heavily on the materials sector.The duo unveiled a $130bn merger last week, but have seen their shares gyrate ever since. DuPont dropped 3.6 per cent to $67.92 and Dow slid 3.9 per cent to $51.29.Shares of Newell Rubbermaid fell 6.9 per cent to $42.15 after the company confirmed plans to buy Jarden for $20.2bn including debt.The tie-up will create a $16bn consumer products company with brands that run the gamut from Sharpie markers to Crock-Pots. Jarden shares climbed 2.7 per cent to $54.08.Kimberly-Clark, the maker of personal care products such as Kleenex tissues, was upgraded from “neutral” to “buy” at Goldman Sachs, and was added to the investment bank’s conviction buy list.Goldman said it expects the company’s net sales growth to turn positive in 2016 after dipping this year. It also expects “cost relief” for pulp, a key input. The company’s stock rose 2.9 per cent to $122.65. It is up 6.2 per cent for 2015.Hormel Foods slipped as much as 1 per cent after Deutsche Bank cut the packaged foods company from “buy” to “hold”.Deutsche said it continues to “view Hormel’s fundamentals as favourable” but warned its “valuation is becoming increasingly difficult to justify”. Deutsche specifically cited “modest” risks, such as a potential recurrence of avian flu, a disease that wreaked havoc among poultry producers earlier this year.By close of trading, the shares pared back losses to trade 0.8 per cent higher at $77.98, pushing the company’s year-to-date rally to 49.7 per cent.Walt Disney was one of the top performers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, climbing 1.2 per cent $109.38. Disney’s much-awaited Star Wars: The Force Awakens blockbuster is due to be released in theatres later this week.Nine of the 10 S&P 500 sectors were stronger on the day, led by telecommunications and consumer staples, both seen as defensive plays.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 2,021.94, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 17,368.50 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4 per cent to 4,952.23.

Sales climbed 22 per cent to $1.31bn, matching Wall Street estimates.Earnings per share came in at 62 cents, excluding certain items, topping forecasts by two cents.Adobe also pointed to solid gains in its cloud service, in which it makes some of its hallmark software, such as the photo-editing package Photoshop, available on a subscription basis online.Adobe’s shares climbed 2.7 per cent on Friday to $91.42. The stock is up 25.8 per cent for the year.Shares in JetBlue Airways fell nearly 8 per cent to $23.43 after the low-cost carrier said it expected passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), a key industry metric that measures airlines’ sales relative to its capacity, to fall by between 2 and 3 per cent in the fourth quarter.Elsewhere, shares of DuPont and Dow Chemical slumped after the chemical giants revealed plans to merge in a $130bn deal that will be followed by a three-way split. The shares of both companies had climbed earlier in the week on reports that outlined the brushstrokes of the tie-up.After mergers are announced shares often pull back as investors gauge the regulatory and other risks that could prevent the deal from closing. DuPont fell 4.7 per cent to $71.02, while Dow dropped 2.8 per cent to $53.38.Energy shares took a thrashing on Friday as the price of crude oil continued sliding. US crude oil dropped 1.7 per cent to $36.14 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, sold off by 2.5 per cent to $38.73 a barrel.After an Opec meeting last week ended in chaos, hopes were dashed that a glut of supply will start to ease any time soon. This is bad news for energy companies, especially those that have aggressively funded themselves using debt.The S&P 500 energy sector dropped 3.4 per cent on Friday, leading the markets lower. Large names in the sector fell sharply. For instance, Kinder Morgan, the pipeline operator, dropped 2 per cent to $16.67. Baker Hughes, an oilfield services company, swooned by 8.3 per cent to $47.40.The financial sector was another laggard. Investment banks declined as a small high-yield bond fund halted redemptions, sparking wider concerns about the credit market. Goldman Sachs dropped 3.1 per cent to $176.43, while Morgan Stanley dipped 4.0 per cent to $32.08.The S&P 500 dropped 1.9 per cent to 2,012.37, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.8 per cent to 17,265 and the Nasdaq Composite sold off by 2.2 per cent to 4,933.In a sign of the tumult on Wall Street, the CBOE’s VIX index, a measure of expected S&P 500 volatility over the next 30 days, shot up 11.7 per cent to 21.6. Meanwhile, traders took shelter in safe-haven asset classes, including Treasury bonds.

21;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Kinder Morgan: plus ça change;Dividend cut of 75% that company says puts shareholders first;“By shareholders, for shareholders proudly” proclaim recent Kinder Morgan investor presentations. Even after slashing its dividend by 75 per cent late on Monday, the energy pipeline pioneer maintains it is still doing right by its investors. So-called “midstream” companies like Kinder Morgan, which build and operate thousands of miles of pipelines, like to think of themselves as “toll collectors”, immune from cratering oil and natural gas prices.Even so, Kinder Morgan shares have somehow sunk nearly 70 per cent since the summer. Part of that correction may be down to misconceptions about the linkage between commodities prices and ancillary businesses. Yet the toll collection analogy belies the tricky capital structure arbitrage of pipeline companies, which has broadly unravelled alongside energy prices.For some time, Kinder’s cash flow was more or less enough to cover its obligations. If there was a shortfall, it could always rely upon the capital markets for a top-up.Two things have changed. Markets have become less receptive to such fundraisings. And cash flow is no longer nearly sufficient. For 2016, Moody’s projects that Kinder will earn $5.5bn in cash flow from operations but capital and debt repayments add up to $6.5bn. Using $3.3bn saved from the dividend cut and undrawn bank facilities means it can now fund its obligations without requiring external financing.That is a relief, since its recent share price swoon means that selling equity would be wildly dilutive, and with its credit rating just above junk status, issuing debt is equally precarious.The company will redirect cash flow to continue its growth, about which it remains optimistic. More than half of its cash flow comes from the transport of natural gas, and gas production continues to expand.Kinder’s actions are effectively a press of the reset button (something to monitor is whether gas producers try to do likewise, and renegotiate supply contracts with pipeline firms). Based on its current share price and reduced dividend, its shares now yield a reasonable 3 per cent — in its heyday, that figure would have been 4 to 5 per cent. Perhaps Kinder reasonably believes its evasive action to be shareholder friendly. But another slide in its deck — “promises made, promises kept” — will have to be discarded.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
22;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2015-12-08T23:47:16Z;Kinder Morgan slashes dividend by 75%;Move will help pipeline operator use cash for investment in expansion;Kinder Morgan, the largest operator of gas and oil pipelines in North America, has slashed its dividend by 75 per cent, just four days after warning that its payout was under review.The heavily indebted company said its board had approved the move to enable it to use cash for investment in expansion, to avoid the need to issue more shares “for the foreseeable future”, and to maintain a “solid” investment grade credit rating.The announcement, which came after the market closed, sent Kinder Morgan’s shares down a further 7 per cent in after-hours trading, following a 30 per cent decline in the past five days. The company argued that issuing more shares to fund its growth as it has done in recent years was no longer attractive after their fall in value.Rich Kinder, founder and executive chairman, said in a statement that the board had “evaluated numerous options, including significant asset sales”, but had decided that those options would have been uneconomic for investors.The dividend cut is a blow to shareholders who had been accustomed to a high rate of dividend payments from Kinder Morgan.As recently as October, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 16 per cent from the previous quarter, and indicated it expected further growth of 6-10 per cent in 2016. Mr Kinder said the payout had “substantial excess cash coverage despite continued challenging conditions in the energy sector”.Over the first nine months of this year, Kinder Morgan declared dividends of $1.48 per share, more than three times its total reported earnings per share of 43 cents.Fears that the dividend would prove unsustainable drove the shares down 65 per cent from their peak in April to Tuesday night’s closing price, and the historic yield rose to 13 per cent, based on past dividend payments.The new dividend of 50 cents per year, to be paid in quarterly instalments of 12.5 cents starting from the final quarter of 2015, gives a prospective yield of 3.4 per cent at the after-hours share price of $14.61.The slump in oil and natural gas prices since the summer of last year has hit the value of many North American pipeline businesses, including Energy Transfer Partners, Enterprise Products Partners, TransCanada and Enbridge.Over the past 12 months Kinder Morgan’s shares have performed the worst of that group, in part because of its higher net debt of $42.5bn. Enterprise has net debt of about 4.1 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, while Energy Transfer had debts of about 4.75 times annual ebitda at the end of September.Kinder Morgan was budgeting for net debt of 5.6 times ebitda this year, and now aims to cut that to 5.5 times next year.Steve Kean, chief executive, said the decision was “not a reflection of our underlying business”, which was “strong and growing”.He said he expected roughly 8 per cent growth in distributable cash flow next year to about $5bn.Kinder Morgan’s cash from operations for the first nine months of 2015 was $3.51bn, up 0.4 per cent from the equivalent period of 2014, in a sign that income from pipelines is relatively stable compared to the volatile earnings from producing oil and gas.However, most of that cash was paid out in dividend payments of $3.08bn, and Kinder Morgan was able to cover its capital spending of $3bn only by selling shares worth $3.83bn.The company has said it plans to stop issuing new shares, meaning that the dividend has to be significantly lower if capital spending is to be maintained at anything close to its present rate.Kinder Morgan said it would give more details of its plans in a call for analysts on Wednesday morning.
23;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Investors balk at Energy Transfer’s $34bn merger with Williams;Both pipeline groups hit by steep share price falls on news of deal;Investors have greeted Energy Transfer Equity’s merger agreement with Williams, which will create one of the largest oil and gas pipeline groups in the US, by steeply marking down the valuations of both businesses.The price of ETE’s units, which it has instead of shares, were down more than 10 per cent at $20.75 in afternoon trading in New York, while Williams’ stock was down almost 10 per cent at $37.54.Other oil and gas pipeline companies were also dragged down by a more than 2 per cent fall in crude prices on Monday, with units in Enterprise Products Partners, which is not involved in the ETE deal for Williams, down 6 per cent.ETE first tried to acquire Williams in June with a $64 a share offer that valued the company at $48bn. The bid was rejected because it was considered too low. Williams then began a strategic review that included a search for other suitors, according to people familiar with the matter, while negotiating the ETE offer’s complex structure.Since then the value of Williams has fallen sharply because of the sharp drop in energy prices that has hit the entire sector. In June, Williams was trading at $49 a share.ETE’s units have fallen even more sharply from $32 a unit (adjusted for the July stock split) in June to about $21.30 on Monday, valuing it at close to $23bn.Layers of complex ownership obscure a compelling deal between the two pipeline operatorsContinue reading“After a comprehensive evaluation of strategic alternatives, including extensive discussions with numerous parties, the Williams board of directors concluded that a merger with Energy Transfer Equity is in the best interests of Williams’ stockholders and all of our other stakeholders,” said Frank MacInnis, chairman of the Williams board.Under the terms of the stock-and-cash agreement, ETE will offer 1.8716 shares in a new company called Energy Transfer Corporation (ETC) for each share in Williams. ETC will in turn hold units in the ETE partnership, such that the shares and units are intended to have the same economic value.However, the tax treatment of corporations is different from partnerships in the US, and the liquidity of the two securities may also be differentKinder Morgan and Spectra were among those companies interested in acquiring Williams, according to people familiar with the matter.ETE and Williams are not directly reliant on commodity prices for revenues as they are transporters, not producers, of oil and gas. However, the decline in energy prices is negatively affecting producers, which are some of their main clients.US oil and gas producers are facing sustained financial strains, which are forcing them to cut back on their capital spending. Such cuts mean that opportunities are fewer for ETE and Williams to grow organically.
24;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2015-09-27T16:45:45Z;Energy Transfer closes in on $34bn Williams takeover;Weak oil and gas prices start to catalyse deals in energy sector;Energy Transfer Equity is close to acquiring Williams in a deal to create an oil and gas pipeline company worth about $59bn, according to people familiar with the matter.An agreement could be announced as early as Monday, in a sign of how the prospect of a potentially prolonged period of weak oil and gas prices is starting to catalyse deals in the energy sector.A deal between the two companies would be the first sizeable transaction to be agreed since oil prices slipped back again over the summer. It suggests that buyers’ and sellers’ expectations about valuations — which are generally far apart at a time of volatile commodity prices — may be coming into alignment, helping other proposed deals come to fruition.Those involved in the negotiations said that although the main points of the deal were essentially agreed, they cautioned that there was always a risk that it could fall apart.Williams’ board has backed a revised cash and stock offer from ETE, said people familiar with the transaction.It was unclear how much of the deal would be paid in cash, but one person said the overall deal would value Williams at $34bn.The valuation of Williams has dropped sharply since ETE made its first approach in late June. That all-equity offer was worth about $64 a share, based on ETE’s then share price, and valued Williams at almost $48bn.Williams rejected that approach, saying it significantly undervalued the company, but launched a strategic review and began looking for possible buyers.Several companies, including Kinder Morgan and Spectra were interested in acquiring Williams, but in recent weeks ETE emerged as the only serious bidder, said those involved in the sale.Since ETE’s approach became public in June, the share prices of both companies have declined significantly. Williams’ shares went down from about $49 to $41.60 on Friday, giving the company a market value of about $31bn.ETE, as a partnership, has units instead of shares, and those have fallen even more sharply, dropping from $32 a unit (adjusted for the July stock split) in June to about $23 on Friday, giving it a market value close to $25bn.Up until the end of June, it appeared that oil prices had stabilised, with US crude holding at about $60 a barrel. After that, however, prices took another slide, and US crude was about $45 a barrel over the weekend. Forward prices in the futures market and analysts’ expectations for prices have also fallen.As transporters rather than producers of oil and gas, neither ETE nor Williams is directly reliant on commodity prices for its revenues. However, their business depends on being able to develop new pipeline projects to generate growth.If US oil and gas producers are going through a sustained period of financial strain that will force them to cut back on their capital spending and hence production growth, that is likely to mean fewer opportunities for ETE and Williams to grow organically.The plan also looks like a vote of confidence in the master limited partnership: an alternative way to structure a business that offers tax advantages to companies that own and operate oil and gas infrastructure.Concerns have been raised about MLPs in recent years, including questions about how they can continue to grow — a key component of their appeal to investors, once they become very large. Last year Kinder Morgan decided to roll up its complex network of partnerships into a single corporation.Williams in May announced a similar move, saying it wanted to absorb its MLP affiliate, Williams Partners, into the parent group, which is a corporation. However, Kelcy Warren, ETE’s ambitious and acquisitive chairman, has kept the group as an MLP partnership, and has said he wants to keep that structure for Williams Partners.
25;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Vitol buys out oil tank partner’s stake in VTTI BV for $830m;Glut of crude and growing world demand leads commodity traders to seek more storage space;Vitol has bought out its partner in a leading oil tank business, as excess supply and growing world demand create more opportunities for oil storage providers.Vitol — the world’s largest energy trader — said on Friday it had paid $830m for MISC Berhad’s 50 per cent stake in the VTTI BV oil storage business. Buying the Petronas-controlled shipping group’s half of the venture gives Vitol greater control over a global network of almost 400 tanks.“Since inception, we have developed an independent storage company supported by the financial strength and market insight offered by Vitol,” said Rob Nijst, chief executive of VTTI BV in a statement. “Our asset footprint will continue to improve and grow.”Mr Nijst will continue to run VTTI BV as an independent company, the statement said. It added that the purchase was made with Vitol Investment Partnership, the trading house’s investment arm.Vitol chief executive Ian Taylor said he was “very excited by VTTI BV’s future potential,” noting that the company has total gross storage capacity of 54m barrels, including assets under construction.A glut of crude globally has led oil traders to look for additional space to store supplies. Using oil futures contracts, traders can lock-in higher prices for the crude for delivery months down the line, when the market is expected to be slightly stronger.Access to oil storage facilities gives traders greater flexibility in moving crude and refined products around the world. Modern oil storage facilities allow quicker shipment and blending of crudes, diesel, jet fuel and gasoline.Investment groups Kinder Morgan and 3i Infrastructure have also bought storage facilities in recent months, while private equity players have been looking at a BP owned terminal in Amsterdam.ICE Brent, the international benchmark, hit a 7-month low of $46.00 a barrel on Friday. Meanwhile, the premium for a contract for delivery six-months later has risen to more than $4 a barrel, the highest since April. This suggests more oil may be moved into storage, allowing tank operators to earn higher fees due to stronger demand.MISC Berhad said it wanted to release profits from its stake in VTTI BV to invest in its main business of oil shipping. It has been under pressure from lower prices, people familiar with the matter said.VTTI currently has storage capacity of 35.5 million barrels, according to its website, including sites in North America, the United Arab Emirates, Europe’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub and in Malaysia.It started building a new facility in Cape Town in July. South Africa has emerged as an increasingly important way station for oil, with traders able to easily flip barrels east and west from the location depending on regional demand.South Africa’s giant Saldanha Bay storage facility, which can hold 45 million barrels of oil, was filled to capacity last month by the oil glut, traders said.
26;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2015-08-14T17:18:01Z;Department stores prosper on sales boost;US stocks lack direction as consumer confidence slide offsets positive industrial production data;US retailers climbed on Friday as two stalwart department stores reported better than expected results, tempering concerns that consumer spending remains downtrodden.Shares of Nordstrom, the luxury goods retailer, were up 4.3 per cent to $78.13 after it lifted full-year sales and gross profit forecasts as revenues across its three main divisions rose.Nordstrom, which sells $99 slippers and $5,495 floral jacquard dresses, said it expected same-store sales, an important industry metric, to climb between 3.5 and 4.5 per cent for the full year, lifting overall net sales as much as 9.5 per cent.The outlook was rosier than similar projections in May when the company projected sales growth of as much as 9 per cent on a 2-4 per cent rise in same-store sales.Nordstrom lifted its full-year earnings forecast to between $3.85 and $3.95, ahead of analyst forecasts for $3.75 a share.Analysts at JPMorgan said the retailer was “pulling away from the pack” as it invested in its underlying business, while those with Cowen & Company expected it to outperform peers as its expansion to Canada, acquisition of Trunk Club and growth of its off-price website buoyed revenues.“The second-quarter strength with young customers — fastest growing categories — demonstrates Nordstrom is future-proofing its business to attract the millennial customer base,” said Oliver Chen at Cowen.JC Penney, the Texas department store chain in the middle of a turnround, said its restructuring efforts had gained momentum in the second quarter, bucking the trend of lacklustre same-store sales growth.A 4.1 per cent jump in like-for-like sales for the period beat expectations for a 3.9 per cent rise.Menswear, home, Sephora cosmetics and fine jewellery categories were its top performing merchandise divisions for the quarter.The department store said net sales had advanced 3 per cent to $2.9bn, while its loss narrowed to $138m, or 45 cents a share.JC Penney shares rose 5.5 per cent to $8.52, while shares in rival department store Dillard’s remained little changed.Several retailers and apparel manufacturers climbed following the two sets of results. Coach advanced 1.5 per cent to $31.93, PVH gained 2.5 per cent to $114.52 and Hanesbrands rose 1.8 per cent to $30.32. Michael Kors, however, decreased 0.6 per cent to $43.37.Kinder Morgan gained 2.5 per cent to $33.96 after analysts with Goldman Sachs added the energy company to its “conviction list”.Dupont, the maker of animal feed and crop protection, rose 1.6 per cent to $53.86 after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “neutral”, citing its more than 20 per cent year-to-date decline.Restaurant chain El Pollo Loco declined 20.7 per cent to $14.56 after it dimmed its full-year sales growth forecasts.Overall, US equity markets rolled sideways as better industrial production figures than expected were offset by a slide in consumer confidence.The S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 2,091.54, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4 per cent to 17,477.40, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.3 per cent to 5,048.23.eric.platt@ft.comtwitter: @ericgplatt
27;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Williams buys out infrastructure affiliate for $13.9bn;Latest restructuring among US energy infrastructure groups;Williams, the US oil and gas pipelines group, plans to take full ownership of its associated company Williams Partners in a $13.9bn deal, marking the latest restructuring of US energy infrastructure groups.The two businesses have agreed an all-share deal for Williams to buy the 40 per cent of Williams Partners that it does not own already, at a price that values the entire partnership at $34.7bn.The move follows similar deals announced last year by Kinder Morgan, in which the company bought out the minority holdings in three linked partnerships.Williams Partners owns and operates gas pipelines and processing plants. It was created through a restructuring of the Williams group in 2010, in which it received several large assets from its parent, including the Transco gas pipeline system that stretches from Texas to New York.It is a master limited partnership, a tax-advantaged business structure that has become increasingly popular in the US energy industry in recent years. It has units instead of shares, and unlike a conventional company pays no corporate tax. Investors instead pay income tax on their share of the partnerships’ profits.The tax benefits of MLPs make them a low-cost way to raise capital and they have proliferated during the US oil and gas boom of the past decade. There were 71 at the end of 2009 and there are now 121.However, the disadvantages of the structure have also become increasingly apparent. In particular, investors have become more aware of “incentive distribution rights”: terms in the partnership agreement that give the controlling general partner a rising share of the MLP’s profits.As the general partner, the Williams parent company benefited from that arrangement, but investors wanted to be compensated for that, so it increased the cost of capital for the partnership. Williams said the cost of capital would be lower if it abandoned the MLP structure, and the incentive distribution rights, and was structured as a regular corporation.It added that as a result of buying out the partnership it expected to be able to increase its dividend to 64 cents a quarter for the second half of this year, and then raise it by 11 per cent next year, and “approximately” 10-15 per cent a year to 2020.The deal offers Williams Partners unit holders 1.115 Williams shares for every unit. That values each unit at about $59.83 based on the Williams share price on Wednesday morning, giving a premium of about 25 per cent to the closing price of the units on Tuesday evening.However, Williams Partners units have been losing value for the past six months, having peaked above $65 in November.The companies expect the acquisition to close in the autumn of this year.
28;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2015-05-04T12:17:04Z;Fresh blow for tax-friendly energy entities;El Paso unit turns spotlight on master limited partnerships;Let’s hope, for the convenience of lawyers, that there are direct flights between Wilmington in Delaware and Houston, Texas. Three years ago, a Delaware corporate court rebuked the energy company El Paso Corporation (confusingly headquartered in Houston) for running a flawed sales process when it sold itself for $21bn to Kinder Morgan.That sale process, however, is better remembered because El Paso’s investment banker, Goldman Sachs, also faced sanctions as it had interests on multiple sides of the transaction. Fast forward to two weeks ago, and another El Paso unit was in trouble in the Delaware Court of Chancery over a troubled deal. This time, the spotlight was on master limited partnerships — one of the most controversial corporate structures of recent years. MLPs have prospered as they have been able to exploit two lucrative trends: securities that pay big cash yields and the explosive growth in US oil and gas production.Most listed American companies are registered as corporations, a structure that has many advantages. But the key disadvantage is that corporations themselves must pay tax (although they are getting more skilled at avoiding that), as must their investors.Partnerships, however, are “pass-through” entities that do not pay corporate tax. Partners pay tax at the personal level. MLPs cleverly combine this pass-through advantage with the liquidity and other benefits of a public listing. These days, MLPs are restricted to the natural resources industry, where they have historically been used for infrastructure activities, such as pipelines, where revenues tend to be steady. But investor appetite has allowed riskier groups, such as drillers, to list as MLPs.121Number of master limited partnerships in the US todayIn the US, the number of MLPs has risen from 71 at the end of 2009 to 121 today, and they now have a collective market capitalisation of about $500bn. Between February 2005 and February 2015, they achieved a juicy annualised total return of 13 per cent, according to the benchmark Alerian MLP index. That return was balanced between the dividends and capital gains. But to achieve capital gains, MLPs need to become bigger. And chasing growth is what ensnared the MLP unit of El Paso.A common way for MLPs to get bigger is through the innocuously-titled “drop down” transaction. This involves the MLP purchasing assets from its parent company, called a sponsor. In El Paso MLP’s case, the sponsor, El Paso Corporation (now part of Kinder Morgan) served as the general partner of the partnership — a role that comes with some handy benefits. These include having 2 per cent of the economic ownership of the MLP, the power to pick the board and the right to receive disproportionate dividends as the MLP gets bigger. The sponsor also holds a large chunk of the ordinary ownership units.$171mAmount that El Paso MLP overpaid El Paso Corporation, according to a Delaware courtHowever, in a transaction between the sponsor and the MLP there is a risk that the MLP board might have divided loyalties and approve an overpriced transaction. This is precisely what the Delaware court found in the case of El Paso — determining that, in a 2010 drop down deal, El Paso MLP paid El Paso Corporation $171m too much.El Paso, like all MLPs, had three independent directors who formed a “conflicts” committee to negotiate with the sponsor. But the court ruling showed that they signed off on the deal simply because, juicy valuation aside, adding the assets would boost the MLP’s cash distribution. Once again, the investment bankers did not drape themselves in glory. The Texas energy boutique Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, was rapped for steering the board towards a deal.The case is the latest blow in what has been an annus horribilis for MLPs. Crashing commodity prices have sent the Alerian index down 13 per cent since last summer and impending monetary tightening is expected to hurt performance further.But the most intriguing development occurred last August. Richard Kinder, the billionaire entrepreneur most associated with the MLP revolution, consolidated his $100bn+ partnership empire into a single, traditional corporation. As part of the transaction, El Paso MLP was then combined into the single Kinder Morgan. For Mr Kinder, the demands of multiple partners became too unwieldy.MLP champions might argue that the structure’s advantages, including the ability to raise capital cheaply, helped make the US an energy superpower. This power will no doubt remain — but the MLP golden age may be over.sujeet.indap@ft.com
29;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2015-03-23T00:39:38Z;US companies sell record euro debt;Companies lured by lower borrowing costs and weaker euro as ECB begins QE;Depressed bond yields in Europe are attracting record debt sales by US multinationals, reflecting efforts by companies to take advantage of lower borrowing costs, while minimising the impact of a sharply weaker euro.With the European Central Bank having begun buying large amounts of bonds in order to jump-start the economy and boost inflation, borrowing costs and the value of the euro have tumbled.For US companies, much lower borrowing costs in the eurozone have triggered a race to issue debt and lock in very low interest rates. The number of US-domiciled companies issuing euro bonds has reached a record high so far this year, with the value of those transactions running at nearly fourfold the pace from just a year earlier.US companies have raised €27.2bn in euro bonds in 24 deals, including multibillion-euro offerings from Coca-Cola, Mondelez International, AT&T, and Kinder Morgan, according to data from Dealogic. The figures eclipse the size of the combined euro debt offerings by US companies through the same point in time over each of the preceding six years.Andrew Kresse, head of North America corporate derivatives marketing at JPMorgan, said companies have taken advantage of a sharp decline in sovereign bond yields, which in turn has lowered the coupon that businesses must pay to appeal to investors.“The reason many US companies are issuing in Europe is because we’ve seen an increase in the interest rate differential. In addition many are leaving that money in Europe, which is a natural hedge to their assets and operations in the Europe.”Benchmark yields in many European countries are negative when adjusted for inflation, and the difference between yields on comparable German and US 10-year debt has climbed to 175 basis points. The differential has widened as monetary policy between Europe and the US diverges.That divergence has also prompted a spike in sales of euro-denominated debt by Chinese companies so far this year.While expectations of the pace at which the Federal Reserve will lift rates this year has been marked down, it still stands in contrast to the European Central Bank, which has just started buying €60bn worth of bonds a month.Many multinationals have also raised capital in Europe to minimise the effect of the depreciation in the euro as the dollar advanced.Richard Peretz, corporate treasurer of UPS, said that while the shipping behemoth itself had not tapped debt markets recently, US-based companies had to think about ways to hedge translation effects of currencies.“Companies have to look at their operations and balance the goals of the business with the volatile markets in currencies. We operate and have expenses every day in Europe and most companies that operate offshore must think about that,” said Mr Peretz after the JPMorgan annual treasurer’s forum in New York.His remarks come amid warnings from numerous S&P 500 companies including Nike, Apple, United Technologies and Pfizer of the impact the strong dollar has had on results,Twitter: @ericgplatt
30;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2015-03-09T20:30:40Z;Kinder Morgan sells first euro bonds;US companies lock in low borrowing costs;Kinder Morgan sold its first ever euro-denominated bond on Monday, extending the charge of US companies into eurozone debt markets, attracted by record low borrowing costs and a favourable currency exchange rate.America’s largest energy infrastructure company issued €1.25bn of bonds divided into seven-, and 12-year tranches. Orders ex ceeded €4.75bn, highlighting the relentless hunger for euro bonds.“You see the snowball effect rolling out and spreading in many different directions as more debut companies look at the market. It’s not just the same repeat borrowers making up the volume,” said Marco Baldini, head of European corporate and SSA syndicate at Barclays.Yields on euro-denominated bonds have fallen to record lows and the pool of government and corporate bonds trading at negative yields has expanded as the European Central Bank has entered the market with its landmark bond buying programme.US companies have piled in to take advantage of record low borrowing costs, with the sale of debt, known as ‘’reverse yankees’’.“Funding conditions have become a lot easier outside the US with quantitative easing-driven liquidity injections and rate cuts raising the supply of euro and other currency funding versus dollar funding,” said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, analyst at JP Morgan.The start of the ECB’s quantitative easing policy, which amounts to €60bn a month of sovereign debt purchases, has heightened demand for eurobonds. Zoso Davies, credit strategist at Barclays, estimates ECB bond purchases will exceed net supply of bonds by three to one, cutting supply by €840bn.The rising wave of eurobonds issued by US companies will also drive down the yields on these particular bonds, according to Mr Baldini.“With more and more US companies coming into the market it helps the price they can achieve because you have more pricing references,” he said.US non-financial companies have already issued €22.9bn of euro denominated bonds this year, the highest figure in more than a decade. That compares with sales of €7bn a year ago. The boom in issuance reflects how US companies are currently able to sell eurobonds offering yields roughly 1.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent lower than they would have to pay on equivalent bonds issued in the US.Borrowing in euros is also attractive to US companies because it allows them to hedge against the depreciation of their euro-denominated assets as the debts become cheaper to repay as the currency falls.The euro touched an 11-and-a-half year low on Friday and investors are expecting it may tumble to parity with the dollar as the ECB’s QE policy gains traction while the US Federal Reserve looks to raise official borrowing rates later this year.Mr Panigirtzoglou said: “Anecdotal information from syndicate desks suggests that a decent amount of this year’s euro corporate issuance by US companies was for hedging existing euro exposures.’’Kinder Morgan priced the $750m 7-year tranche at 110 basis points over mid-swaps- the European benchmark — and the $500m, 12-year tranche is priced at 145 basis points over mid-swaps.
31;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2014-10-27T18:05:43Z;Williams/Access Midstream: flowing pipes;It is not time to bury the master limited partnership yet;Don’t bury the master limited partnership yet. Two months ago, MLP pioneer Kinder Morgan consolidated its sprawling energy pipeline empire and jettisoned the increasingly onerous demands of MLPs (a tax advantaged structure for energy investments). Rival Williams Company announced its own simplification on Monday. Unlike Kinder Morgan, it will stick with this structure. Perhaps then there is nothing untoward about MLPs. Or perhaps Williams’ reckoning is years away.Imagine a triangle with the Williams Company at the top. The two corners at the base are Williams LP and Access Midstream LP, two energy infrastructure MLPs. Williams Company, a regular taxpaying corporation distinct from the MLPs, is the “parent” of Williams LP and Access LP. As the general partner of the two, Williams Company manages those businesses and earns dividends for its efforts (MLPs avoid tax by paying out their cash flow to investors). The ordinary shares of Williams LP and Access LP are called units. Williams Company, in addition to its general partner stake, owns most of the LP units in both as well. Monday’s deal will merge the two MLPs.The key driver of MLP performance is how distributions to investors grow. Williams Company says the distribution growth rate will be 10 to 12 per cent until 2017. The streamlined businesses will have leading gas gathering and processing facilities across the major US shale formations as well as in the Gulf of Mexico. Williams will also operate three of the leading interstate pipeline networks, including Transco which runs from Texas to the north east of the US.Williams LP has an equity value of $23bn while Access has a value of $13bn. Contrast that with Kinder Morgan LP and its sister El Paso Pipeline LP which had a joint market capitalisation of $55bn. That made growth tricky to achieve. With that much more leeway, Williams looks secure for now.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex

On Friday it said it was introducing “a series of enhanced policies related to investments by our own personnel”.“Prior to today’s internal announcement, potential personal investments had generally been required to go through a formal process for approval across each division,” said a person familiar with the matter. “As a consequence of an ongoing review of related policies, the firm is enhancing its policies related to personal trading to ensure an even more comprehensive and efficient process.”The memo, which was first reported by Bloomberg News, came on the same day that Carmen Segarra, a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York examiner, aired more concerns about Goldman’s conflict of interest policy.Ms Segarra filed a lawsuit against the Fed last October claiming she was fired after she criticised Goldman on its handling of conflict of interest matters. The lawsuit was dismissed by a US federal judge in April. Ms Segarra is appealing against that decision.As for her allegations, Goldman said it “has long had a comprehensive approach for addressing potential conflicts. Ms Segarra, who unsuccessfully interviewed for employment at Goldman in 2007, 2008 and 2009, told her supervisors at the Fed that the company did not have a written conflict of interest policy. A quick Google search, however, shows publicly available Goldman Sachs documents outlining the management of conflicts.”Broader restrictions on trading individual bonds, stocks and investing in activist or event-driven hedge funds apply to the whole bank.

33;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2014-08-13T19:17:52Z;Kinder Morgan deal at the centre of price fixing court battle;;Rich Kinder, the Kinder Morgan founder who on Sunday unveiled a $44bn consolidation of a family of companies to create the US’s third-largest energy company, owes no small part of his $10bn-plus personal fortune to a 2006 deal that is now at the centre of a courtroom battle.The one-time Enron executive who bought its physical pipeline assets to form Kinder Morgan spearheaded a management-led buyout of his company that year for $14.6bn, a deal that valued his then 18 per cent stake at $2.63bn.Less than four years later, Kinder Morgan returned to the New York Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of more than $21bn, creating huge paper profits for Mr Kinder – who by then had amassed a 30.6 per cent stake worth $6.5bn at the IPO price – and his backers from Goldman Sachs’s private equity unit and Carlyle, the buyout group.Kinder Morgan’s 2006 take-private deal is now under scrutiny in a lengthy US court case, brought by disaffected public company shareholders that allege private equity groups conspired to fix prices on eight buyouts by agreeing not to compete against each other by “jumping” on their rivals’ deals.Last week, only days before Kinder Morgan’s consolidation was announced, Blackstone, TPG and KKR agreed to pay a combined $325m to settle the lawsuit, leaving Carlyle the sole group fighting the allegations. All the private equity groups that have settled the case denied wrongdoing.The plaintiff’s complaint presented to the Massachusetts district court provides a series of insights into the Kinder Morgan deal.It shows that Mr Kinder and his backers were able to secure Kinder Morgan at an attractive price of $107.50 per share without a single competing offer, even though the price was below the value recommended by the special committee Kinder Morgan’s board set up to evaluate offers.KKR did some initial valuation estimates and calculated that the company was worth $138.30 per share but it chose not to bid, according to the complaint. “Analyst valuations of Kinder Morgan’s stock ranged as high as $150 per share,” it states.“To give the collusive LBO [leveraged buyout] a patina of legitimacy, 35 potential investors were solicited to present competing bids. None did so, resulting in a one-bid auction won by Kinder Morgan insiders along with Goldman Sachs PIA [the investment bank’s private equity unit] and Carlyle,” the plaintiffs charge.Before the deal was agreed, Goldman Sachs executives hosted a meeting at the bank’s New York head office attended by Mr Kinder and the biggest names in private equity – including Apollo’s Leon Black, Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman, KKR’s Henry Kravis and TPG’s Jim Coulter.During that meeting, attendees discussed forming a consortium to take Kinder Morgan private. The buyout bosses were told they had two days to decide whether they wanted to take part in a deal on “pre-existing terms and conditions,” the complaint says.Interested parties were also required to sign agreements that prevented them from making a competing offer for a year, though the special committee later dropped the provision, “recognising its anti-competitive nature,” according to the complaint.Goldman Sachs also struck an exclusivity agreement with Mr Kinder that “effectively precluded him from soliciting or supporting any competing bid”.“Rich Kinder therefore could not discuss competing buyout proposals with other parties – even if the proposals were more favourable to the shareholders than Goldman Sachs’ offer,” the plaintiffs allege. However, the special committee rejected the exclusivity agreement.Five days after the meeting at Goldman’s New York headquarters, Carlyle, along with its then affiliate Riverstone, and AIG, the insurance group, joined the buyout group with an initial offer of $100 per share.That price was above the $84.41 level Kinder Morgan was then trading at but below its high in January of that year of $103.75.David Rubenstein, one of the group’s co-founders, sent an internal email explaining that Carlyle was invited into the deal “because we complained about Goldman competing with us and never having brought us a deal”.Kinder Morgan’s special committee, advised by Blackstone, managed to get the buyout consortium to increase its price by $7.50 to $107.50 per share.After that increase, the take-private deal was agreed by the special committee, with the transaction closing in May 2007.Kinder Morgan’s relisting in February 2011 made Carlyle $400m and Goldman $900m, on top of their paper profits on the stakes they retained in the company – worth over $4bn and $2bn respectively, according to the plaintiffs. Immediately after the IPO, Mr Kinder and the private equity groups still owned more than 80 per cent of the company.Kinder Morgan also provided a fee bonanza for Goldman, which pulled off a coveted “triple play” by not only investing via its in-house private equity unit but also generating fees for advising the buyout consortium and arranging debt finance for the 2006 deal.Kinder Morgan declined to comment. The company’s shares were priced at $30 at the time of its 2011 IPO, peaked at $40.58 in 2013, and traded at $38.79 on Wednesday.In June, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $67m to settle the price fixing case. It denied wrongdoing. Goldman declined to comment.Goldman’s role in the Kinder Morgan buyout is controversial. It came three years after an internal strategy document concluded that the bank should “develop chits that will encourage reciprocity” with its investment banking unit and its buyout arm.In their defence, lawyers for the private equity groups say the plaintiff’s allegations are misconceived and that the communications the plaintiffs highlight have been taken out of context and are only a small part of the millions of pages submitted by the private equity groups during the seven-year court battle.The private equity groups add there are valid reasons for them not to “jump” a rival’s agreed deal. For example, an original bidder may have already secured management’s backing as well as the right to match a competing offer.One lawyer involved in the proceedings said: “Private equity firms never jump each others’ (signed) deals because it isn’t likely that they can succeed at a compelling price.”The private equity groups that have settled also say they wanted to resolve a drawn out case given the uncertainties involved in a jury trial, which is scheduled for early November.Carlyle’s lawyers have argued that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate that the failure of the private equity groups to offer rival topping bids for eight buyouts “actually caused the share prices in each of the deals to be lower than they otherwise would have been.”An industry lawyer added that emails from the private equity executives made public in the case were “ugly” and “embarrassing” but they did not necessarily back up the plaintiff’s case.
34;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2014-08-12T12:23:42Z;Unclogging the pipes at Kinder Morgan;;Last week, we pointed out one of the most exquisite slides we had seen all year in an investor presentation. Simply by spinning off its copper and fiber assets into a REIT, the telecom company Windstream believed its stock would rocket by 73 per cent. Alas, it is only up 7 per cent since then.On Monday, Kinder Morgan, remarkably, came up with the mirror image set of slides. Kinder would consolidate its empire of natural gas pipelines by dissolving its tax-advantaged master limited partnership (MLPs are analogous to its REITs in that they don’t pay corporate level tax). It would also consolidate all companies into a regular old corporate tax-paying C-corporation.The tax arbitrage this time is found by shedding “incentive distribution rights” as we described on Monday and taking advantage of greater depreciation expense to shield taxes. The explanations of this at Breakingviews, Heard on the Street, and by Matt Levine at Bloomberg View are also excellent and are great reads.This chart (which Matt Levine also references in his article) is the analogue to the Windstream slide.The key line item is the cost of new equity calculation — which, in the status quo column, demonstrates how painful the IDRs are (to the point of overwhelming the tax benefits of the MLP).The following slide in the presentation is also intriguing. It translates the cost of capital difference into value creation for the MLP unitholders.The bottom section shows that the nominal dividend or distribution to unitholders actually falls after Kinder Morgan Energy Partners MLP is acquired by the c-corp, Kinder Morgan, Inc.However, the top section shows that because of the way Kinder Morgan Inc. will trade, at a lower dividend yield (read: cost of capital) of 4.5 per cent rather than the 6.95 per cent yield for the MLP, MLP unitholders are much better off becoming a c-corp. With the MLP shares trading up 17 per cent on Monday, the MLP shareholders wholeheartedly agreed with these calculations.
35;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2014-08-11T21:48:25Z;Rich Kinder sees ‘fertile’ field for deals;;Shares in the four pipeline companies Kinder Morgan plans to consolidate into North America’s third-largest energy company leapt on Monday as its founder said the $44bn deal could be a precursor to more aggressive acquisitions in the booming US oil and gas sector.Rich Kinder, a former Enron executive whose stake in Kinder Morgan is worth almost $10bn, said the deal would reduce its cost of capital, allowing it to become “an active acquirer in a situation which I think is a very fertile ground for consolidation – this midstream infrastructure play – over the next few years”.“I think virtually anything in the midstream energy area would fit us,” he told investors.In a presentation on its website, Kinder Morgan identified 120 energy companies, worth a combined $875bn, as potential targets. “It’s a fertile field to do a little grazing in,” Mr Kinder said. Each company uses the same “ master limited partnership” structure as Kinder Morgan currently enjoys.The US shale boom has vastly increased demand for infrastructure to bring new oil and gas supplies to market, benefiting “midstream” companies that own and operate pipelines, storage facilities, export terminals and fuel-processing plants. Kinder Morgan says more than $640bn of investment in such infrastructure will be needed by 2035.The company, which started in 1997 with pipeline assets bought from Enron, is already the largest midstream player in North America with 80,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines. Now it plans to bring all its publicly traded units under one roof.It will acquire Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, Kinder Morgan Management and El Paso Pipeline Partners in a deal comprised of $40bn in Kinder Morgan Inc shares, $4bn in cash and $27bn in assumed debt.The transactions will transform the group into a traditional corporation with an estimated enterprise value of about $140bn, making it the US’ third-largest energy company after ExxonMobil and Chevron.Shares in Kinder Morgan Inc jumped 9 per cent to close at $39.37, while Kinder Morgan Energy Partners jumped 18 per cent to $94.12, Kinder Morgan Management soared 24 per cent to $95.42 and El Paso Pipeline Partners rose 21 per cent to $40.56.The deal involves Kinder Morgan moving away from the concept of the MLP, a structure heavily used by Mr Kinder, who is paid a $1 salary but owns almost 24 per cent of Kinder Morgan Inc.MLPs pay no corporate taxes and pass all their profits straight to investors as dividends, making them a hit with investors at a time of low interest rates. But they can only deliver high yields and healthy growth if they acquire enough new assets.Mr Kinder said the company had become so large, and was paying out so much of its cash to investors that it was struggling to make acquisitions. Shareholders have put pressure on him to fold the partnerships into a single group.He said the combined group would be able to raise dividends, cut its cost of capital, and use its shares as an acquisition currency.Kinder Morgan plans to raise its dividend by 16 per cent next year to $2 a share and to raise the payouts by 10 per cent a year to the end of the decade.Additional reporting by Stephen Foley and Ed Crooks
36;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Doubtful long-term appeal of Kinder Morgan’s MLP structure;;Kinder Morgan’s deal represents a landmark for a form of corporate structure that has undergone a surge in popularity in the US in recent years: the master limited partnership or MLP.MLPs are known as “pass-through” entities, because they pass all their profits straight on to their investors as dividends. That means they pay no corporate tax, and instead their investors – known as unit holders – pay income tax on the dividends.The combination of those tax advantages and high yields has made MLPs highly attractive to retail investors at a time of low interest rates, and in the past couple of years there has been a rush of companies seeking to use the structure to raise capital.Under US tax laws, only companies in certain industries – principally oil and gas infrastructure – are allowed to configure themselves as MLPs, and the need for new pipelines and storage facilities created by the shale boom is fuelling demand for investment.However, there have also been questions raised about the long-term attractiveness of MLPs. Their offer to unit holders of a combination of high yields and healthy growth is achievable only if they can acquire enough new assets, which becomes more difficult as they grow larger.The complex structure and governance of MLPs, which can be controlled by a general partner that owns only a small proportion of the units, has also caused concerns.Moody’s, the rating agency, commented recently that “MLPs provide less protection for investors than do typical public companies”, because “checks and balances tend to be weaker”.The Kinder Morgan deal could be read as an acknowledgment that those concerns are significant for investors. Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and El Paso Pipeline Partners will both lose MLP status as they are absorbed into the parent company.Kevin Kaiser, an analyst at Hedgeye, a research group, has persistently raised concerns about Kinder Morgan and some other MLPs.Over the past year, shares in Kinder Morgan Inc have fallen 4 per cent, and in Kinder Morgan Energy Partners by 3 per cent, while the US energy sector has risen 15 per cent.
37;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2014-08-11T16:57:17Z;Kinder Morgan: perverse incentives;MLPs yields look attractive, but read about the incentive distribution rights first;Yield is king, never mind the fine print. That strategy has usually worked out for investors in master limited partnerships, a tax-efficient corporate structure designed for energy transport and storage companies. The details, however, finally caught up with the vast Kinder Morganempire, the largest US energy infrastructure entity, on Monday. The non-MLP holding company, Kinder Morgan Inc, will spend $44bn mostly in shares to buy out the three MLPs it controls, most notably Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, LP and El Paso Pipeline Partners, LP.The concept of MLPs is that they pay out all their cash to shareholders. But another associated three-letter term, IDRs, has not got enough scrutiny. That will change with this reckoning.If there is a limited partner in an MLP, then somewhere there must be a general partner running the business. Incentive distribution rights make this role a juicy deal. IDRs entitle the general partner, who typically owns just 2 per cent of the operating business in the MLP, to get an outsized dividend should dividends grow overall.The game, then, for the MLP is to keep issuing debt and equity to buy assets to expand the dividend. Kinder Morgan Inc is the general partner for all its MLP progeny. So Kinder Morgan Energy Partners faces two problems. First, with a market capitalisation of $38bn it is already so big that its growth prospects are limited. Second, its distribution has become so large that in 2013 43 per cent of distributions flowed to Kinder Morgan Inc’s tiny LP interest.Those figures are perverse enough that Kinder Morgan has decided the unified company will be a regular corporation liable for corporate tax. Yet after the acquisitions, with some clever accounting for depreciation expenses, Kinder Morgan will be able to boost its dividend faster than its MLPs would have been able to. With Kinder Morgan Inc’s shares up nearly a tenth on Monday, judgment day is sweet.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
38;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2014-08-11T16:15:05Z;Tesla powered higher by expansion plans;;Tesla shares approached an all-time high after brokerage Deutsche Bank lifted its rating on the electric car manufacturer to buy as the company expands aggressively.The investment bank, which also lifted its price target to $310, said sales over the coming three years would likely be far above its earlier expectations.Deutsche now expects Tesla to ship 100,000 vehicles in 2016, two-thirds ahead of its prior forecast.Those advances hinge on the nearing launch of the Tesla Model X, a midsize luxury SUV, as well as a lower price model that has yet to be named.Deutsche expects production on the third model, which will be Tesla’s first entry into the mid-priced category, sometime in 2017.“At this point we see an increasingly clear path to 500,000 units of annual production by late this decade,” “Rod Lache, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said. “And we don’t expect growth to end there, as Tesla is already contemplating opportunities for additional production capacity.”Tesla shares climbed as much as 6 per cent to $263.74, within a tenth of a percentage point of a high reached in February.MannKind, the developer of a new inhaled insulin therapy, soared after Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical group, forged a pact to license and develop the diabetes treatment.The two drugmakers plan to launch the remedy, called Afrezza Inhalation Powder, in the US in the first quarter of 2015. MannKind won US regulatory approval for Afrezza in late June.Sanofi will pay MannKind up to $925m under their agreement. The French company will pay MannKind $150m upfront with the rest if certain goals are met.MannKind will manufacture the drug and the two companies will also share profits and losses globally with Sanofi retaining a 65 per cent share of the earnings.MannKind shares climbed 4.9 per cent to $8.53.Shares in Chiquita Brands, a US food producer best known for its bananas, surged on Monday after the company received a $13-a-share offer from Cutrale, a US farmer of oranges, apples and lemons, and Safra.The offer, which is 29 per cent higher than Chiquita’s closing share price on Friday and values the company at $625m, threatens Chiquita’s own planned tie-up with banana distributor Fyffes.In a letter to Chiquita’s chief executive released on Monday, Cutrale and Safra said they were “confident that this transaction offers compelling and more certain value for Chiquita shareholders as compared with the proposed transaction with Fyffes”.In March, Chiquita and Fyffes announced an all-stock deal that would see the companies sell more than 160m boxes of fruit annually and earn more than $4.5bn in revenues.That deal valued Fyffes at $526m and Chiquita, which is larger than Fyffes, planned to target $40m in savings. Fyffes shares slid 15 per cent in Dublin trading to €0.919 on the news.US travel booking website Priceline climbed after the company said net profit grew by almost a third to $576.5m in the second quarter as its international operations continued to expand.Revenues rose 26 per cent to $2.1bn in the period as the travel company’s gross bookings climbed 34 per cent to $13.5bn.Priceline owns brands like Booking.com, Kayak and OpenTable, and said those results meant that its adjusted earnings per share were $12.51 compared with Bloomberg’s $12.02 consensus.Priceline shares climbed 2 per cent to $1,309.28. Rival Orbitz Worldwide advanced 0.2 per cent to $8.88 while Expedia rose 1.7 per cent to $83.94.Kinder Morgan led the benchmark S&P 500 after the company announced it would spend $44bn to consolidate its businesses and buy out outside investors in its family of companies, including Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, Kinder Morgan Management and El Paso Pipeline Partners.The deal ranks as the second largest in the energy sector to date. Kinder Morgan shares climbed 9 per cent to $39.37.Overall, US equity markets remained on firm footing following Friday’s strong advance.Reports that Russian military exercises near the Ukrainian border had ended have lifted investor sentiment and sent volatility lower.The S&P 500 climbed 0.3 per cent to 1,936.92 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 16.569.98.

39;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Kinder in $44bn deal to buy out investors;Second-biggest deal ever in energy sector;Kinder Morgan, which runs 80,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines in North America, plans to spend $44bn to buy out the outside investors in its family of companies, in a deal that ranks as the second largest in the energy sector.The decision to simplify its sprawling corporate structure comes amid investor excitement over the prospects for US energy production. Founder Richard Kinder said the combined group would use its shares as a currency for further acquisitions and investments.Shareholders in three separately listed companies – Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, Kinder Morgan Management and El Paso Pipeline Partners – will be handed a mix of cash and Kinder Morgan shares for their stakes, at premiums to Friday’s closing share prices of between 12 per cent and 16.5 per cent. The three companies are controlled by Kinder Morgan and their boards have voted to recommend the deal.The enterprise value of the acquisitions, including assumed debt, will be $71bn.Measured by the equity value of the three bids of $44bn, the deal announced will be the second-biggest in the sector, after Exxon’s $74.5bn purchase of Mobil in 1999.“This transaction dramatically simplifies the Kinder Morgan story,” Mr Kinder said in a statement on Sunday, adding that the combined group would be able to raise dividends, cut its cost of capital and use its shares as an acquisition currency. He promised to raise Kinder Morgan’s dividend by 16 per cent next year and by 10 per cent per annum for the rest of the decade.Yield is king, never mind the fine print. That strategy has usually worked out for investors in master limited partnerships, a tax-efficient corporate structure designed for energy transport and storage companies. The details, however, finally caught up with the vast Kinder Morgan empire.Continue reading“In the opportunity-rich environment of today’s energy infrastructure sector, we believe this transaction gives us the ability to grow for years to come,” he added.The growth of oil and gas production from shale rock in the northern US has transformed the energy landscape, and requirements for infrastructure investment to reflect the new locations of supply and demand could top hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.The Kinder Morgan family of companies includes 80,000 miles of pipeline and 180 storage terminals in North America. The combined group will have an enterprise value of approximately $140bn.Mr Kinder will set out additional details for investors in a conference call on Monday morning.Combining cash flows in a single corporate structure will reduce the cost of debt financing, the company said. Executives have already run the deal past credit rating agencies.There will also be tax benefits from eliminating the separate partnerships, it said.
40;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2014-06-12T17:26:01Z;Goldman and Bain pay $121m to settle buyout conspiracy case;;Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital paid $121m to settle a lawsuit alleging they conspired with other private equity firms to fix the price of some of the biggest ever leveraged buyouts.Both Goldman and Bain said they came to the settlement, approved on Tuesday in the District Court of Massachusetts, to put an end to the protracted and costly litigation, which was brought in 2007 against 13 private equity firms of which five remain: Blackstone, Carlyle, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Silver Lake and TPG.“We’re pleased to put this matter behind us,” said Goldman, which paid $67m. Bain paid $54m. Neither company admitted wrongdoing.Shareholders in eight companies bought between 2003 and 2007 first brought the case, alleging they were denied a higher price for the buyout because private equity firms agreed not to compete against each other.The case challenges some accepted practices in “club” deals, where private equity firms collaborate rather than compete in acquisitions.SunGard, Toys “R” Us, Neiman Marcus, Aramark, Kinder Morgan, PanAmSat, HCA and Freescale were among 19 examples cited by the complainants in amended complaints led by the Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit, a public pension fund.The lawsuit is partly built on emails between some of the best-known names in US finance, spanning Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman, and Henry Kravis, co-founder of KKR.The complaint quotes James Coulter, TPG co-founder, stating that during the SunGard acquisition “being overly aggressive here will make further enemies at [Silver Lake] and Bain while perhaps benefiting noone [sic] but the SunGard shareholdersWe would much rather work with you guys than against you. Together we can be unstoppable but in opposition we can cost each other a lot of moneyFor the $17.5bn acquisition of Freescale by Blackstone, TPG, Carlyle and Permira, the complaint quotes Tony James, president of Blackstone, writing to George Roberts, co-founder of KKR, to say: “We would much rather work with you guys than against you. Together we can be unstoppable but in opposition we can cost each other a lot of money.”It also quotes James Attwood, a Carlyle managing director, writing to Alexander Navab, a counterpart at KKR, saying: “[w]e are NOT forming a competing group (although we have received many calls), we are not signing an NDA [non-disclosure agreement], we are not taking any info and will not in any way interfere with your deal.”A judge has ruled that some emails cited by the complainants do not constitute evidence of wrongdoing, dismissing the case against private equity firms including Thomas H Lee and Apollo Global Management.TPG said in a statement: “We are aware that two of the defendants . . . have decided to try to settle with the plaintiffs. We continue to strongly dispute the allegations and are confident in prevailing in both the upcoming interim motions and at trial, should one occur.”
41;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2014-06-09T08:03:35Z;US oil industry finds way around export ban;;"A boom in investment in low-end refineries along the US Gulf of Mexico is helping to ease strains in the country’s oil industry, giving the White House some breathing space as it looks at relaxing a longstanding ban on exporting crude oil.The refineries, known as condensate splitters, turn a super-light oil called condensate into products such as naphtha, used as a petrochemical feedstock.Under US law dating back to the 1970s, condensates pumped from oil wells are defined as crude oil and cannot be exported without being processed.Condensate output is expanding so fast at South Texas’ Eagle Ford Shale that many executives warn the export ban will create a glut in the US, forcing down prices and holding back the industry’s growth.The splitters will help ease that problem because they convert unexportable condensate into readily exportable products, according to Jake Dweck, partner at law firm Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan.Peter Tertzakian of ARC Financial in Calgary says the investment in splitters is evidence that “the market is finding ways round the policy” of export restrictions.“They boil the oil a bit, and then they export the products.”Splitters are a cheaper option for processing oil compared with building new refineries which cost hundreds of millions, rather than billions of dollars, says Houston oil consultant Andy Lipow.Splitting is a simple procedure and the products will generally require further processing. About 445,000 barrels per day of processing capacity is planned or under construction in new splitters in the Gulf of Mexico region; an increase of about 5 per cent in the area’s refining capacity.Oil producers have been lobbying Washington to lift or amend the crude oil export ban. The Obama administration has launched a review of the policy and is looking at whether US refineries can absorb rising supplies.Most Americans would oppose crude oil exports if it meant petrol prices rose, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.Analysts believe the White House could start to allow increased exports of condensate. Many refineries on the Gulf coast have a limited ability to process condensate, meaning that it trades at a discount of $20 per barrel to benchmark Louisiana light crude, according to consultant RBN Energy.Greg Priddy, oil analyst at Eurasia Group, a research group, said the new splitters would keep the condensate surplus under control until at least 2015, or after congressional elections this autumn. “For the next couple of years it helps take the pressure off for any comprehensive action,” Mr Priddy said.As of late May, eight companies had announced plans to build condensate splitters, in addition to one running already at Port Arthur, Texas, said RBN. The total investment is more than $1bn.Valero Energy, one of the largest US refiners, is also building 160,000 barrels per day of similar facilities called topping units at its refineries in Texas, according to Afolabi Ogunnaike of Wood Mackenzie.However, the new units are likely to be profitable only if the export restrictions remain in place. If condensate exports were allowed, said Sandy Fielden, RBN Energy’s director of market analytics, “almost overnight these splitters [would] become questionable or redundant”.Martin Midstream Partners, an oil logistics company, recently halved the size of a planned splitter in the port of Corpus Christi, Texas, to 50,000 b/d. Its contracted shipper, an integrated oil company, is “very keen” on the question of the export ban, said Joe McCreery, vice-president of finance. “To the extent that our project has slowed, I think it’s their assessment of whether that ban is lifted or not.”Kinder Morgan, an oil pipeline and storage company, is building a $360m, 100,000 b/d splitter that BP will use when it opens in November. Targa Resources Partners plans a $115m, 35,000 b/d splitter with Hong Kong-based trading house Noble Group as a shipper.Magellan Midstream Partners is investing $250m to build a 50,000 b/d splitter at Corpus Christi, near the Eagle Ford region. Trafigura, the commodities trading house, has contracted the unit.Domestic condensate production has roughly doubled in the past three years to 1.2m b/d. It will reach 1.6m b/d by the end of 2018, RBN estimated. Condensate has “limited markets if it’s not allowed to be exported, which has led to the interest in splitters”, Michael Mears, Magellan chief executive, said in late May.If the White House liberalised condensate exports, some of the commodity would bypass US splitters for higher-paying refineries and petrochemical plants in Asia, Mr Fielden said.Lisa Murkowski, a Republican senator, has argued that the US Department of Commerce already has authority to allow condensate exports without involvement from the president."
42;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2013-10-10T22:08:28Z;New York Fed sued over Goldman oversight;;A former bank examiner filed a suit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Thursday, claiming she was fired after criticising Goldman Sachs for its policies on managing conflicts of interest.Carmen Segarra is suing the New York Fed and three of its officials in federal court in New York, claiming that her superiors interfered with her work examining Goldman and expressed concern that the bank would be harmed by her criticism.In the complaint, she said a New York Fed official “became concerned large numbers of consumers and clients would discontinue use of Goldman’s services if they knew Goldman had no effective way of managing conflicts of interest in financial transactions”.The lawsuit follows a conflict of interest storm that surrounded Goldman’s role in last year’s $38bn acquisition of El Paso, the oil and gas company, by Kinder Morgan, the pipeline operator.Goldman was the manager of funds holding 19 per cent of Kinder Morgan, with two directors on its board. The bank was also one of the advisers to El Paso.Ms Segarra’s complaint states that she was required to investigate conflicts around the deal but Goldman did not respond to her first request for documents and then said it was “very nervous” about producing them.In her complaint against the New York Fed and three of its employees, she said they had blocked her from asking Goldman questions and from making a finding that the bank had no firmwide policy to deal with conflicts of interest.The lawsuit shines a light on the inner workings of a normally opaque supervisory process. It includes confidential supervisory ratings for Goldman, which show that its board and senior management oversight was rated as “fair” in 2010 and 2011 – the same as most of its peers, whose names are blacked out in the table, but worse than three other banks.Goldman’s risk monitoring also receives a “fair” rating, the same as most other banks on the list, but some receive a higher rating of “satisfactory”.The complaint includes documents and transcripts of interviews from Goldman personnel in which they explain their policy on conflicts of interest. It also includes an email from Michael Silva, chief of staff and senior vice-president for the New York Fed’s executive group, admonishing Ms Segarra for not following regulatory procedure.In the email, Mr Silva said Goldman’s publicly available code of conduct demonstrated that her comments that it had no company-wide policy for conflicts of interest were “debatable at best, or alternatively, plainly incorrect”.On Thursday, Goldman said: “We have no knowledge of internal Fed discussions nor the matters raised by Ms Segarra. As we have described publicly in our Business Standards Committee report, Goldman Sachs has a comprehensive approach to addressing conflicts through firmwide and divisional policies and infrastructure.”Details that emerged after El Paso shareholders filed a lawsuit over the deal showed that the main Goldman banker advising El Paso, Stephen Daniels, had an investment in Kinder Morgan worth about $340,000.The lawsuit led to a sharp rebuke from Delaware Chancellor Leo Strine, and Kinder Morgan agreed to settle the case for $110m last year.The deal led Goldman to review its policies in regards to its bankers’ investments and how they are disclosed. Other banks at the time said they were also reviewing their procedures.At the time, responding to concerns about its role, Goldman said it had encouraged El Paso to get independent advice from another investment bank and Morgan Stanley had been hired. It said it was open with El Paso about its relationship with Kinder Morgan, and the Goldman directors on the Kinder board had recused themselves from discussions about the takeover.The New York Fed said on Thursday in response to the suit: “We cannot speak about individual employees out of privacy considerations, nor can we discuss supervised institutions as that would constitute confidential supervisory information.“Personnel decisions at the New York Fed are based exclusively on individual job performance and are subject to thorough review. We categorically reject any suggestions to the contrary.”
43;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2013-02-12T23:27:30Z;Veteran dealmaker to retire from Goldman;;Goldman Sachs is losing one of its best-known dealmakers with the retirement of Henry Cornell as vice-chairman of its merchant banking division, according to an internal memo distributed on Tuesday.The departure of Mr Cornell, 56, comes as Goldman is responding to new US rules that limit the investments it can make with its capital. Mr Cornell declined to comment and his plans were not disclosed by Goldman.Mr Cornell, who joined Goldman nearly 30 years ago, played a leading role in some of its most profitable investments on both sides of the Pacific – including those in Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, Kinder Morgan and McJunkin Red Man.“Henry is an exceptionally shrewd investor and because he gets along so well with people they would rather have him as a partner than anyone else,” said Steve Friedman, a retired Goldman chairman.Mr Cornell thrived during an era when Goldman raised giant private equity funds that included sizeable contributions from the bank and its employees.In 2006, for example, Goldman’s largest private equity fund, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners 6, had $20bn under management – including $8bn in the bank’s capital and $1bn in funds from employees.However, under the Dodd-Frank financial reform of 2010, banks are barred from investing more than 3 per cent of their tier one capital in any single hedge fund or private equity fund and cannot own more than 3 per cent of one of their funds.This has forced Goldman to change its strategy. Its latest private equity fund, which is focused on energy, has only about $1bn under management.During Mr Cornell’s career, Goldman’s investment efforts were also marked by its attempts to collaborate with big private equity firms. It joined with TPG to invest in Burger King and it invited Carlyle into the Kinder Morgan deal.The ICBC deal reflected Goldman’s experience in China. Long before most private equity firms planted their flags there, Goldman was investing in Chinese companies such as Ping An, the insurer.Many of the Goldman investments were so lucrative under Mr Cornell that bank executives joked that they amounted to college funds for their children.Mr Cornell was one of Goldman’s 221 partners at the time of its initial public offering in 1999. The overwhelming majority have since left.Additional reporting by Tracy Alloway and Tom Braithwaite in New York
44;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2013-01-30T08:18:15Z;Kinder acquires Copano Energy in $5bn deal;;"Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, the US gas and oil pipeline group, is acquiring Copano Energy, another US partnership that operates gas gathering and processing facilities, in an all-paper deal worth about $5bn.The acquisition, Kinder’s first big deal since the $38bn takeover of El Paso, announced in 2011, positions Kinder to benefit from the pressure on oil companies to cut the volume of gas that they burn off in flares.Copano has a joint venture with Kinder in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas, one of the most active areas in the US for new oil development, and is also active in the Woodford shale and Mississippi Lime regions of Oklahoma, widely seen as two of the most promising areas for the future.Over the past five years there has been a steep increase in the volume of unwanted gas flared off by US oil companies.The new oilfields opened up by the shale revolution are often in remote locations that are not connected up to gas infrastructure. This, coupled with the low price of gas caused by the shale gas boom, means it is often not commercially attractive to install it.However, oil companies are coming under pressure from environmental campaigners worried about the waste of resources and the pollution it causes, and many are setting targets to reduce their flaring.With gas gathering and processing facilities in several important oilfields, Copano is well-placed to benefit from companies deciding they need to make more productive use of their gas.Its services are also generally complementary to Kinder’s, operating at a more local level than Kinder’s pipelines, many of which cover long distances.The surge in US gas production has sent prices tumbling, straining the finances of many companies in the industry.However, Richard Kinder, Kinder Morgan’s chief executive, said: “We continue to be bullish on the domestic shale plays, and believe they will drive substantial future growth at [Kinder Morgan].”The terms of the deal are 0.4563 Kinder units for each one of Copano; a 23.5 per cent premium to the Copano share price on Tuesday night.Kinder said it expected the deal to start boosting its cash flow per share as soon as it is closed, which it is planning for the third quarter of 2013.One immediate gain will be enabling Copano to benefit from Kinder’s greater financial strength and investment-grade credit rating.Kinder was advised by Citi, while Copano was advised by Barclays and Jefferies."
45;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Shell joins project to export LNG from US;;Royal Dutch Shell has made its first move into plans to export liquefied natural gas from the US, joining a project planned by Kinder Morgan, the pipeline group, at Elba Island in Georgia.The company hopes to take advantage of cheap North American natural gas prices resulting from the surge in supply caused by the shale boom, which should make it profitable to sell LNG in international markets where prices are higher, even once liquefaction and transport costs are taken into account.Shell has been deliberating over whether to commit to investing in US LNG exports, and by joining an existing project it avoids going to the back of a long line of proposals seeking approval from the US Department of Energy.The Elba Island project received a licence last year to export LNG to countries with which the US has a free trade agreement, and applied in August to sell to countries with which there is no such agreement.There are now 17 projects that have made applications for licences for unrestricted LNG exports, of which only one, for Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass project, has so far been approved.A study commissioned by the energy department reported last year that allowing unlimited LNG exports would be a net benefit to the economy.However, Dow Chemical and other manufacturers have urged the government to go slowly in issuing further export licences, saying cheap North American natural gas should be preserved as an advantage for US industry.The department has said it will consider applications in the order in which they were received, with the Elba Island project in the middle of the pack.
46;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-10-31T18:42:24Z;Petrol prices surge in hurricane’s aftermath;;Benchmark petrol prices surged in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy as power outages in the New York region threatened to stall deliveries of the fuel.Nymex November reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, futures rose as much as 7.7 per cent to $2.9375 per gallon on Wednesday, the contract’s final day of trading.It was the second time since September that futures soared upon expiry.Nymex gasoline and heating oil futures require delivery in New York harbour, a network of rivers and bays lined by oil storage terminals that were without electricity and in some cases damaged after Sandy scoured the US east coast.“You can’t make delivery if your terminal is shut,” said Andy Lipow, president of consultancy Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.NuStar Energy reported “significant high-water damage” to its harbour and storage terminal in Linden, New Jersey, while its truck rack terminal lost power.Motiva, a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell, said its terminals in New York and New Jersey were flooded and without power. It had not yet set a restart date.Kinder Morgan shut down its northeast terminals, which include locations in New Jersey, as they were without electricity.Meanwhile, Phillips 66 said its 238,000 barrel-per-day Bayway refinery in New Jersey and three storage terminals were shut down, though power was restored to the refinery.PBF Energy said its refineries in southern New Jersey and Delaware “ran well through the storm”.The shutdowns come amid low stocks of petrol and distillates such as diesel in central Atlantic states. Stock levels have declined after some refineries closed down operations in the face of weak fuel demand and costly crude.The structure of the futures market has also discouraged traders from keeping excess petrol in tanks as spot prices maintain a premium to prices for deliveries made in the future.This premium widened sharply this week as Sandy arrived with November gasoline rising 4.9 per cent and gasoline for delivery in December climbing 0.4 per cent.“When you have prices this high, you want to minimise your carrying costs,” said Kevin Lindemer, a refining industry consultant.Nymex November heating oil fell 0.6 per cent to $3.0687 on Wednesday.
47;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-09-07T23:49:37Z;Kinder to pay El Paso investors $110m;;Shareholders in El Paso, the oil and gas company that was bought by pipeline operator Kinder Morgan earlier this year, have won $110m from the company to resolve a legal action over alleged conflicts of interest.The case has become a touchstone for critics who say big investment banks are often conflicted when making deals. The settlement is the largest ever to resolve such a case relating to the takeover of one company by another.Three pension funds had led a legal action in Delaware highlighting the role of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, as both the manager of funds holding 19 per cent of Kinder Morgan, with two directors on its board, and one of the advisers to El Paso.Kinder Morgan said in a statement that it believed the takeover had benefited both its own shareholders and El Paso’s, but “the company believes that resolving these claims at this time, avoiding the expense and uncertainty of continued litigation, and putting this matter behind it are in the best interest of its shareholders”.The agreed cash and shares takeover, valuing El Paso at $38bn including debt, was announced in October last year and was swiftly followed by a slew of legal actions.Ruling on the deal in February, Delaware chancellor Leo Strine called Goldman Sachs’ handling of its conflicts “incomplete and inadequate”.He lambasted the bank and El Paso for “debatable negotiating and tactical choices,” but allowed the merger to proceed, arguing that there was no better option available for El Paso’s shareholders.At an investor meeting in March, 95 per cent of the votes cast went to approve the deal, which closed in May. The stock element left El Paso’s shareholders with 32 per cent of the merged group.Responding to concerns about its role, Goldman Sachs has said that it had encouraged El Paso to get independent advice from another investment bank and Morgan Stanley had been hired. It said that it was transparent with El Paso about its relationship with Kinder Morgan and the Goldman directors on the Kinder board had recused themselves from discussions about the takeover.However, Mr Strine criticised Morgan Stanley’s role, because the bank was hired under terms that meant it would be paid its fee only if the deal went through.Goldman Sachs declined to comment on Friday.
48;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-06-13T19:09:55Z;Banks resort to ‘block’ offerings;;Banks are taking on the risk of issuing shares on behalf of companies through “block” offerings as they seek to drive volume in equity capital markets with US initial public offerings stuck in the doldrums.Excluding Facebook’s listing, just $12.3bn has been raised in US IPOs this year, less than half the amount raised by the same point in 2011, according to Dealogic, as stresses in the eurozone have dulled investor enthusiasm for new share issuance.Banks have responded by offering already-listed companies the chance to sell new shares without them having to take on market risk. In so-called “block share” offerings, banks purchase new shares from companies at a discount to the prevailing stock price, and take responsibility for selling those new shares into the market.So far this year, block offerings have accounted for 17 per cent of all equity capital market activity, according to Dealogic, the highest share since records began in 1995.The surge has been driven by the desire of private equity companies to cash in stakes in public companies without undergoing a prolonged investor roadshow.It has also been driven by volatility in equity markets, which has forced several companies to delay IPOs or secondary offerings of shares, after markets fell sharply in recent weeks. By issuing in blocks to banks, companies are guaranteed to sell shares.Last week, Kinder Morgan, the energy pipeline company, which is partly owned by Goldman Sachs and private equity groups Riverstone Holdings and Carlyle Group, sold shares worth more than $2bn in a deal exclusively underwritten by Barclays.That was the largest block share issuance underwritten by a single institution since 2003, according to Dealogic, and suggests banks’ appetite to take on market risk may be increasing.Banks typically demand a discount of up to 10 per cent on the company’s closing share price, and look to sell all shares before the market opens the next day.However, banks may be being forced to accept smaller discounts, as the market becomes more competitive.“On the margin, pricing for blocks is incrementally more competitive this year than it has been the last two. That is partly a result of companies issuing shares bringing more banks to the table,” said Brad Miller, global co-head of equity syndicate at Deutsche Bank.By pricing aggressively, banks risk being left with unsold shares. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were both left holding shares after they failed to attract sufficient buyers for block offerings by European companies this year.Banks are not allowed to market block offerings to buyers before a company instructs them to sell shares. But banks do field inquiries from interested buyers, especially to purchase shares in companies that private equity groups are known to be planning to exit.
49;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-04-27T13:53:46Z;Lazard profits hit by mounting expenses;;Lazard reported a slump in first-quarter earnings but record revenue after the independent investment bank worked several large financial deals.Adjusted operating revenue rose 9 per cent to a record $499m in the first three months of the year, Lazard said on Friday. Adjusted net income fell 23 per cent to $45m in the period as expenses increased. However, the lower net income equated to earnings of 33 cents a share, still exceeding analysts’ estimates of 24 cents.The company competes with other independent investment banks, such as Evercore and Rothschild, for mergers and acquisitions business, as well as other financial advisory work. But Lazard is also believed to be stealing some market share from larger bulge-bracket firms such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.“We feel we are in a good position vis a vis the large firms,” Matthieu Bucaille, Lazard chief financial officer, said in an interview. “There’s been a number of rulings that have shown the potential conflict of the larger [investment banks] and we’re a conflict-free advisory firm.”Earlier this year a US judge criticised Goldman’s role on the $38bn merger between energy companies El Paso Corp and Kinder Morgan. The Delaware judge lambasted the company’s conflicts of interest in the merger, sparking a wider debate about the role of big banks in M&A and other deal-orientated work.Lazard has advised on recent M&A transactions including the sale of European Goldfields to Eldorado Gold for about $2.4bn and Skandia Liv’s £2.1bn acquisition of Skandia AB from Old Mutual. The bank also advised the Greek government on its bond exchange – one of the largest in history.“The macroeconomic environment has improved since last summer but remains uncertain,” Kenneth Jacobs, chairman and chief executive said in a statement. “If this improvement continues, strategic advisory activity will likely increase.”Revenue at Lazard’s advisory business, where the bank works on M&A and restructurings, rose more than a fifth to a record $277m. Asset management revenue fell 6 per cent compared with the first quarter of 2011.But the rise in revenue was not enough to overcome an increase in costs. Compensation expenses rose 16 per cent to $313m, which excludes a $25m charge related to severance pay for departing staff. Other operating costs rose 13 per cent to $105m.Mr Bucaille said: “Our revenues were strong in the first quarter, but, as previously reported, earnings are being impacted by the high level of amortisation expense from previous years’ deferred compensation.”On Thursday, Evercore said its first-quarter adjusted net income slumped 62 per cent after three big deals failed to close during the period and expenses also crept higher.
50;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-04-10T15:22:50Z;Goldman’s co-head of M&A retires;;Yoel Zaoui, one of Goldman Sachs’ most senior dealmakers, is leaving the US investment bank after a 24-year career advising on some of the biggest deals in global mergers and acquisitions.Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, announced the move to employees in a memo on Tuesday that highlighted Mr Zaoui’s “critical role” in building its investment banking franchise in Europe.The Morocco-born 51-year-old will not be replaced. Gene Sykes, who co-heads the team based in Los Angeles, will assume sole responsibility for Goldman’s M&A group.Mr Zaoui’s departure comes just a year after he was appointed co-head of global M&A in a reshuffle of senior positions as Goldman sought to repair client relationships that frayed during its public battles with regulators and politicians in the wake of the financial crisis.More recently, Goldman’s M&A practice drew scrutiny following its work on a $38bn tie-up between El Paso Corp and Kinder Morgan. A US judge criticised Goldman’s conflicts of interest on the deal, sparking a wider debate about the role of big banks in M&A and a review of practices at Goldman.Mr Zaoui is known for advising steel company Mittal in its hostile $40bn takeover of Arcelor in 2006.At the time, the French company was advised by his older brother Michael Zaoui, then chairman of European M&A at Morgan Stanley. The siblings have worked alongside each other in other deals, including when they advised Elf Aquitaine in 1999 to defend the French oil group against a hostile takeover from rival Total Fina and in 2004 when they acted as defence advisers for Aventis, the French drugmaker, against a hostile takeover by rival Sanofi.Mr Zaoui, who was promoted to co-head of European investment banking in 2004 and was also a partner at the New York-based bank, may help advise Goldman on an ad hoc basis.His departure is the third this year from the senior ranks of the M&A team, following the retirement of Luca Ferrari, who worked on Glencore’s proposed merger with Xstrata. George Matteson, a top dealmaker for industrial companies, announced his retirement in February.A number of other Goldman partners – including two former co-heads of securities trading – have also left in recent months.Additional reporting by Tom Braithwaite in New York
51;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-03-27T00:22:10Z;Michaels Stores looks towards IPO;;Michaels Stores, the subject of a leveraged buyout by a private equity consortium at the height of the credit boom, is now looking to tap buoyant equity markets to return to public control.The US retailer of arts and crafts products was taken private in a $6bn deal led by Blackstone Group and Bain Capital in 2006.It has been preparing to file paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as next week, according to people familiar with the company’s plans. It was expected to name JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs as lead underwriters, these people also said. The size of the offering was not yet known, nor its sought-for valuation.Michaels’ public debut would mark a revival of large private equity exits. Following a surge of big exits at the beginning of last year, which included IPOs by HCA, Kinder Morgan and Nielsen, the market quieted for much of the remainder of the year.There are still dozens of deals waiting for public debuts, including Toys R Us, the US children’s retailer. Caesars Entertainment made a nominal float earlier this year, but is still waiting for a larger sale and an exit for its largest investors.But last week’s debut of Allison Transmission, which produces engine components for large vehicles, was successful, with the number of shares sold expanded after strong interest during the company’s investor roadshow, and that has raised hopes for more. Allison raised $600m, pricing in the middle of its range, at $23 a share. The stock was trading at $24 at the close on Monday.Rexnord, a maker of transmissions controlled by Apollo Global Management, is set to sell shares this week. It is seeking to raise as much as $500m, which would value the business at as much as $1.9bn. It was taken private for $1.9bn in 2006.Michaels survived difficult years during the financial crisis, losing money in 2008 and 2009 and strained under heavy financial leverage, according to non-audited financial statements the company publicly releases.Earnings have rebounded in recent years, with the company producing net income of $176m last year, versus $103m the previous year. Net sales in 2011 were $4.2bn, up 4.4 per cent from the prior year.“Michaels represents an affordable luxury,” said Gary Stibel, chief executive of the New England Consulting Group. “But with gasoline prices going higher and the potential for inflation, this may represent the best window for a deal.”The deal was initially reported by Reuters.Michaels’ debt load is still heavy. The company carries $3.5bn in net debt versus adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of $622m. That is a leverage ratio of roughly 5.7 times, below the company’s peak level of over 12 times in 2007.However, it is producing cash flow to cover the cost of debt. It produced $357m in free cash flow last year, against $276m in interest expense.
52;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-03-16T22:11:14Z;New York mayor backs Goldman chief;;Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, said on Friday that not even God could lead Goldman Sachs without criticism, as he defended the investment bank’s head after a rare attack from within its own ranks.Goldman has been battling a stream of negative press since Greg Smith, a middle-ranking derivatives salesman, resigned on Tuesday, publicly accusing Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive, of presiding over a “toxic” culture in which bankers were “ripping off clients” and referring to customers as “muppets”.Mr Bloomberg said the attack on Mr Blankfein was ridiculous. “He’s trying to lead this firm at a time when God couldn’t lead it without being criticised,” the billionaire mayor, who started his own career as an investment banker, told the Financial Times.Mr Blankfein, who once said the bank was “doing God’s work” but later expressed regret over the comment, has remained silent in public over the latest blow to its reputation.The bank faced controversy earlier this month over its role as an adviser in a $38bn merger of two energy companies. It said on Friday it was reviewing whether there should be a formal process for bankers to disclose personal stock holdings to clients after a judge criticised its “conflicts of interest” advising on the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan.Mr Bloomberg said Goldman had made him his first job offer in 1966, although he turned down the $14,000-a-year position in favour of a $9,000 salary at Salomon Brothers, a rival investment bank. The mayor said Mr Smith’s allegations did not seem fair. “Most of the clients of the big firms are professionals,” he said. “Buyers of mortgage securities were not little old ladies.”The New York mayor, who founded one of the world’s biggest financial news and data organisations which counts Goldman among its clients, said “someday you can tell me” why The New York Times published the article, adding that it was “beyond me”.That view was echoed by James Gorman, chief executive of Goldman rival Morgan Stanley, who also attacked the newspaper for publishing Mr Smith’s unsolicited article.“To pick a random employee, I just don’t think it’s fair and I didn’t think it was balanced,” he said at an event hosted by Fortune magazine. “There but for the grace of God go us.”The review of Goldman’s processes for disclosing bankers’ conflicts with clients is likely to spark similar studies at other big dealmaking banks. Goldman advised El Paso on its merger with Kinder Morgan even though the bank’s private equity arm owned a 19 per cent stake in the latter company and held two seats on its board.A Delaware judge said earlier this month that while the bank laid bare its Kinder Morgan stake to the company, Goldman’s lead banker on the deal failed to disclose his ownership of about $340,000 worth of Kinder Morgan stock. That was “a very troubling failure”, the judge said.
53;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-03-15T20:07:46Z;Rivals fear Goldman backlash on Wall St;;Wall Street’s concern over the latest public outcry at Goldman Sachs was underscored when the head of one of its biggest rivals warned his senior staff not to exploit the “alleged issues” surrounding the investment bank.In response to a stinging article on Goldman Sachs’s business practices written by a departing derivatives salesman at the bank, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, emailed his colleagues on the bank’s operating committee. “Today’s New York Times op-ed by a Goldman Sachs executive is generating a lot of discussion around the street. I want to be clear that I don’t want anyone here to seek advantage from a competitor’s alleged issues or hearsay – ever,” he wrote. “It’s not the way we do business …We respect our competitors, and our focus should be on doing the best we can to continually strengthen our own standards.”The article on Goldman Sachs by Greg Smith, published in the New York Times on Wednesday, criticised Lloyd Blankfein, its chief executive, and Gary Cohn, president, for presiding over a culture that had turned “toxic”, with bankers exploiting their clients. In a memo to staff, Mr Blankfein and Mr Cohn said that the article did “not reflect our values [or] our culture”.It comes shortly after Goldman was criticised by a judge for conflicts of interest in the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan, the energy companies, and almost two years after Goldman was accused of defrauding clients by the Securities and Exchange Commission.As JPMorgan operating committee members sent the email on to their division’s employees, the memo, which had not been intended for public consumption, gained a wider audience.Mr Dimon and Mr Blankfein are two of the few survivors of the financial crisis. Former peers such as Lehman Brothers’ Dick Fuld and Bear Stearns’ James Cayne lost their jobs as their banks failed.Mr Dimon’s observation that the article by Mr Smith was “generating a lot of discussion” around Wall Street continued to be true – though few at rival firms were pleased with the fallout. One said that Mr Smith’s accusations would end up hurting the reputation of the industry broadly rather than Goldman exclusively.Additional reporting by Tracy Alloway in New York
54;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Wall St watches automotive group’s IPO;;"The initial public offering of Allison Transmission, the automotives group, which is expected to raise $500m later this week, will be closely watched as a critical indicator of the US IPO market’s health.Though Facebook is the major event of the calendar this year, investors and bankers say they are more carefully watching deals such as Allison to gauge investors’ broader belief in the economy and the capital raising market.“If Allison is well received, it might be the beginning of a trend for industrial groups,” said a senior banker. “For the broader IPO market, that is far more significant than Facebook and social networking.”There have been isolated strong performances in the US listing market such as Yelp, the business reviews website and mobile app, but it is still trailing volumes at this point last year, with 32 deals raising $4bn, versus last year’s 47 deals raising $19.4bn.The notable absence has been large private equity firms’ sales of shares in companies taken private during the credit boom in 2005-07. Private equity-backed companies still make up 56 per cent of the pipeline, according to PwC.Last year, a handful of large deals made it back into public hands. The three largest US IPOs in 2011 were private equity non-technology companies: HCA, the hospital chain; Kinder Morgan, the energy pipeline operator; and Nielsen, the media measurement group.But many big deals are still stuck, even though they have been on file to list for some time. That includes Avaya, the telecoms group, and Toys R Us, the retail chain. Caesar’s, the lossmaking casino group, made a nominal flotation last month, but only to provide liquidity to a small group of minority investors.Allison, a manufacturer of automatic transmissions and other parts for large vehicles, is the first such leveraged buyout deal to come forward with a full-on IPO this year.It is also the first private-equity backed deal of some size that is not a deleveraging. In the offering, the company plans to sell no shares to pay-down debt. Only its shareholders, including private equity firms Carlyle Group and Onex Corporation, are selling shares.“Stabilising the capital structure allows the sponsor to realise a higher equity valuation and to monetise their investment,” said Reuben Daniels, partner at EA Markets, a capital markets consultancy. “The market feels pretty solid right now.”The company, which is expected to be valued at up to $4.3bn in the IPO, turned a $103m profit last year on net sales of $2.2bn. It still has $3.6bn of long-term debt, a legacy of its buyout. But Standard & Poor’s, which rates the company’s credit at B-plus, describes its risk as “fair”, with a manageable ratio of 3.2 times net debt times cash flow. Allison expects to pay a 6 cent per share dividend in the second quarter.Allison plans on putting the proceeds to continuing to grow in developing markets such as India and China, where few buses use automatic transmissions.“Greasy transmissions are not exactly cloud-based computing companies, but they are a key part of an economic recovery,” said Scott Sweet of IPO Boutique, an investor advisory."
55;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-03-09T19:30:44Z;El Paso shareholders approve Kinder tie-up;;Shareholders of El Paso Corp have voted to accept a $38bn merger with Kinder Morgan, while leaving the door open to claiming damages after a US judge found Goldman Sachs had a conflict of interest as an adviser on the deal.The Delaware judge decided not to block energy company Kinder Morgan’s takeover of pipeline operator El Paso last week, after shareholders filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent the deal.But the judge hit out at potential conflicts of interest surrounding the merger and Goldman’s involvement in the transaction.The Wall Street bank advised El Paso even though its private equity arm owned a 19 per cent, or $4bn, stake in Kinder Morgan and held two seats on the Houston-based company’s board.The case has prompted a lively debate about the role of Wall Street banks in M&A. Detractors labelled the El Paso deal as another example of banks operating against the interests of their clients. Others argued that banking relationships are a key reason why companies hire them as advisers.The judge, Chancellor Leo Strine, said in his decision filed last week that Goldman was in a position to “exert influence” over the El Paso-Kinder Morgan merger. While the bank laid bare its conflict to the company, Goldman’s lead banker on the deal failed to disclose his ownership of about $340,000 worth of Kinder Morgan stock, which was “a very troubling failure”, the Delaware-based judge said.But most shareholders on Friday appeared to dismiss the judge’s concerns, with 79 per cent approving the takeover, according to preliminary results from the special meeting. Of shares voted, more than 95 per cent were in favour of the merger, the company said in a statement.“We are pleased that our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the pending merger with Kinder Morgan,” Doug Foshee, chairman and chief executive officer of El Paso, said in the statement.However, Chancellor Strine said that despite the “substantial” 47.8 per cent premium offered to El Paso shareholders by Kinder Morgan, investors could seek damages because of the conflict of interest.“This doesn’t end the story because the chancellor talked about damages. The issue is how much did investors get and did they get a fair price?” said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. “That will be a decision for another day.”Kinder Morgan’s proposed purchase of El Paso, which ranked among the largest deals of 2011, was a bet by the Houston-based oil and gas pipeline company on the growth of gas supplies in the US.“The real issue is, do the people making the decisions know about the conflict? Has the conflict been disclosed and is it understood?” said a senior M&A lawyer and partner at a large New York law firm, who declined to be named because like many legal firms, his company does work with Goldman.“The mere fact that it’s a conflict does not mean that there is a problem in and of itself,” the lawyer said. “The reality is that this is not the Goldman from 50 years ago where it’s just 35 partners. We’re talking about a big public company with many different teams and many different motivations.”Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui in London.
56;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-03-01T09:32:33Z;Kinder Morgan’s El Paso deal clears hurdle;;A US judge has decided not to block Kinder Morgan’s $38bn takeover of pipeline operator El Paso but hit out at potential conflicts of interest around the deal, criticising the behaviour of Goldman Sachs and the chief executive of El Paso as “disturbing”.Chancellor Leo Strine said on Wednesday that “although Goldman’s conflict was known, inadequate efforts to cabin its role were made”, adding that the investment bank did not step back from the process once another adviser was brought in to help mitigate its conflict.However, he declined to block the deal, pointing out that there was no other bid for El Paso and that shareholders themselves have a chance to vote against the transaction. The judge also noted the 47.8 per cent premium implied by Kinder Morgan’s cash and stock offer at the time of announcement.Chancellor Strine said in his opinion on the lawsuit brought by El Paso investors that shareholders, slated to vote on the offer next week, “should not be deprived of the chance to decide for themselves about the merger, despite the disturbing nature of some of the behaviour leading to its terms”.He noted they still had a chance to prove that the deal was “tainted by disloyalty” because Goldman, who was advising El Paso, had a 19 per cent stake in Kinder Morgan, while Douglas Foshee, El Paso’s chief executive who negotiated the deal, had allegedly disguised his interest in buying back its exploration and production assets.The defendants in the shareholder lawsuit have denied any wrongdoing.Goldman said in statement: “We respect the judge’s opinion but want to be clear that we stood by our client through this process encouraging them to get independent views from another adviser. We were also transparent with El Paso about our relationship with Kinder Morgan and the related issues.”El Paso hired Morgan Stanley as an independent adviser on the deal.El Paso on Wednesday welcomed the decision to let shareholders vote on the deal but said it “respectfully disagrees” with some of the judge’s findings.Goldman, through its private equity arm, owned 19 per cent of Kinder Morgan and controlled two board seats after participating in a leveraged buy-out of the company in 2007.Kinder Morgan’s purchase of El Paso last October, which ranked among the largest of 2011, was a bet by the Houston-based oil and gas pipeline company on the growth of gas supplies in North America, bolstering its operations in the leading areas for US shale gas production. The group intended to keep El Paso’s pipeline assets, linking key producing areas with markets for consumption of natural gas, but sell its exploration and production business.A group of investors led by private equity group Apollo Management last week agreed to buy those assets from Kinder Morgan for $7.2bn. The Kinder Morgan deal valued El Paso, which had previously said it would split its upstream operations from its pipeline assets, at about $21bn, or $38bn including debt.Chancellor Strine, known for his trenchant criticism in opinions of this kind, objected to the conduct of Goldman and Mr Foshee, saying that each had reasons not to push for the highest price possible from Kinder Morgan. The judge homed in on Kinder Morgan’s decision to reduce its offer during negotiations, lowering the deal value by about $534m.
57;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2012-02-25T00:05:01Z;Apollo agrees $7.2bn deal for El Paso unit;;A group led by Apollo Global Management, the private equity group, has agreed a deal for El Paso Corp’s oil and gas exploration unit for $7.15bn.Friday’s deal rivals the $7.2bn acquisition of Samson Investment, another oil and gas exploration company, by KKR in November, the largest buy-out in the US since the financial crisis and would mark a revival in dealmaking by private equity as the economy recovers.The buy-out team also includes Access Industries, founded by Len Blavatnik, and Riverstone Holdings, another private equity group focused on energy investment.Apollo is considering raising $5.5bn of debt to fund the purchase, according to people familiar with the situation.“Apollo is acquiring a company with an impressive portfolio of valuable natural resource assets, a talented management team and a remarkable group of highly skilled employees,” said Josh Harris, senior managing director at Apollo.Kinder Morgan, the US oil and gas pipeline company, agreed to buy El Paso in October last year for $38bn, including debt, creating the fourth-largest energy company in North America by enterprise value.The deal with Apollo marks a success for Houston-based Kinder Morgan, which wanted to sell the exploration business in a single piece to help finance the buy-out, although the price is likely to be below some analysts’ expectations. Valuations for gas assets have suffered as prices for the fuel have continued to decline as a result of growth in the production from shale reserves.“We are pleased that this pending sale will allow the El Paso exploration and production assets to be kept intact as a single entity,” said Richard D. Kinder, Kinder Morgan’s chairman and chief executive.
58;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Evercore reports record earnings;;Evercore Partners, the independent investment bank, reported a record set of full-year earnings, fuelling speculation that deals work may be moving away from the larger bulge-bracket banks.Though the company’s founder, former deputy US Treasury secretary Roger Altman, refuses to label the firm a “boutique investment bank”, market watchers could interpret the results as a potential indicator of the sector’s rapid rise.“Evercore is no longer a boutique. We passed away from that category three or four years ago,” said Mr Altman, who is also co-chair of the company. “But there are some folks who follow this industry that still classify us in that group. And if you look at it that way, we literally did five times more M&A business this year than the second-most active [boutique] firm.”The firm’s revenues surpassed $500m for the first time in its 16-year history, after winning high-profile deals including advising Kinder Morgan on its $37.6bn takeover of El Paso Corp. Evercore also advised on the $58.9bn restructuring of AIG’s preferred stock, one of the biggest deals of the year.Some of Evercore’s deals failed to come to fruition, with competition authorities blocking Nasdaq’s offer for the New York Stock Exchange and a merger between AT&T and T-Mobile.Adjusted earnings jumped 29 per cent to $14.1m in the fourth quarter of last year, or 32 cents a share, taking full-year profit to the record $63m. Analysts had expected 28 cents a share for the fourth quarter, helping boost shares of the company a quarter per cent to $29.31 in early New York trading.On a statutory basis the firm recorded net income of $13.0m for 2011, down from $19.6m in 2010.Boutique advisers were involved in 16 per cent of US M&A volumes during 2008 and 2009, according to a November presentation from Evercore. In 2000, they had only 3 per cent of the market.Unlike larger banks, Evercore has been hiring throughout the crisis – adding Britain’s Lexicon Partners to help expand into Europe, and a 45 per cent stake in ABS Investment Management.A sluggish start to the new year has worried some bankers, though Thursday’s news of an $80bn deal between Glencore and Xstrata is likely to raise hopes of a busy year. M&A volumes in January were at their lowest levels since 2003, with just $102.9bn worth of deals announced globally – nearly half the level announced at the same time last year, according to data provider S&P Capital IQ. The fall in activity has been most marked in the US, where only $34.2bn worth of deals was announced.But Mr Altman forecast a “solid” year for M&A deals, citing low interest rates, improving business conditions and “pretty good” levels of management confidence.“At this very moment, the outlook for 2012 on an industry-wide basis would seem to be solid,” said Mr Altman. “You have the major ingredients in place for higher levels of M&A.”
59;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-12-27T16:34:49Z;Carlyle in $15bn return to investors;;Carlyle returned a record $15bn to investors during the first nine months of 2011, an amount equal to the combined payments made by private equity rivals Blackstone, KKR and TPG during the same period.The bumper return is particularly striking as Carlyle is planning to list on the stock market as soon as market conditions for initial public offerings improve. One of the main metrics by which private equity firms are valued is the size of assets under management.After Carlyle’s $15bn return, the group still raised assets under management from $107bn at the end of last year to around $148bn, a level partly boosted by acquisitions.Carlyle was able to exit investments to return cash to investors early in the year before market conditions deteriorated in recent months as the eurozone crisis intensified.“Other private equity firms had more pessimistic views of the world in the beginning of 2011,” a top investor in many big private equity funds said. “So they should have been more aggressive in taking advantage of market windows to cash out. But they did not. Nobody was as aggressive as Carlyle in returning money to investors.”According to letters sent to investors and seen by the Financial Times, Carlyle returned $15bn while TPG gave investors $4bn in the first nine months of the year. Meanwhile on recent earnings calls, Blackstone and KKR executives said they had returned $6bn and $5bn respectively.Carlyle’s exits this year include stock sales of China Pacific Insurance, which raised $2.7bn, and Kinder Morgan, the US energy group that raised $1.5bn. It also sold stakes in companies such as Dunkin Brands, and sold firms such as Moncler, an Italian maker of high end sportswear to a strategic buyer.In its third quarter end letter to its investors Carlyle noted: “We are not forced sellers and we maintain the flexibility to exit our investments at our discretion. We have historically chosen the ‘right’ time to exit.”Carlyle’s ability to returns funds to investors is aided by its structure. It operates dozens of funds targeted at individual geographic regions and sectors, which has enabled it to seize on local market windows when they appear.However, adept it has been at exploiting those opportunities, Carlyle has been less nimble in the timing of its own public debut, in part because of the length of time it has taken to do the preliminary work. It is waiting for equity markets to improve before pressing ahead with its IPO.
60;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-12-06T00:01:07Z;Overview: Hunt for raw power fuels dealmaking;Resources deals have accounted for nearly a third of M&A so far this year – but the right ones can still be hard to find. By Anousha Sakoui;"The mergers and acquisitions market has been dominated by the resources sector over the past year, as some of the biggest and most cash-rich companies in the world have taken advantage of their relatively stronger balance sheets to seize attractive assets.Resources deals accounted for 31.6 per cent of global M&A, with some $753.65bn worth of deals to November 29, up 20 per cent on the same period last year. Notably, however, the number of deals decreased from 8,450 to 7,799, according to Thomson Reuters.Energy and power companies generated $453.4bn worth of deals to November 29, up 7 per cent on the same period last year, accounting for 19 per cent of total global M&A.Oil and gas provided the biggest share of resources sector deals and some of the year’s largest deals, including Duke Energy’s $25.8bn acquisition of Progress Energy, and the decision by Kinder Morgan, the US oil and gas pipeline company, to buy El Paso Corporation for $38bn, which created the fourth-largest energy company in North America by enterprise value.“The oil majors have built up mountains of cash,” says Mian Zaheen, global head of oil and gas at Lazard, the investment bank. “Their intent may be to do big deals but their opportunities are few. There are a lot of companies running the ruler over targets but the deals are difficult to execute in the current climate.”Some explorers have been seeking to reduce their exposure to certain geographies – such as UK-listed BG Group and Anadarko, the US independent explorer, in Brazil – thus freeing up funds to exploit finds elsewhere.Another driver of deals in the sector has been the rush for alternative forms of oil and gas. Five of the top 10 largest deals in the third quarter of 2011 involved shale, according to a study by PwC, the professional services firm.Small explorers have found themselves vulnerable to takeover as funding for risky projects has dried up in the wake of the financial crisis. One recent example was Dominion Petroleum, an east African explorer, which agreed a takeover by the UK’s Ophir Energy for £118m ($186m).As executives from the mining and metals industry met in London recently for the annual London Metal Exchange LME Week gathering, the focus was also on dealmaking. Mining has accounted for 5.2 per cent of global dealmaking by value up to November 10, the highest share since 2005, according to Mergermarket data.The mining sector has seen deals worth $99.4bn up to November 10, putting the industry on track to match the annual record of $114.4bn set in 2006.Executives and bankers say copper, iron ore and coking coal have been particular targets as companies bet that prices would remain strong.“We expect to see an increasing investment in physical resources; an acceleration in cross-border activity, both organic and by way of acquisition; increasing demand for access to capital, including from alternative providers; and a recycling of capital, via asset sales and domestic listings,” says Alan Brown, global co-head of the natural resources group at Deutsche Bank.For some, the low market valuations open up the opportunity for a first foray into mining. Qatar Holding, an arm of the Gulf state’s sovereign wealth fund, has been planning to create a standalone investment vehicle to buy stakes in, or take over, gold companies. It aims to invest about $10bn in metals and mining. In October, it completed its first deal in gold, setting itself up to become the largest shareholder in European Goldfields after agreeing to lend the company $750m to fund the development of flagship mines in Greece.Analysts expect deals in the gold sector to increase in 2012, as the industry generates record levels of cash margins, the outlook for the gold price remains positive and stock market valuations remain low.“The mining sector had a very positive start to the year, with continued rises in underlying commodity prices supporting a strong flow of M&A transactions in sub-sectors such as iron ore, copper and gold,” says Richard Horrocks-Taylor, head of mining and metals at RBC. “However, by March/April the market began to turn, and since August the market turmoil has provided much cheaper acquisition opportunities for those still willing to pursue transactions.”Lee Downham, lead partner in Ernst & Young’s global mining and metals team, says M&A behaviour is being driven by mid-market deals under $1bn, rather than the larger transformational deals seen at the market’s peak in 2006 and 2007.“The large transformational deals were largely debt-financed and pushed a number of mining companies into 60-70 per cent leverage, which going into the global financial crisis proved to be a major burden,” says Mr Downham. “There is an obvious reluctance to go back to that level of gearing with the financial market still in a perilous state, and the result is a more prudent approach to M&A.”Catherine Raw, natural resources portfolio manager at BlackRock, the fund manager, says: “Big deals are unlikely to happen in the short term because of the conservatism of boards since the financial crisis, and after some past deals left balance sheets very stretched. Boards across the mining industry are very bruised.”Market volatility remains a stumbling block for dealmaking. “Management are quite rightly looking to price over a 20-30 year horizon for long-life assets but are financing against a market value that seems to be driven by much shorter-term economics,” says Mr Downham. “It’s incredibly difficult to justify a move when you know that the valuation of your target could move by 10 per cent or more in any given week.”The continuing influx of resource sector companies to the London market has also been the topic of debate in recent months. UK investors have been concerned about levels of liquidity in newly listed stocks, accounting standards and corporate governance.However, the year has seen initial public offerings from the sector such as Vallares, the cash shell run by financier Nat Rothschild and former BP boss Tony Hayward. Within a few months, Vallares acquired a stake in Genel Enerji, a Turkish company with oil interests in Kurdistan. The deal followed a similar transaction led by Mr Rothschild for another cash shell he backed, called Vallar, which bought a stake in Bumi, the Indonesian coal producer.Meanwhile, Evraz, the Russian steelmaker, saw its shares soar when it sought a listing in London. And UralKali, the world’s largest potash producer by volume, Polymetal, a gold and silver producer, and Polyus Gold, a Russian miner, are all among the resource companies expected to list in London in coming months, underlining the capital’s central role in the sector."
61;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-12-01T22:15:41Z;Enron: 10 years after;The energy trader’s crimes should not be minimised, but ...;Here’s a take you may not hear elsewhere on the 10th anniversary of Enron’s collapse – the company also left a positive legacy. In some circles that is tantamount to noting that Joseph Stalin had some virtues too, but keep reading.Enron and its leaders utterly transformed the buying and selling of electricity and natural gas, leaving a lasting legacy. This was not out of altruism, of course – it made tremendous (mostly legitimate) profits. Tens of billions of dollars in lasting benefits that trickle down to utility customers were also unlocked through its innovations. This is because risks were taken and infrastructure fully utilised that would not have been otherwise for lack of financial techniques to do so. And, though Enron is blamed for the fallout from energy deregulation such as California’s brownouts and soaring commodity prices, much of the fault lies elsewhere – with shortsighted politicians, for example.So were they really the smartest guys in the room? The evidence certainly is mixed. A decade on, companies formed out of their unwanted assets – such as EOG Resources and Kinder Morgan – are success stories while Messrs Lay, Fastow and Skilling are dead, disgraced and incarcerated, respectively. And companies such as Dynegy and Reliant that mimicked Enron’s swashbuckling, asset-light strategy nearly went bust as a result. But many veterans of the energy trading boom that Enron and its competitors spawned have gone on to make fortunes in hedge funds or run energy trading desks at investment banks. Long after they retire, fat and happy, the innovations they were part of will endure.That is not quite up there with defeating fascism, and Enron’s crimes should not be minimised either. It is a pity, though, that they are conflated with benign market forces even a decade later.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
62;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-11-22T20:36:11Z;Energy LBOs: fuel for thought;It is a bet, probably a sound one, that US gas prices cannot stay low forever;The popular image of buy-out barons may be that they thrive on risk, but that impression is a false one. Borrowing loads of money and piling it on to a sliver of equity requires a strong stomach (and the past few years offer examples aplenty of indigestion and a few cases of severe heartburn). But those lending the money crave relatively stable cash flows to service the loans.Not surprisingly, oil and gas producers have never been high on the list of targets. So does this year’s largest deal – a reported $7bn bid for privately held Samson Investment Corp led by KKR and others including Japan’s Itochu – mean the conventional wisdom is wrong?The industry provided one of the most lucrative LBOs of the last boom with the 2007 buy-out and 2011 initial public offering of Kinder Morgan, providing a return of more than 100 per cent to backers. But that was a pipeline company with chunky and predictable cash flow. A better comparison is smaller deals for US shale gas acreage later snapped up by producers. Recent acquisitions have valued future gas production at $4.50 per million British thermal units, reckon analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co, or some 80 cents above the 12-month futures strip.Reports that KKR is buying only the parts of Samson with long-lived gas assets, eschewing conventional offshore fields with more rapid decline rates, are telling. It is a bet, and probably a sound one, that US gas prices cannot stay low forever and that the equity market is right while the commodity market is artificially depressed. It also suggests that companies such as ExxonMobil, taking flak for making big bets on unconventional gas, have got a bargain. Using leverage to make a long duration bet into a glutted market has less downside and far more upside than it seems. Watch this space for more deals.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
63;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-10-27T20:26:51Z;Lazard and Evercore best larger peers;;Lazard and Evercore Partners, the independent investment banks, outperformed their larger peers in the third quarter in spite of a slowdown in deal activity.Evercore, which advised Kinder Morgan on its $39bn acquisition of El Paso, was particularly bullish on the outlook, and its net earnings of $1.8m beat analysts' expectations and sent its shares 21.3 per cent higher.“Our own backlog remains strong,” said Roger Altman, chairman and founder of the company. “It’s well above last year. There is no sign of weakness in it at all. And, going forward, we expect to increase our share of the global fee pool as we have been doing.”Lazard, whose earnings were broadly in line with expectations with a 2 per cent decline to $62.7m, was more muted on the outlook for mergers and acquisitions. “The volatility in the third quarter has been impacting CEO confidence,” said Matthieu Bucaille, chief financial officer. “Until this volatility diminishes, I remain cautious on the M&A cycle.” Among Lazard’s deals in the quarter was advising Google on its $12.5bn acquisition of Motorola Mobility.Both companies have benefited from the absence of a bulging balance sheet, trading losses and mortgage litigation and losses, which have plagued larger companies. “We have not been under the same pressure as our largest competitors,” said Mr Bucaille, adding that “we’ve been focusing this quarter on strengthening [the team with] some senior hires”.Ralph Schlosstein, chief executive of Evercore, said: “Evercore has had a very strong recruiting hand, so to speak, for sometime, never stronger than right now. And as you can see we’re taking advantage of it, because there is a long-term out-migration of talent …from many of the large platforms to independent firms.”Lazard’s net revenues rose from $453.3m to $462.4m in the three months to the end of September from the same period last year. Stripping out an $18.1m gain for the repurchase of subordinated debt and a tax adjustment, net income fell from $62.2m to $52.9m, or 39 cents a share. Shares in Lazard rose 16.6 per cent to $28.89.Evercore’s net revenues rose from $123.7m to $163.9m in the third quarter. Net income fell from $3.5m to $1.8m, or 6 cents a share. On its preferred accounting basis, which excludes the impact of vesting shares, Evercore’s net income rose 35 per cent to $19.7m, or 46 cents a share. It shares closed up $5.05 at $28.75.Both companies were affected by a weaker performance from their asset management divisions, hit by the decline in equities during the quarter.
64;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-10-17T18:24:01Z;Kinder bets $38bn on continued US gas growth;;Even as US shale gas production has soared over the past decade and companies have poured tens of billions of dollars into drilling rights in promising areas, doubts have persisted about how real and sustainable the North American natural gas revolution really is.With his bid for the El Paso Corporation, Rich Kinder, the oil and gas entrepreneur who owns 31 per cent of Kinder Morgan, is betting $38bn that US gas supplies will continue to grow.The agreed deal announced on Sunday afternoon– the largest in the energy industry since ExxonMobil’s $41bn acquisition of XTO in 2009, according to Dealogic – highlights an emerging trend in oil and gas takeovers.As Jon Wolff, an analyst at ISI, says: “It’s the infrastructure era.”Find out how natural gas is extracted from shale rock using a process called ‘fracking’ or fracturingShale gas, produced from rocks where the reserves were previously uneconomic but have been unlocked by improved techniques of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, has been reshaping the North American energy landscape.First it was the upstream groups such as XTO with oil and gas resources – or potential resources – that were in demand. Now, while there is still healthy interest in those groups, bidders’ attention is shifting to encompass also midstream pipeline and processing businesses that will benefit once those reserves come into production.Before the Kinder Morgan/El Paso deal, in June there was the $7.9bn bid from Energy Transfer Partners for Southern Union, another pipeline operator, which became contested for a time when Williams also made a bid, although it has since dropped out of the running. Also on Monday, Energy Transfer sold its propane operations to AmeriGas for $2.9bn.Those midstream companies such as El Paso are attractive at a time of volatility: they earn relatively stable, often regulated, returns from shippers paying to use their pipelines. They have growth potential from the large investment in gas processing and transport that will be needed as areas are opened up for shale production.The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America has published forecasts showing that by 2035 the US will need $205bn of investment in new gas pipelines and processing facilities (in 2010 dollars), and a further $46bn in new pipelines for oil and other liquids, to meet the expected increase in production and demand.It includes 35,600 miles of transmission mainlines, 13,900 miles to connect up power plants, storage and processing plants, and 414,000 miles of gathering line to connect up the gas wells.It is based on a projection that US gas production will rise 48 per cent over that period to 40,300bn cubic feet per year, and consumption will rise 47 per cent to 39,700bn cubic feet.The forecast implies the industry will have to invest an average of $10bn per year, with about $3.9bn of that going on long-distance gas transmission lines. Mark Routt, an analyst at KBC in Houston, suggests that creates pressure for further deals. “Consolidation has to happen,” he says. “You need economies of scale to put in all those new gas gathering points and pipelines.”Both Kinder Morgan and El Paso have gas pipelines, but El Paso has more, with operatorship or an interest in about 43,000 miles of gas pipelines compared with Kinder Morgan’s 23,600 miles.By buying El Paso, the largest natural gas pipeline operator in North America, Kinder Morgan puts itself in the prime position to make those investments, with a presence in all the main areas where production is expected to grow, including the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, the Utica shale in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the Haynesville shale in Louisiana and Texas.The one potential obstacle could be that by setting itself in such a leading position, it attracts objections on antitrust grounds.Speaking to analysts on a conference call on Monday morning, Mr Kinder rejected those concerns, saying there was “not a lot of overlap between the two companies”. Because many of El Paso’s assets are regulated, customers should be protected against any abuse of market power.However, El Paso’s share price of $24.45 on Monday morning, although up 25 per cent from Friday night’s close, was still short of the implied $27.41 value of the Kinder Morgan offer, based on its closing price of $28.19.Even so, Mr Kinder’s example is likely to inspire other potential buyers of midstream businesses. The more the shale gas revolution becomes entrenched, with greater use of gas for power generation, for example, the more attractive those pipelines will be.

Earnings per share of 12 cents were also 4 cents lower than expected.Investments banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which are less dependent on interest rate margins because less of their business is made up of deposit taking and lending, were both up on the day. Morgan Stanley rose a fraction to $15.25 and Goldman was up 0.2 per cent to $96.90.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 fell 3.3 per cent and the closely watched KBW banks index was off 3.9 per cent.The broad S&P 500 index was down 1.9 per cent to 1,200.86, on bank losses, and renewed doubts about a deal on eurozone debt, after German officials warned this weekend’s summit was unlikely to yield a comprehensive settlement.The declines marked the third time since August that the benchmark S&P 500 has rallied to 1,220 before selling off again.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.1 per cent to 11,397 and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 2 per cent to 2,614.92, putting both indices back in to negative territory for the year.Shares in oil and gas pipeline company El Paso Corporation soared 24.8 per cent to $24.45 after Kinder-Morgan, a rival pipeline company run by former Enron president Richard Kinder, agreed to buy El Paso for $38bn.Kinder Morgan shares rose 4.8 per cent to $28.19.Anadarko Petroleum was up 5.5 per cent to $74.44, after the company agreed a final $4bn settlement with BP over the Gulf of Mexico spill. Anadarko was a part-owner of the oil well at the centre of the environmental disaster.Oilfield services company Halliburton fell 7.8 per cent to $34.48, despite posting earnings per share of 74 cents for the three months to September 30, a 26 per cent year-on-year jump.Savings and loans holding company Charles Schwab fell 6.4 per cent to $11.95 as earnings per share of 18 cents disappointed. Although the company posted net income of $220m for the third quarter, up 77 per cent from a year ago, analysts were concerned about the impact of recent market volatility on its online brokerage subsidiary.Global media company Gannett was off 7 per cent to $10.17, despite reporting quarterly earnings per share of 41 cents, in line with expectations. Revenue from television adverts held up, but circulation of the group’s local newspapers fell.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 9.5 per cent to $4.01 on reports of rising mortgage delinquency rates.Semiconductors had a tough day after hard drive manufacturer and key consumer, Western Digital, extended the closure of its Thai facilities due to flooding in the country.Western Digital was down 7.4 per cent to $26.25. The Philadelphia semiconductor index was off 2.8 per cent to $370.31.Children’s toy manufacturer Hasbro was up 0.7 per cent to $34.99 on earnings per share of $1.27, slightly below expectations.Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital, who has been among the most bullish of US equity analysts, lowered his year-end target for the S&P 500 to 1,260 on Monday morning, blaming “continued public policy uncertainty and the impact of slowing earnings momentum.”Mr Knapp also lowered his 2012 earnings forecast to $102 from $105, but tipped the current quarterly reporting season to be positive for investors, and to make a dent in the high levels of correlation among US stocks, as markets respond to individual firm performance.After the close of trading, IBM posted quarterly earnings per share of $3.19, up from $2.82 for the same quarter a year ago. IBM also raised its full-year earnings per share forecast by 10 cents, although the company slightly missed revenue expectations for the third quarter.
66;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-10-16T22:11:51Z;Kinder Morgan to buy El Paso for $38bn;;"Kinder Morgan, the US oil and gas pipeline company, has agreed a $38bn deal including debt to buy El Paso Corporation, another pipeline operator, creating the fourth-largest energy company in North America by enterprise value.The deal represents a bet by Houston-based Kinder Morgan on the future growth of North American natural gas supplies, giving it operations in all the leading areas for US shale gas production.El Paso announced in May that it planned to spilt into a pipeline company and an exploration and production business, but the break-up, which has not yet gone through, was received tepidly by some analysts. Kinder Morgan said it planned to sell all of El Paso’s exploration and production assets.Richard Kinder, chairman and chief executive of Kinder Morgan, described the deal in a statement as a “once in a lifetime transaction [that] is a win-win opportunity for both companies”.He added: “The El Paso assets are primarily regulated interstate natural gas pipelines that produce substantial, stable cash flow and have access to key supply regions and major consuming markets.”The deal is worth about $21bn in cash and stock, and also involves Kinder Morgan taking on $17bn in debt.Kinder Morgan shareholders will own 68 per cent of the merged group, El Paso shareholders 32 per cent. The new company will continue to be known as Kinder Morgan and Mr Kinder will stay on as chairman and chief executive.The new company will have 67,000 miles of gas pipelines, of which 43,000 – almost two-thirds – will come from the El Paso group. The merged entity will have an enterprise value of $94bn.Mr Kinder also implied that antitrust concerns should not be a problem for the deal, saying the two businesses were “complementary”, and served “different supply sources and markets in the United States”.El Paso specialises in gas pipelines, running the largest interstate network in North America, while Kinder Morgan’s pipelines carry oil, petrol and carbon dioxide as well as natural gas.The deal is expected to enhance earnings immediately, yielding cost savings worth about $350m per year – roughly 5 per cent of the combined companies’ earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation – and savings on tax payments.El Paso shareholders are being offered $14.65 in cash, 0.4187 Kinder Morgan shares and 0.640 Kinder Morgan warrants, exercisable at $40, with a choice of replacing the shares with cash or vice versa. Kinder Morgan calculates that, based on its share price of $26.89 on Friday, its bid is worth $26.87 per El Paso share; a premium of 47 per cent to the 20-day average price leading up to last Friday, but still well below the peaks of over $50 that El Paso shares reached a decade ago.El Paso has agreed not to seek an alternative buyer, and promised to pay Kinder Morgan a termination fee of $650m if the deal does not go ahead, depending on the circumstances.Karl Miller, a former El Paso executive and now a managing partner at Newco Energy Acquisition Holdings, said it was “about time” the company was taken over. However, he warned that “regulators might force some asset divestitures” due to monopoly positions.Kinder Morgan was advised by Barclays Capital and Evercore; El Paso by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty"
67;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-10-16T21:43:03Z;Kinder Morgan: pipe dreamer;Former Enron heir apparent in $38bn bid to create America’s largest energy infrastructure group;With the benefit of hindsight, the smartest guy in the room was no longer working at Enron when things were unravelling a decade ago. Rich Kinder’s penchant for hard assets rather than financial alchemy had transformed him from heir apparent to outcast five years earlier, but he was allowed to snap up $40m of unwanted assets along with friend Bill Morgan. Now his vindication is nearly complete as the company they built, Kinder Morgan, bids $38bn for El Paso to create America’s largest owner of energy infrastructure and its fourth largest energy group overall.Of course the deal itself will make use of some nifty financial engineering, but all of it above board and much through exploiting tax rules rather than investor gullibility, in sharp contrast to Mr Kinder’s one time college buddy Ken Lay. The 37 per cent premium in a combination of cash, shares and warrants can be justified by more than usual deal synergies, estimated at about 6 per cent of the premium paid per annum.El Paso’s tax losses will be harvested, its energy production assets sold to repay debt and much of its pipeline and other hard assets “dropped down” into master limited partnerships allowed to pass through income untaxed to unit holders. With US oil and gas transport infrastructure requiring $255bn in investment over the next quarter century, according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, threats to repeal these tax advantages appear empty.That still leaves two question marks for a deal Mr Kinder confidently calls a “win-win”: will it be hurt by regulatory complications and will others bid for all or part of El Paso too? Energy Transfer’s bid for Southern Union this year was similarly attractive until a bidding war with Williams eroded the upside. If he pulls it off, victory will be sweet indeed.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
68;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Roar turns to whimper in US IPO market;;"The roar has become a whimper in the US initial public offerings market. After the excitement at the start of the year that the market was beginning to burst into life, sentiment has turned sharply amid worries about the eurozone crisis and the economic slowdown.There are still dozens of companies seeking to take the plunge – more than at any time since 2007, according to Dealogic – and there are still investors with money to buy them.But the market closed down in September, despite predictions that the post-Labor Day period would see a burst in activity. So what is the problem?In part, IPOs are a victim of their own success. After convincing investors that they were growing quickly, hopes were high that performance would continue; that becomes much less certain if the US economy slows.“The most compelling investment thesis is ‘promises made, promises kept’. If a company falters immediately after they go public, it shakes investors’ confidence,” said Dan Cummings, global co-head of equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.This summer, a number of high-profile debutantes missed earnings in their maiden quarters, including private equity holdings HCA and Kinder Morgan and Russian web group Yandex.Among the private equity-backed groups that make up the bulk of the pipeline, just over half are not profitable on an operating basis, according to Renaissance Capital, the US-based IPO research firm.“That stands to test investors’ risk appetite,” says Stephanie Chang, analyst at Renaissance.But the demand side of the market is not necessarily the issue. Fund flows into equity mutual funds have been positive for three of the last four weeks, according to Lipper, which tracks flows, despite a big outflow in early August.Michael Shinnick, portfolio manager at Wasatch Funds, says that the beginning of autumn is also the end of the reporting year for many mutual funds, so managers are selling losing positions. “People have some money to spend, and they are looking for some new ideas,” he says.Instead, the problem is one of timing an offering at a very uncertain moment. Are companies willing to endure a poor debut if it happens to come on the same day that, say, a European sovereign defaults?Not all companies need the cash from an IPO, enabling them to time their exits for when conditions are just right. “Through the crisis, firms became very efficient, and they can fund themselves with cash flow,” says Marc Zenner of JPMorgan’s corporate finance advisory unit.The rise of structured equity investments by private firms, as well as record low rates for investment-grade debts, allows firms to be choosier about how they fund themselves.“If I were sitting in an issuer’s shoes, I’d be thinking very hard about the various funding alternatives,” says Craig Orchant of EA Markets, a capital markets advisory.For many companies, an IPO is marketing event, especially when there is the possibility of a huge “pop”, such as social network LinkedIn’s debut earlier this year, when its shares nearly tripled in price.The threat of a first-day decline is a huge risk. Many Chinese groups have cited the “pop” as a reason to go public in the US, even if it means generating less cash in the offering. “An IPO is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and you don’t want to do it when market conditions are not optimal,” Mr Zenner says.Among companies trying to manage that timing are Groupon, the online coupon-seller, and Zynga, the social network games maker, who have delayed hoped-for September offerings into October.With so many companies on offer, both issuers and investors are waiting for the biggest names to take the first step. “As the execution of the pipeline slows down, the bar for companies that want to go public is a little bit higher,” said Mr Cummings. “You tend to find demand only for the best-in-class.”"
69;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-05-30T18:49:01Z;IPO outcomes lead to cooler US sector;;It has been a tale of two markets for US initial public offerings.It was the busiest May for technology IPOs since 2000, according to Dealogic. LinkedIn, the social network, debuted to much fanfare, and saw its shares rocket from $45 at their initial sale to as much as $122 on their first day. A few days later, Yandex, the Russian web search company, saw a “pop” of 55 per cent.But issues tied to industry and commodities had poor showings. Freescale Semiconductor, a private equity-owned automotive chipmaker, had to lower its offer price. And last week Spirit Airlines, a discount carrier, and Lone Pine Resources, a Canadian oil and gas group, saw their shares fall in first-day trading.The US IPO market has rebounded sharply in 2011, with $22bn in 64 deals so far, according to Dealogic. That puts it on track to match 2007’s volume of $54bn, though not the 254 deals seen that year.During the early months of the year, deals ranging from Demand Media, a web company that provides low-cost content, to Kinder Morgan, an operator of natural gas pipelines, priced at or above expectations and saw their shares rise in early trading.The pops for LinkedIn, RenRen – a Chinese social network – and Yandex drew comparisons with the 1990s “dot-com” bubble. LinkedIn is valued at $8.35bn, more than 500 times 2010 earnings. However, the divergent fates of May’s IPOs has led some to believe that the market has cooledand has become far more selective.This month saw four successive weeks of outflows from US equity funds, as tracked by the Investment Company Institute, the first time that has happened since before the Federal Reserve’s second quantitative easing programme began last September.May also saw the S&P 500 index fall every week, the first time that has happened in a month since 2008, though the overall drop was just 2.4 per cent.“It certainly states the gross misconceptions that we are in a bubble market when IPOs with far less allure and cachet are having trouble getting done,” said Scott Sweet, an investor and senior managing partner at IPO Boutique.Dan Cummings, global head of equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, explains that the market has absorbed an enormous amount of supply already, from IPOs and from massive secondary offerings, such as $6bn by Mosaic, the fertiliser producer, and $8.7bn by AIG, the bailed-out insurer.“May was a challenge,” he said. “The new issue market takes its cue from the secondary market. As the stock rally has faded, that led to some apathy and a feeling of fatigue.”That may be evident even in social media. Despite the growing excitement Twitter and Zynga, the social games maker, have not yet filed, nor have Facebook, the biggest social network, or Groupon, the retailer.There are 169 companies in the US pipeline waiting to go public, according to Renaissance Capital, the longest queue since 1999.That may bode well for the market. Investors have been hesitant to buy large offerings from companies that are deleveraging, such as the $783m offering by Freescale, which carres $7.6bn in long-term debt. Such companies are highly sensitive to the economy.“Investors are content to accept balance sheets for what they are, and are not willing to make bold assumptions about unabated growth,” said Mr Cummings. “That’s only fair when you see signs the economy is struggling and higher commodity prices.”Even deals for non-web growth companies, such as $197m last week for Solazyme, which produces petrol from algae, are faring well. Solazyme priced above range and rose 15 per cent.Tim Keating of Keating Capital said it showed investors were discerning, but not unwilling to take risks. “Social networking is an obvious hot area, so the bullishness of clean-tech is much more notable, since it tends to divide investors.”Deals coming this summer are likely to be smaller. No companies on file expect to raise $1bn. BrightSource Energy, a solar power company, is anticipated, as are private-equity backed companies such as Dunkin Donuts, and autos groups Allison Transmission and Delphi Automotive.
70;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
71;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-03-30T20:00:07Z;NYSE retakes listing lead but Asia is rising;;The New York Stock Exchange retook the lead as the exchange with the highest volume of initial public offerings in the first quarter.But for how long can it hold that position?The number of listings on China’s Shenzhen Stock Exchange, 72, was still the most globally, but NYSE’s 15 offerings raised $13.2bn in the first quarter, or 31 per cent of total global volume, according to Thomson Reuters. Shenzhen’s offerings raised $10.2bn.It was the first time since 2008 that NYSE led listings volume for two quarters in a row. Either Shenzhen, the Shanghai Stock Exchange or Brazil’s BM&FBovespa has led all but one quarter since 2008. In part, a few large US deals and the calendar explain the shift. NYSE had multibillion listings for private equity-held groups HCA and Kinder Morgan in 2011, as well as GM’s $18bn IPO in November.“Asian volumes in the first quarter are often light due to [the] Chinese New Year,” said Raj Dhanda, head of global capital markets at Morgan Stanley. Activity in Asia grew stronger late in the quarter. Hutchison Port Holdings raised $5.4bn in Singapore, the largest listing in 2011.“Risk aversion is receding, creating new opportunity,” said Mark Hantho, co-head of global equity capital markets at Deutsche Bank.Examples include the $151m IPO by Demand Media, the web content group, and the $264m offering by InterXion, a trading data provider. Similar US listings are seen for web groups such as LinkedIn and Pandora later this year.Big deals lurk in Asia. Glencore, the Swiss commodities trader, is considering a dual London-Kong Kong listing for its roughly $10bn IPO. Guangdong Development Bank, the state-owned Chinese lender, is reportedly seeking at least a $2.5bn-$3bn listing in China and Hong Kong.“We expect developing markets to be dominant again,” said Jackie Kelley, IPO leader at consultancy Ernst & Young.
72;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-03-30T13:07:36Z;Apollo raises $565m in delayed IPO;;Apollo Global Management, the private equity firm, has raised $565m in an initial public offering, making it the most recent in a series of alternative asset managers to sell shares on public markets.Apollo had delayed its planned offering last week, following a spike in market volatility after the devastating earthquake in Japan. Despite the delay, it still priced its offering of 29.7m shares – a bump from an initial plan to sell 26.3m shares – at $19, which was in its pre-Japan range of $19 to $20 a share. By mid-morning in New York trading the shares were lower at $18.65 each.Of the 29.7m shares offered, 21.5m were sold by the firm. Its principals, including founders Leon Black, Josh Harris, and Marc Rowan, who formed it out of the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, will retain control of the company in the form of Class B shares. Apollo also has an option to sell an additional 4.4m shares.The other 8.2m are being sold by investors in Apollo’s 2007 listing on private-share exchanges operated by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, whose need for liquidity partly prompted the offering. Those investors include Goldman itself and several large hedge funds.The lead bookrunners were Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS.Apollo had initially sought to go public in 2008, but withdrew the offer in the midst of the financial crisis.Its offering follows listings of the Blackstone Group, KKR, Fortress Investment Group and Och-Ziff Capital Management. These once-secretive groups still raise large investment funds from private investors, but sold shares in their management groups to create liquidity for top executives.These shares collapsed during the crisis, but since last June have roughly doubled in price. KKR, which began listing its Amsterdam-based shares in the US last July, has seen shares rise 108 per cent, to $17.41.Private equity groups have seen the value of their portfolios recover from post-crisis lows, reflected in strong IPOs for groups such as Kinder Morgan and HCA. Even troubled holdings such as NXP Semiconductor have done well after deleveraging. NXP this week sold some $700m worth of shares in a secondary offering at roughly double their 2010 IPO price.The success of Apollo’s offering could prompt other firms to go public. Scott Sweet, managing director at IPO Boutique, an investor advisory firm, said it was likely that “bankers are already in talks with other private equity firms” including The Carlyle Group and Oaktree Capital Management.“Barring a poor deal for Apollo, one or the other or both will highly likely file soon thereafter,” Mr Sweet said.Earlier this year, Carlyle hired Adena Friedman, former chief financial officer of Nasdaq OMX, as its own CFO. That is a key position to bolster ahead of a public offering.
73;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-03-21T23:10:07Z;Apollo Global seeks to raise $480m in IPO;;Apollo Global kicked off its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, seeking to sell $480m of shares in what is expected to be the culmination of a five-year saga to raise public capital by the private equity firm run by Leon Black.However, the announcement came a week later than expected and Apollo has scaled back its pricing ambitions for the offering, said people familiar with the matter.Acknowledging market volatility, Apollo has lowered the target price range from $19 to $20, to a $17 to $19 band, they said.The company is pressing ahead with the move, which is expected to give Apollo a market capitalisation of about $7bn, in spite of recent jitters in the market over the Libyan conflict and Japanese disasters which have seen other offerings pulled.At the midpoint of that new range the listing would raise about $473m, $324m of which would go to Apollo.Apollo has been under pressure to list to provide liquidity to institutional investors who purchased shares in a 2007 private placement on proprietary trading systems set up by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.These investors will sell about 8.3m shares, in addition to the 18m new shares Apollo will sell to the public. Investors in the earlier private placement paid $24 per share.The timing reflects a good start to the year for private equity groups, with shares in larger listed peers Blackstone and KKR rising 18 per cent and 21 per cent respectively so far this year.In 2006 Apollo raised a $2bn investment vehicle listed on Euronext’s Amsterdam exchange, after initially seeking to raise $2.5bn.Plans to list shares publicly in New York in 2008 were shelved amid the financial crisis.It also follows the successful listing this month of HCA, a hospital group taken private in 2006, which raised $3.8bn to become the largest ever private equity backed IPO.Offerings for Nielsen, Kinder Morgan, BankUnited and, HCA, have all priced at or above the top of their expected range.Leon Black, Josh Harris, and Marc Rowan, who founded the group in 1990 out of the wreckage of the Drexel Burnham Lambert brokerage house, retain majority ownership and will control the company through a single class B share, giving them 81 per cent of voting rights.Joint bookrunners are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS.
74;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-03-14T04:36:49Z;HCA’s share sale raises bar;;The private equity industry has high hopes for a series of challenging buy-outs this year and next, following the successful sale of shares in HCA, the US hospital group taken private in a $31bn buy-out in 2006.HCA became the largest US private equity initial public offering on Thursday with its $3.8bn listing, according to Dealogic. On paper, the sponsors gained some $10bn in equity value for just five years of work.Along with HCA, share offerings from Nielsen Holdings, the media measurement group, and Kinder Morgan, a gas pipeline operator, were in high demand from investors.“The 2011 class of IPOs have thus far been for well performing, larger companies. An IPO is a natural alternative for those companies,” said Paul Donahue, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Morgan Stanley. “Investors are less focused on gearing when they are confident in a company’s or sector’s prospects.”HCA and Nielsen both saw the majority of the proceeds of the IPO go towards debt repayment, rather than to the private equity firms and their investors.That has become a typical concession for firms in IPOs, and investors have welcomed the shift so far.“Rather than providing de-levering from existing cash flow, private equity firms are doing that in a primary offering. Once they get the right business conditions, they will sell their own shares,” said Dan Cummings, head of global equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Many of the buy-outs still in the pipeline are more cyclical or more highly leveraged, and enjoyed less operating success during the crisis.That group includes Freescale Semiconductor, computer chip maker, Caesars Entertainment, the casino operator, and Toys R Us, the retailer, each of which has filed for a public offering.Further down the road are companies including TXU, a power utility renamed Energy Future Holdings, Clear Channel, the advertising and media group, and Hilton Worldwide, the hotel chain, which have not yet filed for offerings.“We’re not in a rush to do an IPO,” Chris Nassetta, chief executive of Hilton, said last week. Hilton has cut its debt load through a restructuring.
75;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-02-27T17:41:07Z;Best start to a year for listings;;Dealmaking may be on the up but private equity groups are doing their utmost to make 2011 the year of the initial public offering.Companies have raised more than $26bn globally this year through IPOs, the best start on record, according to Dealogic.This flurry has been particularly pronounced in the US. Already this year, the US market has chalked up two of the biggest floats ever of sponsor-backed companies with the IPOs of Kinder Morgan, the energy company, and Nielsen, the media measurement group.HCA, the hospital operator, is expected to top them with an IPO that could exceed $4bn, making it the largest private equity backed flotation.“There has been pent-up demand to provide liquidity to investors,” says John Miller, head of the global financial sponsors and industrials groups at Barclays Capital. “Now sponsors’ focus on monetising large investments made in 2006 and 2007 is coalescing with overall strength in the equity markets, resiliency in the operations of these high-quality businesses and the ability to achieve an attractive valuation.”Advisers worry that unrest in the Middle East and the rising price of oil could put a damper on the economy and the equity market. Volatility means a rougher ride for companies seeking a listing and the Vix index, a measure of stock market turbulence, this week spiked higher.Europe has lagged behind the US on concerns about ailing economic growth and government indebtedness. But the European pipeline is the longest in three years, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch.“Companies going public are still trying to figure out when the business environment will align with the market in Europe’s peripheral economies,” says Dan Cummings, global head of equity capital markets at BofA. “But we are optimistic that sponsors and carve-outs will be strong later this year.”The flow of big US deals should also continue. Dealogic’s global IPO backlog stands at $48bn, about a third of which is destined for US markets.The bread and butter of the US market – the technology sector – is also faring well. Eric Mandl, global head of software & large cap tech banking at UBS, argues that, after a strong year for dealmaking in 2010, more energy is now being devoted to determining how companies can best go public.“Investors want to play the big themes in technology, such as cloud computing, data storage and security and it is hard to get that exposure by owning big technology companies,” he argues.
76;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-02-24T23:52:50Z;Allison Transmission eyes IPO;;Allison Transmission, a private-equity owned builder of transmissions for commercial trucks and military vehicles, is planning an initial public offering for later this year, according to people familiar with the situation.The company is considering an offering of at least $500m, according to these sources. Allison did not confirm the plans.Several banks are said to have been hired as underwriters, including Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. The banks could not confirm their hiring or comment on the plans.The company’s plans were first reported by Reuters.Private-equity firms Carlyle Group and Onex Corp bought Allison in 2007 from General Motors for $5.6bn, which included $1.5bn in equity. Allison has since taken a large stake in Torotrak, the UK-based manufacturer of speciality transmissions.Shares in London-listed Torotrak are down 6.7 per cent this year, but S&P’s US Automotive Components index is up 4.9 per cent in 2011.Allison’s IPO comes amid a wave of large private-equity backed companies selling shares to the public. The two largest-ever US private equity IPOs have taken place in 2011: Nielsen, the media measurement group, and Kinder Morgan, a gas pipeline operator. HCA, a hospital operator, is set to sell up to $4.3bn in shares next week, which would top those deals.
77;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-02-23T02:52:10Z;HCA eyes $4.3bn offering;;HCA, the US hospital group taken private in one of the largest leveraged buy-outs ever in 2006, is planning on raising as much as $4.3bn in an initial public offering next week.It would be the largest US private equity-backed IPO ever, topping the recently completed Nielsen and Kinder Morgan IPOs.The company and its owners plan to sell 124m shares at a range of $27 to $30 a share, with an option to sell an additional 18m. The offering is set to price next Tuesday.At the top of the targeted share price range, the company’s equity would be valued at $15.4bn. That would be a nearly $10bn paper profit for the company’s private equity owners and the Frist family, who founded the company and helped take it private for $5.5bn in equity and $26.1bn in debt.That is on top of $4.25bn in dividends, paid for with debt raisings, the company paid to its owners last year.KKR, Bain Capital and Bank of America Merrill Lynch Capital Partners will each sell 11.1m shares, with an option to sell an additional 4.6m shares. The Frist family will sell about half a million shares.HCA itself plans to sell some 87.7m shares, which will be used to repay some of its $28.2bn in long-term debt.Revenues for the year ending December 31 2010, for HCA were $30.7bn, up from $30.1bn in the previous year. Net income was $1.6bn, up from $1.4bn.The company generated free cash flow of $1.74bn in 2010, according to Renaissance Capital, an IPO equity research group.Its debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, or ebitda, would fall from about 4.8 to 4.4 after the offering, according to Renaissance.Private equity backed IPOs struggled in 2010, with several offerings pricing below their range and others being pulled or delayed as investors worried about the ability of the heavily indebted groups to cover their debt payments.However, in 2011 they have performed well, as US equity markets have soared since the middle of last year. Nielsen in January and Kinder Morgan earlier this month sold shares above their price ranges and saw jumps in first-day trading. They also both exercised their overallotment options to sell more shares.“Investors are becoming a little more receptive to companies where they feel like the fundamentals are strong and stable. The debt is a big risk, but HCA does a pretty good job covering it,” said Nick Einhorn, analyst at Renaissance Capital.More large private equity portfolio companies, including Freescale Semiconductor and Toys’R’Us, are set to sell shares later this year.HCA’s offering features nine bookrunners, led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, matching the record set by General Motors for a US IPO. There are an additional 15 underwriters on the deal.
78;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-02-12T08:14:55Z;US equities rally as Mubarak goes;Dollar still stronger and oil price remains above $101;Friday 21:30 GMT. Equities rose and the price of oil remained elevated after news that Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak had stepped down.Egyptian credit default swaps are at 320 basis points, meaning it costs $320,000 to insure $10m of government debt. A wave of relief just after the president’s announcement saw the price fall as low as 300bp, but it has drifted higher again as traders reconsider, according to Markit.The FTSE All-World index rose 0.2 per cent, having been lower for much of the global session after traders in Asia were disappointed that Mr Mubarak had defied expectations that he would depart on Thursday.The S&P 500 in New York trimmed early losses before the news of Mr Mubarak’s departure broke, partly in response to a well-received IPO from Kinder Morgan, the energy pipeline group. The benchmark index ended up 0.6 per cent to 1,329, a fresh 30-month high.However, while the atmosphere may be euphoric in Tahrir Square, the celebrations are more muted in dealing rooms in Europe and the Americas. This makes sense. It is hard for stock investors to argue for a huge rally on the news given that many equity benchmarks had barely shifted from cyclical highs over the past few weeks of political turmoil in Cairo.In addition, traders will have quickly realised that a transfer of power to the military is not the end game sought by Egyptian protesters and that a further period of tension is likely until democratic civilian rule is established. Furthermore, the success of the Cairo protests could actually make the situation in the region more chaotic if it inspires populations in other autocratic states.Much has been made of the “risk on/risk off” trades that have dominated global markets for many months. writes Jamie Chisholm. The now-faltering strategy saw sometimes disparate financial products move in Pavlovian correlation to often distant catalysts.But the trend has been prevalent within asset classes too. The chart below shows the CBOE’s KCJ implied correlation index for the S&P 500, which tracks how much stocks move in tandem. It is probably not a coincidence that the KCJ peaked above 80 shortly after the equity market began the latest stage in its rally that has seen the S&P gain 25 per cent in less than five months. The KCJ is now below 60.It is less the speed of the bounce than its nature that has encouraged investors to be more discerning. A trundle higher, with a lack of volatility – the Vix index has averaged 17 in 2011, versus 22 over the past 12 months – means it makes more sense to analyse “bottom-up” fundamentals as exogenous factors lose their heft. That means skilled stock pickers have become more valuable. And it may result in less demand for broad tracker funds – a move that could deliver a virtuous circle of lower correlation.“There is a paradox at work for markets. What may tamp down Egypt-specific risk underlines the risks of political contagion. The protesters’ victory is not going to discourage actors in other countries,” said Eric Fine, portfolio manager at Van Eck Global.With this in mind, the dollar is off its highs but has kept a chunk of the day’s “haven” gains. Equally, Brent crude has given up some of its fear premium but remains near $101 a barrel.Europe – Bourses opened with losses but turned things around in response to an improvement in US futures and then the news from Egypt. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 climbed 0.4 per cent, despite a 14 per cent fall in Nokia shares, following a disappointing strategy statement, which pushed the technology hardware sector down 3 per cent.London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.7 per cent, with energy groups firmer on the rising oil price.Another concern weighing on equity investors of late has been evidence that corporate margins are being squeezed by rising material costs. Data on UK producer prices for January, released earlier on Friday, will have done little to dispel those worries. The Office for National Statistics said that input cost inflation is rising at its fastest annual pace in more than two years .Asia-Pacific – The broad risk aversion battered emerging markets in Asia, exacerbating a recent trend that has seen funds desert fast-growing economies on fears of inflationary pressures and a perceived relative improvement in the attraction of developed nations, such as the US and Japan.The Taiwan stock market has tumbled 2.6 per cent, for example, its biggest drop in more than eight months, taking its decline this week to 5.9 per cent.The FTSE Asia-Pacific index excluding Japan fell 0.8 per cent, falling for a fifth day, while markets in Tokyo were closed for a national holiday.The Seoul market initially found some traction after the Bank of Korea kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 2.75 per cent. But the news put pressure on the won, which is now down 0.8 per cent to Won1,126.30 against the US dollar, and the broader regional trend prevailed in stocks, leaving the Kospi off 1.6 per cent as foreigners continued to sell.In Shanghai, farming shares lost ground after Wen Jiabao, China’s premier, vowed to increase spending to tame food inflation. Banks were also under pressure after the central bank said it would use different reserve requirements for individual banks to curb loan growth.Rates – US Treasuries are in demand, with 10-year yields down 7 basis points to 3.63 per cent. Following a week of topsy-turvy auctions, in which 3-year notes were not in demand but 10-year notes saw a surge of interest, the market ended with what RBS strategists deemed a “tactical” move.“The act of putting supply behind us and strongly placing long-end supply resulted in a tactical rally,” said John Briggs, Treasuries strategist at RBS, but he noted that the buying may have been due to asset allocation and that “sentiment has certainly edged closer to bearish extremes”.Eurozone peripheral bonds are mixed, though Portuguese benchmarks remain above 7 per cent following the European Central Bank’s supportive intervention on Thursday.Forex – The dollar is seeing buying as traders execute traditional “haven” strategies at times of stress. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback against a basket of its peers, is up 0.2 per cent to 78.42, tracking a similar gain versus the euro to $1.3547.Growth-related units, such as the Aussie dollar, are under pressure, as is the yen, which has hit a one-month low versus the buck of Y83.58 as Japanese corporate buying dwindles.Commodities – Oil has been volatile. Brent crude, which is more sensitive to global supply issues, is up 0.5 per cent at $101.43 a barrel keeping the spread with the US Nymex contract at nearly $16. The US crude benchmark, WTI, is down 1.5 per cent to $85.45.Industrial metals are softer on general risk aversion and gold is down 0.6 per cent at $1,356 an ounce as a stronger dollar counteracts any haven impetus.Additional reporting by Song Jung-a in Seoul.
79;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-02-11T23:06:47Z;Kinder Morgan IPO raises $2.9bn;;Kinder Morgan, the energy pipeline operator, has sold shares in its initial public offering above the projected range and is set to raise some $2.9bn, the largest-ever private equity-backed share offering in the US.The shares opened at $31.75 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, but fell slightly later. They ended the day at $31.05, up 3.5 per cent from their sale price of $30.The sale represents a significant profit for the group of private equity firms that along with Rich Kinder, chief executive, took the company private in 2006. The company is not receiving any of the proceeds of the sale.The offering, underwritten by Goldman Sachs and Barclays, priced above its projected range of $26 to $29 a share. The company issued 15m shares more than the original 80m planned. If an overallotment of 14.3m shares is exercised, the value of the deal could rise to about $3.3bn.Mr Kinder and the private equity firms, which included funds owned by Goldman Sachs, Carlyle Group, Riverstone Holdings and Highstar Capital, took the company private in 2006 for $22bn, which included $15bn in equity along with $7bn in debt.The offering at $30 a share valued the company at $21bn, with 707m common shares outstanding. The company projects to have $12bn in debt at year end.This year, private equity groups are expected to sell shares in several of the large buy-outs undertaken in 2005 and 2006, at the peak of the credit bubble.Kinder Morgan’s sale tops the $1.8bn IPO of Nielsen, the media measurement group, in January. A $4.2bn IPO of HCA, the hospital chain, is also expected in the first quarter.The Kinder deal is also the largest IPO of a US energy group since Conoco sold $4.4bn worth of shares in 1998.Mr Kinder is a one-time Enron executive who bought its physical pipeline assets in 1996 to form Kinder Morgan. He is not selling any of his 30.6 per cent stake in the company. After the offering, Mr Kinder and the private equity firms will still own more than 80 per cent of the company.The Kinder Morgan entity going public is a holding company that owns the general partner stake in publicly listed Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, a master limited partnership (MLP) that operates some 37,000 miles of pipes shipping oil, gas and other commodities.The holding company will be renamed Kinder Morgan Inc, to trade under the symbol ‘KMI’. KMI also owns a stake in a pipeline. The shares will yield around 4 per cent, according to the prospectus.KMI will be the general partner and as such will participate in a greater share of any future increases in the partnership’s dividend payments. Also, it will not be subject to ownership restriction rules that are faced by MLPs, which many pension and non-US investors cannot buy into.Other high-yielding shares have done well in trading. Shares in Targa Resources, another similarly structured private-equity backed natural gas infrastructure group, are up 39 per cent since their offering last February.“There’s also a lot of buzz about natural gas and whether with oil prices rising, it’s going to become a more important fuel in the future,” said Nick Einhorn, analyst at Renaissance Capital, the US-based IPO research group.
80;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-02-11T21:51:14Z;Freescale files for $1.2bn IPO;;The parade of private equity-backed initial public offerings is continuing, with Freescale Semiconductor filing regulatory papers for the issue of $1.15bn of shares.Freescale was taken private in 2006 for $17.6bn by group of private-equity firms including Blackstone, TPG, Carlyle Group and Permira following an intense bidding war that drove up the price of the deal.The company plans to use the cash raised in the share sale to pay down debt, according to the prospectus. The company has total debt of $7.62bn.The offering will be co-managed by a large group of banks, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan.Freescale, a spin-out of Motorola that provides computer chips for automobiles and other products, had a net operating loss of $61m in 2010, narrowed from a $1.3bn operating loss in 2009.The company faced deep losses during the financial crisis, taking a $6.9bn writedown in 2008, as it struggled with its debt load in the midst of an economic recession.Recent weeks have seen the two biggest-ever private equity IPOs, with Nielsen, the media measurement group, selling $1.9bn in shares in January, and Kinder Morgan, the energy pipeline operator, selling $2.9bn on Thursday.Those two deals priced well, both above their projected range. Nielsen shares have sputtered in trading, gaining just 0.9 per cent since its listing on January 27. Kinder Morgan shares were up 3.9 per cent in their first day of trading on Friday.HCA, the hospital chain, is expected to sell $4.2bn in shares by the end of the first quarter, according to market sources.Separtely on Friday, Pandora, the internet radio service, filed to raise as much as $100m. The company reported its registered users as numbering more than 80m, double the figure reported in December 2009.Its regulatory filing said revenues were $55.2m and $90.1m in fiscal 2009-10 and the nine months ended October 31 2010, respectively. Its net loss was $16.8m and just $300,000 for the same periods, suggesting revenues are more than doubling year on year and it may by now be profitable.Additional reporting by Chris Nuttall
81;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-02-08T20:10:15Z;Better year expected for private equity IPOs;Aggregate $17.9bn could be raised across global exchanges;About $18bn of initial public offerings of private equity-owned companies are expected this year in what is hoped to be a stronger year than 2010.According to Ernst & Young, there are 50 private equity-backed companies that have registered their intention to go public, which could raise an aggregate $17.9bn across global exchanges.“There is huge pent-up demand from companies for IPOs, which accounted for only 20 per cent of equity capital markets’ issuance last year, in Europe, Middle East and Africa,” said Michael Findlay, managing director at investment bank Moelis. “I expect that will be more like 25 to 30 per cent this year. [Private equity funds] will be a high proportion of the activity. They have a lot of assets they have restructured and that they want to bring to market.”While IPOs made a comeback in 2010 after the crisis, recent market volatility meant many financial sponsors were forced to put plans on hold. There is a hope among some bankers that 2011 will be a more positive year for flotations.The month of January is already the biggest on record for IPOs since 2000, according to Dealogic, the data provider.The value of planned IPOs from private equity sponsors indicates volumes this year will surpass those that went public during the entire year in both 2008 and 2009, but this year’s planned $17.9bn of IPOs is still less than the $35bn that was set to be raised by 155 companies at the start of 2010, according to Ernst & Young.The estimated number for 2011, however, excludes a sizeable “shadow pipeline” of private equity-backed companies that either have yet to make an initial filing, or withdrew an IPO based on negative market conditions yet remain interested in coming to market.E&Y analysts expect many of these companies to have another run at going public this year.“Volumes will depend on whether the economic recovery takes hold and investors remain confident the eurozone imbalances can be managed,” said Craig Coben of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.“Investors have done well out of IPOs and I think they’ll be receptive to new issues, but not indiscriminately so.”Analysts at Société Générale forecast €80bn in IPOs in Europe, Middle East and Africa this year.This is up from 2010, but still below the market peak in 2007 of €87bn.The companies expected to list this year include hospital operator HCA Holdings, which at $4.6bn, is poised to be the largest PE-backed deal in history, Toys R Us and energy company Kinder Morgan.One challenge to this is a recovery in the financing markets, which gives private equity funds some alternatives to IPOs, such as sales to trade buyers or to other funds.
82;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2011-02-04T01:36:04Z;Kinder Morgan aims for $2.3bn IPO;;Kinder Morgan, the pipeline operator, aims to launch the largest-ever US initial public offering of a company backed by private equity groups, of up to $2.3bn.The company, which was taken private by its chief executive and a group of private equity firms in 2006, announced on Thursday in a regulatory filing that it intends to sell 80m shares in a price range of $26 to $29 a share.At that size, it would top last month’s $1.8bn IPO of Nielsen, the media measurement group. That deal supplanted Spirit Aerosystem’s 2006 offering as the largest-ever share sale of a US company backed by private-equity investors.It will also be the largest IPO of a US energy group since Conoco sold $4.4bn worth of shares in 1998.The shares being sold are owned by private equity funds controlled by Goldman Sachs, the Carlyle Group, Riverstone Holdings and Highstar Capital. The company will not receive any of the proceeds.The firms were partners in the leveraged buy-out alongside its chief executive, Rich Kinder. The group acquired the company for $15bn, taking on $7bn in debt. Together, the firms own roughly 60 per cent of the shares.Mr Kinder is a one-time Enron executive who bought its physical pipeline assets in 1996 to form Kinder Morgan. He will not be selling any of his 30.6 per cent stake.After the offering, Mr Kinder and the firms will still own 88.7 per cent of the company. The offering is in the marketing phase, and is tentatively scheduled for February 11, according to a market source.The entity going public is a holding company that owns the general partner stake in publicly listed Kinder Morgan Partners, a master limited partnership (MLP) that operates some 37,000 miles of pipes shipping oil, gas and other commodities.The holding company will be renamed Kinder Morgan, Inc, to trade under the symbol ‘KMI' on the New York Stock Exchange. KMI also owns a stake in a pipeline.KMI, the new public entity, will offer a lower yield, of 4.25 per cent at the midpoint IPO prices, versus the existing public entity’s yield of 6 per cent, according to the filing. However, KMI will be the general partner stake, and as such will participate in a greater share of any future increases in dividend payments.KMI will also not be subject to the restrictions on MLPs, which many pension funds do not buy, and which many foreign funds cannot own under US rules.Several large private-equity backed deals filed IPOs last year, including Kinder Morgan. Toys’R’Us, the retailer, and HCA, the hospital company, are expected to follow Nielsen and debut this year if the equity markets continue to rebound and reach new highs.“When you do an IPO, a firm is still a participant in the upside of the company. If people feel the market overall is still headed up, you’ll see more of these big deals,” said Michael Laveman, a partner at EisnerAmper, an accounting advisory group.According to Dealogic, private-equity backed companies make up 54 per cent of the backlog of US IPOs filed in the past six months, with 21 deals worth $17.9bn waiting to come to market.Barclays Capital and Goldman Sachs are lead underwriters on the deal.
83;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Kinder Morgan plans $1.5bn IPO;;Kinder Morgan, the pipeline company that was taken private by its chief executive and a group of private equity funds in 2006, has filed registration for an initial public offering of shares to raise up to $1.5bn.It joins a list of successful private equity portfolio companies that have lined up to take advantage of thawing public markets after the financial crisis mostly shut the window for IPOs.The shares being sold are owned by private equity funds controlled by Goldman Sachs, The Carlyle Group, Riverstone Holdings and Highstar Capital. They became partners in the leveraged buy-out, which acquired the company for $15bn, and took on $7bn in debt. Together, the firms own roughly 60 per cent of the shares.The registration says the group will sell some portion of their shares in a holding company that owns a stake in publicly-listed Kinder Morgan Partners, the primary business operating some 37,000 miles of pipes shipping oil, gas and other commodities. The holding company will be renamed Kinder Morgan, Inc., after the transaction.No shares are being sold by Richard Kinder, the former Enron president who bought its physical pipeline assets in 1996, and formed them into a separate company. Having led the buy-out, he owns 31 per cent of the shares. The company also said in the registration it will not receive any proceeds from the offering.Private equity funds have been under pressure to make money from their investments in companies bought with funds raised during the peak of the credit bubble in 2005 and 2006.Following the worst IPO volumes in the US in six years in 2009, this year was expected to be a return to pre-crisis health. However, the market has seen 41 deals withdrawn, and the pipeline of groups waiting to go public reached its longest since 2007 as many issues were delayed, according to Renaissance Capital, an IPO advisory group.“There is a perception that these private equity deals are capital structure IPOs, where the proceeds don’t go into growing the companies,” said Josef Schuster of IPOX Schuster, which manages funds that invest in IPOs.Kinder Morgan’s net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) is estimated at 3.8 times for 2010, according to a presentation by the company at a Barclays conference in September. That is below the average 3.9 times ebitda ratio for private-equity portfolio companies that have gone public this year, according to figures from Bloomberg.IPOs for Toys R Us and HCA, both controlled by KKR & Co. and Bain Capital, have filed registrations for public offerings, but did not issue shares as expected this year.Last week, however, Booz Allen Hamilton, a Carlyle group company that focuses on US government defence consulting, successfully sold $238m of shares. LPL Financial, which provides broker-dealer services to independent financial advisors, sold $470m in shares. It is owned by TPG and Hellman & Friedman.“Kinder Morgan was one of the most successful LBOs ever,” said a senior banker. “Rich Kinder has made money for investors. The IPO market is always open for high-quality, brand-name companies.”
84;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2009-12-23T18:27:31Z;Falling oil demand a boon for tank owners;;"Tank owners, the workaday landlords of the oil trading business, stand to make big money this year as a glut of oil has sparked a clamour for fuel storage.Oil inventories in the most industrialised countries remain well above average as global demand declines for the first time in a quarter of a century.With tanks full, their owners have gained pricing power.In some cases companies such as Royal Vopak, of the Netherlands; Oiltanking, of Germany; and US-based Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and NuStar Energy are turning oil away.“On-land storage is full. We have absolutely nothing to sub-let right now,” says Danny Oliver, vice-president of marketing at NuStar Energy, a Texas company with 91m barrels of storage capacity.“As contracts have come up for renewal we have a long line of interest, and those renewals are getting done at much higher rates than before.”Most storage capacity is held by oil majors and state-owned producers or in strategic government reserves.But a quarter is run by “independent” storage companies that rent out tanks to outside parties, says Andre Mulder, analyst at Kepler Capital Markets in Amsterdam.Vopak, with tanks adjacent to ports on six continents, is the largest independent storage company by capacity. Its facilities were 93 per cent full in the latest quarter.The company expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to grow 18 per cent to €510m ($731m) this year.The storage industry stands in sharp contrast to the refining sector, where weak demand has pressured profits. In the US, the world’s top energy consumer, refineries are running at 80 per cent of capacity and domestic use of distillates, a key industrial fuel, is down 3.9 per cent annually. Integrated oil companies such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell also suffered from the collapse in oil prices this year.Storage specialists have been helped by new environmental rules that require oil products to be blended with biofuels, multiplying the number of separate tanks necessary to serve consumers.Trade in refined products has also grown more international, with US exports doubling in the past five years and new refineries in places such as India exporting petrol. Tank farms split these ocean-going cargoes and dispatch them to end-users.“You continue to see new refineries built in places that are far away from the demand centres,” says Tim Day, managing director of First Reserve, a US private equity firm that is expanding a large Bahamian oil storage terminal it owns with Vopak.Oil futures markets have compounded the storage trend. Spot prices are trading at a discount to forward contracts, a pattern known as “contango”. This has encouraged traders from commodity merchants to Wall Street banks to buy relatively cheap oil and store it for months before cashing in.“Tankage demand right now is probably the best I have seen it in the past five years,” says Doug Leach, vice-president of business development at Kinder Morgan’s terminals unit.Some storage operators have joined the futures trade themselves. Plains All American Pipeline uses its 57m barrels of storage for both lease and “contango market storage activities”, according to its quarterly report.Plains, based in Houston, is known for its “ability to drive excess profitability during periods of crude oil contango,” says analyst Ethan Bellamy at Wunderlich Securities.Some people find the mix of leasing and oil trading objectionable.“We don’t want to be in competition with our customers,” Mr Leach says."
85;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2007-02-04T21:08:25Z;Sleepwalking into a new insider scandal;;Zzzz. Zzzz. Zzzz. Uh, what? Give me a second. Sorry about that. I was taking a nap. Financial journalists tend to put their heads down sometimes, you know. Remember the telling-off we got for falling asleep on the job during the scandals over Wall Street analysts and deception at Enron?There are two types of financial scandal. The first is the Enron kind, where you have to dig hard to realise what is going on. The second involves things such as analysts recommending stocks to get advisory business for their investment banks in the 1990s. Anyone with any knowledge of the sector knew that something vaguely dodgy was going on, but it carried on being tolerated until it blew up.Given that there is so much money chasing deals and backing new ideas, we must assume that plenty of the first type are brewing. But there are also some of the second in plain view. Perhaps the most visible example is management buy-outs of public companies by executives backed by private equity firms.To state the obvious, any chief executive who plans to buy the company that he or she leads faces a huge conflict of interest with its shareholders. The job of an executive is to make a company as valuable as possible so that its shares fetch the highest possible price. But any director who bids for a company is eager to pay as little as possible so that he or she can reap the maximum reward in the future.There are always conflicts of interest between shareholders and managers of public companies, but they escalate when private equity firms hove into view. Take Justin King, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, the supermarket chain. We are told that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, CVC Capital Partners and Blackstone want him to stay if they buy the business and will no doubt give him a stake. Whose side is Mr King now on?Happily, there are already signs of journalists, analysts and investors waking up. The alarm clock has gone off in Australia, where the chairman and senior executives of Alinta, an energy utility, are in trouble for working on a bid for the company while still running it. Macquarie Bank, the company’s financial adviser, faces questions about its nimble swapping of sides to finance a management buy-out.Australia is a long way away from America, and the gap in attitudes between the two countries is striking. John Poynton, Alinta’s former chairman, and Bob Browning, its former chief executive, do not seem to have departed from what has become accepted practice in the US in the past couple of years. Nor is Macquarie a more serious sinner than Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch, to name two banks that have played both sides of the table in the US.One of the beauties of US securities laws is that companies that are taken private must file reports on exactly how executives and investment banks came to make bids for the companies they manage and advise. For those seeking enlightenment about markets, I recommend the filings on last year’s $14bn (£7bn) buy-out of HCA, the hospital chain, and $21bn buy-out of Kinder Morgan, the pipeline company.Kinder Morgan’s executives started to kick around ideas for how to raise the company’s value last March with Goldman Sachs, its adviser. By August, Rich Kinder, chairman and chief executive, had mounted a buy-out that took his stake from 18 to 31 per cent. Goldman had swapped sides to advise the buy-out group and Goldman’s private equity arm had taken a 25 per cent stake.In the HCA case, its adviser Merrill Lynch discussed the idea of a buy-out with executives last April. The managers contacted KKR and Bain Capital while Merrill, as the filing delicately puts it, “introduced management to Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity”. By July, the three private equity firms had backed a management buy-out that gave Thomas Frist, chairman and chief executive, a 15 per cent stake.Both sales were handled by special committees of directors – the standard way to curb conflicts of interest – and in both cases executives had to raise their bids a little (7.5 per cent at Kinder Morgan and 4.6 per cent at HCA). Neither company was auctioned although HCA had a “go-shop” clause to allow other bidders to emerge and Kinder Morgan’s advisers contacted other private equity firms.Compared with Alinta, executives at Kinder Morgan and HCA were treated indulgently. “Ten years ago, if an executive asked me about a buy-out, I would have said: ‘You are not going to break the law but you might get fired,’ ” says one lawyer. “Now, you’re not going to break the law and you’re not going to get fired. All you are going to do is make money.”But these are troubling transactions for everyone else. It is easy for executives to solicit backers for MBOs without having formally to get the approval of their boards. All they need do is ask their financial advisers to advise them on strategic alternatives for raising the share price. Not only is the topic bound to come up, but the bankers will probably offer to leap on board and finance their buy-out.This has been so for a while but, at last, directors and shareholders are realising that they should beware of insiders offering cash in return for their equity. At Cablevision and Clear Channel in the US and Country­wide in the UK, investors and boards have resisted bids to take their companies private. Not every MBO is inherently flawed, but when executives attempt to squeeze out their shareholders, it should be a wake-up call.
86;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2006-12-28T04:51:07Z;Goldman infrastructure fund raises $6.5bn;;Goldman Sachs is to step up its pursuit of ports, airports and regulated utilities around the world after the investment bank raised more than $6.5bn for its first dedicated infrastructure fund.The fund, which was expected to close on Wednesday, will be one of the largest single pools of capital dedicated to infrastructure investing, which is attracting growing interest from banks, insurers and pension funds eager for assets that offer stable, long-term returns.In the past year a string of high-profile infrastructure assets have changed hands as investors seek out businesses with reliable, inflation-proof cash flows that can be used to service large amounts of debt while providing returns that match pension liabilities.Goldman will contribute some of its existing investments to the fund. These include its participation in the £2.8bn ($5.5bn) take-over of Associated British Ports, the ports group, as well as its investment in the consortium that bought Kinder Morgan, the US pipeline operator, for $22bn in cash and assumed debt earlier this year. Goldman has been moving aggressively into private equity and real estate investments, and executives see infrastructure as a natural extension of that business.“With the success of this fundraising, we have the capital to create and pursue large-scale investment opportunities while achieving portfolio diversification,” said Steven Feldman and William Young, co-heads of the infrastructure group in Goldman’s merchant banking division.However, the success of Goldman’s fundraising will add to concerns that the rush by investors and banks into infrastructure investing is creating an unsustainable bubble. Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, last month warned that the infrastructure sector was in danger of suffering a “dual curse” of overvaluation and excessive leverage.The world’s largest investment banks have been eyeing up infrastructure investing for some time, spurred on by the success of Macquarie, the Australian group that is a pioneer in the sector. Bankers have been attracted not just by the returns available on infrastructure investments, but also by the fees they can typically charge for financing such deals.However, the move into infrastructure investing can also highlight potential conflicts of interest with corporate clients, as Goldman found this year when it pursued a takeover of BAA, the British airports operator that was ultimately bought by Ferrovial of Spain.Goldman’s fund is expected to concentrate on larger investments in developed markets.The bank has contributed about $750m of its own money to the fund.
87;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Kinder Morgan backs management buy-out;;Kinder Morgan, a US pipeline operator, has agreed to be bought out by its management, which has increased its offer to $15bn.The offer, led by Richard Kinder, chairman, chief executive and co-founder of Kinder Morgan, is for $107.50 cash. With the assumption of $7bn of debt, the new offer has a total value of $22bn. The previous offer in May was for $100, or $13.6bn.With energy prices at record levels, analysts are anticipating a rise in mergers and acquisitions in the sector. Indeed, the Kinder Morgan deal comes as Western Refining said on Monday that it would acquire Giant Industries, creating the US’s fourth largest publicly traded independent refiner and marketer.Western will pay $83 a share in cash, in a deal valued at about $1.5bn, including about $275m of Giant’s outstanding debt.Analysts said they had anticipated the sweetened offer for Kinder Morgan, if only to enable Mr Kinder to appear to “pass the smell test” of offering shareholders a fair price. “He knew he would end up having to do more,” said Robert Lane, vice- president of equity research at Sanders Morris Harris. “I don’t think we have ever seen a deal in which the first offer was taken.”On May 26 – the last trading day before the investor group made its proposal on May 29 – Kinder Morgan shares closed at $84.41, giving the new bid a 27 per cent premium.News of the sweetened deal, which is expected to be completed by early next year, pushed the shares up by 2.4 per cent to $104.17 in lunchtime trading.As well as Mr Kinder, those seeking to acquire Kinder Morgan include other members of management – co-founder Bill Morgan and board members Fayez Sarofim and Mike Morgan – in addition to investment partners Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, American International Group, Carlyle and Riverstone Holdings. Mr Kinder will remain chairman and chief executive, and will reinvest all his shares.The board of directors of Kinder Morgan, on the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of independent directors, has approved the agreement and will recommend Kinder Morgan stockholders approve the merger. “This buyout reflects the confidence that senior management and the sponsors have,” Mr Kinder said.The group launched the buy-out because they felt the company was underrated in the stock market, and, analysts said, they wanted to do things that will be easier to do as a private company, such as selling some operations and growing others.
88;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2006-05-31T01:06:42Z;NRG Energy rejects $8bn offer from Mirant;;"Mirant Corporation, the Atlanta-based electricity producer, on Tuesday night made an $8bn unsolicited approach to take over rival NRG Energy in a deal that would create the largest non-utility power company in the US, dominating the nation’s most populated regions.The cash-and-stock bid from Mirant, which is supported by an $11.5bn financing commitment from JPMorgan Chase, was made public after NRG earlier this month rejected the offer.Mirant is proposing to pay $57.16 per share for NRG in an equal mix of cash and stock.NRG on Tuesday night issued a statement responding to the latest offer, saying it was “not in the best interests of its shareholders.”“Having spent considerable time analysing Mirant, its assets and prospects…we have concluded that Mirant is a company and stock with flat earnings, little to no growth opportunity beyond 2007,” the statement said.Specific terms include the ability of NRG shareholders to receive $57.50 per share, valuing the company at a 33 per cent premium to its Tuesday closing price of $43.01. Mirant shares closed at $25.25.A successful takeover of NRG would position Mirant as the dominant player in non-utility - or merchant and contracted - power generation in Texas, the MidAtlantic region, the NorthEast and California. It would also mark the union of two companies that only recently emerged from bankruptcy. Both collapsed in the wake of the demise of Enron in 2001.The proposal comes as the US energy industry is experiencing a bout of consolidation. On Monday, a consortium of private equity firms offered $13.5bn to take over Kinder Morgan, the oil and gas pipeline company, in deal backed by management. US utilities have also participated in the dealmaking activity, but transactions such as FPL’s $11.5bn takeover of Constellation and Exelon’s $13bn bid for PSEG have encountered stiff regulatory hurdles.Mirant does not expect to be faced with the same obstacles, and believes a deal could close before the end of the year. The company is likely to woo NRG inevstors by describing benefits such as $150m in annual cost savings from corporate level integration; coal purchasing synergies ; and similar approaches to hedging.A takeover of NRG would come only a year after the NRG acquired Texas Genco, the Texas -based power group, in a landmark transaction for the four private equity owners that previously owned the assets and made about five times their money on the deal.These included Blackstone, Texas Pacific Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Hellman & Friedman.Lawyers at Wachtell Lipton advised Mirant, along with bankers at JPMorgan, which provided exclusive advisory services as well as the financing."
89;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2006-05-30T23:33:06Z;Kinder Morgan shares soar on buy-out proposal;;Shares in Kinder Morgan, the US oil and gas pipeline group, rose nearly 19 per cent - and the value of its bonds tumbled - on Tuesday as Wall Street reacted to the $13.5bn takeover bid tabled by a consortium including the company’s top executives and private equity firms.The proposal marks another example of the power of private equity groups in corporate America, where some of the largest companies are being lured away from public markets in multi-billion dollar buy-outs supported by management.Tuesday’s market reaction highlighted how differently such deals are greeted by different classes of investors. While shareholders were celebrating the premium valuation in the offer and the prospect of a bidding war, bondholders worried that the proposed additional debt financing would damage the company’s credit.The company’s longest-dated bonds fell more than 10 per cent from their last traded levels, according to data from MarketAxess.Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, the rating agencies, said they might downgrade the company to junk if the deal went through. “The sharp increase in debt contemplated in the [Kinder Morgan] buyout offer would likely lead to a multiple notch ratings downgrade into the ‘BB’ category,” said Todd Shipman, an analyst at S&P. Kinder Morgan is currently rated BBB, two notches above junk.Meanwhile, the company’s shares moved up 18.8 per cent to $100.31, or slightly above the offer price of 100 per share. This suggests that many on Wall Street are speculating that the consortium – which includes Goldman Sachs, American International Group, Carlyle and Riverstone – will have to raise its offer to clinch a deal.One US energy banker suggested there was also the possibility of a counterbid, from players such as TransCanada or Enbridge, although such a move would be complicated in the absence of support from Mr Kinder, who holds a 20 per cent stake in the company. Other private equity groups active in the energy arena might also examine an offer, he said.If accepted, the proposal has the potential of setting a number of records: it would be the largest ever management buy-out at $20.4bn including debt, and involve the largest ever equity cheque written for a single private equity transaction, at $4.5bn.The bid for Kinder Morgan prompted a rally in shares of other midstream energy groups, including Williams Companies, which had risen 3 per cent by the close, and El Paso, which was up 1.7 per cent.Bankers at Goldman Sachs and lawyers at Weil Gotshal & Manges advised the consortium on the bid, which will have to be approved by a special committee of independent Kinder Morgan board members.
90;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2006-05-30T23:25:13Z;Lex: Kinder Morgan;;The proposed management buy-out of Kinder Morgan Inc stands out for its sheer size. At close to $22bn, including debt, it will be the biggest ever. But it should leave investors with the usual unsettled feeling. While better off because of the 18.5 per cent premium on offer, they risk leaving a lot on the table for management and its backers.KMI is a complex energy company. About half of its value lies in a general partnership stake in Kinder Morgan Energy Partners - a separately listed master limited partnership containing pipelines and other assets. As general partner, KMI gets geared exposure to the master limited partnership’s cash flows. That makes it a big swing factor in KMI’s valuation. It also leaves management - with its deep understanding of the assets, particularly the pipelines projects yet to be completed - in a strong position to calculate what the real value should be.According to Morgan Stanley, the $100-a-share offer implicitly values KMI’s general partnership stake at about 17-times 2007 distributable cash flow. But other such entities, admittedly with different tax structures, trade as high as 25 times. That appears to leave plenty of upside if ongoing projects are managed effectively and, potentially, the tax status is one day changed.It will be tough for a third party bidder to challenge management’s offer - given its intimate knowledge of the assets, strong private equity backing and large equity ownership. (Chief executive Richard Kinder alone owns 18 per cent of KMI). That makes the whole process very unsatisfactory. But the special committee of directors, which will evaluate the deal, should at least be able to squeeze a higher price out of the bidders as it seeks to demonstrate its independence.
91;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
92;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2006-05-30T03:21:20Z;Kinder Morgan in $13bn management buy-out;;"Kinder Morgan, the Texas-based midstream energy company, on Monday night received a takeover proposal worth $13.5bn in cash from its management and a group of private equity funds including Goldman Sachs.If a deal is struck it will be the latest - and largest - in a recent string of proposed ""management buy-outs"" in the US, where executives offer to take their companies private with the help of private equity firms.This month, Aramark, the food service and equipment rental company, received a $5.8bn takeover offer led by its management, while Kerzner International, the Bahamas-based casino and leisure group, will be taken private in a $3.5bn deal led by its founders.The consortium bidding for Kinder Morgan is offering to pay $100 a share for the company, or an 18.5 per cent premium over the company's closing share price of $84.41 on Friday. The proposal may have been driven by a belief that the company's fortunes with public investors had passed their peak. Its shares hit a high this year of $103.45.As well as Kinder executives Richard Kinder, Mike and Bill Morgan and Fayez Sarofim, members of the consortium include the buy-out units of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, American International Group, the insurance giant, and US private equity firms Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings.The buyers would also take on about $8bn of the company's debt, bringing the total value of the proposed deal near to $22bn - or close to the $30bn Kohlberg Kravis Roberts paid for RJR Nabisco in the largest private equity deal in the late 1980s.Kinder Morgan is one of the largest US midstream energy companies, operating natural gas and oil pipelines and terminals across North America.The company expanded into Canada last year with the acquisition of Terasen for $3.1bn. Kinder Morgan also owns the general partnership in Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, one of the largest publicly traded pipeline limited partnerships in the US.In a statement on Monday night, Mr Kinder, chairman and chief executive, said the takeover offer would benefit the partnership by allowing it to implement a new hedging facility for crude oil, and to acquire at an attractive price the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which connects Edmonton with Vancouver.A deal to take Kinder Morgan private would represent the latest chapter in one of the more remarkable stories in the US energy industry. Only 15 years ago, Kinder Morgan was a small rural utility. But its assets grew rapidly through a series of acquisitions and its pipelines now serve key regional energy markets such as Chicago and Houston."
93;KMI;Kinder Morgan;2005-08-01T22:38:45Z;Kinder Morgan buys Canadian rival for $3.1bn;;Kinder Morgan, the US pipeline operator, on Monday agreed to buy Canadian rival Terasen for $3.1bn in cash and stock, in an attempt to take advantage of a projected boom in oilsands production.The deal will give Kinder Morgan, already the second largest operator of natural gas pipelines in the US, access to areas of western Canada. Oilsands production there is expected to reach 2m barrels of crude oil a day - double the current levels - by 2012.“We have been very successful in finding megatrends in the energy business,” Richard Kinder, the chief executive, told the Financial Times. “This is primarily a recognition that we think oilsands are going to be extremely important in the next 15 to 20 years and we want to participate in that.”Oilsands production is typically more expensive and difficult than traditional crude oil production, but has become increasingly attractive amid soaring commodity costs.Last week, as it reported a rise in second quarter earnings, Terasen said: “Energy demand in North America and Asia clearly shows the need for additional pipeline capacity from the Alberta oilsands.”Mr Kinder said his company had been looking at a number of acquisition targets before settling on Terasen. According to Thomson Financial, the deal ranks as the second largest ever US acquisition in Canada, after Duke Energy’s $8.2bn purchase of Westcoast Energy in September 2001.Under the terms of the deal, Terasen investors will be receiving about C$35.91 in cash and stock, valuing the company 20 per cent higher than its shares’ average closing price over 20 days. Kinder Morgan will also take on some $2.5bn of Terasen debt.By acquiring Terasen, Kinder Morgan will also be taking control of a regulated gas utility business in British Columbia. Mr Kinder cited favourable demographic trends - as well as Vancouver’s hosting of the 2010 Winter Olympics - as reasons why this too might be a good investment.Overall, the combined company will have about 40,000 miles of natural gas and oil pipelines, more than 1.1m natural gas distribution customers and an enterprise value in excess of $19bn.The deal is expected to lift Kinder Morgan earnings by 6-8 per cent next year and result in a dividend rise worth more than 50 cents per share from its current level of $3.00 annually.Mr Kinder will remain chief executive of the combined group, whose headquarters will remain in Houston, Texas. Terasen’s pipeline operations will continue to be based in Calgary, Alberta.UBS advised Kinder Morgan. RBC Capital Markets advised Terasen.
