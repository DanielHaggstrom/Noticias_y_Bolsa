0;DLR;Digital Realty Trust;2019-11-22T05:00:13Z;Don’t be fooled by the growth in global datacentre companies;The specialist groups risk being sidelined when big cloud companies start talking to each other;You know the way serious money thinks. Pick a big trend, such as protectionism, the dollar’s overvaluation, gold or data moving to the cloud. Then use the financial markets to have the trend make money for you, say by picking an ETF or the best-rated securities in a sector.Take, for example, data and applications moving to the cloud. You could buy one of the big tech names, say Amazon or Google. The smarter thing to do though, is to pack your portfolio with one, or several, of the top datacentre companies that major companies or governments use when they move to the cloud. Why, even Facebook and Apple turn to specialised providers rather than keep their apps and data on-premises. You would be profiting from the future.No, no and no. Remember, the point of financial markets is not to make you money, but to devise ever more elaborate ways to take your money. The more clever you are, the more intricate your mistakes can be.Having said that, the growth of the global datacentre companies is a real trend. Take two of the top specialists, Equinix and Digital Realty. Both take the form of US real estate investment trusts or Reits. So they pay out about half (adjusted) cash flow from operations as dividends, after paying for maintenance, however they define that.As the companies invest more in their businesses, with the certainty or hope that Facebook, Ford or Acme will “migrate” their data and apps to servers in the datacentres, they raise more funds with equity offerings or debt issues. The base rent they charge is quoted in kilowatts, a reference to their huge power requirements.The major users are gradually concentrating their IT spending in the largest and most capable datacentre companies, which have global “offerings” and the most possible interconnectivity with multiple telecoms providers. So the market share of the top groups is increasing.This is reflected in equity prices and debt ratings. Over the past year, Equinix has had the better performance, with its shares up about half. It is more focused on “retail”, or service and interconnexion-intensiveness. Digital Realty was the investment grade datacentre, serving “wholesale” customers, sophisticated users who just want cheap data warehouse space.The two are leapfrogging each other’s competitive advantage with big customers. Equinix cracked the investment grade barrier last month and has already exchanged debt costing up to 5.75 per cent with new notes, some yielding just 2.625 per cent. On October 30, Digital Realty counter-attacked Equinix’s stronger European market position by striking an $8.4bn deal to buy Interxion, a Dutch datacentre company.Demand for capacity has been shifting from “co-location” customers, mostly traditional corporations who want to move their own servers next to others in the warehouse, to “hyperscale” cloud-based companies.What a fun multiplayer online war game. Is there anything that could go wrong?Yes. If you are a public investor, your money is getting a commission to be a hero — probably a dead one in the end. Do you think Mark Zuckerberg is renting your datacentre so he can make you rich?According to real estate services firm CBRE, in the US in the first half of this year, the secondary market price for datacentre megawatts declined in Boston, Seattle, and Minneapolis, and was already down to a dirt-cheap $100-$130/MW in the giant Northern Virginia market. No wonder Equinix and Digital Realty are battling over the less developed European market.A lot of presently valuable leases will need rolling over by the time those investment grade notes mature in the middle of the next decade. If those customers want to use AI applications, you may need to install up to ten times the power access.As for the demand from co-location space bought by IT departments, well, that may largely go away. “Co-location is only temporarily driving demand for datacentres. It’s a holding area. Eventually that will move,” says Sid Nag, a vice-president for cloud research at Gartner Group.And what about the fast growing requirement for “edge” datacentre space outside the main hubs? According to Mr Nag: “The edge issue has always been about latency [the response time lag caused in part by distance]. The dark hole there is the provision of 5G mobile service. The [mobile providers] are going to create some tectonic shifts in the edge cloud.” And under your shiny, almost-new edge datacentre.Also, the large cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft have been using the expensive interconnexions offered by datacentres to connect to each other. Eventually, Mr Nag says, “the cloud providers will talk to each other, without the datacentres’ interconnexions.”Hey, sorry about your investment in datacentres!
1;DLR;Digital Realty Trust;2018-10-19T10:30:00Z;Data in the cloud falls back to earth;;Any child can tell you the data world is moving to the cloud. The cloud has to live somewhere, as in a datacentre. Not all of those are owned by Amazon, Microsoft, NTT or China Telecom. So if I am an infrastructure or property company, how do I get into such a high-growth business? It does sound better than a European bank headquarters in the City of London, or high-end apartments on East 57th Street.As luck would have it, there are people ready to sell you their datacentres, such as telecom companies or the smaller independent owners of co-location services. They know that, while the past decade has seen an extraordinary boom in IT capex, the corporate world is reining in tech spending.The past few years have been good for co-located datacentre companies, which rent serviced rack-and-cage space to server owners. The scramble to find such space has benefited companies such as Equinix and Digital Realty Trust, the two largest independent co-located datacentre companies.Both were run as real estate investment trusts, which in a declining rate environment was a cheap way to raise the gobs of capital consumed by the trade. For a while that worked well. Equinix shares rose about 10-fold in the 10 years to November. If you had bought Digital Realty post-crisis, by this August you would have made more than 3.5 times your investment. And, of course, as Reits, both pay out post-capex cash flow as dividends.Over the past 12 months, though, despite both companies still having double-digit revenue and cash-flow growth, their equity has been weak. Equinix’s share price has declined by 12 per cent and Digital Realty’s is down a tenth. You could ascribe some weakness to the rise in interest rates affecting income vehicles such as Reits. Considering, though, that Equinix yields just 2.22 per cent and Digital Realty 3.64 per cent, and that Reit prices generally have increased, we should look beyond the yield curve.The truth is datacentres are a demanding business. As one industry veteran says: “This is capital intensive and you have to deliver service to a customer at “five nines” reliability (99.999 per cent). You need access to (property) in the right place, electrical substation access and redundant connectivity to lots of (telecoms) carriers. You also need co-location with ‘hyperusers’ such as Amazon and Google.”That is a fair description of what a few companies such as Equinix and Digital Realty are able to offer but investors seem worried about future revenue growth.According to Gartner, the growth in total spending by IT departments on datacentres will decline from 6 per cent this year to 1.6 per cent next year. This should accelerate industry consolidation as smaller datacentre providers lose market share.Datacentres can be thought of as similar to shopping centres. Hyperusers such as Amazon or Google can demand favourable pricing as “anchor tenants” for smaller corporate customers who want low latency in their interaction with the cloud giants. Many customers are also willing to pay for access to multiple telecommunications providers, or even direct connections within the centres to other customers, such as major suppliers, banks or distributors.That is why US telecoms companies such as AT&T and Verizon have arranged to sell their in-house datacentres to independents who can offer interconnection neutrality and co-location with other customers. AT&T, for example, has agreed to sell its datacentres to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners and, in turn, is outsourcing some of its requirements to Oracle.In time these trends should favour larger independent operators, which should, ultimately, benefit from buying smaller companies that cannot charge premium prices.The challenge will be to generate the capital to get to that promised land. In the first half of this year, for example, Equinix earned $840m in net cash from operating activities, but spent $910m on all property, plant and equipment, along with $830m on business acquisitions.This is not as dire a situation as that which the owners of “dark fibre” optical cable faced in the years after the dotcom bust. The better datacentres are running at 85 per cent or 90 per cent of capacity.As data and applications become more portable across platforms, large users will migrate to the most effective points of the cloud. Those will include independent datacentres with the densest interconnections, most desirable co-tenants and low latency for the customer.It will not include interlopers such as garden-variety private equity and infrastructure funds. You have to know what you are doing.
2;DLR;Digital Realty Trust;2016-10-27T22:32:11Z;US real estate sector hit by soaring bond yield;Broader US stock market weaker after mixed earnings;The US real estate sector faced heavy selling pressure on Thursday, as Treasury bond prices declined, amid rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.The market-implied odds that the Fed increases rates in December have crept higher throughout October, hitting nearly three-quarters on Thursday from 60 per cent at the start of the month, as data have reinforced expectations that economic output growth accelerated after a disappointing first half of 2016.At the same time, an increasing number of top Fed policymakers have warned over the risks that tightening in the labour market could eventually push inflation above the central bank’s 2 per cent target if it does not slowly increase its benchmark interest rate, which remains just slightly above the crisis-era low.“Combined with the ongoing uptrend in core inflation and the economy at full employment, the risks are rising that the Fed is falling behind the curve,” Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, said.As a result, “a December rate hike looks very likely”, said Zach Pandl, an economist at Goldman Sachs.The more hawkish outlook on Wall Street sparked selling in Treasury bonds on Thursday, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, soaring as much as 7.5 basis points to 1.868 per cent, a nearly five-month high.The real estate sector, which is frequently used by investors as a bond proxy because of its consistent dividend yields, followed suit, sinking 2.5 per cent. That brings the group’s decline this month to 8.3 per cent, making it one of the worst performers on the S&P 500 index.Digital Realty Trust, which owns 155 data centres across 11 countries, tumbled 4.7 per cent to $92.02, Extra Space Storage, an owner and operator of self-storage facilities, skidded 7.4 per cent to $70.59.Elsewhere, Bristol-Myers Squibb raised its full-year earnings outlook on Thursday after third-quarter results handily beat Wall Street’s expectations driven by soaring sales for drugs including cancer treatment Opdivo and blood-thinner Eliquis.The company’s shares rose 5.4 per cent to $51.96 after it reported third-quarter revenue of $4.9bn, a 21 per cent increase from the same three-month period last year and above the $4.8bn forecast by analysts. Its net income was $1.2bn compared with expectations of $1bn, weighed down slightly by foreign currency pressures.That translated to earnings per diluted share of 72 cents, compared with 42 cents in the same period a year ago.The strong results were led by blockbuster Opdivo, which saw revenues more than triple compared with the third quarter of 2015, as regulatory agencies around the world have recently widened its range of approved uses.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 fell 0.3 per cent to 2,133.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 18,169.68 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.7 per cent to 5,215.97.
3;DLR;Digital Realty Trust;2012-03-11T19:31:42Z;Data centres: riding the wave;The boom in cloud computing has prompted a data centre surge;Selling picks and shovels may be smart during a gold rush, but you gotta put ’em somewhere, too. The boom in data-heavy internet services and cloud computing has prompted a surge in demand for data centres. Riding this wave are the owners of the speciality buildings that house the equipment that runs them. The market is growing fast. Cisco Systems estimates that global data centre traffic is growing at a compound annual rate of 33 per cent, and will reach 4.8 zettabytes (about 5tn gigabytes) by the end of 2015.What is new is not the growth in internet data but the way in which it is being transferred. Until about 2008, internet traffic was dominated by peer-to-peer networks, which connected individual computers to each other – the music file-sharing website Napster made its name in this way. As a result, most internet traffic did not flow through a data centre. Since 2008, however, remote data storage has become the main way of storing files.As Apple, Google and Facebook fight it out for consumers’ hearts, minds and wallets, by offering more storage space and easier ways to upload and download photos and movies, investors in the specialist property trusts that house data centres are lapping it up. Since the stock market’s nadir in 2009, two of the largest data centre-specific property trusts – Digital Realty Trust, which counts Facebook as one of its largest clients, and Dupont Fabros – have generated returns for investors of 170 per cent and 336 per cent respectively, easily more than the broader property market’s 140 per cent return.Constructing and managing these niche buildings is a skill that most property trusts tend to avoid. That means that, even though Digital Realty and Dupont Fabros trade at about 16 times their 2012 earnings – a cosy premium to the market – investors may find that these quiet achievers are well positioned to profit from the frantic rush for space of their more famous clients.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

5;DLR;Digital Realty Trust;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
