0;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-03-17T23:19:32Z;US companies raise $25bn as bond market thaws;ExxonMobil, PepsiCo and Verizon lead list of issuers paying higher interest rates to raise cash;ExxonMobil, PepsiCo and Verizon were among nine US companies that raced to borrow money on Tuesday as improved market conditions opened the door for the groups to sell tens of billions of dollars in investment-grade corporate bonds.Companies across the globe have worked to fortify their balance sheets over the past two weeks by securing new loans from banks. On Tuesday, the corporate bond market thawed, providing an opening for better quality groups to issue debt — albeit at higher rates than in recent months.The borrowers on Monday also included insurer Progressive, Bank of America and electric utilities Consumers Energy, Dominion Energy, Oncor and Union Electric.In some sense, it is a vote of confidence in a scary worldRiskier borrowers were locked out of the market as investors remained picky. Investment grade utility Entergy had planned to raise cash in the bond market on Tuesday but postponed its plans, according to two people briefed on the matter.“Companies should use any window they can to access liquidity at the moment,” said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management. “I believe these deals should function smoothly but they will be the first test of the new economic reality we are in.”The nine companies borrowed $25bn, according to FT calculations, with recently downgraded oil and gas producer Exxon clinching $8.5bn, the largest borrower of the day. Exxon on Monday vowed to “significantly reduce spending” as the coronavirus outbreak sapped demand for oil and a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia knocked down the value of crude.However, institutional investors on Tuesday demanded significantly higher payouts, reflecting fears of an economic slowdown. Exxon raised $2bn of the $8.5bn through new 10-year debt, which was priced to yield 240 basis points over a similarly maturing US Treasury, or 3.48 per cent. Less than a year ago it issued 10-year bonds with a so-called spread of just 75 basis points, which yielded 2.44 per cent at the time. Wireless carrier Verizon, beverage group PepsiCo and Bank of America faced similar investor demands. The maker of Pepsi and Lays potato chips secured $6.5bn on Tuesday in the second-largest bond offering, with 30-year debt sold to investors at a spread of 200 basis points and a yield of 3.65 per cent. That compared with the premium of 80 basis points it paid last July when it issued a 30-year bond. “These are top blue-chip names trying to add to stability and confirm that markets are still working — choppy but working,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. “In some sense, it is a vote of confidence in a scary world right now.”The European debt market also emerged from hibernation on Tuesday, but with less enthusiasm. Although three bonds were issued in the banking sector, including a €1bn covered bond by Royal Bank of Canada, most corporates were still reluctant to dip their toes into the market. Toronto-Dominion Bank decided to postpone its sterling bond offer due to adverse market conditions. “Issuers in the US are taking the plunge, and saying ‘better the devil you know,’” said Adam Bothamley, global co-head of debt capital markets at HSBC in London. “But, as we’ve seen in previous cycles, we’re in a market where the US is willing to put a price on risk earlier than other global investors.”
1;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Pepsi/Rockstar: an acquired taste;Energy drinks are an increasingly crowded space but this looks like a well-timed tie-up;Americans are thirsty for energy drinks. So are big beverage companies. PepsiCo is splashing out $3.85bn to buy Rockstar Energy Beverages. The $182bn packaged food and drink giant is hoping the acquisition will help it compete better in a fast-growth category that is particularly popular with millennial consumers. Buying a distant number three player is not the obvious way for PepsiCo to get its energy drink buzz. Rockstar, with its distinctive black and gold logo, has less than 6 per cent of the market in the US, according to Nielsen data. That lags well behind market leader Monster Beverage’s 42 per cent and Red Bull’s 35 per cent. Worse, Rockstar’s market share has declined in each of the past three years. The challenges are reflected in the price. PepsiCo is paying just a little over 3 times revenues, compared to the 8.5 times publicly listed Monster is valued at. With its deep pockets and drinks expertise, PepsiCo can add value. One example: Rockstar has a notably weak presence on the US east coast and outside the US. That is something PepsiCo can remedy through a ramp up in marketing spend.There is a more granular reason for PepsiCo to buy Rockstar. The two companies currently have a distribution agreement that limits what PepsiCo can do in energy drinks. Owning Rockstar outright would allow PepsiCo to sidestep the kind of legal issues that have afflicted Coca-Cola. They wrangled with partner Monster over plans for a Coke-branded energy drink. A roll-out of more caffeinated versions of PepsiCo’s existing Mountain Dew Kickstart energy drink seems likely once the Rockstar deal closes. Energy drinks continue to post steady growth. Manufacturers are substituting low-sugar versions of their drinks, as consumers turn away from fattening sodas. It is also an increasingly crowded space. Even Amazon is looking for a jolt through its Solimo brand. Rockstar is a fixer-upper. With a bit of hard work, the purchase could end up being a well-timed bargain.

2;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-03-11T13:14:09Z;PepsiCo to buy energy drink maker Rockstar for $3.85bn;Acquisition to boost company’s offering in fast-growing consumer category;PepsiCo is seeking to boost its presence in the fast-growing energy drinks category, announcing it will buy Rockstar Energy Beverages for $3.85bn.The deal reflects the trend among big beverage companies like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola to overhaul their portfolios to shift their reliance on sales of sugary, fizzy drinks and towards options ranging from tea and coffee to water of both still and sparkling varieties, which appeal to health-conscious and millennial consumers.Neither PepsiCo nor Coca-Cola own a major brand in the energy drinks category, which is forecast to grow to more than $80bn over the next five years, and is currently dominated by Red Bull.Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo chief executive, described the acquisition as “highly strategic” and said it would allow the company to “both accelerate Rockstar’s performance and unlock our ability to expand in the category with existing brands such as Mountain Dew.”The deal would mark one of the first big moves for Mr Laguarta, who took the reins from Indra Nooyi in 2018, and comes at a time when sharp moves in financial markets have prompted investors and bankers to rapidly reassess the outlook for merger and acquisition activity.PepsiCo shares were down 3.8 per cent in pre-market trading on Wednesday, slightly worse off than the 3.4 per cent drop for the S&P 500 that was implied by futures as investors continue to grapple with volatility amid the coronavirus outbreak and following Monday’s oil price plunge.PepsiCo has distributed Rockstar in North America since 2009. Its own stable of energy drinks is limited to Mountain Dew Kickstart, GameFuel and AMP. Coca-Cola owns a stake in Monster Beverage, and had a distribution agreement with the company that, until an arbitration ruling last year, meant it could not sell its own Coke-branded energy drinks in the US.In February, PepsiCo said it would buy Hangzhou Haomusi Food, also known as Be & Cheery, one of the largest online snacks companies in China, for $705m, which it said at the time represented “an important step” in its goal to become China’s leading consumer-centric food and beverage company.PepsiCo said in a statement on Wednesday it did not expect the transaction, which is subject to the usual customary closing conditions and approvals, to be material to its revenue or earnings in 2020. The deal is expected to close in the first half of this year.
3;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-02-13T19:38:22Z;PepsiCo: fizz whizz;The food and drinks group’s share surge has outpaced arch-rival Coca-Cola ;For a company that makes its living selling offbeat products such as Jacked Ranch Dipped Hot Wing Doritos and vanilla-flavoured coffee-infused cola, PepsiCo’s earnings reports can be a surprisingly dry and dull affair. Fortunately for shareholders, the stock itself has been anything but.Shares in the $200bn packaged food and drink giant have jumped by a third over the past 12 months to hit a record high this week. That tops arch-rival Coca-Cola’s 20 per cent gain.At 24 times forward earnings, Pepsi investors must consider the possibility that the stock has run its course. The drink and snack markets are crowded and competition is cut-throat. The global economy is cooling. But generous payouts, progress in turning round a struggling beverage business and the potential for growth from its healthier offerings are reasons for investors to stay put. The company had solid results last year. Organic revenue grew 4.5 per cent in 2019, the fastest pace in four years. Despite its name, Pepsi gets most of its bite from the snack group, Frito Lay North America. The division generated a quarter of group sales but over half of total operating profit last year. Meanwhile, smaller can sizes and sugar-free versions of Pepsi and Gatorade helped drive a 3 per cent rise in the North America beverage business last year.Having said this, Pepsi’s generosity to its shareholders has a cost. Free cash flow has not covered the sum of its dividend plus share buybacks since 2017. Net debt has risen to twice ebitda last year. Though still low, that ratio is up more than 31 per cent over two years. Low interest rates make this an acceptable strategy.Perhaps the best news for Pepsi now is its tiny exposure to China, where the coronavirus outbreak has hit consumption. The country accounts for less than 2 per cent of Pepsi sales. That is one defensive quality to keep sceptics at bay.Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly. Please sign up here.
4;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Pepsi price rises offset ad spending splurge;Consumer goods group ups forecast for 2019 revenues, but not profits;Consumers are stumping up more for fizzy drinks and snacks without balking at higher prices, PepsiCo said, as the US-based group issued a more bullish annual sales forecast.Quarterly results published on Thursday showed the company behind brands including Doritos, Quaker Oats and Tropicana increased prices an average 4 per cent in the quarter while its volumes were flat.“As far as I can tell, the consumer is doing just fine,” said Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, said in an interview. He remained upbeat about the outlook, especially for the US, although economic performance varied by country. “Obviously Brexit is a bit of a concern in the UK right now.”The ability of consumer goods companies to push price increases on to the consumer has become a central concern of investors as tariffs and other costs rise in some areas. Retailers such as Target have signalled that they want suppliers to absorb cost increases, and the forthcoming earnings season will probably provide evidence of who is winning in that tug of war.Mr Johnston also said Pepsi would “certainly continue to increase” spending on advertising and marketing after a 12 per cent rise so far this year, which he said had fuelled consumer demand for its products.The company’s shares were up 4 per cent by late morning in New York, giving it a market capitalisation of $195bn, after it said it would “meet or exceed” a target to increase full-year organic revenues by 4 per cent this year.Caroline Levy, analyst at Macquarie, said that while volumes across the company — including a 2 per cent decline in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa — were “a tad disappointing” in the quarter, these had been “more than offset by strong price”.Despite its more optimistic revenue forecast, Pepsi still expects profits to come under pressure this year. It expects earnings per share, excluding certain items, to dip 1 per cent.PepsiCo’s chief executive Ramon Laguarta, who replaced Indra Nooyi at the helm last October, had already put investors on notice that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of additional investments this year would hurt profits.The world’s largest consumer goods companies are feeling the need to reinvest to improve revenues in the face of changing consumer tastes and behaviour. Pepsi is stepping up a push into other products such as juices, teas and sports drinks as salt, fat and sugar in diets go out of favour.“The cost of achieving growth is increasing,” said Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo.Pepsi generated $17.1bn worth of sales in the third quarter. That marked a rise from the same period a year ago of 4.3 per cent on an organic basis, which strips out the negative effects of foreign exchange. The rise was led by the company’s Frito-Lay snacks business in North America, which helped offset volume declines at its domestic PepsiCo Beverages business.Operating profit was little changed in the quarter at $2.86bn, while a provision for income taxes pushed net income down from $2.51bn a year ago to $2.1bn.
5;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2019-07-19T07:36:38Z;PepsiCo plots expansion in Africa with $1.7bn deal;Fizzy drinks and snacks manufacturer has been investing in new products under Ramon Laguarta;PepsiCo is to acquire South Africa’s Pioneer Foods for $1.7bn, expanding the US fizzy drinks and snacks company’s footprint in the African market as it diversifies under a new chief executive.The two companies said on Friday that Pepsi has agreed to buy Piooner’s outstanding shares for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash, valuing the deal at approximately $1.7bn. Shares traded at 77 rand at the close on Thursday.The acquisition will help Pepsi “gain a solid beachhead for expansion into Sub-Saharan Africa,” the maker of Tropicana, Walkers Crisps and the eponymous fizzy drink said, as it boosts its manufacturing and distribution presence on the continent.“Pioneer Foods forms an important part of our strategy to not only expand in South Africa, but further into sub-Saharan Africa as well,” said Pepsi chairman and chief executive Ramon Laguarta.Mr Laguarta replaced Indra Nooyi at the helm of Pepsi last October, and has stepped up investments including a push into products such as juices, teas and sports drinks as consumers shift their tastes into healthier products.Pioneer Foods sells cereals, juices and other snacks, via brands such as Weet-Bix, Liqui-Fruit and Ceres.UBS, JPMorgan and Centerview acted as financial advisers to PepsiCo. PSG Capital acted as corporate and transaction adviser to Pioneer Foods.
6;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2019-07-09T18:25:13Z;PepsiCo says investments paying off as revenues climb;Chief financial officer credits increased spending on logistics and brand development;PepsiCo said investments the fizzy drinks and snacks company was making to offset pressures in the consumer goods industry were starting to pay off, after it reported a jump in quarterly revenues.“I think we’re seeing a clear and present pay back,” said Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer of the New York-based company, which is behind brands including Tropicana, 7UP and Walkers crisps, as well as the eponymous beverage.Net revenues in the company’s second quarter rose 4.5 per cent on an organic basis to $16.5bn, while net income rose from $1.82bn to $2.04bn.Chief executive Ramon Laguarta, who replaced Indra Nooyi at the helm last October, is ramping up marketing and stepping up a push into products such as juices, teas and sports drinks as salt, fat and sugar in diets go out of favour. PepsiCo had already put investors on notice that the investments would hurt profits this year. Full-year core earnings per share on a constant currency basis are expected to decline 1 per cent this year, despite a 4 per cent rise in organic revenues.Despite the higher second-quarter revenues and profits, Mr Johnson cautioned on Tuesday that “organic revenue growth comparisons get meaningfully more challenging in the second half”. He added that the “pace of planned reinvestments in the business will accelerate” over the rest of the year.The company on Tuesday left its financial guidance for the year unchanged. But PepsiCo shares eased back about 1 per cent by lunchtime in New York trading to about $131 each, compared with $109 at the start of the year.“The cost of achieving growth is increasing,” said Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo.Sales in the quarter were led by Frito-Lay North America, whose brands include Doritos and Cheetos. Revenues at the division rose 5 per cent on an organic basis to $4bn. At the group’s biggest division, PepsiCo Beverages North America, they rose 2 per cent to $5.3bn, helped by water brands LIFEWTR and Bubly.Other recently developed products include Gatorade Zero, a low-calorie alternative to the sport drink, and a version of its Mountain Dew energy drink that is pitched at computer gamers and features a resealable lid. “We’re selling every one of them we can make,” Mr Johnson said.The company was using some of the investment funds to improve logistics and delivery, Mr Johnson said. He added that PepsiCo also planned to open a new hub in Silicon Valley as part of a focus on digital innovation.
7;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2019-04-17T17:27:41Z;Super Bowl ad blitz helps Pepsi shares hit high;Marketing spending spurs biggest sales increase in more than three years;PepsiCo hailed its Super Bowl marketing blitz a success on Wednesday after the food and snacks company reported its biggest sales increase in more than three years, sending shares to a record high. Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, said revenues generated from the campaign had been a “big driver” of the company’s 5.2 per cent rise in organic sales in the first quarter. He noted that the American football game was a “one-time event” and cautioned growth rates were likely to moderate in the remainder of the year.The New York-based company covered the host city of Atlanta with billboards during the championship that played up its rivalry with Coca-Cola, which is based in the city. Stars from Steve Carell to The Backstreet Boys featured in TV commercials during the Super Bowl to promote its products, which include the crisps brand Doritos as well as the eponymous soft drink. “We really had a very big Super Bowl, bigger than we've had in previous years,” Mr Johnston said. He described a 6 per cent rise in organic sales at its Frito Lay division as “extraordinary”, and added: “We don't expect that rate of growth to continue for the balance of the year.”Chief executive Ramon Laguarta, who replaced Indra Nooyi at the helm in October, is ramping up spending on marketing and stepping up a push into products such as juices, teas and sports drinks to deal with rapidly changing consumer tastes and behaviour. The group’s first-quarter boost in organic sales, which strip out the effects of currency fluctuations and acquisitions and are widely seen to be a good gauge of the health of Pepsi’s legacy brands, was the largest since the third quarter of 2015. Organic sales at PepsiCo’s all-important North America beverage unit rose for a third straight quarter, climbing 2.5 per cent. The unit, which makes up more than a third of the company’s revenues, reported a 2.1 per cent rise in sales while operating profit edged about $1m higher to $389m. Overall, PepsiCo’s net revenue for the three months to March 23 grew 2.6 per cent to $12.8bn, topping expectations for $12.66bn. Net income came in at $1.41bn, or $1 per share, compared to the $1.34bn, or 94 cents per share, recorded in the year-ago period. Analysts expected earnings of 92 cents a share. Shares rose more than 3 per cent at lunchtime in New York on Wednesday, having hit a record high of $126.86. The rally brought gains for the year so far to 15 per cent. They lost nearly 8 per cent in 2018.
8;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2019-02-15T12:46:36Z;Nooyi’s successor stamps authority on Pepsi;New chief executive lays down plans to invest more in new products and marketing;Indra Nooyi’s replacement at the helm of PepsiCo, Ramon Laguarta, has moved to stamp his authority on the drinks and snacks company with plans to make hundreds of millions of dollars worth of additional investments, pushing profits lower this year.Presenting his first batch of earnings as the company’s chief executive, Mr Laguarta outlined plans to deploy extra funds in marketing, innovation and manufacturing capacity.The plans from Pepsi — whose brands include Tropicana, 7UP and Walkers crisps, as well as the eponymous fizzy drink — is the latest sign that the world’s largest consumer goods companies feel the need to reinvest to improve revenues in a rapidly shifting landscape.“As we thought about 2019 and thought about our future — particularly with the change in the CEO — the conclusion we came to was we can sustainably grow the business faster than we have been,” said Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer.The US company did not spell out the scale of the investments, but it put investors on notice that core earnings per share on a constant currency basis would decline 1 per cent this year. About half of the decline was explained by additional investments. The rest relates to tax changes, the strong dollar and other items.New initiatives from the company include Gatorade Zero, a low-calorie alternative to its sport drink, and Mountain Dew Game Fuel, an energy drink for computer gamers. Mr Johnston said it plans this year to “ramp up” sales of Bubly, its flavoured sparkling water.Pepsi’s tempered profit forecast came a day after arch-rival Coca-Cola warned of slowing sales growth this year, prompting its biggest one-day share price fall in a decade. The health of the US consumer has also come under renewed scrutiny. Economic data this week showed retail sales in December fell by the most since 2009.Wall Street took Pepsi’s lower profit forecast in its stride, however, sending the stock up 3 per cent by mid-morning in New York — cheered in part by Mr Laguarta’s commitment to hand $8bn to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks this year.The company also said it would extend a cost-saving programme through 2023, aiming to generate “productivity savings” of at least $1bn annually in a drive to become “leaner, more agile and less bureaucratic”. It did not quantify job losses.“Savings from our productivity programs will be substantially reinvested,” Mr Laguarta said. “Our overarching goal is to accelerate the rate of top line growth.”Pepsi said it expected organic revenue, a metric that excludes the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, to accelerate from 3.7 per cent in 2018 to 4 per cent this year.Net revenue in the three months ended December 29 was little changed from a year ago at $19.52bn. The company swung to a profit of $6.85bn, or $4.83 a share, compared with a loss of $710m, or 50 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.49 a share were in line with forecasts.
9;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-11-23T17:26:44Z;Pay of Bet365’s Denise Coates dwarfs that of other chiefs;A closer look at the remuneration of the gambling boss puts it off the scale;The old English adage that “you never see a poor bookmaker” was thrown into sharp relief this week with the publication of Bet365’s Denise Coates pay for last year.At £220m, it makes her far and away the most heavily paid chief executive in the UK and puts her in the rarefied company of private equity legends such as KKR’s Henry Kravis and Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman. Her remuneration is double that of Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai and Tesla’s Elon Musk, according to Bloomberg and Equilar data.It is unusual for the UK, where executive pay tends to be lower than in the US. Bet365, though, is private and does not have to answer to public shareholders.It also sets Ms Coates apart from other women executives, who seldom feature on the top of lists ranking the world’s best-paid business people. Indra Nooyi, former PepsiCo chief executive, was an exception.But that points to another distinction. Pepsi is much larger — Ms Nooyi’s pay accounted for only 0.04 per cent of group revenues. Ms Coates pay is the equivalent of 8 per cent of Bet365’s sales.
10;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Nooyi bows out at Pepsi with beverage growth;Chief executive’s final earnings show progress, though dollar strength limits benefits;Indra Nooyi presented PepsiCo’s first increase in beverage sales volumes in its home market for the first time in seven quarters on Tuesday, as she bowed out as chief executive of the US soda and snacks group after 12 years.Fizzy drinks have fallen out of favour during Ms Nooyi’s tenure, and she has pushed the company into other products such as juices, teas and sports drinks. In her final three months in charge, volumes from PepsiCo’s North America beverage division ticked up for the first time since the last quarter of 2016.The flagship Pepsi brand, along with other products including Mountain Dew and Gatorade, had enjoyed “nice growth” during the period, said Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer. Sales had benefited from a recent advertising push, he said. PepsiCo lifted its full-year organic revenue growth target to at least 3 per cent, having previously said that it would at least equal 2017’s pace of 2.3 per cent.However, a stronger US dollar prompted the group to cut its full-year core earnings per share target. An expected 1 percentage point full-year drag from dollar strength meant core earnings per share were now expected to be 5 cents a share lower than previously expected, at $5.65. Nevertheless, the full-year earnings per share target is still 8 per cent higher than last year.Tuesday’s figures showed net revenue growth slowed to 1.5 per cent year on year in the 12 weeks to September 8, as PepsiCo grappled with a 2 percentage point foreign exchange headwind. Shares in PepsiCo dipped 1 per cent in morning New York trading.As well as the eponymous drink, the $157bn-market-cap company is behind snack brands including Doritos, Walkers and Cheetos and the beverages Tropicana and 7UP.In August it announced a $3.2bn deal for SodaStream, which makes home sparkling-water dispensers.While sales from PepsiCo’s main North American beverages division have been under pressure, snacks have supported the group results. Frito-Lay North America increased operating profits 3.5 per cent in the 12-week period.Although revenues in the North American beverages unit increased 2 per cent year on year, operating profits for the unit fell 14 per cent amid higher costs — and despite a 4 percentage point gain from an asset sale.Overall, operating profit for the period fell 3 per cent although earnings per share were 18 per cent higher.Ms Nooyi is handing the chief executive role this week to Ramon Laguarta, a 22-year company veteran, although she remains chairman until early 2019.
11;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-08-20T17:26:39Z;PepsiCo/SodaStream: bubble economics;Consumer hardware will be a new area for a packaged food and drink company;America should be more like Sweden. That view is not just held by the democratic socialists now proliferating in US politics. PepsiCo appears to agree and is spending $3.2bn on SodaStream. About 16 per cent of Swedish households use SodaStream’s carbonation system, the highest penetration of any country according to the company. The US adoption rate is only around 1 per cent. PepsiCo hopes its distribution heft will help make carbonation equipment a standard household appliance in the US and around the world.Americans increasingly do not want to buy cans of sugary cola. For the first half of the year, operating profits for Pepsi’s large US division fell 16 per cent. Soda consumption has been falling for years but Pepsi has been hit even harder against a shrinking market. Its share of the industry has shrunk relative to that of Coca-ColaPepsi’s move on Monday is the latest sign that makers of sugary drinks are pivoting towards juices, waters, teas, coffee and anything nominally healthier than cola. The Israeli company is not coming cheaply. The ratio of transaction value to ebitda exceeds 20 times. Pepsi was rumoured to be interested in buying SodaStream back in 2013. The companies ultimately agreed to a partnership. SodaStream shares floundered between 2013 and 2016 falling from roughly $70 to just above $10 as the once high-flyer’s sales growth rate that had exceeded 30 per cent, fell sharply. A row over manufacturing on the West Bank did not help.Since 2016, SodaStream has, under activist investor pressure, refocused on profitability. Its operating margin has soared from mid-single digits to 15 per cent, even as revenue growth has kept up in the double digits. Before a blowout quarterly report from SodaStream on August 1, its shares were just below $90. Pepsi is now paying a price more than 60 per cent greater to get into a consumer hardware business.

12;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-08-20T06:03:36Z;PepsiCo strikes $3.2bn deal to buy SodaStream;Beverage and snacks group looks to continue health-conscious strategy for growth;PepsiCo has signalled it will continue its expansion into healthier food and drinks under its new chief executive, announcing a $3.2bn acquisition of SodaStream, maker of home sparkling-water dispensers. The acquisition of the Israeli company comes just weeks after Pepsi announced that Indra Nooyi, its longtime leader who pushed the cola and snacks group into natural and organic foods, would step down later this year.Incoming chief executive Ramon Laguarta made clear he viewed the deal as maintaining the direction of Ms Nooyi, who expanded its healthier Quaker Oats division even as it relied on Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lays for the bulk of its revenues.“SodaStream is highly complementary and incremental to our business, adding to our growing water portfolio, while catalysing our ability to offer personalised in-home beverage solutions around the world,” said Mr Laguarta. Nasdaq-listed SodaStream, which fashions itself as a health and wellness alternative to cola drinks, would complement Pepsi’s healthier options, which include the flavoured sparkling water brand Bubly and the fruit and vegetable snacks maker Bare Foods. Pepsi has agreed to pay $144 per share in cash, an 11 per cent premium to SodaStream’s Friday closing price of $129.85 after a sharp rally in the company’s shares since the start of this month.The recent gains had been attributed to better than expected results, given no news of deal talks had become public before Monday’s announcement. The offer, which needs to be approved by SodaStream shareholders, is also a 32 per cent premium to the company’s 30-day volume-weighted average price.Sodastream’s sales rebounded after it moved its main factory out of an illegal West Bank settlement in 2015, following a near two-year controversy that had dragged in its celebrity brand ambassador, the actor Scarlett Johansson.The factory’s location, in the settlement of Ma’ale Adumim, had made it the target of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement, which seeks to persuade consumers around the world to shun products made in Israeli settlements east of the 1967 ceasefire line.Global food and beverage companies are in the middle of a wave of acquisitions in an effort to reposition their portfolios as health-conscious consumers opt for fewer sugary snacks and drinks.Pepsi’s deal comes days after its main rival Coca-Cola agreed to buy a minority stake in BodyArmor, a sports drink maker backed by US basketball star Kobe Bryant. Coca-Cola has struggled over the years to loosen the hold of Pepsi’s sports drink business Gatorade. SodaStream will continue to be led by its current chief executive, Daniel Birnbaum, as Pepsi aims to expand the Israeli company by giving it access to its strong global distribution, research and development firepower and marketing expertise.“The intent is to maintain the business as a standalone unit, keep the growth, maintain the culture and not stifle the organisation with corporate types of restrictions,” Mr Birnbaum told the Financial Times.SodaStream has grown strongly in parts of Europe and Asia in recent years but lagged behind in the US, where its fizzy drink dispensers have less than 2 per cent market penetration.In the beverage market, Coca-Cola and Pepsi also face new competition from consumer group JAB Holding, a Luxembourg-based investment vehicle backed by the Reimann family. As part of an international buying spree JAB bought the Keurig Green Mountain coffee business, best known for its single-serve brewing machines, in December 2015 for $13.9bn. A main shareholder in Keurig at the time, Coca-Cola agreed to sell its entire stake. JAB subsequently discontinued Keurig’s cold brewing system that allowed consumers to make their own sodas from pods including those produced by Coca-Cola.In January 2018, JAB struck a $18.7bn deal to acquire Dr Pepper Snapple and combined it with Keurig to create a beverage group with almost $11bn in annual revenue.

13;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-08-07T17:58:39Z;Women CEOs and the hard path to the board;Efforts to promote female bosses should start with recruitment;"Indra Nooyi’s 12-year tenure as chief executive of PepsiCo highlights the strides women have made in getting to the top levels of business leadership. Yet, for all the achievements of Ms Nooyi, born in Chennai, India, in smashing America’s glass ceiling, the number of female CEOs of big US companies has fallen in the past year.Ms Nooyi’s departure from PepsiCo in October will reduce from 24 to 23 the women heading Fortune 500 companies, though Kathy Warden is due to become CEO of Northrop Grumman in January. Little over a year ago, the total was 32. A third of those have since resigned; several — including Campbell Soup’s Denise Morrison, Irene Rosenfeld at Mondelez and Hewlett-Packard’s Meg Whitman — have been succeeded, like Ms Nooyi, by men.Women are becoming more common and visible in chief executive roles. But surveys show corporate employees — especially men — tend to overestimate women’s representation in the top echelons. The danger is that women’s presence in C-suite jobs starts to stall at its current, highly inadequate, level.For now, the trend remains broadly in the right direction. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outsourcing company, found 18 per cent of all new US CEOs appointed last year were women — up from 15 per cent in 2015. In the legal industry, half of new CEOs were female. But among CEOs of London-listed FTSE 100 companies, a survey in March found there were more called David (9) than there were women (8).One issue is still the composition of boards, which tend to appoint C-suite members in their own image. Progress has been made, with women making up 21 per cent of S&P 500 board directors, according to Catalyst, a non-profit group. Perhaps thanks to the nine-year term limits on directorships in the UK — leading to greater rotation — and more active campaigns by government and business lobbies, the proportion is higher among FTSE 100 companies, at about 28 per cent.A bigger problem is the pipeline of women available for promotion. Ms Nooyi herself suggested in an interview this year that there were lots of women in entry-level corporate positions, but candidates for top jobs thinned out after women had to grapple with balancing children, marriage, and careers.A McKinsey study in 2017 found women and men in fact tend to leave organisations at about the same rate, with few women planning to leave the workforce to focus on family. But it found female employees were under-represented, and under-promoted, at every level in corporate America, including among entry-level hires — despite more women earning college degrees than men for the past 30 years.Senior women tend to be better represented, meanwhile, in positions such as legal, human resources and finance, than in operational management jobs that lead more often to CEO positions.The task of getting more women into leadership roles must therefore begin at recruitment — and before. Companies need to work harder to attract and hire talented female employees. Businesses, and governments, should do more to support workers with families by providing affordable childcare, crèches, and flexible, paid parental leave. Efforts should be accelerated to increase boardroom diversity.This is a moral issue. But it also makes good business and economic sense. Multiple studies have shown companies with more women in decision-making roles, and throughout the workforce, achieve better financial results and have fewer governance and reputational problems. Companies that fall short on gender equality may find investors start to penalise them."
14;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-08-06T20:42:41Z;Nooyi leaves Pepsi after trying to shape healthier future;Changing consumer tastes and Peltz interference were but two of the big challenges;By her own admission, Indra Nooyi’s 12-year reign at PepsiCo could have been far shorter.Her predecessor Steve Reinemund had led the world’s third biggest consumer goods company by revenues — after Nestlé and Procter & Gamble — through one of the most successful periods in its history, taking the group’s market value above that of arch-rival Coca-Cola for the first time.“Then everything changed. We faced new regulatory pressures . . . the North American market slowed down and we weren’t big enough internationally,” Ms Nooyi told the Harvard Business Review in 2015. “I had a choice. I could have gone pedal to the metal, stripped out costs, delivered strong profits for a few years and then said, ‘adiós!’ But that wouldn’t have yielded long-term success.”Instead, Ms Nooyi, who is stepping down at the age of 62, developed a strategy that largely built on her predecessor’s legacy through international expansion and a recognition that people wanted to eat less salt, fat and sugar in their diets — a challenge for the maker of Frito-Lays crisps and Pepsi-Cola carbonated drinks.Carbonated sugary soft drinks have been in decline in North America for the best part of two decades. Rather than try to buck this general trend, Ms Nooyi sought to change PepsiCo’s focus towards juices, teas and sports drinks.She also placed a large bet on developing a line of healthy foods through its Quaker Oats division — for which she was criticised when the company began struggling in 2011.That was the year when the company hit a low point after data from Beverage Digest, a closely watched industry publication, showed for the first time that sales of Diet Coke had overtaken those of Pepsi’s core brand in the US.It was also the year when activist Nelson Peltz took a $150m stake in PepsiCo and began his campaign to split the high-growth snacks business away from the underperforming beverages unit.After a high-profile campaign, during which Mr Peltz urged PepsiCo to buy Mondelez, the Oreo biscuit maker, and spinout beverages, Ms Nooyi finally prevailed with her “Power of One” strategy. The concession was to cede a seat on the board to an adviser of Mr Peltz’s Trian Fund Management.On Monday, Mr Peltz, who made a 50 per cent return on his investment when he sold two years ago, issued a friendly statement about his former sparring partner: “Trian has appreciated its constructive engagement with Indra Nooyi over the years and warmly congratulates her on a strong decade-plus of corporate leadership at PepsiCo. We wish her all the best.”Ali Dibadj, analyst at Bernstein, said: “Ms Nooyi succeeded in getting investors on board against a split of the company, especially after a strong cost-cutting programme and a period of reinvestment.“More recently the business is coming under pressure again and [her successor’s] priorities are likely to be fixing the North American beverage business, preserving the performance of snacks in an environment that is growing increasingly competitive and driving ongoing cost savings,” he added.Ramon Laguarta, who is to replace Ms Nooyi when she steps down in October, has worked at PepsiCo for the past 22 years and was widely seen as Ms Nooyi’s anointed successor when she appointed him president last year.In an interview on Monday, the incoming chief said he saw no let-up in the health-conscious trend. “We’re going to continue to see choices become more informed — the choices will go into products that are healthier.”Yet he also said consumer habits were “bifurcated”. “The same consumer can make super-healthy choices in some parts of the day for whatever reason, and then indulge in a treat for other reasons.”Mr Laguarta highlighted an increasing tendency for consumers to prefer unstructured “mini-meals”, consumed throughout the day, to traditional set-piece mealtimes. “It’s a big consumer trend that we can capture as a business,” he said.The dining habits of the Spaniard’s three millennial children, who live in London, brought home to him differences from previous generations.“The food industry used to be quite linear and, in a way, predictable. I think we’re in a very fun moment for our industry — where insights, technology, capabilities, matter a lot,” he added.Blair Effron, co-founder of investment bank Centerview Partners and an adviser to PepsiCo, said Mr Laguarta had a proven record in innovating and growing the business.“Ramon took a business in Europe, Middle East and Africa that was modest in scale — particularly in Africa — and grew it into a $10bn business. He absolutely understands that any consumer company has got to be attuned to trends around health and wellness as well as sustainability,” said Mr Effron.Mr Laguarta has set himself a challenge in aiming to grow sales at 5 per cent, up from low single digits currently. Unlike Ms Nooyi at the start of her tenure, Mr Laguarta will have to play catch-up with Coca-Cola. With a market capitalisation of $198bn, Coca-Cola is 20 per cent bigger than PepsiCo.Overall, since Ms Nooyi became chief executive, PepsiCo’s total shareholder return of 151 per cent is in line with rivals Hershey and Mondelez, but it has underperformed the S&P 500’s return of 170 per cent and also lagged behind Nestlé.Her departure deprives US business of one of its few prominent women leaders. Peter Land, a former head of corporate communications at PepsiCo, said she understood why she received attention for her gender “but also bristled against it. She wanted to be a role model for other female executives, but she was a visionary global CEO not just a visionary female CEO.”Ramon Laguarta, 54, has worked his way up the management ranks at PepsiCo over a 22-year career at the company.Barcelona-born Mr Laguarta joined the US beverage and snack maker in 1996 from Chupa Chups, the confectionery maker famous for its eponymous lollipops, which is now part of Amsterdam-based Perfetti Van Melle, writes Mark Odell.He was appointed president of PepsiCo in September last year overseeing global operations, corporate strategy and public policy and government affairs. Before that he had served for 10 years as head of the company’s Europe and sub-Saharan Africa unit, having served in various more junior roles across Europe early in his career.Mr Laguarta, who becomes the company’s sixth chief executive in its 53-year history, has an MBA from Barcelona’s Esade Business School and a masters in international management from the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Glendale, Arizona.In a YouTube statement at the Global Positive Forum on his first day as PepsiCo’s president last September, he listed corporate promises including a focus on “making healthier products” and “protecting our planet” as well as “empowering people”.Mr Laguarta, who is married with three children, will take over from Indra Nooyi on October 3.
15;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-08-06T20:33:25Z;Indra Nooyi to step down as PepsiCo chief after 12 years at helm;Ramon Laguarta, a 22-year company veteran, to take top job in October;Indra Nooyi is to step down from PepsiCo after a 12-year tenure, the latest in a series of management changes in a global food and drinks industry grappling with rapidly shifting consumer tastes.The 62-year-old, who is among a handful of non-white women at the top of world business, will step down as chief executive at the start of October and as chairman early next year — reducing the diversity of corporate America’s boardrooms.Ms Nooyi’s impending departure reopened questions on Monday about strategy at Pepsi, which saw off an activist campaign two years ago from the hedge fund manager Nelson Peltz. He called on the group to separate its beverage and snack divisions.The change could “open a wider door” to “potentially splitting up the company” in the longer run, said Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo. Pepsi shares closed up 0.9 per cent on Monday.However, Ms Nooyi’s replacement — Ramon Laguarta — is a 22-year company veteran and analysts played down the prospect of an immediate shake-up. The outgoing chief executive described her successor — Pepsi’s sixth chief executive in its 53-year history — as “exactly the right person” for the job.Mr Laguarta did not elaborate on Monday on the company’s strategic thinking, noting it was still “day zero” for him in the new job. “Indra and Hugh [Johnston, chief financial officer] have made very clear external statements that reflect our current position on this,” he said.“Obviously I’m part of the discussion . . . We continue to invest in the North American beverage business — it’s sequentially improving, and we’re very proud of that development.”Ms Nooyi has consistently ranked among the most powerful women in the world and enjoyed a rock star status in her home country of India. The nation’s burgeoning youth population looked up to her as an inspirational figure.“She was an absolute role model,” said Madhu Kannan, Uber’s chief business officer in India and former head of the Bombay Stock Exchange. “We looked up to her because she wore her Indianess with pride while running a global company. That was very inspirational.”Ms Nooyi said on Monday: “Growing up in India, I never imagined I’d have the opportunity to lead an extraordinary company like PepsiCo.”Her departure will reduce the number of S&P 500 companies with women chief executives to less than 5 per cent, according to not-for-profit group Catalyst.Having taken the helm in 2006, Ms Nooyi switched Pepsi’s focus from sugary sodas to healthier snacks and beverages. Forays into healthier options included its flavoured sparkling water Bubly, and the acquisition in May of fruit and vegetable crisps maker Bare Snacks.Ms Nooyi’s exit continues a recent trend of management turnover among major US food and beverage groups. Several companies including Coca-Cola, General Mills, Kellogg, Mondelez International, Hershey and Starbucks have all replaced their chief executives since the start of 2017. Campbell Soup, whose bet on fresh food failed to improve its fortunes, is still looking for a new chief.As is the case with Pepsi, the products around which these corporate giants were built are no longer the growth engines they once were.Earlier this year, Steve Cahillane, Kellogg’s chief executive, made the admission that the company best known for Corn Flakes and Froot Loops could not stake its future on its cereal products. Coca-Cola’s most recent results were buoyed by its suite of no-sugar drinks.Pepsi’s most recent results were slightly ahead of analysts’ forecasts, but revenues from its main North American beverages division had fallen. The unit makes up about a third of the company’s overall sales, but the main contributor to Pepsi’s operating profit is its snacks division, which makes Doritos and Lays chips.Ian Cook, presiding director at the company, praised Ms Nooyi’s leadership and pointed to an 80 per cent rise in revenue and a shareholder return of 162 per cent since December 31, 2006. The S&P 500 consumer staples sector has delivered a return of 188 per cent over that time, according to Bloomberg data.Pepsi shares were down 3.6 per cent so far this year, before Monday’s rise, slightly outperforming its sector.
16;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;PepsiCo/Indra Nooyi: cashing her chips;PepsiCo, difficulties of the sector aside, still trades at a premium;Indra Nooyi is the prototypical globetrotting, Davos-attending chief executive. Yet her job leading Pepsico, at its core, involves trumpeting the merits of, say, “Mozzarella ‘n’ Marina” flavored potato crisps. She did so with aplomb on a recent earnings call.On Monday Ms Nooyi announced she will step aside from Pepsi later this year after a dozen years as one of America’s most visible chief executives. When she took the helm, guiding big packaged food and drink companies was a mostly straightforward job of not messing things up. Today, the mandate has flipped. Millennials have different tastes and values (sugar out, artisanal in). The ruthless efficiency of private equity firm 3G Capital, the backer of Kraft Heinz, has put the focus on the unnecessary bloat of mega brands.Ms Nooyi did a decent job of guiding the transition. She is smart to depart now that every big consumer brand is under siege.Despite its name, Pepsi’s strongest unit is its snack group, Frito Lay North America. This generates a quarter of group revenue but more than 40 per cent of profit. The activist investor Nelson Peltz agitated for years, arguing that Pepsi should separate the soda and snacks divisions. The latter had far better global growth prospects, he said, and could merge with Mondelez which Kraft had spun off for similar reasons.Ms Nooyi fought off those efforts. She argued that a bigger Pepsi had more clout with retailers. She then slashed billions in costs to prop up operating margins and cashflow even as soda sales stagnated. Pepsi’s operating margin in 2017 of 16.5 per cent was still two percentage points lower than its level in 2006.In the past five years, Pepsi’s total return to shareholders has been 62 per cent compared to 69 per cent and 36 per cent for the S&P 500 and Coke, respectively. Pepsi, more remarkably, still trades at 20 times forward earnings, a premium valuation that belies the difficulties of its sector. This is the rare instance where maintaining the status quo counts as an achievement.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
17;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;PepsiCo shares bubble higher as Q2 revenue tops forecasts;;PepsiCo shares rose in premarket trading after the beverage and snack maker increased revenue faster than forecast in its second quarter and said it was sticking with its full-year financial targets.The company, which is still seeing shrinking revenue in its main North American beverages division as consumers turn away from sugary soda, saw overall sales growth propped up by its North America Frito-Lay snack division as well as by its business in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.PepsiCo — which makes products ranging from its eponymous cola, Mountain Dew and Gatorade drinks to Doritos corn chips and Quaker oats — reported a 2.4 per cent rise in net revenue for the three months ended June 16 from a year ago, to $16.09bn. That came in slightly ahead of the median forecast from analysts in a Thomson Reuters survey.Headline net income of $1.82bn, or $1.28 a diluted share, was down about 14 per cent from a year ago, but fell short of analysts’ forecasts. Adjusted for asset sales and expenses related to the Trump administration’s Tax Cut and Jobs Act, core earnings came in at $1.61 a share, which was 9 cents ahead of analysts’ estimates.The company saw operating profit fall 16 per cent from a year ago in its home market, North America, which it attributed to factors including increased transportation costs and higher commodity prices, as well as to an overall shrinkage in revenue. Higher sales and operating profit at its Frito-Lay division, which makes snacks, were offset by the fall in the company’s main drinks unit in the region.However, the 16 per cent fall was an improvement on the 23 per cent drop the group reported in the first three months of the fiscal year, as planned cost savings filtered through.PepsiCo’s North America beverages division makes up about one-third of — and is the biggest contributor to — the company’s overall sales. However, Frito-Lay North America generates nearly one quarter of the company’s operating profit. The beverages unit has been under pressure as diet-conscious millennials reduce their sugar intake, which has prompted PepsiCo to make forays into more health-focused options, such as its new flavoured sparkling water Bubly, or fruit and vegetable chip maker Bare Snacks.Operating profit also jumped by double-digits across the company’s Latin America and Asia, Middle East and north Africa geographies, but shrank by double digits in its Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa grouping, which was primarily due to the sale of the company’s minority stake in UK bottler Britvic.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chairman and chief executive, said she was “pleased” with the company’s results and added: “The majority of our businesses performed very well, particularly our international divisions propelled by continued growth in developing and emerging markets, and our North America Beverages sector posted sequential net revenue and operating profit performance improvement.”PepsiCo stuck with its full-year forecast for organic revenue growth of 2.3 per cent, in line with 2017, and core earnings of $5.70 a share, which is slightly ahead of what analysts are tipping.Shares were up 1.8 per cent in premarket trading on Tuesday.
18;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-05-25T17:07:58Z;PepsiCo gobbles up fruit and veggie chip maker Bare Snacks;;PepsiCo is stocking up on some healthier snacking options. The global food and beverage giant on Friday announced a deal to buy Bare Snacks, which specialises in baked fruit and vegetable chips, for an undisclosed sum.PepsiCo makes some of the best-known American snacking staples, including Pepsi sodas, Doritos and Tostitos tortilla chips, Fritos corn chips, Lay’s crisps and Cheetos cheesy puffs. The deal will add Bare’s line of baked fruit and vegetable chips, which are made from foods like apples, carrots and coconuts and baked instead of fried.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive and chairman, said in a statement:“For nearly a dozen years, PepsiCo has been committed to Performance with Purpose, our vision of making more nutritious products, while also reducing added sugars, salt, and saturated fat. Bare Snacks fits perfectly within that vision. The Bare Snacks leadership team has done an outstanding job building a top-tier organisation and a strong brand with authentic roots, and I couldn’t be more excited to welcome Bare Snacks to the PepsiCo family.”Bare was founded in California in 2001 by a family-owned organic apple farm, and expanded quickly from its roots selling apple chips in local farmers’ markets to become a national brand. It will continue to operate independently while reporting to PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay division.The deal is the latest move by a big food company to try to lure nutrition-conscious consumers with alternatives to fatty, salty and sugary choices, after losing market share to nimbler upstarts that cater to healthier tastes.Campbell Soup said last year it would buy organic soup maker Pacific Foods, and candy maker Hershey bought Amplify, which sells Skinny Pop popcorn.Photo credit: Getty Images
19;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-05-18T17:48:34Z;Campbell Soup woes knock wider packaged food stocks;;Campbell Soup is on track for its worst one-day drop in over 19 years on Friday following a profit warning and the abrupt departure of its chief executive.But the comments from the food and snack giant on higher transport and commodity costs are also weighing on the wider US packaged food and beverage sector.Here is a rundown of some of the moves in midday New York trade:Companies from tyre maker Goodyear to trash bag and bleach maker Clorox to airlines have all sounded the alarm bell on rising cost pressures this earnings season.But for big food companies, the squeeze is being felt on multiple fronts — with higher crude and metal prices driving up packaging costs while the rebound in agricultural prices is driving up input ingredient costs. Rising fuel prices and a tighter labour market are also running up the amount companies are having to shell over for transport and logistics.All this is coming at a time when many of the companies are struggling with declining sales of their mainstay brands. This in turn makes it harder for them to pass on the price increases to bargain savvy consumers, especially given the ever growing number of new entrants in the food and snacks market.Anthony DiSilvestro, Campbell’s chief financial officer said in a call with analysts, that he is expecting costs for everything from carrots to cardboard packaging to go up this year.“We’re seeing and expecting an acceleration on the rate of inflation across a number of ingredient and packaging items,” he said. “For example, we expect double digit increases on steel and aluminum. A lot of that driven or all of it’s driven by the impact of anticipated tariffs.”“We’re also expecting higher inflation on wheat and vegetables and resins and corrugated,” he added. “So this is a meaningful shift in the inflation outlook.”
20;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Pepsi quarterly sales rise 4%, beating Wall St estimates;;PepsiCo revealed better than forecast sales in the first three months of the year, as the company behind Mountain Dew soda and Frito-Lay crisps works to keep up with more health-focused consumers.The New York-based company said sales rose 4.3 per cent in the first quarter to $12.56bn, beating Wall Street expectations of $12.42bn.Investors have been focused on the health of PepsiCo’s core American soda business, which makes up a third of sales, and has been on the decline as consumers turn away from sugary soda.PepsiCo said it made $4.42bn from its North American beverages unit in the quarter. Analysts had predicted $4.3bn in sales from the unit, down from $4.46bn in the previous year.PepsiCo, like rival Coca-Cola, has been adding or adapting its products to offset stagnant soda sales. During the quarter, PepsiCo unveiled a new line of flavoured sparkling water, called “Bubly”, aimed at millennials who have gobbled up seltzers like La Croix.Core earnings for the quarter were 96 cents a share, compared to a consensus for 93 cents a share, from 94 cents a year ago.“We generated solid overall results in the first quarter,” said chief executive Indra Nooyi. “The majority of our businesses performed very well, including particularly strong performances in our international divisions propelled by accelerated net revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.”Shares in PepsiCo were little changed in US pre-market trade. They were down 15.7 per cent for the year as of Wednesday’s close.
21;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-04-24T16:05:48Z;Diet Coke revamp adds flavour to Coca-Cola results;’Twisted mango’ and ‘feisty cherry’ gave brand first N America sales growth in 8 years;Coca-Cola’s moves to make its drinks more appetising to millennials are paying off.The soda giant beat forecasts for profits and revenues in the first three months of the year, as a makeover of its Diet Coke brand helped drive sales even as US soda consumption stands at a 31-year low. Diet Coke returned to quarterly sales growth in North America for the first time in eight years, after redesigning its no-calorie cans with neon colours and unveiling flavours like “twisted mango” and “feisty cherry” — citing demand from millennials for “adventures and new experiences”.James Quincey, chief executive, said he was “encouraged by the initial consumer response” to the Diet Coke re-brand. The big soda companies have been grappling for years with shrinking demand for their historic core products as consumers look to wean themselves away from sugar. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which sell a combined $100bn a year in drinks and snacks, have tried to reduce their reliance on soda by launching or acquiring new products, particularly in faster-growing drinks categories such as water and tea. In recent years, Coca-Cola has bought or taken stakes in brands such as Honest Tea, the organic tea brand, Suja Life, a cold-pressed juice maker, and AdeS, a soya-based beverage brand.However on Tuesday Coke said that it was a strong showing in its trademark cola beverage that had powered overall volume growth of 3 per cent in the quarter, impressing analysts. Soda volumes grew 4 per cent while water and sports drinks climbed only 1 per cent. “The remarkable improvement in volume trends is good news,” said Pablo Zuanic, analyst at Susquehanna Financial.The stock may “tread water” due to weaker pricing, however, Mr Zuanic warned. Coca-Cola cut prices in North America, Asia and Europe during the quarter. Shares were down 2 per cent in late-morning trading in New York.Coke has been undergoing a broad restructuring as it moves away from bottling and distribution, which has affected its income statements in the past few years. The strategy is expected to drive higher operating margins as the company looks to become a more “asset-light” operation, but has hit sales in the short term.The Atlanta-based company said revenues declined 16 per cent year on year to $7.6bn as a result of the restructuring. This was better than analyst forecasts for $7.3bn.Stripping out structural changes, organic sales growth was 5 per cent in the quarter, ahead of forecasts of 4 per cent. Growth in North America, Coke’s home market, was 1 per cent.Adjusted earnings grew to 47 cents a share in the first three months of the year, from 43 cents a year ago, better than Wall Street expectations for 46 cents.
22;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-04-01T13:21:35Z;Sugar tax leaves bitter taste for drinks makers;Levy on producers designed to counter rising cost of obesity-related illnesses;A petition demanding that AG Barr keep its “hands off our Irn Bru” attracted about 52,000 signatures. But the Scottish company that makes what is in effect the national soft drink has pressed ahead with the plan to replace half the sugar in Irn-Bru with the artificial sweetener, aspartame.To an extent, it has had little choice. AG Barr has sought to escape the UK’s sugar tax, which comes into effect on April 6 and will be levied on manufacturers of soft drinks. Drinks that contain 5g of sugar per 100ml will pay 18p a litre, while the levy on drinks with more than 8g of sugar per 100ml is 24p a litre. The soft drinks levy is the latest in a number of health taxes around the world as governments grapple with the rising costs of obesity-related illnesses. For food and drinks producers, the shift in political mood has meant formulation changes and strategic shifts, as they worry about which sector is likely to be hit next and how hard.Such moves also have had an immediate impact on how investors view consumer groups. AG Barr’s share price fell 2.4 per cent when the British levy was announced in April 2016 by George Osborne, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, to tackle the UK’s rising rates of obesity in children.In response, the changes being made to its drinks will mean that almost all brands — which include Rubicon and Rockstar energy drink — will escape the tax. About 40 per cent of its portfolio of drinks would have been exempt from the tax but now 99 per cent of its drinks will escape it. But, as the company revealed last week in its annual results, the reformulation has also led to £1.4m in costs in 2017, booked as exceptional because they “have significantly exceeded the level of expenditure that would ordinarily be incurred in the course of new product development or reformulation”.Still, the move is not necessarily bad news for the group. As Laurence Whyatt, analyst at Société Générale, pointed out: “Sugar has partially been replaced by aspartame which is about 20 per cent the price of sugar. Sugar is the second-largest input cost in Irn-Bru (after packaging) and therefore we anticipate a gross profit improvement, although this will be slightly muted due to increased additional ingredients.”AG Barr took advantage of the two-year breathing space that Mr Osborne gave the industry to reformulate drinks. Others have done the same — Japan’s Lucozade Ribena Suntory more than halved the amount of sugar in its drinks in favour of artificial sweeteners.The result is that the UK government expects to raise £240m from the tax this year, which is less than half the £520m it had originally forecast. Duncan Brewer, partner at Oliver Wyman, the consultancy, said: “Overall, the sugar tax appears to be working, even though it hasn’t landed yet. The Treasury’s estimates of lower returns from the tax shows how effective it has already been.”Yet some manufacturers have not been prepared to go as far as AG Barr.Reformulation is a risky business — as Coca-Cola found out in the 1980s after a disastrous experiment with changing the recipe of its flagship brand. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Red Bull, the energy drink founded in Austria as a jet lag cure, have not tampered with their core brands.They are likely to end up paying the lion’s share of the tax, according to analysts, based on the share of volumes sold, with the biggest burden falling on Coca-Cola, which could find itself paying about 45 per cent of the tax.A can of full sugar Coke or Pepsi contains about 11g of sugar per 100ml — or 36g in a 330ml can — which is the equivalent of 9 teaspoons of sugar. This is more than the World Health Organisation’s ideal daily limit of 6 teaspoons.Coca-Cola European Partners, Coke’s UK bottler, would not comment on its tax liability but said: “Coca-Cola Classic is one of the few brands that will be subject to the new tax as we have decided not to change the recipe. Consumers tell us not to change it and we believe they should be able to choose a Coca-Cola Classic if that’s the drink they want.”Volume sales of full sugar Coca-Cola have fallen by double digits over the past five years, according to Euromonitor, reflecting consumers’ desire for healthier drinks, but it is still the UK’s best-selling carbonated soft drink.Tonic waters, including those of Fevertree and Schweppes — which is part of Coca-Cola — will also be caught by the tax. Coca-Cola appears to be aiming to recoup some of the costs of the sugar tax by shrinking sizes and raising prices — for example, last month it cut the size of a 1.75l bottle to 1.5l and raised the price by 20p. The government wants producers to pass on the cost of the tax to supermarkets, which in turn are expected to put up the price of sugary drinks, although they have discretion over how much to charge. The levy could add an extra 8p to a 330ml can of high-sugar cola and 48p to a 2-litre bottle, according to analysts.Drinks makers will be nervously watching sales after the price rises. Mr Brewer said: “Shoppers will ultimately end up paying the sugar tax at the checkout. Where prices do increase, sales of sugary fizzy drinks are likely to fall. However, we expect much of the lost volume to switch to low-sugar or sugar-free variants.”The trend for healthier drinks has been evident in sales of bottled water, which was the fastest-growing soft drink in both the US and western Europe over the past five years, according to SocGen and Euromonitor.The government could now set its sights on taxing sugar in other types of drinks — such as fruit juices and milk-based drinks, some of which contain large amounts of added sugar. Food is another potential target. Public Health England, the government health agency, last month recommended that the calorie content of processed foods be cut by 20 per cent by 2024, which many in the industry have accepted as a voluntary target.But Coca-Cola European Partners argued that such taxes did not achieve their main goal. “There is ample data which show that the sugar people consume from soft drinks has declined significantly over the past decade and continues to do so. As that has happened, obesity rates have continued to creep up.”

PepsiCo reaffirmed its commitment to using 100 per cent certified sustainable palm oil by 2020 and said it would publish its list of producers “in the coming days”. Ferrero said it would be producing a full list of the mills from which it sources palm oil in May.Hershey said it had mapped more than 99 per cent of its palm oil supply chain to the mills, and identified 14 per cent of the plantations where its palm oil comes from but would not publish the names due to confidentiality agreements.Other companies emphasised transparency over confidentiality.Marc Engel, chief supply chain officer at Unilever, which was the first consumer group to publish its producer list earlier this year, said: “Due to traditional commercial sensitivities and the complexity of the palm oil supply chain, it has required perseverance to get to where we are now.” He added that “complete transparency is needed for radical transformation”.Nestlé said its ambition remained that, by the end of 2020, all of the palm oil it used would be both traceable and responsibly sourced.Alastair Child, vice-president of global sustainability at Mars Wrigley Confectionery, said the company would use its influence to push for further changes while Jonathan Horrell, director of sustainability at Mondelez, acknowledged that the company’s work was not over and pledged to speed up progress on the ground. Reckitt Benckiser said more needed to be done with the entire industry.Kellogg’s said it had shared its list of suppliers with Greenpeace, but did not challenge the group’s report. Kraft Heinz, Johnson & Johnson, PZ Cussons and Smucker’s did not respond to requests for comment.
24;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-02-16T18:36:46Z;Food industry giants struggle to keep up with changing tastes;Sales woes at Kraft Heinz, Danone and others force groups to cut costs and eye deals;Makers of sugary drinks and processed foods are struggling to boost sales to increasingly health-conscious and penny-pinching consumers, forcing them to slash costs to beef up bottom lines and look for deals to stimulate growth.The challenges were laid bare on Friday as industry giants Kraft Heinz, Coca-Cola and Danone revealed fourth-quarter results that showed shoppers turning away from products that delighted earlier generations — from processed cheese slices to cola cans loaded with 39 grams of sugar — in favour of cheaper store brands or healthier offerings.“There is no question that our financial performance in 2017 did not reflect our potential,” Bernardo Hees, chief executive of Kraft Heinz, said as weak demand for meats and cheese sent US sales down 1.1 per cent, the seventh straight quarterly drop.The changes in tastes have forced the world’s biggest food and drinks companies to shift towards newer products favoured by younger consumers.Coca-Cola, which reported soft drink sales at a 31-year low, still was able to post a 6 per cent rise in organic sales — nearly double analyst forecasts — with help from vitamin water, tea products and other drinks it has added to its offerings, often through acquisitions.Mr Hees of Kraft Heinz hinted its major shareholder — 3G, the acquisitive private equity group — might return to dealmaking following a more than 20 per cent decline in the company’s share price, which hit a two-year low last week.“It’s fair to say that valuations today are more attractive today than they were even two months ago, and the chapter of Kraft Heinz integration is behind us,” he said. If there is more consolidation in the industry, he added: “We want to be a force of that.”Since the $100bn merger of Kraft Heinz, 3G has followed its playbook of cutting costs to drive up profits. Gross profit margins have soared to 37 per cent, from 27 per cent when the company was formed in 2015. The company on Thursday said it had met its target of reducing costs by $1.7bn by the end of last year. Net income rose to $8bn, or $6.52 a share, reflecting a benefit from the US tax overhaul.Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest fizzy drinks company, aims to save $3bn by next year as part of a cost-cutting plan. It reported adjusted earnings of 39 cents a share in the fourth quarter, just above the 38 cents analysts expected.Other food and beverage companies fared worse. Campbell Soup reported organic sales fell 2 per cent in the fourth quarter, weighed by weak demand for its trademark soups in North America. Nestlé, the world’s biggest food group, on Thursday revealed that last year’s sales grew at their slowest rate in more than two decades. On Friday Danone, the French yoghurt and water company, said like-for-like sales grew 2.5 per cent in 2017, the slowest pace in 20 years.* Analysts have suggested that consolidation is inevitable this year as the incumbents battle for sales. “Long-term headwinds reinforce the need to diversify outside of US food and we continue to see upside from potential large-scale M&A,” said analysts at RBC, raising a tie-up between Kraft Heinz and Mondelez as a potential option.Mark Schneider, chief executive of Nestlé, warned that the move away from packaged food superbrands is here to stay. “There was a pattern we saw through the whole of 2017 with the entire food and beverage sector,” he said. “The entire industry . . . has been a little slow to recognise it, but we have it firmly in our sights now.”*This story has been updated with 2017 figures
25;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-02-13T17:43:26Z;Pepsi says advertising blitz will take time to pay off;North American drinks sales declined 3% in the fourth quarter;"PepsiCo’s core American soda business continued to shrink at the end of last year, prompting the company to warn that a new marketing blitz for its fizzy drinks brands will take time to pay off. The North American drinks business, which accounts for a third of the snacks-and-drinks group’s revenues, fell 3 per cent in the fourth quarter, the only division to go backwards.Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, said PepsiCo has begun redirecting advertising dollars back to core brands after having cut spending and reduced shelf space to focus on healthier products in previous years.“In 2018 we have increased advertising behind the big brands, and we expect that to have a positive impact,” he said in an interview. “But like most advertising campaigns, that will take several quarters, to fully realise the impact”.In last year’s Super Bowl television broadcast, the company only ran an advert for Lifewtr, its bottled water brand. This month, the company returned to advertising’s biggest night with a 30-second advert for its trademark Pepsi cola, which was estimated to cost $5m, and a 60-second advert for Doritos and Mountain Dew.“While [PepsiCo's] formidable snacks business continues to impress, its North America beverage business has struggled, with greater investment . . . likely required to right the ship,"" said Kevin Grundy, analyst at Jefferies.The stakes in the US soda wars are rising. Last month JAB, the investment vehicle backed by Germany’s Reimann family, bought Dr Pepper Snapple for $19bn, with plans to combine it with the group’s coffee interests to create a giant distribution network. About 80 per cent of Dr Pepper’s products are currently distributed through networks controlled by PepsiCo or Coca-Cola, Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive pointed out on Tuesday.On a conference call with analysts, Ms Nooyi said she does not see the logic behind the deal. “I’m sure there is strategic logic, but we’re still searching for it,” she said.Ms Nooyi said that the decline in PepsiCo’s North America beverage unit came “in the midst of a dynamic retail environment and rapidly shifting consumer landscape”. As more US consumers turn away from sugar, the company and its peers have been offsetting waning demand for soda with products like tea, water and snacks. The company this month unveiled Bubly, a flavoured sparkling water drink, which analysts estimate could become a $220m brand by next year. PepsiCo, which spent $2.5bn on advertising in 2016, also plans to run splashy adverts for Bubly at next month’s Academy Awards. Ali Dibadj, analyst at Bernstein, commended the company’s plans to support the North America beverages business with more product innovation and advertising, but added: “We’ll see whether that works.” Overall, PepsiCo’s net revenue was flat in the fourth quarter at $19.53bn, topping street forecasts for $19.39bn. It was boosted by another strong quarter for its Frito-Lay snacks business, which reported organic sales up 5 per cent.The company as a whole swung to a loss for the three months to end December because of an estimated $2.5bn tax hit — equivalent to $1.73 per share — as a result of the US tax reform passed shortly before Christmas. On a reported basis PepsiCo posted a quarterly loss of $0.50 per share, but its core earnings at $1.31 a share were a touch ahead of the $1.30 analysts expected."
26;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Strong snack sales put fizz in PepsiCo results;;PepsiCo delivered better than expected fourth quarter sales thanks to stronger snack sales, as the company battles with competitors to meet the demands of a healthier consumer.But the company behind Mountain Dew and Frito-Lay chips swung to a loss for the three months to end December because of an estimated $2.5bn tax hit — equivalent to $1.73 per share — as a result of the US tax reform passed shortly before Christmas. Net revenue was flat at $19.53bn, compared to street forecasts for $19.39bn. On a reported basis PepsiCo posted a quarterly loss of $0.50 per share, but its core earnings at $1.31 a share were a touch ahead of the $1.30 analysts expected, and higher than the $1.20 the company posted in the same period a year ago. Chief executive Indra Nooyi was upbeat about the broader impact of US tax reform despite the effect on fourth quarter results, though, suggesting that lower income taxes could mean more disposable income to spend on PepsiCo products. “The provisions of recently enacted tax legislation are expected to result in lower income taxes in 2018 for our operations in the United States, our largest market”, she said. Benefits from the reform would also allow PepsiCo to invest in the business and “enhance cash returns to our shareholders over time”, Ms Nooyi added.Sales at PepsiCo’s all-important North America beverage unit, which makes up about a third of the company’s revenues, slipped 6 per cent on a reported basis, although on a like-for-like basis the drop was only 3 per cent. PepsiCo has continued its quest to offset stagnant soda sales by building new products in faster-growing categories, like water and tea. The company this month unveiled bubly, a flavoured sparkling water drink, which analysts estimate could become a $220m brand by next year. In the latest quarter more expensive raw materials and hurricane-related costs nixed improvements from productivity and savings on marketing and advertising spending, however, to send operating profit in the North America beverage division down 23 per cent on the company’s core measure and 29 per cent on a reported basis.Meanwhile the stakes in the US soda wars are continuing to rise. Last month JAB, the investment vehicle backed by Germany’s Reimann family, bought Dr Pepper Snapple for $19bn, with plans to combine it with the group’s coffee interests to create a giant distribution network. The better than expected quarterly revenues were instead driven by growth in the Frito-Lay North America snacks division and its overseas divisions. Shares in PepsiCo, which are down 7 per cent this year as part of the broader market sell-off, were broadly flat in premarket trading.
27;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2018-02-11T10:24:08Z;Dr Pepper Snapple deal puts focus on distribution networks;JAB’s $19bn purchase of US carbonated drinks maker could help it sell other beverages;"The soda business has seen better days. Americans have been guzzling fewer fizzy drinks for more than a decade — sales hit a 31-year low in 2017 — as a younger generation of consumers rejects the 39 grams of sugar in a can of cola. So market participants are struggling to explain why JAB, the savvy investment company of Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, has agreed to pay $19bn for Dr Pepper Snapple, one of the biggest carbonated drinks makers in the US.It was the largest soft drinks deal on record, according to Dealogic, and a big bet on creating a third contender in what has been a two-horse race between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in the $230bn US beverage market. “I certainly think [Coca-Cola and Pepsi] are scratching their heads and trying to figure out what JAB is going to do next, because JAB is known to be smart and inventive,” says Caroline Levy, analyst at Macquarie Capital. While Coca-Cola and PepsiCo remain far larger than the newly formed Keurig Dr Pepper, the acquisition presents a “forceful entry” to their turf, she adds.One explanation for JAB’s investment is distribution. According to the chief executive of one large consumer goods group, access to the US beverage market has been historically dominated by the soda powers’ distribution networks: “The red [Coke], blue [Pepsi], and the white [Dr Pepper Snapple] network.” By buying Dr Pepper, JAB is acquiring a bottling and sales network that could be used to distribute various kinds of beverages. “If you want to reach beverage distribution in the US in a major way, that's the real value of this company,” says the executive. “They can add more to that network.”Ms Levy is more sceptical. “They are buying a distribution system, but what are they going to add to it that wasn’t there before?”, she asks. “It’s hard to figure out where the scale addition is.” PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, which sell a combined $100bn a year in drinks and snacks, have tried to offset waning soda demand by launching new products, particularly in faster-growing drinks such as water and tea. Investors will look to the latest update on their quest this week, as PepsiCo and Coca-Cola report their earnings for the final three months of 2017. “There’s not much that you can do beyond the current strategy, which is to build or acquire new brands, while cutting costs by franchising bottling operations,” says Ali Dibadj, analyst at Bernstein. PepsiCo last week unveiled its latest solution: “Bubly”, a flavoured sparkling water packaged in bright neon cans and emblazoned with greetings such as “hey u”. The company plans to promote the new product with splashy adverts at next month’s Academy Awards.Coca-Cola last month rolled out its take on what millennials might want to buy: diet cola in similarly vibrant cans infused with “feisty cherry” and “twisted mango” flavours.JAB’s transaction will merge Dr Pepper’s brands, such as Sunkist orange soda, with that of Snapple’s juices and Keurig’s coffee pods. Dr Pepper Snapple has been a distant third in the US soft drinks market, commanding 8.5 per cent of sales, compared with Coke’s 22 per cent and Pepsi’s 19 per cent, according to Euromonitor. Analysts suspect JAB will use its dealmaking skills to acquire smaller, fast-growing brands. Dr Pepper in 2016 bought Bai brands, which makes antioxidant drinks, for $1.7bn. Coca-Cola over the years has bought or taken stakes in brands such as Honest Tea, the organic tea brand; Suja Life, a cold-pressed juice maker; AdeS, a soy beverage brand; and Topo Chico, a Mexican sparkling water brand. “The competition for small brands just went up,” says Mr Dibadj. “People believe Bodyarmor [the sports drink] may be for sale. That probably would have gone to Coke or Pepsi, but now JAB is probably going to buy it.”Rumours about future acquisition targets have centred on the new en-vogue drink: water. Bottled water dethroned soft drinks as the most popular beverage in the US in 2016. More recently, sparkling water has been a hot ticket item in the US, helped by the rising popularity of LaCroix. Some analysts speculate that either Coke or Pepsi could buy LaCroix, or Monster, the energy drink maker."

Pepsico owns and operates about 50,000 commercial fleet vehicles, about 10,000 of which are so-called class 7 or 8 heavy duty trucks.“We believe achieving a more fuel-efficient and sustainable fleet is a continuous process, one that requires forward-thinking and a willingness to adapt to a changing technological landscape,” said Mike O’Connell, senior director, PepsiCo supply chain. “The Tesla semi truck represents a unique opportunity for us to explore electrification across our class 7 and 8 fleet, which is exciting.”Pepsico follows retailer Walmart and truck operator JB Hunt Transport services in signalling a vote of confidence in Elon Musk’s attempt in disrupting the trucking industry.Mr Musk first unveiled the truck last month, and it is expected to have a range of 800km when it goes into production in 2019. One of Europe’s leading energy consultancies has estimated that Tesla’s electric haulage truck will require as much power to recharge as up to 4,000 homes.
29;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

Pre-tax profits fell almost 9 per cent from the last financial year, to £139m from £152m.Chief executive Simon Litherland said Britvic, which makes drinks including Robinsons squash, and PepsiCo beverages in the UK and Ireland had “grown both organic revenue and margins”, and made progress on its broader strategy. After-tax profits were dented — down 2.5 per cent –by around £25m of “planned costs” related to the group’s strategic overhaul and investment in UK manufacturing facilities, the company added.But Britvic said it recognised the significance of the coming soft drinks industry levy, due to be introduced in the UK next year, which it said would create a “high level of uncertainty” in the short term.It added:However, we have prepared well and, with our great portfolio of brands and our strong marketing and innovation plans, we believe we are well placed to navigate it. This, combined with our continued focus on revenue and cost management, including the benefits of the business capability programme, mean, we feel confident of delivering further progress next year.(This article has been amended to clarify one-off costs affected profits at Britvic.)(Photo: Bloomberg)

Salle Yoo, who had been Uber’s legal chief since 2012, announced her departure in September. Mr West, a San Francisco Bay Area native and graduate of Harvard and Stanford Law School, has previously worked as special assistant at the California attorney-general’s office during its antitrust case against Microsoft and at corporate law firm Morrison & Foerster.While at Morrison & Foerster he helped with Barack Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008. That led to a position in the justice department when Mr Obama won, eventually rising to become associate attorney-general, the third most senior position in the department. In 2014, Mr West joined PepsiCo, where as well as handling the legal responsibilities of a large publicly traded multinational, he focused on compliance and diversity — two areas where Uber has historically struggled. “Pepsi has been named one of the world’s most ethical companies 10 years in a row,” Mr Khosrowshahi wrote in an email to employees. “Under Tony’s leadership, I’m confident that we will one day join this list.”Mr West arrives at Uber next month as it is defending itself against charges of stealing trade secrets from Alphabet’s autonomous cars division Waymo, and battling to save its service in London after its licence to operate was not renewed in September. Pepsi has been named one of the world’s most ethical companies . . . I’m confident that we will one day join this listFederal investigators are also probing Uber over several issues, including its “Greyball” tool for evading regulatory officials, its “Hell” campaign against rival Lyft, and Uber employees’ handling of an Indian rape victim’s case, as well as issues related to the Waymo litigation. Uber is locked in negotiations with SoftBank over a potential $10bn investment which, if finalised, would start the clock counting down towards an initial public offering by the end of 2019. Mr Khosrowshahi has said he hopes to take Uber public in the next 18 to 36 months. Before that, he will need to hire a new chief financial officer, as well as potentially filling the vacant positions of chief marketing officer and chief operating officer. “Tony is exactly what Uber needs now,” Mr Khosrowshahi wrote in the email. “He has public company experience leading a global team of lawyers across more than 200 countries. As a former federal prosecutor and senior Department of Justice official in the Obama administration, he’s well equipped to handle the investigations into our past practices.”

Ms Nooyi said: “This summer, we directed too much of our media spending and shelf space to low-calorie, much smaller brands at the expense of our Pepsi and Mountain Dew trademarks.”After five years of directing money away from its biggest-selling, full-sugar brands towards low-calorie products, “we overdid it a little”, conceded Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer. He added that the company had reallocated advertising budget to drinks such as Lemon Lemon, a sparkling lemonade. “We got a bit ahead of our skis and a little ahead of consumers, in terms of shifting media spending and shelf space . . . particularly in convenience stores, but also in supermarkets,” he said. “By overdoing it, we squeezed Pepsi and Mountain Dew a little too tightly.” Consumption of fizzy drinks has been slowing for more than a decade, as people seek healthier options and governments across the globe crack down on sugar content. The world’s largest consumer goods companies, including PepsiCo and rival Coca-Cola, have been investing in new healthier products to adapt to changing tastes. Ms Nooyi also told investors on a conference call that a cooler summer and less foot traffic to convenience stores hit sales of Gatorade, which makes up about a fifth of the company’s beverage sales in North America. She said PepsiCo was making “corrections” to shift some focus back to Pepsi and Mountain Dew. The company started to break out North American sales in the third quarter of 2015.Overall sales ticked up 1.3 per cent to $16.24bn in the quarter, missing consensus forecasts of $16.35bn. Net income, however, topped analyst expectations, rising 8 per cent to $2.14bn, or $1.49 a share, compared with the consensus $1.43 a share. PepsiCo said it makes nearly half of total revenues from “guilt-free” products, such as diet sodas.

Mr Pichette, who left Google in 2015, replaces outgoing director Hugh Johnston, chief finance officer of Pepsi. In a tech-director game of musical chairs, Mr Johnston is now joining Microsoft’s board.“Thrilled to join the Board of Microsoft … a company I have long admired,” Mr Johnston said in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon. “Twitter has a clear mission and strong leadership team and, as I leave the Board, I wish the company continued success.”Those were only the PepsiCo CFO’s 52nd and 53rd tweets, but that is still 51 more than Mr Pichette, who made his first public postings to Twitter on Tuesday.His first tweet read: “Absolutely thrilled to join the @Twitter board! A company that has such influence and impact on the world.”His second showed a picture of him mountain-biking in Colorado, part of a two-year sabbatical since leaving Google.Mr Pichette, who was replaced at what is now Alphabet by former Morgan Stanley CFO Ruth Porat, bade farewell to the search company in 2015 with a now-famous post to his Google+ page , which FT columnist Lucy Kellaway called an “instant classic” of the resignation-letter genre.The French-Canadian executive said then that his decision to leave Google came after climbing Kilimanjaro with his wife.“I could not find a good argument to tell Tamar [his wife] we should wait any longer for us to grab our backpacks and hit the road – celebrate our last 25 years together by turning the page and enjoy a perfectly fine mid life crisis full of bliss and beauty, and leave the door open to serendipity for our next leadership opportunities, once our long list of travels and adventures is exhausted,” he wrote.
36;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-09-06T04:32:58Z;Britain’s Brexit brand is weak and confused;Hectoring doubters is like blaming customers for not buying your fancy product;"If you leave the world’s largest free trade area because you believe in free trade, you are bound to confuse people. Brexit faces grave difficulties of substance, but it also has a brand problem.This struck me last weekend at the Villa d’Este, a 16th-century luxury hotel by the shore of Lake Como. It is the setting for the Ambrosetti Forum, Italy’s closest equivalent to Davos. Italian and European policymakers, with a sprinkling of technocrats and politicians from the US and Asia, gather there to reflect on the state of the world and discuss ways to improve it.Brexit is a tough sell to such people, who mostly believe in the economic and political cause of the EU, but the difficulty runs deeper. They struggle even to grasp what Eurosceptics such as David Davis, Brexit secretary, want. Michel Barnier, his EU counterpart, remarked that British people had yet to be “educated” in what Brexit involves; the same might be said of everyone else.It was epitomised by a quiz asking the participants what most worried them in the next year. Alongside the possibility of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, the options included “nationalism and protectionism eg Trump, Brexit”. Niall Ferguson, the Remainer turned Brexiter author and academic, protested that protectionism was “the last thing” Brexit was about, but few present seemed convinced by his words.Donald Trump is a master of simplicity and it is easy to understand what the US president thinks. The same goes for Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Freedom party, who told the forum that EU federalism was “my nightmare” and lambasted its “enmity towards patriotism”. Brexit is an enigma: what does it mean, if not turning inward?The prevailing mood was captured by Mario Monti, former prime minister of Italy, who noted that Europeans had grown up admiring the Anglo-Saxon world’s “pragmatism, rationality and its sophisticated connection of research to policy” and had “become adult” by learning from it. Now the US and UK seemed to be regressing, EU countries felt “more lonely in the world”.Express such sentiments in the UK these days and ardent Brexiters tend to accuse you of being an arrogant “Remoaner”, instructing you to be patriotic and to get behind Brexit. The trouble is, nobody is forced to obey. Adopting a similar hectoring attitude to the rest of the world is like blaming customers for not understanding, liking or buying your fancy product.This is more than a matter of national pride: having a strategy that others understand would make it easier to strike trade deals and co-operative arrangements on defence and security. At the moment Brexit appeals viscerally to 52 per cent in a domestic market of 66m, but does not export well.The value of an appealing brand was proved in an academic experiment in which a group of 67 people was asked to rate Coca-Cola against Pepsi both in blind tests and when their cups were labelled. They also submitted to blind and identified taste tests while having their brains scanned.The study found that knowing the brand “had a dramatic effect on expressed behavioural preferences and on measured brain responses”. In short, telling people they were drinking Coke not only increased their enjoyment but activated parts of their brains that influence behaviour based on mood.Coke has had since 1886 to develop its identity, and to associate the formula with a jolly Santa Claus dressed in red, while Brexit is an untested concept. The EU has a comparative advantage: whatever the financial crisis revealed about the structural flaws in the eurozone, it is associated with rising wealth and continental peace since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957.Theresa May, UK prime minister, has relied on the tagline “Brexit means Brexit”, but its dogged opacity would not win any advertising awards. One difficulty is the ambiguity of the idea itself, as shown during the Brexit referendum. The official Vote Leave campaign was dominated by Tory free marketers and classical liberals, while the rival Leave.EU group emphasised curbs on immigration.Since then, the brute clarity of the latter has overpowered the idealistic fervour of the former. Mrs May tried to portray Britain as “a great global nation that is respected around the world” in her Lancaster House speech in January. Mr Davis insisted this month that it was “liberal and international in both temperament and outlook”. The brand, though, is weak and confused.Were I a consultant, I would recommend pausing a while and hoping that talks with the EU lead to a transition deal, while showing that the UK remains open to migration. Then it could be time to relaunch Brexit Britain as an entrepreneurial, innovative country that prefers risk-taking (and goodness knows, Brexit is a risk) to the EU’s steady incumbent corporatism.It might evoke grudging respect, in contrast to the baffled offence that Brexit now causes. Or the UK could abandon the whole idea as a marketing disaster, akin to the launch of New Coke in 1985, and return to EU Classic. Coca-Cola went back to its original cola formula two months later with the slogan: “Red, White and You”. Red, White and EU would have a ring to it.john.gapper@ft.comBrexiters’ need for a sparkling brand / From Nicholas Faith, London, UK"
37;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-08-23T04:41:11Z;Panera spells out sugary drink details to customers;Sandwich chain uses cola cups listing teaspoons of sugar in move away from sodas;Panera is unveiling cups that list how many teaspoons of sugar have been added to drinks, as the sandwich company battles for the lunch money of more health-conscious American consumers.The new cups, which post sugar and calorie counts in large letters, reveal to customers that a 20oz serving of Pepsi, the cola Panera sells, has 17 teaspoons of sugar. This is more than double the sugar in Panera’s chocolate chip cookie, and also exceeds the daily limit of 12.5 teaspoons that the US government recommends.The move comes amid growing pressure from regulators and consumers for a reduction in sugar and salt, which are linked to obesity and diabetes.Panera has been a bright spot in an increasingly tough environment for eating out in the US. While traditional fast food stalwarts such as McDonald’s have grappled with a global shift in demand towards fresh food, Panera has benefited, with comparable sales growing between 4 and 5 per cent.This year JAB, the investment group backed by Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, bought Panera for $7.5bn, a marker of how investors value so-called “fast casual” restaurants. Panera’s move comes ahead of new government requirements for all packaged food and drinks to label added sugars, with a compliance date of 2018 recently pushed back. However, the sugar requirements did not apply to restaurants. “It’s up to companies to take the lead on transparency, not wait for legislation,” said Ron Shaich, Panera chief executive.It’s up to companies to take the lead on transparency, not wait for legislationAnother piece of Obamacare legislation requiring restaurant chains with at least 20 stores to post calorie counts on menus has also been delayed. Panera and some other restaurants already list nutrition information on food menus, but drinks increasingly have been a target in the battle against obesity. The company aims to shift more customers away from sodas, and the decision to post sugar in teaspoons instead of grams was deliberate, said Mr Shaich: “the only people who know what grams are are drug dealers”. Panera in March unveiled a new line of drinks with less or no sugar added, and says that since then 8 per cent of customers have opted for these drinks over soda.US soda sales have been falling for more than a decade as sweet drinks have come under fire from regulators and health officials for contributing to obesity. This week Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and other soft-drink makers agreed to limit the amount of sugar they use in beverages sold in Singapore. In the US, local governments in cities such as Seattle and Chicago have raised the idea of so-called soda taxes. Panera aims to roll out the cups across its 2,100 restaurants by next month. This year the Missouri-based company said it had stripped artificial ingredients from its food as part of a campaign to position itself as the healthier alternative to the likes of McDonald’s. McDonald’s has taken steps to stay relevant amid disruption by Panera and Chipotle. The world’s largest burger chain has removed artificial ingredients from chicken nuggets and said it would use fresh beef in quarter pounders. Shares in Panera have risen 46 per cent in the past year, while rival Chipotle’s stock has dropped 21 per cent.
38;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-08-22T17:14:00Z;Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nestlé to limit sugar in Singapore drinks;Seven drinks manufacturers agree to 12% cap by 2020 in fight against diabetes;Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nestlé are among seven soft-drink makers that have agreed to limit the amount of sugar they use in beverages sold in Singapore, marking the latest campaign from a health regulator to fight diabetes by targeting sweet drinks.The seven companies, which include four large, regional groups, would cap the sugar content of their sweetened drinks at 12 per cent by 2020, Singapore’s ministry of health said on Tuesday.The pledge appears to be the first of its kind in Asia in which a national health regulator has received such a commitment from the largest drink producers in the market.“We are heartened to receive the strong support from industry players on sugar reduction efforts,” the ministry said.Singapore-based Yeo Hiap Seng and F&N Foods, as well as Malaysia Dairy Industries and Japan’s Pokka have also agreed to the sugar limit.The companies make up 70 per cent of pre-packaged sweetened drinks in the country of about 5.6m people and could reduce Singapore’s sugar consumption by 300,000kg a year, according to the ministry.In Asia, rising wealth has been accompanied with dramatic changes in diet, including increased sugar intake. As a result, diabetes has rapidly become a serious concern for health authorities in many countries across Asia.The Philippines has introduced a bill that aims to increase a tax on sweetened drinks, and the south-east Asian state of Brunei this year implemented a tax on sugary beverages.The agreement to limit sugar content in drinks sold in Singapore follows efforts by western governments to combat obesity by urging consumers to lower their sugar and salt consumption. The US government last year mandated that companies label how much added sugars are in packaged foods.As part of a global shift towards healthier drinks, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have rolled out smaller bottles of their namesake sodas and introduced new drinks, such as kombucha fermented teas. “Guilt-free” snacks and drinks, such as diet sodas and baked crisps, now make up about 45 per cent of PepsiCo sales, according to the group.The Singapore decision comes as PepsiCo has been “transforming our portfolio to meet changing consumer needs”, the company said.PepsiCo added that about 80 per cent of its drinks sold in Singapore already contained 12 per cent or less of added sugars. The company last year committed to cutting sugars globally so that two-thirds of its drinks would have less than 100 calories per 12 ounce serving by 2025.The essential briefing for decision makers on global healthJames Quincey, chief executive of Coca-Cola, has pledged to cut sugar in more than 500 of its drinks globally this year. The company says that 30 per cent of its 3,900 beverages contain either low or no sugar, and that 97 per cent of its drinks sold in Singapore, including the eponymous soda, already meet Singapore’s requirements.In Singapore, more than 400,000 people suffer from diabetes and one in three citizens is at risk of getting the disease, according to the ministry of health.China in recent years has seen a rapid increase in obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes. The World Health Organisation says that about 10 per cent of Chinese adults live with diabetes and about half of adults are considered pre-diabetic.
39;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-08-17T22:32:43Z;How business leaders lost faith in Trump;Advisory group members had hoped to tame president but decided they had to draw a line;The US business leaders who served on the two now-defunct advisory groups to President Donald Trump have suffered a hail of opprobrium for their involvement. But some of them continue to believe that their efforts were worthwhile.They knew when the administration convened the two groups - the strategy and policy forum and the manufacturing and jobs initiative - that joining would expose them to reputational risk, but they believed that working with Mr Trump would also give them an opportunity to shape the administration’s position.The president’s remarks on Tuesday, including the comments that there were “very fine people” alongside the neo-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville at the weekend, convinced almost all the business leaders that they had to end the association with him.Within 24 hours, the two groups were disbanded, and a third chief executives’ council to advise on infrastructure, which was still being formed, was also called off on Thursday.Yet several executives argue that their engagement brought significant benefits, in particular over the issue of labelling China a currency manipulator.In an interview with the Financial Times on April 2, Mr Trump was still sticking to his argument from the campaign trail that “they [China] are world champions” at currency manipulation.But at a meeting of the strategy forum on April 11, a succession of executives argued that the accusation was misguided and counter-productive.“As it went round the table, just about everyone there said it would be a really bad idea,” remembers one former member.When he spoke to the Wall Street Journal the following day, Mr Trump had shifted his line completely: he said he would not label China a currency manipulator, and since then the issue has been allowed to fade.Mark Weinberger, chief executive of EY who was a member of the strategy forum, wrote in a note to staff yesterday that it had “had a positive impact on issues such as trade, economic growth and paid leave for families”.The business leaders were not always successful in their attempts to persuade Mr Trump. Many of them urged him to keep the US in the Paris climate agreement, but he rejected their advice.Elon Musk of Tesla quit both advisory groups over that decision in June, and many other members were unhappy about it. But Stephen Schwarzman, the Blackstone chief executive who chaired the strategy forum, argued that the group should stay together to continue make the case for business.When they heard Mr Trump’s remarks in the marble-clad lobby of Trump Tower on Tuesday afternoon, however, many of the business leaders decided it was time to draw a line.They had been reassured by Mr Trump’s prepared statement in the White House on Monday, when he had unequivocally condemned “the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans”.But on Tuesday, Mr Trump observed that “you also had people that were very fine people on both sides” of the protests, including those “innocently” demonstrating against the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee.“He was like an actor stepping on his own lines,” says one former member of the strategy forum, of Mr Trump’s Tuesday press conference. “It’s meant to be about infrastructure, and then all that goes out the window.”Members of the forum talked about what they should do throughout the afternoon, and on a call at about 9pm that evening, some chief executives, including Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, Ginni Rometty of IBM, and Rich Lesser of the Boston Consulting Group, concluded that the full membership should make a decision the following day.Mr Schwarzman had been reticent about his own position, but overnight he convened a call for the entire forum at 11.30 on Wednesday morning. He also wrote a statement explaining that the group had decided to disband, which he read out on the call for the other members to approve.When it came to a vote, all but two of the members agreed with the plan to dissolve the forum, according to people who were on the call. Some members had said they would quit if the others tried to continue.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, later sent a note to employees explaining why he supported the decision.“I strongly disagree with President Trump’s reaction to the events that took place in Charlottesville,” he wrote. “There is no room for equivocation here.”Mr Schwarzman rang the White House to tell the president the group was disbanding, and shortly afterwards Mr Trump tweeted: “Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both.”The strategy forum issued a statement saying, as a courtesy to Mr Trump, that “the president and we are disbanding the forum”. In reality, the decision was taken by its members alone.The manufacturing council, meanwhile, had already been falling apart, with eight members announcing they were stepping down by the time Mr Trump tweeted. Jeff Immelt, chairman of General Electric, had not yet said he was quitting, but had already decided to go, the company said.John Flannery, GE’s new chief executive who took over from Mr Immelt at the beginning of August, explained in a note to staff: “Following the President’s deeply troubling statements yesterday [Tuesday], we decided that GE needed to leave the committee on American manufacturing.”In a final blow, the White House announced on Thursday that it would also not go ahead with its infrastructure council that would have advised the president on how best to deliver the $1tn he promised to invest in roads, bridges and other vital public works projects during last year’s campaign.With the advisory groups gone, US businesses will need to find other ways to make their points to Mr Trump. With the tax reform debate in Congress looming, the lack of a clear channel of communication is worrying for some.The position staked out by the president, however, made it impossible for the framework of advisory groups to survive.Additional reporting by Stephen Foley, Anna Nicolaou and Richard Waters
40;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-08-16T19:24:08Z;Consumer companies wrestle with how to respond to Trump;CEOs of PepsiCo and Walmart risked criticism on all sides for advisory role;"For companies reliant on the US consumer, taking a position on anything said or done by the present incumbent of the White House risks exposing them to fury online — from both sides.Walmart and PepsiCo came under fire from opposite ends of the political spectrum this week in the wake of Donald Trump’s comments on the deadly violence in Charlottesville, and the companies’ situation reflects the especially awkward position of trying to sell household brands to diverse groups across the US.The chief executives of both companies were members of the presidential advisory councils that were disbanded on Wednesday amidst the furore, alongside business leaders from manufacturing, finance and other industries.“This is a much bigger deal for Pepsi than it is for Boeing,"" says Scott Galloway, marketing professor at NYU. ""Pepsi is trying to create a hip, youthful image. Boeing is just trying to not p*** off Delta. The CEO of Pepsi needs to make a decision and the calculus has changed dramatically over the past 48 hours.”Groups on both the left and right had threatened to stop buying from the retailer Walmart after Doug McMillon, chief executive, posted a note to employees on Monday with his most explicit criticism of the US president so far.“As we watched the events and the response from President Trump over the weekend, we too felt that he missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists,” Mr McMillon wrote. It was a rare move by a company that usually avoids wading into politics. However, the chief executive of America’s largest private employer stopped short of leaving Mr Trump’s advisory council, saying that “we should stay engaged to try to influence decisions”. While Mr Trump’s supporters bristled at the critical message, on the other side, some groups argued Mr McMillon should break ties with the White House entirely.Denise Morrison, head of Campbell Soup, another consumer staple, resigned from the president’s advisory council shortly before it was disbanded on Wednesday. She and Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo, had faced particular pressure from activists.Color of Change, which helped generate a consumer backlash against Uber in recent months, had stepped up its campaign against Pepsi on Tuesday. “After today’s press conference how can anyone remain associated with an openly racist, terrorist defending, Donald Trump,” the group tweeted, after the president cast blame on “ both sides” of the Charlottesville protests. An online campaign that has led consumer boycotts of brands in the Trump era, with the Twitter hashtag #grabyourwallet, was also bearing down on PepsiCo. “We’re not letting this go,” co-founder Shannon Coulter wrote in a Twitter post that was retweeted 12,000 times. Ms Coulter, a marketing consultant, in October created the hashtag to urge shoppers to boycott retailers selling Trump brands, including Amazon, Macy’s and Nordstrom.Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and other retailers have since reduced or dropped products associated with Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter. Even Tiki Brands, the maker of torches “designed to enhance backyard gatherings,” this week specified that they were “not associated in any way with the events that took place in Charlottesville”, after neo-Nazis held similar torches as they marched last weekend.Corporate America’s “strategy of the past 50 years has been to stay out of politics, and that was the right one”, said NYU’s Mr Galloway. “But if the CEO of Walmart can come out against this . . . that has changed.”"
41;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-08-15T18:04:29Z;Activist Corvex looks to squeeze value from Danone;Like many of its peers the French yoghurt maker is struggling with slowing growth;Danone, the French food group that was deemed of strategic national interest 12 years ago when the government blocked potential for a takeover, has come under renewed pressure from US activists.Shares in the company, which owns brands including Activia yoghurt and Evian water, rose 3 per cent on Tuesday morning following reports after the market close on Monday that US activist hedge fund Corvex had built up a roughly $400m position in the company, believing it to be undervalued.Corvex, according to people familiar with the fund’s thinking, is not planning a campaign to shake up management or demand board seats at Danone, which has a market value of €45bn. Rather it wants to improve operations and better position the group in a food industry beset by slowing growth.Danone in February unveiled a strategy to deliver €1bn of cost savings by 2020 as it forecast a slowdown in profit growth for 2017. It recorded its weakest like-for-like sales growth since 1997 last year with revenues of €21.9bn, up 2.9 per cent, while in July it said second-quarter sales were flat.In April, it completed its $12.5bn acquisition of WhiteWave, a US maker of high-end natural and health-focused foods. The deal was designed to tap new areas of growth, benefit from a health and wellness trend among consumers and reduce Danone’s reliance on its under-performing dairy division, which still accounts for 40 per cent of sales.Robert Waldschmidt, head of consumer research at Liberum, says: “I agree with Corvex that Danone is undervalued but I’m left scratching my head a bit as to what Corvex might want to do.”He adds: “Danone is a fairly levered business following the WhiteWave acquisition so there is not much room for returning capital to shareholders. And Danone has already announced reasonably ambitious targets of €1bn in cost savings and improving dairy margins by 200 basis points.”The appearance of an activist investor on its shareholder register is likely to come as little surprise to Emmanuel Faber, chief executive, however.Shares in Danone and rivals Unilever and Diageo rose in June after Nestlé was targeted by Dan Loeb’s activist hedge fund Third Point. This reflected investor belief that activist pressure would spread throughout the industry to push companies to improve profitability and increase shareholder value.After the disclosure of Third Point’s Nestlé stake, Mr Faber told the Financial Times: “We will continue to see activists in this industry because there’s a big debate within it about whether food is an industry in which there is no growth any more.”Mr Faber says that one view is that in a low-growth environment for food, companies should cut costs and return capital to shareholders to deploy elsewhere. This is the “lean and mean” zero-based budgeting and aggressive cost-cutting approach favoured by the likes of 3G Capital, which backed a failed bid by Kraft Heinz for Unilever in February.Danone, for its part, says that “food is still something that matters to humanity” and has a stated vision to create a sustainable future for the industry.The French group, which declined to comment on the Corvex stake, is regularly rumoured as a takeover target and analysts say it could be seen as one again now that activist investors have it in their sights.It is not the first time: in summer 2005 its shares soared on speculation of a bid approach by PepsiCo.Before a bid was made or announced, the French establishment swooped to “defend France’s interests” in the shape of Danone. The government drafted a law designed to protect companies in “strategic industries” from foreign takeover — dubbed the Danone Law.The Corvex stake marks the second time that Danone has been targeted by a US activist investor. In November 2012 it emerged that Nelson Peltz’s Trian investment firm had built up a position in Danone. He called for the return of excess cash flow in the form of share buybacks, and pushed for the yoghurt maker to improve operating margins by 100 basis points to 15.1 per cent by 2015.Last month, Danone reported that recurring operating margin stood at 14.18 per cent at the end of the first half of 2017, up 81 basis points year-on-year on a reported basis. This is roughly the same level it was when Mr Peltz bought in back in 2012. Trian later sold out of its position in Danone in the second quarter of 2013.Following the WhiteWave acquisition, Danone’s operating margin is still hovering around this level.“I don’t know what more you’d want to do to the business the right now,” says Mr Waldschmidt. “Danone just needs to execute what it has already announced.”
42;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Investments in Bai drag on Dr Pepper Snapple earnings;;Already battling stagnant soda sales, Dr Pepper Snapple reported an unexpected earnings drop of 28 per cent after debt write-down and expenses related to its Bai drink acquisition.As the company behind 7UP and A&W adjusts to a market of more health-conscious consumers, the group reported earnings in the second quarter had decreased to $188m, or $1.02 per share, compared to $260m, or $1.40 per share, in the period last year.While revenue of roughly $1.8bn met expectations, analysts had estimated earnings per share of $1.28.The Plano, Texas-based company said the losses primarily stemmed from a $49m early payment of debt as well as $40m in additional expenses related to its acquisition of Bai, a flavoured water drink. As the the company spent $20m in marketing the brand, however, the group noted total Bai brand sales growth contributed just over 2 percentage points of net sales growth.The company reported a slight recovery in volume, as non-carbonated beverages grew 5 per cent with the help of Bai, making up for a 1 per cent decline in Snapple.In the carbonated drinks division, volume also rose 3 per cent, assisted by a 4 per cent gain in sales of Schweppes and 6 per cent increase of Canada Dry. Squirt and 7UP were also up, while A&W was flat.By geography, US and Canada volume increased 3 per cent, while Mexico and the Caribbean volume grew 6 per cent- both slight improvements over the previous quarter.The company said it continues to expect core earnings per share in the range of $4.56 to $4.66 for its 2017 fiscal year outlook.Shares in Dr Pepper Snapple are up just 1.6 per cent for the year, while shares in rivals PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are up 11.8 per cent and 9.9 per cent, respectively.
43;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Consumer goods make appetising target for US activists;Nestlé, P&G and Unilever all under pressure to improve performance;Nelson Peltz has always had a healthy appetite for food. Heinz, Cadbury, Mondelez, PepsiCo and Danone — the veteran US activist investor has agitated for change in them all.Mr Peltz’s taste have broadened with his ambitions. This week, the 75-year old launched a proxy battle to get a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble, the US’s biggest household products company with a $226bn market value, in which Mr Peltz’s Trian investment group invested $3.3bn this year.And Mr Peltz is not alone at the table. Nestlé, the world’s largest consumer goods group, discovered last month that its SFr259bn market value was no longer a defence against activist incursion. Dan Loeb, founder and chief executive of Third Point, took a $3.5bn stake in the producer of KitKat chocolate and Nespresso coffee.Mr Loeb called for a “greater sense of urgency” in boosting performance at the Swiss company, which he described as “staid” and “stuck in its old ways”. Mr Peltz used similar language about P&G — pointing to “excessive cost and bureaucracy” and “a slow moving and insular culture”.Francois-Xavier de Mallmann, chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, says that activists are stepping up their activity in the consumer goods sector.“Activists have been investing in the consumer sector for several years but there has been a sizeable increase in both the number and size of the companies they have targeted over recent months.”Consumer goods companies can make appetising targets. Companies such as P&G and Nestlé — alongside peers that have come into the sights of activists, such as Unilever and Mondelez — are easily criticised for their sprawling empires, weighed down by excessive costs and inefficient staff protected by the size of the business and ingrained management approaches.But analysts say that the bulk of these companies is almost the point — within their hundreds of thousands of staff, shelves of products and rosters of marketers lies the fat that can be trimmed.Activists see the potential to boost profits by cutting costs and use their large, cash-dispensing balance sheets that have relatively little leverage to boost shareholder returns.“Sales growth in consumer industries has slowed and because of this you are seeing the rise of activist investors, looking to cut costs to boost profitability,” said David Dudding, European equities fund manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investment.Analysts say that the strongest impetus for activists is the potential to drive up profits, as demonstrated repeatedly by 3G Capital, the Brazilian-led private equity group. It has for decades been acquiring consumer companies, cutting costs and boosting profits to levels described by Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman emeritus of Nestlé, as “revolutionary”.After 3G bought Heinz in 2013 with Warren Buffett, the ketchup maker’s profit margins soared 58 per cent within two years to 28 per cent — almost twice Nestle’s 15 per cent operating profit margin. 3G and Mr Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group went on to merge Heinz with Kraft in 2015. This year, they stunned the consumer goods world with the $143bn takeover bid from Kraft Heinz for Unilever, which is twice the size of Kraft Heinz in revenues. The bid was quickly dropped after stiff opposition from Unilever but the bold approach has left even the biggest consumer goods companies looking vulnerable.“The catalyst for the focus on consumer groups from activists is the increasing polarisation in the sector between those companies that have been through a 3G-style cost-cutting process and those that haven’t,” said Raphaël Pitoun, chief investment officer at Seilern Investment Management.“Companies such as Nestlé, Colgate, P&G and others haven’t been through that process so activists see an opportunity to drive earnings per share growth through cost-cutting.”Mr Peltz has highlighted P&G’s weak organic growth and said its cost-cutting plans have not translated into higher operating profits and shareholder value creation. Mr Loeb’s criticisms of Nestlé are similar. He has called for the company to adopt a formal margin target, something that Mark Schneider, Nestle’s new chief executive, was already considering.Another attraction is the low levels of debt at many large consumer companies, including Nestlé, Unilever and L’Oréal, compared to other industries.Mr Loeb has described Nestle’s net debt of 1 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation as “remarkably low”. He has urged the group to double its borrowings, “monetise” its 23 per cent stake in L'Oréal, which is valued at about $25bn, and return capital to shareholders.Mr Schneider announced a buyback programme of up to SFr20bn a few days after Mr Loeb burst on the scene, although Nestlé said this had been planned for months.Unilever too has been jolted into action after the failed Kraft Heinz bid. The company behind Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream has sharpened its focus on profitability, setting a target of 20 per cent operating margin by 2020, from 16 per cent last year.Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever finance director, said on Thursday that it had made €1bn in savings in the first six months of the year out of a three-year €6bn savings programme.The cost-cutting included reducing advertising agency fees by 17 per cent and lowering the average cost of making an ad by 14 per cent. Staff had taken 30 per cent fewer flights, and each seat cost a quarter less.But activist investors are also flush with cash and on the hunt for returns outside the US. For investors such as Mr Loeb, Europe was once seen as an uncertain place to attempt to mount a campaign given varying laws and shareholder rights.All that has changed given the perception of better value in many industries than in the US. David Neuhauser, founder of the small Chicago-based activist investor Livermore Partners, says his fund is increasingly looking to Europe.“I see a lot more things to do in Europe than in the US, and a lot of that is due to valuation and opportunity and growth prospects,” said Mr Neuhauser. “Some of the things in the US, the valuations are high and they do seem to have their defences up quicker.”Moody’s, the rating agency, said that despite experiencing outflows last year “activists still have plenty of spending power to take on even the largest companies”, although it added that they usually target smaller groups.Chris Plath, a Moody’s vice-president, expects more activist campaigns this year. “International activism continues to gain steam. This increase reflects the relative lack of low-hanging fruit among US large-caps.”The big question being asked by executives in the sector is whether the increased activist appetite will be healthy for the industry — stimulating faster change as it grapples with low growth and a shift in the way people buy food and household goods.Or whether activists end up benefiting their funds more than the longer-term growth potential of the companies.Mr Dudding said: “We tend to be agnostic about activists’ presence on shareholder registers. In the long run, consumer staples stocks do better when they reinvest cost savings in driving top line growth and shouldn’t be bullied into prioritising short-term profitability over long-term brand equity.”The ideal is when both sides win. Mr Peltz in 2013 argued that PepsiCo was plagued by a “culture of sycophants”, pushing the company to split its drinks business from its faster-growing snacks unit. Indra Nooyi, chief executive, resisted but eventually agreed to add a Trian representative to the board.PepsiCo shares gained 50 per cent over the course of the campaign, as the company aggressively cut costs and improved margins to take the edge off Trian’s pressure. “In a slow-moving industry like consumer packaged goods, you have a good safety net so companies don’t blow up. So a lot of them have been complacent,” said Ali Dibadj, analyst at Bernstein. “It’s perfect for activism because they have the room to cut massive amounts of costs.”When Dan Loeb announced his largest ever stake in Switzerland-based Nestlé this summer, writes Lindsay Fortado, the move was the latest sign of the interest taken in Europe by activist shareholders from the US.Mr Loeb has been busy this year having also acquired stakes in UniCredit, the Italian lender, and German utility Eon. He was not alone. Elsewhere, Keith Meister’s Corvex Management joined with 40 North to take a 7.2 per cent stake in Clariant, the Swiss chemicals group, in the hope of scuppering its $20bn merger with US rival Huntsman.They follow San Francisco-based ValueAct, which built a 10.8 per cent stake in Rolls-Royce beginning in 2015, and Elliott, Paul Singer’s hedge fund, which has been active in Europe for decades but has been ramping up activity.“As markets rise, people are starting to look for opportunities,” said Reade Griffith, the London-based chief investment officer of hedge fund Polygon’s European event-driven strategy, which sometimes takes a behind-the-scenes activist approach.“There is less competition for activists here and the economic cycle is just turning so the upside in company margins in Europe is significant across many sectors,” Mr Griffith said. “Europe is around the second or third inning out of nine in its economic recovery, while the US is around the seventh or ninth inning, depending on how Trump does.”Europe is no stranger to shareholder activism but most in the past has been conducted by local firms and often with a more “constructivist” behind-the-scenes approach. European activists have already made inroads, however, such as Cevian Capital, Chris Hohn’s TCI, and some smaller peers such as CIAM in Paris and Knight Vinke in Monaco.But Europe may still prove a harder, and unfamiliar, place for US activists to mount campaigns.“In Europe, whilst there are some commonalities, such as antitrust law, that cut across multiple markets, there are a lot of specificities and cultural differences that are unique to each country, so you have to have an understanding of each jurisdiction to be successful,” said Mr Griffith.Eleazer Klein, head of the shareholder activism group at the law firm Schulte, Roth & Zabel, which represents a number of hedge funds, says that Europe is far from being under attack.“As much as you’re seeing the expansion of US activists into Europe, I don’t view it as anything other than a lot of these funds are looking at companies that are underperforming, and they are funds that are not limited to companies that are wholly located in the US,” he said.A chart in this article has been amended to remove an incorrect title.

Not quite yet. PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks juggernaut that owns the Mountain Dew brand, said on Tuesday that it was thinking hard about ways to get products into the hands of consumers who are changing the way they shop. Such reflection should be expanded to include a worrying lack of volume growth.For years, PepsiCo and the traditional consumer giants have been building and buying healthy, hipster brands with better margins than its eponymous sugary water. But those consumer tastes are changing alongside shopping habits, as Whole Foods learned when it decided to sell out to Amazon. Nevertheless, PepsiCo delivered another steady quarter. It announced year-on-year earnings growth of 13 per cent and re-affirmed its annual targets of 3 per cent organic sales growth and 8 per cent earnings growth.PepsiCo’s shares are up 4 per cent in the past year. That’s below the S&P 500 which has zoomed up 14 per cent. But rival consumer stalwarts are also facing trouble. Unilever is under siege from the swashbulcking 3G Capital. Mondelez is facing chief executive succession questions. And smaller competitor General Mills, whose fate is tied up with the fading breakfast cereals category, has seen its shares dip by a quarter.Suddenly PepsiCo looks like a safe harbour. Second-quarter results were driven, in what has become a pattern, by pricing gains (3 per cent) rather than volume growth which was flat, overall. The company claims that its higher prices for healthier or more convenient drinks and snacks suggests it can obsess less about unit sales.Already caught in a deflationary cycle and facing competition from Amazon, the question remains how PepsiCo can maintain its pricing leverage. A chunky forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22 times may be unsurprising given its historic resilience. That could start to look rich if drinkers don’t start buying more low calorie soda from their smartphones.
45;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-07-11T17:09:40Z;PepsiCo makes a healthy profit thanks to price rises;Company says consumers will pay more for ‘guilt-free’ snacks;PepsiCo’s attempt to shift its business away from its namesake soda to healthier, upmarket snacks continued to pay off in its latest results.Facing flat sales for sugary drinks, the New York-based company is charging higher prices for “guilt-free” snacks, such as overnight oats and vegetable crisps, helping fuel higher than forecast profits and revenue in the second quarter. Both PepsiCo and rival Coca-Cola have aimed to reinvent themselves and become less reliant on their flagship drinks, as consumers opt for healthier snacking and regulatory pressures to cut consumption of salt and sugar intensify. Instead PepsiCo is focused on smaller packaging and premium products they can charge more for. “The prices are going to be higher on products that are a little bit healthier,” Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, said in an interview. “Consumers are willing to pay more for premium products. We can sell this cup of overnight oats for $2.” For the three months to June 17, net revenue climbed 2 per cent to $15.7bn, ahead of the $15.57bn the market had forecast. Net income came in at $2.1bn, or $1.46 a share, and also topped the $1.39 per share analysts were expecting. 45%Of Pepsi’s sales are ‘guilt-free’ snacks and drinksPepsiCo says “guilt-free” snacks and drinks, such as diet sodas and baked crisps, now make up about 45 per cent of the company’s sales. The maker of Gatorade and Doritos has used savings from a broad $5bn cost-cutting programme to pay for development of healthier food. In the past year PepsiCo has introduced products such as probiotic versions of its Tropicana juices and has acquired Kevita, a maker of fermented tea drink kombucha and other beverages. Almost 9 per cent of PepsiCo’s sales come from products introduced in the past three years, thanks to the success of new drinks including electrolyte water, says Mr Johnston. He added that the price-raising strategy would continue through the year. The all-important North American beverages and snacks units both benefited from higher prices and productivity gains. Revenue at PepsiCo’s North American beverage unit, which accounts for about a third of total group sales, was up 2 per cent at $5.2bn during the quarter despite flat volumes. At Frito-Lay North America, the group’s snack business and second largest unit, sales rose 3 per cent to $3.6bn. In both units, the ability to charge higher prices for its premium and better-for-you offerings helped offset the lack of volume growth. Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, said the results were “very much in line with our expectations”. The New York-based group also raised its guidance on core earnings for the year to $5.13 a share, up from $5.09 a share three months ago, as renewed dollar weakness helped lessen the currency headwinds it was expecting to face.

Net income came in at $2.1bn, or $1.46 a share and also easily topped the $1.39 per share analysts were expecting.The gains come amid efforts by PepsiCo to diversify away from its namesake Pepsi brand. It has been investing in reformulating products and developing new ones as consumers increasingly opt for healthier snacks, using gains from a broad cost-cutting programme to help pay for it.In the past year it has introduced products such as probiotic versions of its Tropicana juices and has acquired Kevita — a maker of fermented tea drink kombucha and other beverages.Revenue at Pepsi’s North American beverage unit, which accounts for about a third of total group sales, were up 2 per cent at $5.2bn during the quarter.

47;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-06-27T21:36:49Z;Global groups join forces to prove value beyond financial results;Corporate and investment fund CEOs want to be judged on broader, longer-term measures;Some of the world’s biggest companies and investors are joining forces to move beyond pure financial reporting and develop ways to measure performance on softer issues such as environmental impact and training.The chief executives of more than 20 companies and investment funds, including Unilever, PepsiCo and Nestlé, and the asset managers Vanguard, Fidelity and Schroders, are involved in the project led by the not-for-profit business group, Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism, and professional services firm EY.While listed companies are subject to standard financial reporting requirements, which enable investors to compare their ability to make profits or increase revenue, other aspects that give companies value — such as training workforces or producing intellectual property — do not fall under a consistent framework and are therefore harder for investors to judge.Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who founded the coalition, said it was “the first step” to allow companies to prove their long-term value, rather than being judged solely on their immediate financial performance.“Companies want to behave better, but there’s a gap in being able to explain that and compare that for investors,” she said. “I can’t tell you the number of CEOs who talk to me and say, ‘I have extensive employee training but not one analyst has asked me about employee training. They’ve asked me about my margins on burgers in Detroit’.”Mark Weinberger, EY’s global chairman and chief executive, said the project responded to calls by fund managers, who have said they want to invest in companies that will be “good for stakeholders” — not just shareholders, but also customers and employees.The participating companies and investors, representing a combined $20tn under management, will discuss a set of consistent metrics that would allow fund managers to compare companies’ “intangible assets”, which range from intellectual property to more ephemeral aspects like company culture or brand value.Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever and an advocate of sustainable growth, said a standardised reporting framework for long-term investment “has long been needed so markets can properly measure this broader approach to value creation”.But Mr Weinberger said that although regulators would advise the group, it was not aiming to set new standards at this stage.Public trust in business has slumped amid fears that globalisation has left many workers poorer and that technology is threatening jobs. Survey data published in January by Edelman, a public relations firm, found that trust in business had declined in 18 countries last year, with the majority of survey participants in 13 countries, including the UK, saying they distrust business.Lady Rothschild called it “a critical point in history when popular opinion of capitalism is very low and political pressure against the status quo is building to a crescendo”. To combat this, “investors and businesses need a better way to create and articulate the long-term, inclusive value they create for their customers, employees, communities, the environment and shareholders”, she said.
48;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-06-23T04:01:33Z;LuxLeaks: Luxembourg’s response to an international tax scandal;Damaging attacks on sweetheart deals have forced policy changes;Jean-Claude Juncker was a man under pressure when he appeared before the European Parliament’s tax investigation committee in September 2015.The European Commission president and former Luxembourg prime minister was under tremendous scrutiny due to the LuxLeaks scandal, which centred on revelations that hundreds of multinational companies with offices in the grand duchy had constructed complex strategies to reduce their tax bills to near zero.Having fended off calls to resign when the scandal erupted in 2014, the veteran politician sought during the parliament hearing to deflect the blame from Luxembourg’s politicians, including himself. Instead, he emphasised the independence of the country’s tax authorities from political interference and the international nature of the problem.In the packed committee room, Mr Juncker told MEPs that when people talk about LuxLeaks “really what they are talking about is a kind of common practice in many member states”, adding: “In fact, that is why I’d rather say EULeaks than LuxLeaks.”Nearly three years on from the LuxLeaks revelations, scrutiny from the public and politicians of corporate tax deals remains intense. The response from Luxembourg and the EU has had a profound impact on the decisions companies make when deciding where to base international operations.The LuxLeaks scandal broke in November 2014 when the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published thousands of pages of documents, many of them leaked by Antoine Deltour, a whistleblower and former employee of PwC.The documents revealed details about how more than 300 companies with operations in Luxembourg had cut their tax bills by moving profits around different parts of the corporate group and playing national tax systems off against one another.The companies had worked with big accounting firms and secured rulings from the Luxembourg tax agency that such arrangements did not flout national laws. Those involved included household names such as Ikea, Pepsi and Fiat.One tactic revealed in the scandal was companies arranging loans between different subsidiaries within the same group at high interest rates. The result was that profitmaking businesses in high tax countries had to pay back loans to entities in lower-tax countries, effectively transferring profits from where they would have been taxed most.Multinationals also routed investments through “brass-plate” companies in Luxembourg, which had very little presence in the country other than a registered legal address. This was done to take advantage of the grand duchy’s favourable treaties with other countries, allowing the companies to avoid certain taxes in other jurisdictions they had invested in.The scandal brought public attention to these practices, known as “base erosion” and “profit shifting”, and put pressure on politicians to tackle them.Mr Deltour says the problem with the practices is not so much legal as moral. “The big issue is not whether or not Luxembourg respected EU law,” he says. “The main issue is that the European single market allows member states to compete with their tax systems. In the end if you still allow that then it leads to a race to the bottom.” Within Luxembourg, he adds, “no one really took responsibility for this, for the scandal and for all the practices.”Mr Deltour along with Raphael Halet, another former PwC employee, and Edouard Perrin, a French journalist, were prosecuted for their roles in exposing documents.Mr Deltour received a six-month suspended sentence and a €1,500 fine on appeal in March, while Mr Halet was fined €1,000 and Mr Perrin was acquitted.Since the LuxLeak scandal broke, Luxembourg’s politicians and senior financial services figures have argued that the problems exposed were down to international rather than national failings. They say the government has worked with other countries to improve information-sharing among national tax authorities and fix the divergences between tax codes that made it possible for companies to hide their profits from tax collectors.Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg’s finance minister, says he aims to create an international “level playing field”. “We need more transparency, and everyone has to play along,” he says. “Now the European Union is doing that and we are expecting others to follow.”The grand duchy has insisted that, in the years when multinationals were making their tax deals, Luxembourg was not doing anything different from other EU countries. Its says its tax agency was simply providing clarifications to companies, on request, as to whether their arrangements were legal or not. The granting of these “tax rulings” is standard procedure in many countries.But this explanation has been challenged in Brussels, where MEPs held their investigation into the scandal in 2015. The European Commission has picked through tax rulings in Luxembourg and elsewhere over concerns that companies enjoyed special treatment not available to competitors.The affair has had wider implications. McDonald’s, the US fast-food chain, responded to the increased scrutiny of its affairs after LuxLeaks by announcing last year that it would move its non-US tax base out of the country. LuxLeaks has also reignited concerns about the country’s tax affairs that its current government, elected in 2013, had been working to dispel.The LuxLeaks revelations emerged as the country was trying to move on from a different, and long running, dispute with its European partners about tax — one focused on banking secrecy.For years, Luxembourg, Austria and Belgium had opted out of EU arrangements that meant national tax authorities shared data about the bank accounts Europeans set up in other EU countries. The intention of these arrangements was to make sure that people did not hide money abroad to avoid tax.In exchange for being allowed to maintain their banking secrecy, the three countries had to levy a so-called “withholding tax” on foreign savings.Banking secrecy had been one of the cornerstones of Luxembourg’s rapid development as a financial centre, which began in the 1960s when the grand duchy set about transforming an economy previously reliant on steel.Luxembourg had argued that if it shared information it would hand the advantage to non-EU financial centres in Europe such as Liechtenstein and Switzerland. By the time current prime minister Xavier Bettel’s government took office in December 2013, the position had become untenable.The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis had galvanised international work to combat tax evasion. The nadir for Luxembourg came in November 2013 when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development branded the country as non-compliant with international standards on tax transparency, and placed it on a blacklist of non-co-operative jurisdictions.The country then set about reforming its tax laws, effectively bringing an end to banking secrecy. The strategy was endorsed by the OECD, which took the country off its blacklist in October 2015.“When we took the decision in 2014 that we had to embrace transparency, we had no guarantee that our financial centre would not only survive but eventually do better,” Mr Gramegna says. “It wasn’t easy. Quite a few players at the financial centre of Luxembourg were telling us that we shouldn’t do it.”He adds: “Because it was done at a time when the international environment was evolving, it had less impact on our financial centre than many had anticipated.”LuxLeaks posed an entirely different, and reputationally more dangerous, problem, especially because of the role of Luxembourg’s tax authorities in signing off their rulings.“In the first days of LuxLeaks it was presented in such a way that . . . rulings in Luxembourg were responsible for all the [tax] problems in the world,” Mr Gramegna says. “We managed to explain that it was a combination of factors that were at work, that rulings exist in 26 countries out of 28 in the EU, and that it is the combination of rulings of different countries — together with international tax conventions between countries — that could lead to companies paying very little or no taxes.”Luxembourger politicians, including Mr Juncker, have insisted the country operates a strict division of responsibilities where politicians are never involved in granting tax rulings. That task falls to the Luxembourg tax agency known as Sociétés 6 which the government says is fully independent. But this has not prevented the country coming under intense international pressure.Michael Theurer, a German MEP and co-author of the European Parliament’s reports into LuxLeaks, says that, while the scandal revealed an international problem, Luxembourg is a special case given the volume of tax rulings produced by Sociétés 6.“We [had] big doubts whether the economic substance underlying these rulings was checked in a diligent manner,” he says. “We couldn’t prove a lack of diligence, but there was significant evidence if we looked at the cases and if we looked at the time they spent on checking each ruling.”While the schemes helped reduce tax bills, they also led to companies carrying out business in Luxembourg and so bolstered the grand duchy’s finances, Mr Theurer says.“We could see that for Luxembourg the result was net positive because the tax amount was increasing,” he adds. “Although the companies overall gained an advantage, Luxembourg was also increasing its tax take.”Luxembourg also faced European Commission probes. Brussels ruled in October 2015 that a tax ruling given by Luxembourg to a subsidiary of carmaker Fiat in 2012 was a sweetheart deal that “unduly reduced the company’s tax burden by a total of between €20m and €30m”.The Commission said Luxembourg had been too flexible in accepting the tax plans the Fiat subsidiary put on the table, allowing the company to use “an extremely complex and artificial methodology to calculate Fiat Finance and Trade’s taxable profits, which cannot be justified by economic reality”.Since then, Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, has opened in-depth probes into Luxembourg tax rulings given to GDF Suez — the French utility company now known as Engie— and McDonald’s. The cases are based on concerns that the companies could have been given an unfair edge over competitors.In McDonald’s case, Brussels says it is assessing whether the Luxembourg tax agency “selectively derogated” from the country’s tax law and from the terms of a tax treaty with the US, which handed the fast-food group an unfair advantage.Luxembourg is not the only country Brussels has probed since the scandal began. Ms Vestager has challenged tax rulings handed down in the Netherlands and Ireland, and has ruled against an “excess profits” scheme in Belgium that she said unfairly benefited multinationals.We should leave this monolithic economy based on the finance industry. It’s a golden cageLuxembourg officials, politicians and finance professionals insist that the scandal and its aftershocks are not deterring businesses from setting up in the grand duchy. They argue that McDonald’s decision to relocate should be seen in the light of the steps taken by the OECD and EU to close the loopholes that companies exploited.The new restrictions are forcing companies to reorganise their international operations — something they argue could lead to arrivals in Luxembourg as well as departures.Mr Gramegna says that the scandal was “an important event, but it’s been digested”. In his meeting with companies, he says, “everybody talks to me about Brexit not about LuxLeaks”.Luxembourg reformed its tax laws in December, ushering in penalties for fraud and making “aggravated tax evasion” a criminal offence. The country has also reviewed the way its tax agency works.But for David Wagner, an MP from Luxembourg’s opposition Left party, whatever the specific consequences of LuxLeaks on policy and legislation, repeated tax scandals are leading to a growing realisation that the country should diversify its economy.“We should leave this monolithic economy based on the finance industry,” he says. “It’s a golden cage.”
49;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-06-18T23:01:09Z;Consumers turn shopping into a political statement;Companies are having to tread carefully around hot topics;Fifty-seven per cent of global consumers buy or boycott products because of a brand’s stance on political or social issues, according to a new survey, a sign of growing pressure on companies to weigh in on hot-button topics from immigration and climate change to transgender rights and fake news.Amplified by the megaphone of the internet, consumers have successfully pushed companies including JPMorgan, Coca-Cola, Mercedes-Benz and Delta Air Lines to pull their marketing dollars from controversial television programmes, unsavoury internet content and even a production of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar.Edelman’s Earned Brand survey offers evidence that people are also wielding the power of their pocketbooks to reward and punish companies based on whether or not they share shoppers’ values. Of the 14,000 respondents in 14 countries, 30 per cent said they are buying or boycotting based on values more than they were three years ago. Nearly a quarter of consumers who said they prefer to buy from brands that share their beliefs are willing to pay more for those products.This trend represents “a real opportunity for multinational brands”, said Richard Edelman, chief executive of the world’s biggest public relations firm by revenues, who will present the research at the Cannes Lions advertising festival this week. “Brands have to take on bigger issues of the moment,” he said.Social media has accelerated the pace of consumer-led campaigns that helped oust Bill O’Reilly from Fox News and spurred hundreds of brands to stop advertising on Breitbart News, the far-right website. But companies are also responding to evolving expectations about their role on the public stage, Edelman’s research suggests.The data show us that 67 per cent of people will try a brand for the first time because of its position on a controversial issue. That is customer acquisitionPublic trust in institutions, from government to media, has dropped to the lowest level since the financial crisis, according to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer. People are increasingly looking to companies to fill that vacuum: 51 per cent of respondents in the new survey said they “believe brands can do more to solve social ills than government”.Companies have long wanted to distance themselves from inappropriate or controversial content. But today many are also using their financial support to signal their stances. JPMorgan not only pulled its advertising from NBC News over a planned interview with Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist, but the bank’s chief marketing officer tweeted her disapproval, saying “as an advertiser, I'm repulsed that [presenter Megyn Kelly] would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes”.Corporate values have become a particular flashpoint in America’s polarised political environment. The chief executives of Apple, Google, Starbucks and Coca-Cola spoke out against President Donald Trump’s travel ban. After Mr Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement, Bob Iger, Walt Disney chief executive, and Elon Musk, Tesla chief, resigned from the president’s business advisory council. Mr Iger said his decision was “a matter of principle”.Companies have also exerted influence on the state level. A corporate boycott of North Carolina sparked by a controversial law that barred transgender people from using the bathroom of their choice will cost the state an estimated $3.8bn over the next decade, according to the Associated Press. Similar pressure from big companies in Georgia, Indiana and Arkansas in recent years resulted in those states amending or dropping controversial “religious freedom” bills viewed as anti-gay.However, wading into public controversies can backfire. Pepsi apologised earlier this year for a tone-deaf ad featuring reality television star and model Kendall Jenner attending a Black Lives Matter-style protest that drew scorn and ridicule on social media. Many companies looking to sell their products to a wide array of people across the political spectrum fear that the risks of taking sides may outweigh the benefits.Brands were more likely to succeed when they picked issues that fitted closely with their products or customers and when they took concrete action to support those causes, said Chris Allieri, founder of Mulberry and Astor, a PR consultancy.“These things cannot be just statements from CEOs. They have to be followed up with actual programmes and commitments. If they are going to take a stand on an issue, they have to make an investment along those lines.”Mark Renshaw, global chair of Edelman’s brand practice, said the firm’s research illuminated a business opportunity awaiting companies that did take a stand.“The data show us that 67 per cent of people will try a brand for the first time because of its position on a controversial issue. That is customer acquisition. And they’re willing to pay more for those brands. You can gain customers and they will be better and more financially viable customers for you.”

The picture then appeared as a framed photo held up by Gary Lineker, the former footballer, who has long fronted the Walkers crisps advertising campaign.However, Walkers — which is owned by PepsiCo of the US where it is known as Lay’s — quickly found itself at the centre of a social media storm after being inundated with embarrassing images as people instead sent in pictures of Josef Stalin and criminals such as Harold Shipman, the mass murderer.The failed stunt was widely shared on Twitter before Walkers started taking down unsuitable posts.Mr Lineker joked about the incident, tweeting: “Had an unusual day in some very strange company. I’m sure we’ll wave goodbye to them all by tomorrow.”Walkers said: “We recognise people were offended by irresponsible and offensive posts by individuals, and we apologise. We are equally upset and have shut down all activity.”This is not the first time in recent weeks that Pepsi has been caught up in an advertising campaign backlash. Last month it was forced to apologise and withdraw an ad featuring reality TV celebrity Kendall Jenner after it co-opted iconic imagery of protest movements to promote the fizzy drink.The Snap and Share competition was part of the launch of Walkers “sharing bags” — larger packs of crisps to be shared while watching the football match.Walkers is the latest consumer products group to run into problems over a marketing initiative, highlighting the perils of direct contact with consumers through social media.Matt Donegan, chief executive of social media marketing agency Social Circle, said: “It’s certainly the worst campaign featuring a brand app like this for some time. It does scream naivety. You can’t have a fully automated system, you need to put some control mechanisms in place.”Johnson & Johnson, the US group that manufactures benadryl, a hay fever remedy, found that people were forming obscene words by dropping pins on a map supposed to show areas of high pollen count. The app had to be taken down temporarily soon after launch.A campaign in 2012 by Waitrose, the British grocery chain, inviting customers to finish the sentence ‘I shop at Waitrose because . . . ’ backfired when the answers instead ridiculed the brand’s upmarket image.Jonathan Trimble, chief executive at advertising agency 18 Feet and Rising, said the reaction to the Walkers campaign showed brands and agencies needed more caution when it came to using people’s personal space online.“We in the creative and marketing industry need to respect the boundaries of where people are socialising and when we are interrupting them to sell them something,” he said.Twitter declined to comment.

The maker of Mountain Dew and Quaker Oats reported adjusted earnings rose nearly 6 per cent to 94 cents a share, beating consensus forecasts of 92 cents a share. Sales climbed 1.6 per cent to $12.05bn, eclipsing estimates of $11.98bn. Sales of “guilt-free” products, such as diet carbonated drinks and baked crisps, now account 45 per cent of revenues, PepsiCo said. Indra Nooyi, chief executive, said the group had managed to increase revenues “despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America”. PepsiCo has been adding new products to reduce its reliance on its namesake Pepsi brand, which makes up about 12 per cent of total sales. In the past year it has introduced drinks such as probiotic versions of its Tropicana juices and has acquired Kevita, a maker of kombucha, the fermented tea drink, and other beverages. Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft-drink maker, on Tuesday reported that first-quarter sales had dropped 11 per cent to $9.1bn as it restructures its business. The Atlanta-based company has been selling off chunks of its bottling divisions to diversify away from fizzy drinks. James Quincey will take up the chief executive role at Coca-Cola in May to lead a turnround strategy, replacing Muhtar Kent. Mr Quincey said on Tuesday that the group would axe 1,200 jobs as it looks to cut costs by $800m a year. Mr Quincey, who has worked at Coca-Cola for two decades, is looking to recast the company, pledging to use ingredients with less sugar, to become “bigger than the Coca-Cola brand”. Analysts at Wells Fargo warned that challenges would “remain very strong for the near-term” but said the company was “doing the right things” to address them. Coca-Cola reported adjusted earnings of 43 cents a share in the first three months of the year. It said structural changes accounted for 10 per cent of the fall in revenues. Mr Kent said the results were “in line with our plan” and had been “adversely impacted” by Easter falling earlier this year. “We continue to execute against the long-term strategic transformation plan for the company,” he said. PepsiCo this month drew ire on social media for an advertisement depicting model Kendall Jenner joining a demonstration and offering a police officer a can of Pepsi. The company axed the ad and apologised after being condemned for trivialising civil protests. PepsiCo shares fell about 1 per cent in morning trading as lower than forecast profit margins, particularly in emerging markets where higher commodity prices have pressured the bottom line, weighed on investor sentiment.

Sales climbed 1.6 per cent to $12.05bn, matching Wall Street expectations.The results came “despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America”, said chief executive Indra Nooyi.PepsiCo has been diversifying its products to meet demands from more health-conscious consumers, reducing its reliance on its namesake Pepsi brand, which accounts for about 12 per cent of total sales.

54;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-04-07T21:02:25Z;Week in Review, April 8;"Pepsi pulls ad; Unilever, Volkswagen, WS Atkins, and 21st Century Fox in the news";"A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Pepsi advert fails to click with the digital generationPepsi once declared itself “the choice of a new generation”. But the fizzy drink brand’s latest advertisement fell flat with the social media generation. They panned its depiction of reality TV star and model Kendall Jenner handing a Pepsi to a police officer at a protest, writes Shannon Bond.The commercial featured Ms Jenner abandoning a photo shoot to join a crowd of passing marchers, who all happened to be attractive and multicultural young people toting inoffensive signs reading “Peace” and “Join the conversation”. Music is played, dance moves are executed, flirtatious smiles are exchanged. It culminates in Ms Jenner offering the policeman a can of Pepsi, which he accepts to the cheers of the crowd.As soon as the ad appeared online on Tuesday, the condemnation began. Pepsi was trivialising concerns over police violence, appropriating imagery from the Black Lives Matter movement, and co-opting the nature of protests to sell soda, critics said.“If I had carried Pepsi, I guess I never would’ve gotten arrested. Who knew?” tweeted DeRay Mckesson, a prominent Black Lives Matter activist.The vagueness of what exactly Ms Jenner and her companions were protesting about drew mockery from Stephen Colbert, the host of CBS’s Late Show. “I’m guessing it’s a protest for Attractive Lives Matter,” he quipped.The backlash forced Pepsi to pull the ad less than 24 hours after first posting it online and issue an apology to the public and Ms Jenner.“Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding,” the company said. “Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologise. We did not intend to make light of any serious issue.”Pepsi’s effort is just the latest instance of the risks brands take when they try to flaunt their corporate values.“These brands and marketing teams are in this constant effort to be edgy and relevant,” said Chris Allieri, founder of Mulberry & Astor, a marketing consultancy. “Sometimes they push the envelope too far.”Car legend Piëch to sell down his stake in PorscheFerdinand Piëch, a visionary who turned Volkswagen into the world’s largest carmaker, agreed to sell most of his stake in the company this week, nearly two years after he was ousted as chairman, writes Patrick McGee.Mr Piëch, who turns 80 this month, agreed to sell a 14.7 per cent stake in Porsche SE, the family-controlled company that holds 52 per cent of the VW group.He retains a small, undisclosed stake and will remain on Porsche SE’s supervisory board for the time being.The share sale reflects Mr Piëch’s growing isolation from the rest of the Porsche-Piëch clan, after he accused his cousins — to internal investigators and German prosecutors — of having knowledge of the VW emissions cheating scandal half a year before it emerged in September 2015.VW’s supervisory board “emphatically” repudiated the claims in February, threatening legal action against him.The abrupt downfall of Mr Piëch two years ago and this week’s share sale are remarkable considering the all-pervading influence the man once had.He is the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, who founded VW, and the son of Anton Piëch, the carmaker’s chairman after the second world war.As the group’s top executive from 1993 to 2002, he acquired the upmarket marques Bugatti, Bentley and Lamborghini.Then, as chairman, he acquired Porsche and managed to integrate the two
legacy carmakers of his grandfather into one behemoth.Unilever reveals rejig after takeover attempt by KraftUnilever’s hotly awaited plan to make itself less vulnerable to the type of unwelcome takeover attempted by Kraft Heinz, was received by investors on Thursday as going far enough to make a difference, without being too radical, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.“They’ve been listening,” said one top 20 investor in the world’s third-biggest consumer products group, after Nestlé and Procter & Gamble. “And they’ve gone beyond the bare minimum, by including a few interesting tit-bits.”The interesting tit-bit was the decision to review the Anglo-Dutch group’s dual structure involving London and Amsterdam listings. Combining the company’s shares into one legal entity, would give Unilever the potential to make big acquisitions in the future, the most frequently suggested by bankers being Colgate-Palmolive or Reckitt Benckiser.As Graeme Pitkethly, finance director, said the dual legal structure “can add complexity to structural portfolio change, be that an acquisition, a disposal or a demerger”.The “bare minimum” were measures to simplify Unilever’s businesses and sharpen up its profitability.The declining margarine and spreads business will be sold — analysts estimate it could fetch between €6bn-€8bn.Cost savings will rise to €6bn by 2019, up from €4bn previously, with two-thirds of the savings reinvested in its brands, which include Dove soap and Surf detergent.The savings will help boost operating profit margins by a new target of 20 per cent by 2020, up from 16.4 per cent.Unilever is to launch a €5bn share buyback this year and lift its dividend by 12 per cent, reflecting a more aggressive policy towards borrowings.Moody’s, the rating agency, said on Friday that Unilever’s decision to increase net debt to 2 times earnings before interest, tax and depreciation — against a sector average of 1.6 times — would not weaken its A1 credit rating.● Lex: Unilever — divided we standFox probe broadens to look at settlements with victimsFederal prosecutors in the US are investigating Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News Channel over whether a settlement with a victim of alleged sexual harassment was concealed from investors in 21st Century Fox, the network’s parent company, according to two people briefed on the probe, writes Matthew Garrahan.The investigation, which is also examining whether other settlements were concealed, is taking place amid a flurry of new allegations and lawsuits against Fox News and its executives.Julie Roginsky, a Fox News contributor and political consultant, sued the network this week, in a lawsuit that named Bill Shine, the channel’s co-president, as one of three defendants alongside Fox News itself and Roger Ailes, its former chairman.Ms Roginsky claimed the company ignored her complaints of harassment at the hands of Mr Ailes and that Mr Shine “retaliated” against her.Dianne Brandi, the channel’s top legal officer, has been drawn into another lawsuit. Three black employees have alleged racial discrimination by Judith Slater, Fox’s long-time controller. Ms Slater was fired last month by Fox News, which said it had taken “prompt and effective remedial action”. However, one of the plaintiffs alleged she told Ms Brandi in 2014 about mistreatment by Ms Slater, but nothing was done.Bill O’Reilly, presenter of The O’Reilly Factor, was the subject of a weekend New York Times report alleging $13m of pay-offs to silence women who had complained he sexually harassed them.● News: Brussels clears 21st Century Fox takeover of SkyCanada’s SNC-Lavalin in £2bn bid for WS AtkinsSNC-Lavalin sought to take advantage of the weakened pound this week with a £2.08bn takeover bid for the UK design consultancy WS Atkins, writes Michael Pooler.The Montreal-based engineering and construction group made an all-cash offer of £20.80 a share, which Atkins’ board this week said it would be prepared to accept, subject to agreement on other terms and conditions.A deal would represent a further step towards consolidation in the global engineering consultancy sector and help SNC Lavalin diversify away from the oil and gas sector, which has been hit hard by lower prices.Founded in 1938, Atkins generates more than half of its revenues in the UK and Europe.The FTSE 250 company is one of the main contractors on the High Speed 2 rail project in the UK, and is involved in a host of other large British infrastructure schemes including the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant and the Thames Tideway tunnel.For its part, SNC-Lavalin has a market capitalisation of around C$8bn and more than half of its C$8.5bn in annual revenues come from North America. Its offer represented a 35 per cent premium to Atkins’ undisturbed closing price last week.Some City analysts suggested SNC’s approach could spark interest from other prospective buyers, as Atkins’ stock price has lagged behind peers since the beginning of 2016. But Citi pointed out that Atkins’ sizeable pension liabilities could be a deterrent.● Lex: SNC-Lavalin/Atkins — Canuck the dots"
55;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-04-05T19:50:40Z;Pepsi withdraws Kendall Jenner ad after social media backlash;Commercial condemned for trivialising protests over police killings of black people;Pepsi was the latest brand to wade into politically charged territory, as the fizzy drinks maker was forced to apologise for an advertisement that depicted Kendall Jenner, the reality television star and model, joining a protest and offering a can of Pepsi to a police officer.The ad, which Pepsi posted on YouTube on Tuesday, quickly drew widespread condemnation on social media from critics who said it trivialised Black Lives Matter protests over police killings of black people.“Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologise. We did not intend to make light of any serious issue,” the company said. “We are removing the content and halting any further rollout. We also apologise for putting Kendall Jenner in this position.”The commercial, which Pepsi had described as “a short film about the moments when we decide to let go, choose to act, follow our passion and nothing holds us back”, was derided for being tone-deaf to the serious nature of social justice protests.The latest controversy comes as companies are under intense scrutiny over everything from what goes into their products and how they treat their employees to which TV programmes and websites receive their advertising dollars and what values they embrace in their marketing messages.Consumer goods makers in particular are walking a fine line between reaching a broad base of customers across an increasingly divided political spectrum and responding to calls from younger consumers to publicly embrace values of inclusion and diversity.“Great advertising is timely, relevant and at times, even provocative. But when your ad sparks mass protest and calls for boycotts, you’ve clearly missed the mark,” said Chris Allieri, founder of Mulberry & Astor, a marketing and branding consultancy. “In an effort to appear relevant to consumers, especially millennial consumers, they waded into a firestorm they could’ve avoided.”Pepsi, whose brands also include Mountain Dew, Lay’s crisps and Quaker oatmeal, is one of the world’s biggest marketers, spending $2.5bn on advertising in 2016.Touching on political themes can be a risky move for companies trying to appeal to a national audience. Budweiser found itself drawn into a debate earlier this year when it debuted its latest Super Bowl ad, which depicted the immigrant experience of the beer maker’s founder.The ad came amid President Donald Trump’s clampdown on immigration, and while Budweiser said it did not intend to comment on current events, the commercial was interpreted by many viewers as a political statement.The fact that Pepsi posted and removed its latest ad from the internet in less than 24 hours highlights the speed at which companies are reacting to feedback from the public. Social media has given consumers and activists a platform to pressure corporations by publicly shaming and calling for boycotts of brands they see as supporting values different from their own.This has sparked campaigns such as #deleteUber, which led to the car hailing app’s chief executive stepping down from Mr Trump’s business advisory group, and a rightwing boycott of Kellogg’s after the cereal maker pulled its advertising from Breitbart, the far right news site.

Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologise. We did not intend to make light of any serious issue. We are removing the content and halting any further rollout.

The video has already been removed from YouTube.The firestorm hasn’t done much to dim the share price of Pepsi parent PepsiCo, which was trading up 0.2 per cent in midday trading.Despite the controversy, Pepsi may have gotten just what it wanted with the short-lived ad, according to Mary Harding, managing director at communications agency Tangerine: “It’s ticked all the boxes in terms of raising awareness and ironically did bring people together as millennials flocked to social media to discuss it. Ultimately there’s no doubt it’ll drive sales overall for the brand.”
57;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-02-24T18:58:38Z;Unilever defends rebuff of Kraft Heinz deal;Consumer industry ponders which group might be next on the menu for 3G;"Unilever said on Friday that Kraft Heinz’s aborted $143bn bid had been a “trigger” for it to work harder and faster on delivering better returns to investors.It was the Anglo-Dutch group’s first public remarks since Kraft Heinz — backed by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital — revealed its approach a week ago.Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever finance director, told attendees at Cagny, the consumer industry’s annual gathering, in Florida: “It has certainly been a trigger for Unilever and we will not waste it. It showed us the challenge to unlock value quicker in the shorter term.”He blamed Unilever’s vulnerability as a takeover target on poor communication of its midterm plans and slow growth in emerging markets, which had contributed to its share price underperformance.Mr Pitkethly defended Unilever’s rapid rejection of the Kraft Heinz approach by highlighting the difference in business strategies between the two groups.Unilever would generate higher returns “indefinitely” and “sustainably” over the long term, while Kraft Heinz’s depended on “repeated portfolio change”, he said, in a reference to 3G’s serial dealmaking.Mr Pitkethly was tight-lipped on the details of a sweeping business review to boost profits that Unilever announced on Wednesday. But he indicated that the company would be sharper on driving down costs. “It’s clear we can go harder and deeper,” he said. The outcome of the review is expected in April.The big question dominating — but not directly addressed — at the conference was which company would be next on the menu for 3G.This made Kraft Heinz all too present — despite its absence at Cagny — though some delegates said they had spotted Alexandre Behring, Kraft Heinz chairman and 3G partner. It was Mr Behring who first mooted the idea of a deal for Unilever with its chief executive Paul Polman, last month.“They have a list of targets, A, B, C,” said one person who knows 3G well. “If A doesn’t work out, they’ll move quickly on to B.”Some of the industry’s biggest names — Mondelez International, Danone, Kellogg’s, General Mills and Procter & Gamble — showcased their strategies on cost-cutting, growth and ecommerce at the conference.We’ve been . . . rumoured to be a takeover target and I’ve lived with that for past 20 years and expect it to be [that way] for next 20 yearsMany of these sounded like “a defence against a possible bid”, said one analyst.Kraft Heinz’s approach for Unilever — which makes 60 per cent of its sales in home and personal care products such as Surf laundry and Sunsilk shampoo — has broadened considerably the spectrum of the food group’s potential targets.Cedric Besnard, analyst at Citigroup, said that food, home and personal care companies “with [an operating profit] margin below 20 per cent and a market cap below $140bn — and with no controlling shareholder — could feel the urgency to work on their portfolio and/or cost structure to avoid an unsolicited offer”.Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein, said US companies such as Mondelez and General Mills still seemed the most logical targets for Kraft Heinz as “Europe may be resistant politically to a takeover at least in this environment”.PepsiCo could not be ruled out, she said, given the potential to pass on the beverage business to Anheuser-Busch InBev, in which some of the 3G principals are shareholders, while retaining the Frito-Lay snacks business.Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and chief executive of Mondelez, attempted to bat away the attention, insisting that “the macro environment was hanging over a lot of presentations. I’m hopeful we distinguished ourselves with great hope and optimism”.Emmanuel Faber, chief executive of Danone, the French dairy and nutrition company, was asked whether he felt vulnerable, given the company’s recent underperformance. “We’ve been . . . rumoured to be a takeover target and I’ve lived with that for past 20 years and expect it to be [that way] for next 20 years,” he said.Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive — which leads consumer companies in terms of profit margins — said he “doesn’t want to be distracted by chatter”. Some Unilever investors have said privately they would like it to acquire some of the US company’s businesses, funded by disposals in its food units that include Flora margarine and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.“When you look at the bath and shower market shares of both companies, or oral care, body care, facial care, shampoos — there’s a lot of synergies available from putting those two businesses together,” said one investor who did not wish to be named.The industry’s sluggish growth and 3G’s voracious appetite are likely to spur deals between companies to forestall a 3G approach.Kevin Dreyer, co-chief investment officer at Gabelli, which has $40bn assets under management, said: “The industry isn’t in a steady state right now. The cost of capital is very low. We’re going to see consolidation in both [household products and food]. 3G is clearly looking for a deal, but others could look for M&A as a defensive move.”But fresh from Kraft’s unwanted advances, Mr Pitkethly said: “It’s certainly been a busy old week. When Paul [Polman] and I announced earnings [in January] we said we expected volatility — but certainly didn’t expect a bid for the company.”———————-Further coverage on Kraft Heinz’s approach for UnileverRobert Armstrong: Hyena capitalism receives a swift kick from the Unilever giraffe

That beat analysts’ estimates of a 9.2 per cent rise to $1.16.PepsiCo’s full-year sales were little changed at $62.8bn, while earnings per share rose 19 per cent to $4.36. Net income for the year to December 31 was 16 per cent higher at $6.4bn.Like rival Coca-Cola, PepsiCo has benefited from steady demand at home, where it has been investing in reformulating products and developing new ones as consumers increasingly opt for healthier snacks, using gains from a broad cost-cutting programme to help pay for it.In the past year it has introduced products such as probiotic versions of its Tropicana juices and has acquired Kevita — a maker of fermented tea drink kombucha and other beverages.Its focus on healthier options has reduced its reliance on its namesake Pepsi brand, which accounts for 12 per cent of total sales, and comes as the Beverage Marketing Report estimates that volume sales of bottled water in the US will overtake that of carbonated drinks this year.Additionally, like other multinationals, PepsiCo is facing considerable uncertainty at home and abroad. In the US there is political turmoil and the prospect of tax reform, while abroad the impact of Brexit on the UK and continental Europe’s consumers is an unknown.It also faces challenges in key emerging markets. In Argentina, the year-old government is battling to restore economic stability and reduce inflation. In India, another important market, sales have suffered amid the government’s decision to scrap more than 80 per cent of its cash in circulation — a development that has also affected rivals such as Mondelez.These uncertainties prompted the maker of Frito-Lay snacks and Naked Juice smoothies to give cautious guidance for this year, saying it expects adjusted earnings of $5.09 this year, short of the $5.15 forecast by analysts, on an organic sales increase of “at least” 3 per cent.Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, said: “We’ve not seen any [consumer] pull back since the [US] election, our caution is more around volatility than around expectations of negativity. There are so many balls in the air, so to speak, in terms of important policy questions, so we’re erring on the side of caution.”Shares fell 0.3 per cent to $106.59 in afternoon trading in New York.

India, another important market, also faced strains amid the government’s decision to scrap more than four-fifths of its cash in circulation – a development that has also affected rivals such as Mondelez.The New York-based company said it expects adjusted earnings of $5.09 this year, short of the $5.15 that analysts expected.“Looking ahead to 2017, we expect solid financial performance despite anticipated continued macroeconomic challenges,” said chief executive Indra Nooyi.The shares were little changed in pre-market trading.
60;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2017-02-03T13:14:48Z;Brenda Barnes, consumer products executive, 1953-2017;Leader who found an equilibrium between boardroom and children;When Brenda Barnes resigned in 1997 as head of Pepsi-Cola for North America, little did she know it would reignite a fierce debate around work-life balance.Having shattered the glass ceiling to become one of the world’s most powerful businesswomen, by opting to focus on her three children she seemed to puncture something else instead — the idea that women could “have it all”.For Barnes, who has died aged 63, the decision had been purely personal. Nor were her following seven years restricted to the kitchen and the touchline of a school soccer pitch. She sat on boards including those of The New York Times and Sears, taught at Northwestern University and served as interim president of Starwood Hotels.Yet her resignation lingered. “My moment of fame in life was quitting my job . . . It’s not exactly what I aspired to,” she quipped at a speaking engagement at Stanford University in 2009.Then, in 2004, Barnes hit the financial and feminist headlines again — by snagging a top post at Sara Lee, where she was soon elevated to chief executive.Her return to the highest echelons of corporate America, once her offspring were older, suggested that perhaps women could indeed have it all — just not all at once. Reflecting on her experience, she established “returnships” for women at the company.Brenda Jo Czajka was born on November 11 1953 in Chicago, the third of seven daughters of a pipe fitter, who along with her mother shaped her strong work ethic. Her first job was sorting mail on the night shift at a post office — grunt work that she credited with giving her pointers in bringing dignity and an “element of fun” to a role.Graduating with a degree in economics from Illinois’ Augustana College, whose board she later chaired, Barnes joined Wilson Sporting Goods in 1976, then part of PepsiCo’s empire, while earning an MBA from Loyola University Chicago.In 1980 she moved to the parent soft drinks company and began to climb the ranks. In the same year she married colleague Randy Barnes, divorcing amicably after 26 years.At Sara Lee, Barnes set about selling off 40 per cent of the bakery-to-bras consumer group and battled to meet a self-imposed target of raising profit margins to 12 per cent from 8 per cent. Jon Harris, a friend who worked for her both there and at PepsiCo before joining ConAgra, says she advised him it was good “to be tough, as you owe it to shareholders, but it’s never an excuse to be mean. That was Brenda to a T.”Shedding many international and other operations enabled the company, renamed Hillshire Brands, to be acquired in the end by Tyson Foods.All the while, she was unafraid to let loose. In his eulogy for Barnes, Jim Nolan, another PepsiCo colleague who is now at Bimbo Bakeries USA, describes a work celebration with spouses. Leading the conga dance, “Brenda made a sharp turn and all of us in our cocktail attire, just like lemmings . . . followed her right into the pool . . . and then right out the other side.” He adds: “I lost a watch that night. But it didn’t matter — we would have followed her anywhere.”While her colleagues held her in high regard, she found tough love among some analysts — one of whom questioned her ability to lead a multinational after being a mum for several years. “I stayed calm didn’t throw anything at him, though I felt like it,” she told Stanford students, adding that mothers run much of society, from which they draw crucial experience. “I learnt I have to have a thick skin [or] else it gets in the way, and there’s too much to get done.”In 2010 she suffered a stroke, forcing her to step down from Sara Lee. Barnes, who succumbed last month to another stroke, is survived by her children and Sal Barrutia, her partner of eight years.During her career, the advance of technology came to offer women a wider range of ways to combine work and family. Bigger numbers of male executives are also seeking a form of work-life balance that suits them.Still, “if anything, the Brenda Barnes story speaks to how few role models we have”, says Samantha Ettus, an author and speaker on women and the workplace. “If there were thousands of Fortune 1,000 current and former female CEOs, then one woman’s story wouldn’t be used as an example for an entire gender. Because we have ridiculously few women CEOs, each woman’s story takes on too much weight.”Barnes herself never sought to be a role model. It was all about being good at her job, trying to make a success of parenthood too, and juggling those priorities accordingly — whether hour by hour or year by year.Lindsay Whipp
61;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-12-14T15:02:03Z;Trump’s business policy forum adds Pepsi, Uber, Tesla executives;;As his whirlwind courtship of the US business community continues, US President-elect Donald Trump has added three more prominent corporate executives to a forum to advise him on economic policy and job creation and productivity.On Wednesday morning, Mr Trump said that Uber co-founder and chief executive Travis Kalanick, SpaceX and Tesla chief executive and chairman Elon Musk and PepsiCo chairman and chief executive Indra Nooyi would join the previously announced 16 members of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum.The forum is chaired by Blackstone chairman and chief executive Stephen Schwarzman. Previously announced members include General Motors’ Mary Barra, JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, BlackRock’s Larry Fink and Walt Disney’s Bob Iger, among others.“America has the most innovative and vibrant companies in the world, and the pioneering CEOs joining this forum today are at the top of their fields,” Mr Trump said in a statement.His surprise election victory last month has brought to the American business community optimism about possible infrastructure spending and corporate tax cuts on one hand, and on the other concerns that his administration may take an overly protectionist stance on trade.Mr Trump is scheduled to meet with a number of top Silicon Valley executives at Trump Tower in New York City on Wednesday.
62;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-11-17T17:35:18Z;Trump supporters call for Pepsi boycott;Food and drink group hit by political backlash after CEO’s comments were misquoted;PepsiCo, the food and beverages group, is facing a boycott of its products by supporters of US president-elect Donald Trump, after rightwing political websites misrepresented comments by its chief executive.A number of sites, including Truthfeed and The Conservative Treehouse, directly quoted Indra Nooyi as telling Mr Trump’s supporters to “take their business elsewhere” — a remark she did not make.Ms Nooyi had been interviewed at a New York Times Dealbook event last week where she said that “all” her staff were “mourning” and “crying” following Mr Trump’s election victory, and she had felt it necessary to reassure some who were concerned about their safety.In response to the first election question put to her, she had congratulated Mr Trump on his victory and said: “We will all come together in a unified country. The process of democracy happened and we have to let life go on.”Nevertheless, some supporters of Mr Trump became incensed about Ms Nooyi’s remarks, particularly those about women, which were interpreted as a criticism of the president-elect’s behaviour. They called on other supporters to boycott Pepsi’s brands, and to spread the word via the Twitter messaging platform using the hashtag #boycottpepsi.PepsiCo has since acknowledged that Ms Nooyi “misspoke” at one point by saying that “all” employees were crying and mourning, but declined to comment further.It is not alone in being caught in a divergent consumer backlash following the election.New Balance, which makes a significant proportion of its shoes in the US, sparked protests when chief executive Matt LeBretton told the Wall Street Journal that he felt “things were going to move in the right direction” with a Trump victory.Some owners of New Balance trainers reportedly went as far as burning their shoes in response. But a Trump supporting website claimed New Balance should become the “official shoes of white people”.New Balance said in a statement that its CEO’s comments had been taken out of context and that it “does not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form”, adding that it had supported the trade positions of both Mr Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Food delivery company GrubHub was also targeted after its CEO sent a letter to staff explaining that comments on immigrants made by Mr Trump during his campaign would have no place in his company and anyone against inclusiveness should resign. However, some interpreted his comments as meaning anyone who voted for Mr Trump should quit — triggering a call to boycott the company.Mr Trump’s opponents have called for consumer boycotts, as well. In protest at Ivanka Trump’s decision to stand by her father through his campaign, some women shoppers said they would boycott retailers such as Amazon and Nordstrom unless they removed Trump brands from their shelves.
63;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-11-06T12:46:06Z;Brexit blamed for price rises on crisps and frozen food;Walkers, Birdseye seek to raise prices or shrink package sizes;"British consumers will soon be paying more for a host of well-known brands, as the owners of Walkers crisps and Birds Eye frozen foods are set to follow in Marmite’s lead and raise prices in the wake of the Brexit vote.Walkers is increasing in the price of its crisps by 10 per cent in response to “fluctuating foreign exchange rates”, which have seen the value of sterling fall in the wake of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.The Leicester-based group, which is owned by the US-based foods conglomerate PepsiCo, said a standard pack will rise from 50p to 55p and a grab bag from 75p to 80p.The company has come under attack from consumer groups that argue the changes could not be justified as the savoury snack is made from British-grown potatoes and produced in the UK.Marmite owner Unilever was criticised on similar grounds. That dispute briefly led UK supermarket Tesco to remove the salty spread and other Unilever products out of its online store.But Walkers said the rising cost of importing items such as seasonings, frying oil and packaging film necessitated a price rise.“Fluctuating foreign exchange rates, supply pressure on key ingredients and the weakened value of the pound are impacting the import cost of some of our materials and affecting the price of material costs based on commodities that are traded in foreign currencies,” said a company spokesperson.Birds Eye, the makers of fish fingers and chicken nuggets, said it is considering price rises of up to 12 per cent. It is discussing plans with supermarkets to raise the price of popular products, such as frozen peas; or shrink pack sizes, such as reducing the numbers of fish fingers in a pack from 12 to 10.“Many of our raw materials are priced in dollars and the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum has meant that our costs in sterling have risen,” said a spokesperson for Birds Eye, which is owned by US group Nomad Foods.“Our first priority is always to the people who buy our brands and we are working to try and absorb these costs as much as possible.”"
64;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-10-17T07:54:26Z;PepsiCo launches multibillion-dollar health drive;US food and drink group to reduce sugar, salt and fat as demand for healthier options rises;PepsiCo is to spend billions of dollars to develop drinks and snacks and reformulate existing ones with lower sugar, salt and fat content, as consumers demand healthier options and regulatory pressure intensifies amid an obesity epidemic.The maker of Mountain Dew and Gatorade has been one of the earlier movers in the industry to offer products with reduced levels of unhealthy ingredients — PepsiCo claims a packet of its crisps now contains less salt than a slice of white bread. However, its new 10-year plan makes clear it believes it still has a long way to go.Shifting eating habits, including a sharp drop in consumption of fizzy drinks such as Pepsi, have forced radical change on the industry. But those shifts have yet to be reflected in record obesity levels, which stand at 36.5 per cent overall in the US.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chairman, told the Financial Times that the plan to make its products healthier was important for the company’s growth.But on the subject of obesity, she said consumers’ lifestyles have changed significantly, with many people being more sedentary not least because more time is spent in front of computers. She said PepsiCo’s contribution was to produce healthier snacks that still tasted good.“Even before people were talking about obesity, we saw consumer trends shifting and realised we couldn’t keep growing the top line” without making radical change, Ms Nooyi said. “These goals are related to growing the top line.”She added: “Society has to change its habits. We can’t do much to [alter] sedentary lifestyles, but we can provide consumers with great-tasting products, low in salt, sugar and fat. In the past we had to have a taste trade-off. But we’re breaking that trade-off.”PepsiCo’s plan for its foods and drinks is part of broader targets set by the maker of Sabra hummus and Naked juices, based on guidelines from the World Health Organisation, which last week backed using taxes on fizzy drinks to reduce sugar consumption. Initiatives include efforts to reduce its environmental impact, water consumption and materials used in packaging by 2025.PepsiCo will cut the number of calories from added sugar per 12oz serving to less than 100 in “at least” two-thirds of its global drinks portfolio. Nearly 40 per cent of its drinks in its 10 biggest markets, which account for 80 per cent of its revenues, already meet this goal.More than three-quarters of its food products globally will contain 1.1g or less of saturated fat per 100 calories, while the same proportion of its snacks worldwide will contain 1.3mg or less of salt per calorie. About half of its global food products meet those targets now.Rivals such as Coca-Cola and Mondelez International have been diversifying their portfolios away from unhealthy food and beverages.Coca-Cola aims to offer low or no-calorie drinks in all of the 200-plus markets it operates in by 2020, and has so far reached that goal in 191 of them, but it does not have specific sugar, salt and fat reduction targets. Mondelez aims to have half of its snack offerings defined as “well being”, an ambiguous term, by 2020 and to reduce saturated fat and sodium by 10 per cent in its products. Its sugar-reduction target has not been made public.Prof Kelly Brownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, said efforts to make the food supply more healthy are welcome, but it also needs to asked whether companies are doing enough and what they are marketing most aggressively.“Companies are making changes. Are they trying to do it to help public health? I think not, I just don’t think they want to miss the segment of the population that eats those foods. But at same time they are pushing hard on unhealthy products,” he said.PepsiCo did not say exactly how much it planned to invest to reach its goals. However, Dr Mehmood Khan, chief scientific officer, said the company had doubled research and development spending in the past five years and was “committed to sustaining investment”, adding that companies cannot cost-cut their way to increasing sales. PepsiCo’s R&D budget in 2015 was $754m.Dr Khan said the broader commitments that PepsiCo had made in the past to cut energy consumption, use water more efficiently and reduce waste had generated $600m in savings. The new 10-year plan includes replenishing all the water it uses in “high risk areas” to the same watershed, as well as further initiatives to cut energy use and waste.
65;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-09-29T15:30:15Z;Pepsi raises guidance after beating earnings expectations;Group reports strong demand for Naked juices and Sabra hummus;"PepsiCo beat earnings expectations in its third quarter and raised its guidance for the full year as it benefited from demand for its Naked Juice and Sabra hummus brands at home.The company, which is in the middle of a five-year $5bn cost-reduction programme, said revenue dropped 1.9 per cent to $16bn but increased 4.2 per cent after excluding the impact of the strong dollar and other items.Earnings almost quadrupled to $1.40 a share, a year after the company took a hit for deconsolidating its Venezuela operations amid the country’s economic and political crisis. Stripping out that bounce and foreign exchange fluctuations, earnings per share rose 7 per cent.Pepsi now expects EPS, adjusted for extraordinary items, to rise 10 per cent instead of 9 per cent for the full year, to $4.78, in part as it expects a smaller currency impact and also as it benefits from higher demand for its snacks and drinks.Shares gained as much as 2.8 per cent in pre-market trading in New York and were up 1 per cent at $108.42 in early trading.As consumers globally increasingly opt for healthier snacking, and regulatory pressures to cut consumption of salt and sugar intensify, Pepsi and rivals have been reformulating products. Pepsi is adding probiotics to its juice offerings at its Tropicana brand amid a slowdown in demand for orange juice in particular, and is introducing organic Gatorade.Its Sabra brand of hummus, salsa and guacamole has grown to $800m in retail revenues.Revenue at Pepsi’s North American Frito-Lay and beverages divisions both rose 3 per cent, although those from its Quaker business dropped 2 per cent.The company said it had spent more on marketing and advertising but its increasing use of technology to improve efficiency had improved productivity and reduced overall costs.“We’re playing the long game,” Indra Nooyi, chairman and chief executive, said. “We want to make sure we go where consumers are going,” added that she was “cautiously optimistic” about the group’s prospects in emerging markets.“Many emerging markets showed signs of improvement; whether it will continue I don’t know,” she said, citing Russia, south-east Asian countries and China.“In Latin America . . . there’s no question Argentina has had a troubled year and Brazil is having its share of troubles. But economies seem to be holding up and more importantly [so is] our business.”"
66;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-09-29T11:13:13Z;Pepsi raises forecast as North America sales sparkle;;PepsiCo continues to put the fizz back into its earnings.The world’s largest snack maker and second-largest beverage company lifted its full-year earnings outlook for a second time this year and delivered third quarter results that topped expectations, helped by its aggressive cost cutting drive and rising sales for its snacks and soft drinks in the all important North American market.Shares in the company jumped 2.4 per cent in pre-market trading.The maker of Lay’s potato chips, Tropicana juice and Pepsi-Cola said it now expected core earnings per share this year to come in at $4.78 compared to the forecast of $4.71 it gave in July.“Our product portfolio, geographic mix and capability centers are enabling us to deliver balanced revenue and productivity,” said Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chairman and chief executive.For the third quarter, Pepsi was boosted by businesses in North America, which has benefitted from the recovery in US consumer spending and confidence. Lower commodity prices and the company’s ongoing cost cutting drive have also helped profitability.For the three months to September 3, net revenue dipped 1.9 per cent to $16bn as the strong dollar took a bite out of the group’s overseas sales. Still this was ahead of the $15.8bn the market was expecting.Net income surged nearly three-fold to $1.9bn. The figure is flattered by a large writedown Pepsi had to take on its Venezuelan business last year, which was not repeated this year. Core earnings came in at $1.40 a share for the period, compared to the $1.32 a share forecast.
67;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;UK businesses unite to fight sugar tax;Tax on sugary soft drinks will do little to tackle obesity, they say;A coalition of UK businesses — from vending machine operators to publicans and beet farmers — has formed to warn that a tax on sugary soft drinks, announced in the budget, threatens thousands of jobs and will do little to tackle obesity.Representing 400,000 people across several sectors, the group has launched a “face the facts, can the tax” campaign. It says the levy would merely “push up prices for those who can least afford it”, and create opportunities for import fraud and tax avoidance.“We know from the evidence around the world where they’ve tried a tax that it will not make a difference to obesity,” said Gavin Partington, director-general of the British Soft Drinks Association which part funds the campaign.“At a time of economic uncertainty,” he added, “the government needs to be supporting these businesses and working with industry to support actions that are already making a difference, such as reformulation, smaller packs, and more marketing of the many no-sugar options now available.”The campaign, however, was: “a complete scandal and clearly cheap scaremongering from the soft drinks industry,” said Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of the Action on Sugar group.“In actual fact,” he added, “the sugar drinks tax will switch people to lower-sugar or artificially sweetened drinks which are cheaper to produce than sugar-sweetened drinks, meaning that, in reality, soft-drink companies will make more money.”The campaign comes as a report by Oxford Economics predicts that 4,000 jobs will be lost and £132m will be cut in output if the tax proceeds. The think-tank adds that calorie consumption “will drop by just five calories per person per day as a result of the tax”.Prof MacGregor said: “Sugar-sweetened drinks are the biggest contributor of sugar intake in the diets of children and teenagers and unless they are cut back there will be an increase in the levels of obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay, all of which are preventable and cost the NHS billions of pounds each year, unnecessarily. Soft-drink companies need to get serious in the interest of the UK consumers.”The Treasury said the aim of the tax was to encourage producers to use healthier ingredients to reduce the levels of added sugar in products consumed by children. “If they reformulate, they won’t have to pay,” it said.Companies have two years to adapt before the levy comes into force. “British children are currently consuming three times the recommended amount of sugar and health experts agree there is a specific problem with sugar-laden soft drinks,” the Treasury said.Peter Chema, chief executive of the Scottish Grocers Federation, said the measure “completely ignores the efforts taken by the soft-drinks industry to reformulate their products, promote low- or no-calorie alternatives and the commitment not to advertise high-sugar soft drinks to under-16s”.Jonathan Hart, of the Automatic Vending Association, said that further improvements in product labelling, and increasing awareness of nutrition issues in schools “will achieve results which are long-lasting and effective — unlike a sugar tax”.Paul Waterson, head of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association said that, in the wake of the tightening of drink-drive laws, soft drinks was one of only two growth categories in Scottish pubs and clubs.This article has been amended to remove the reference to five calories per person per day being the equivalent of a bite of an apple.
68;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-07-07T15:34:11Z;North American sales help PepsiCo beat expectations;Group looks to domestic market as growth in emerging markets slows;PepsiCo relied on home comforts as it beat market expectations for second-quarter earnings and raised its guidance for the year, joining the ranks of US multinationals looking inward amid slowing growth in emerging markets.The strong dollar continued to hurt revenues at the maker of Doritos, Mountain Dew and Naked Juice, falling 3 per cent in the three months to the end of June to $15.4bn but earnings rose 4 per cent to $1.38 a share.Pepsi said on Thursday its decision last year to stop consolidating its Venezuelan earnings because of the volatile currency cost 2.5 percentage points of revenue growth.However, cost cuts and a more efficient supply chain in its snacks business has helped counter the downward pressure as its North American business grows, particularly on the snacks side. Frito-Lay sales and the Quaker branded business both saw sales rise 3 per cent.PepsiCo expects full-year growth in earnings per share, excluding the negative impact from the dollar and Venezuela’s deconsolidation, of 9 per cent instead of an earlier 8 per cent forecast.After years of strong growth in emerging markets many US companies are finding that their home market is providing a solid basis for demand.These groups have been hit by slowing growth overseas and lower profits when they are translated back into dollars.They are stepping up efficiency to be able to spend on innovation and marketing as the global consumer becomes increasingly picky and vocal on social media, creating a fragmented market of niche foods and beverages.This has played out in Diet Pepsi. Amid concerns about the sweetener aspartame, the company decided to reformulate the drink to use another sweetener. While that appeased some consumers, fans of the drink could taste the difference and sales dropped sharply. The company recently reintroduced a version of Diet Pepsi using the original recipe in an attempt to keep both sets of customers.We continue to see great strength in our North American businesses. Internationally, we plan conservatively, assuming things are not going to go well [in terms of the] economic environment“We continue to see great strength in our North American businesses,” Pepsi’s chief financial officer Hugh Johnston said. “Internationally, we plan conservatively, assuming things are not going to go well [in terms of the] economic environment.”Mr Johnston said that he did not expect Britain’s vote to leave the EU to have a huge impact on Pepsi’s operations because the company sourced much of its ingredients in the UK, leaving limited trade with the rest of the EU. He said that the biggest impact would be if there was a slowdown in economic growth or a fall in disposable income.Pepsi’s earnings come amid a flurry of M&A activity in the sector, with Mondelez International making a bid for chocolate rival Hershey and Danone agreeing to buy WhiteWave for $12.5bn.Mr Johnston said that Pepsi’s focus would remain on small deals if the company were to make any.On the investor call, Indra Nooyi, chairman and chief executive for almost a decade, was asked about her plans given questions about her possible political ambitions. “Over the next several years I see myself running PepsiCo,” she said.
69;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-07-07T11:48:38Z;PepsiCo shares pop on higher profit forecast;;Heavy cost-cutting has helped PepsiCo offset the effects of a stronger dollar and deliver better-than-expected second quarter profits.The world’s largest snack maker and second-largest beverage company lifted its full-year earnings outlook on Thursday as it reported a 1 per cent rise in net income to $2bn for the quarter.The profit increase came despite the strong dollar, which took a bite out of the group’s overseas sales and contributed to the 3 per cent drop in revenue to $15.4bn.The maker of Lay’s potato chips, Tropicana juice and Pepsi-Cola said it now expects core earnings per share this year to come in at $4.71 compared to its previous forecast of $4.66.The better-than-expected results sent PepsiCo shares up nearly 2 per cent in pre-market trading and should provide a fillip to chief executive Indra Nooyi who has been working to shift the business towards healthier offerings and improve efficiency in the supply chain.“In what continues to be an incredibly volatile global macro environment, we are pleased with our results for the second quarter,” said Ms Nooyi.“While reported net revenue performance was negatively impacted by foreign exchange translation and the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, we delivered balanced volume growth and positive price/mix driven by relentless execution of our commercial agenda and leading to solid organic revenue growth. At the same time, our focus on driving greater efficiency throughout our operations contributed significantly to attractive margin expansion while we continued to invest in our business.”PepsiCo has been losing market share to chief drinks rival Coca-Cola for several years in the US and abroad. For the quarter, revenue at its all important North American Beverage division rose just 1 per cent, with price increases helping to offset the 1 per cent drop in organic sales volume. The division accounts for a third of group revenue and nearly 29 per cent of group operating profit.Snacks continue to outperform drinks however. Its North American snack business grew 3 per cent on a revenue basis while organic sales volume rose 2 per cent.

It follows hard on the heels of his decision to retire from the Argentine national team after losing last month’s final of the Copa America, his third successive final defeat with the national side since 2014.According to the ruling, Mr Messi “failed to declare to the Spanish tax authorities in his personal income tax statements in the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 the income obtained from the exploitation of his image rights”. The actions taken by Mr Messi and his father were part of a “strategy”, the court said.The footballer, who appeared in court last month, was accused of defrauding the tax authorities by using offshore accounts to conceal earnings in a trial that centred on the alleged unlawful activities of his father. But authorities said the Argentine player knew enough to also be charged in the case.The pair were accused of using companies in Belize and Uruguay to avoid paying taxes on €4.16m of income earned through the sale of the footballer’s image rights between 2007 and 2009. The income related to contracts with Banco Sabadell, Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter & Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company. Both men had denied any wrongdoing.Lack of knowledge . . . was no error and it cannot lead to the avoidance of responsibilityIn August 2013, father and son made a voluntary “corrective payment” of €5m — equal to the alleged unpaid tax plus interest. Mr Messi’s lawyers had argued that he had “never devoted a minute of his life to reading, studying or analysing” the contracts.The judges acknowledged this argument in Wednesday’s ruling: “[Mr Messi’s] line of defence has always been the same . . . he only played football, all the decisions were taken by the lawyers, and he never asked his father anything because he trusted him.”But the ruling also argued that Mr Messi had signed numerous papers relevant to the tax fraud over several years and concluded that his “lack of knowledge was the result of an earlier decision, more or less conscious, not to acquire it”.The judges added: “This was no error and it cannot lead to the avoidance of responsibility. You cannot err about something that you had no interest in knowing.”FC Barcelona continues to be at the disposal of Leo Messi and his family to support him in whatever action he decides to takeFC Barcelona gave both Mr Messi and his father their full support. “The club, in agreement with the government prosecution service, considers that the player, who has corrected his position with the Spanish tax office, is in no way criminally responsible with regards to the facts underlined in this case.“FC Barcelona continues to be at the disposal of Leo Messi and his family to support him in whatever action he decides to take in defence of his honesty and his legal interests.”Legal experts pointed out that the verdict was unlikely to have a direct impact on Mr Messi’s playing career.“In cases where the sentence is less than two years in prison, the judges can suspend the jail term provided there are no previous convictions and that the civil penalty has been paid,” said Javier Cremades, chairman of Cremades & Calvo-Sotelo, a Spanish law firm.That approach was taken in “99 per cent of cases” but Mr Cremades cautioned that judges in a recent high-profile fraud case involving a Spanish flamenco singer had decided to impose a jail term regardless.
71;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-07-06T11:30:09Z;Lionel Messi sentenced to 21 months in jail;;Lionel Messi, the Argentine footballer widely considered the best player in the world, has been sentenced to 21 months in jail for tax fraud by a provincial court in Barcelona, Spanish media has reported.According to El País, Mr Messi, who plays professionally for Barcelona, and his father Jorge Horacio Messi were given identical sentences after being accused of hiding €4.1m from Spanish tax authorities through a complex web of companies set up in tax havens.The paper said that judges normally suspend prison sentences that are less than two years when a suspect has no criminal record – though there are precedents to order immediate imprisonment.The two Messis were charged with using companies in Belize and Uruguay to avoid taxes on income earned through the sale of the footballer’s image rights between 2007-09. The income relates to contracts with Banco Sabadell, Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter & Gamble and the Kuwait Food Company.Although the trial focused on the activities of the elder Mr Messi, prosecutors alleged the Argentine striker knew enough about the arrangement to be charged. Mr Messi’s lawyers had argued he was ignorant of the complex financial dealings and was only focused on his on-pitch career.

He then served as Facebook’s chief technology officer for three years before leaving to found Quip in 2012, writes Tim Bradshaw in San Francisco.“Twitter is the fastest way to find out what’s happening, and beneath its simplicity lies a very sophisticated set of technology,” Mr Taylor said. “I hope to bring my knowledge and experiences to bear to help Jack [Dorsey, chief executive] and the board push Twitter and its services forward.”Mr Taylor is the fourth new director to join Twitter since April, as executive chairman Omid Kordestani shakes up the social media company’s boardroom.He joins UK internet entrepreneur Martha Lane Fox, Pepsi chief financial officer Hugh Johnston and Debra Lee, chief executive of BET, an African American cable channel and news site.“Bret brings to our board a great mind for consumer products and technologies that will be invaluable to the company as we execute our plans for 2016 and beyond,” said Mr Kordestani. “His skills also complement those of our other recent board additions, who bring expertise in finance, media, and entrepreneurship.”Facebook’s acquisition of Friendfeed was seen at the time as an attempt to fend off the rise of Twitter in real-time communications. Seven years later, Facebook has continued steady growth while Twitter has struggled to attract and retain new users. In recent months, Facebook has once again been pushing into territory traditionally dominated by Twitter, including a greater focus on news with its Instant Articles and live video broadcasting akin to Twitter’s Periscope app.Mr Taylor has more than 42,200 followers on Twitter, recently using the service to share his views on sports, software and Game of Thrones. When Twitter announced its acquisition of artificial intelligence start-up Magic Pony last month, he tweeted: “Would have been slightly cooler if it were an actual mystical horse, but an AI company is pretty cool, too.”

Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.Investors in easyJet will be hoping that traffic figures can provide a glimmer of hope after what has been a tumultuous week for the budget airline.Shares in easyJet fell by a fifth last week to reach a three-year low, after it warned that profits would be hit by Britain’s decision to leave the EU.It said that Brexit could cause further economic and consumer uncertainty, and investors also feared the threat to the airline’s membership of the single European aviation market, which allows airlines to travel freely to EU destinations without charge.EasyJet is drawing up plans to move its headquarters to continental Europe following Britain’s vote to leave the EU. No final decision has yet been taken, and any move would see easyJet set up a legal base rather than transfer its core functions overseas.The news dealt a further blow to easyJet, which has already been buffeted by a cocktail of factors in recent months. More than 1,000 flight cancellations were already expected in the third quarter owing to air traffic control strikes in France, severe weather and the runway and congestion issues at Gatwick airport in London, and the industry is still recovering from terror attacks around the globe which have reduced demand for flights.Traffic figures for May were positive, however, with the total number of passengers up 5.7 per cent to 6.9m, while the load factor, a key airline metric, slipped 0.1 percentage point to 91.5 per cent. Paul McCleanEarningsWalgreens Boots Q3 $1.14 ($1.02)Investors will be looking for even the smallest signs of recovery in Marks and Spencer’s clothing business when the high street stalwart posts its first-quarter trading update.In May, new M&S chief executive Steve Rowe unveiled a turnround strategy that involved a revamp of the retailer’s clothing range and a shift away from promotional pricing tactics — but warned that his plans to revive the UK retailer would hit profits in the short term.That guidance sent the company’s share price down sharply, a trend that only worsened after both Exane BNP Paribas and Jefferies downgraded M&S to “underperform”.M&S’s results have long been a tale of two businesses, with its food division popular among Britain’s middle-class shoppers, while “general merchandise” — clothes and homewares — has struggled.In May, the company reported an 18.5 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the 12 months to April. The retailer’s food division outperformed the market, with a 0.2 per cent uptick in like-for-like sales for the 12-month period, but its clothing arm continued to disappoint, with a 2.9 per cent drop in like-for-like sales for the year.Thursday’s results will come at a difficult time for UK retailers. The latest figures from Kantar showed that Britons spent less on fashion in the last year than in the previous year, a downward trend not seen since the financial crisis.According to Kantar, Britain’s fashion sales, which include clothing, footwear and accessories, fell 0.1 per cent in the 52 weeks to June 5, compared with the previous year.And retailers are bracing for further falls, as the results of the UK referendum on EU membership have stoked fears that Brexit will dampen consumer confidence.Shares in M&S fell more than 24 per cent the morning the referendum results were announced. Lauren FedorSalt, sugar and genetically-modified ingredients. Being both a sweet drinks and salty snacking company that uses GMO, PepsiCo is facing a regulatory ambush from all sides over the long term. But at the moment the biggest headwind for the maker of Seven Up and Doritos is the relentlessly strong dollar that Britain’s vote to leave the EU has just made even stronger.Consensus analyst estimates suggest that PepsiCo, one of the world’s largest snacking and beverage companies, will post second-quarter revenues of $15.4bn, a decline of 3.6 per cent.Earnings, adjusted for extraordinary items, probably fell 2.5 per cent to $1.288 per share, while unadjusted they are likely to have declined 3.3 per cent to $1.286 a share.At home, Nielsen data points to a strong quarter for PepsiCo on the salty snacking side of the business, with sales in the 12 weeks to June 18 rising 3.6 per cent, though the overall market increased 4.4 per cent.Overseas, where the company has big exposure to emerging markets, investors will be looking for a clearer outlook on Chinese and Brazilian sales, while there will be interest in executives’ views over its exposure to Britain and the EU amid the political turmoil.Over the long term, both at home and overseas PepsiCo and other food companies face increasing pressures over the ingredients they use. Philadelphia recently passed a tax on sugary drinks, which is likely to invigorate other cities, which have been trying to do the same. Vermont is to introduce a GMO labelling initiative, which is likely to be overtaken by a nationwide ruling, and the US Food and Drug Administration is releasing guidelines aimed at slashing sodium by a third over the next decade. Lindsay WhippSamsung Electronics is likely to surprise investors with an upbeat guidance for second-quarter earnings as the world's largest smartphone maker continues to enjoy robust sales of its flagship S7 smartphones, defying concerns about slowing growth in the global smartphone market.The South Korean company is forecast to report an operating profit of around Won7.3tn in the April-June period, according to market researcher WISEfn, which surveyed 24 analysts. But Lee Jae-yoon, at Yuanta Securities, expects Samsung’s second-quarter operating profit to reach Won8tn, up 16 per cent from a year earlier, while sales are forecast to grow 6 per cent to Won51.3tn.Mr Lee attributed the strong performance to reduced marketing costs and a streamlined product line-up, which boosted operating margins of low-to-mid-end phones.Operating profit from the mobile division is estimated to have topped Won4tn for the first time in two years, accounting for more than half the company’s operating profit, as the company is believed to have sold about 15m Galaxy S7 phones in the second quarter.But some analysts caution the strong momentum may not continue through the third quarter, when competition is likely to intensify in the premium segment with Apple expected to launch a new flagship smartphone. Samsung will unveil its detailed second-quarter results in late July. Song Jung-aSports Direct will reveal the financial impact of a series of torrid trading conditions on the high street and a long-running controversy surrounding labour practices at its Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire.Shares in the sportswear chain fell further than most UK retailers in the aftermath of a referendum decision to leave the EU. Analysts blamed the fall in the pound sterling. Sports Direct buys extensively from Chinese factories, using dollar-denominated contracts which are for the most part unhedged.The company has suffered a series of mishaps over the past six months. In March, apparently unguarded comments made by its founder Mike Ashley during a warehouse tour were interpreted as an informal profit warning.The chain’s executive chairman said that Sports Direct was “in trouble” and that “we are not trading very well”. He later announced that the company’s chief executive would forgo a multimillion-pound share award.The billionaire founder testified before a committee of MPs last month, but only after being threatened with being held in contempt of parliament. He acknowledged workers in the sportswear group’s warehouse went unpaid for time spent undergoing security searches, but insisted the issue had been resolved.Sports Direct has faced a litany of complaints by employees and unions, including using zero-hour contracts that do not guarantee a minimum number of working hours a week.

74;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Pepsi reintroduces aspartame into diet soda;Reversal comes after sharp drop in product’s retail sales;PepsiCo is reintroducing the controversial sweetener aspartame into Diet Pepsi after a large number of customers abandoned the product following the recipe change less than a year ago.While Diet Pepsi made with sucralose and Ace-K, a calorie-free sweetener, will remain the primary offering of the soda, the company is to reintroduce a version using aspartame, named Diet Pepsi Classic Sweetener Blend.The company removed aspartame from Diet Pepsi last August following consumer concerns about the use of artificial sweeteners. Those concerns have contributed to the long-term decline in demand for diet sodas, prompting PepsiCo to rethink its sweetener ingredient in an effort to improve sales.However, the decision, which was not followed by Coca-Cola, was not received well by customers, many of whom took to social media to voice their dissatisfaction.Concerns about aspartame, which Pepsi has in 13 of its products, have been growing over a number of years. Research in 2014 from Israel’s Weizmann Institute that was published in Nature, concluded that using artificial non-caloric sweeteners may promote obesity rather than prevent it. Other studies linking the use of aspartame to cancer have not been proven conclusive, according to the American Cancer Society, and the artificial sweetener is approved by regulators.While Pepsi has repeatedly said that reformulation often leads to an initial dip in sales, Diet Pepsi’s retail sales — which exclude fountain sales — dropped 10.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with a 2.5 per cent decline in 2015, according to Beverage Digest figures.“It goes to show the taste did change and goes to show given the share loss of Diet Pepsi since, [that] you can’t mess with tastes,” said Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar.Mr Fleck said the reintroduction would test whether consumers were divided over their taste preferences and concerns over aspartame, or whether the reintroduced Diet Pepsi Classic would cannibalise other Diet Pepsi products.Pepsi’s move comes amid a realignment of its diet products beginning in September, including renaming its Pepsi Max drink Pepsi Zero Sugar in the US to highlight the beverage is calorie free.That move follows a US trademark ruling last month that found Coca-Cola did not have exclusive rights to use “zero” in drinks branding.“Consumers want choice in diet colas, so we’re refreshing our US line-up to provide three options that meet differing needs and taste preferences,” Pepsi said.Analysts are sceptical that diet or carbonated drinks will become a growth category again, given that more consumers are choosing healthier drinks.However, sales of carbonated beverages remained crucial for Pepsi and Coca-Cola as they produced solid revenues while pricing for them was stable, analysts said.“Diet Pepsi made a bold bet last year that most consumers wanted a diet cola alternative to aspartame,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. “PepsiCo apparently found out that enough consumers still want the taste they grew up drinking and the company is listening, as it should.”
75;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-06-24T15:40:19Z;£3.5m backing for Smurfit Kappa;Non-exec shows faith in cardboard manufacturer;"Jim Lawrence created a splash when he joined the board of Smurfit Kappa last October.The market reacted favourably to the appointment of the former head of the US arm of Rothschild, so there was bound to be some excitement when the new non-executive, who also previously held key positions at Unilever and Pepsico, bought another 185,000 shares in the Irish cardboard manufacturer at $26.50 (£18.68) each.That represents a total outlay equivalent to £3.5m — some commitment.It also presents a stark contrast with a deal completed a month subsequent to Mr Lawrence’s arrival, when Smurfit Kappa’s then finance chief Ian Curley took the decision to sell almost two-thirds of his stake for around €3.4m (£2.6m), three months prior to his resignation.The significance of these deals is open to interpretation; directors come, directors go. But it is true that many analysts look at entities such as Smurfit Kappa — highly attuned as they are to aggregate industrial demand — as bellwethers for the state of the economy, be that regional or global.With the group’s share price flatlining since this point last year, a modest forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10 and a gross yield of 3 per cent, the portents are not exactly encouraging. But given the resilience of the group’s product offering, we remain in the buyers’ circle."
76;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-06-16T23:40:13Z;Philadelphia introduces tax on sweet carbonated drinks;First implementation by a US city of a duty comes as blow to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo;Philadelphia has just taken some of the fizz out of Big Soda, becoming the first large city in the US to introduce a tax on sweet carbonated drinks following two previous failed attempts.The move is a blow to arch rivals Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, and adds to increasing pressure across the globe by governments using taxation in an attempt to limit sugar consumption, amid record levels of obesity and worrying rates of diabetes.Faced with battling the financial clout of big industry organisations such as the American Beverage Association, just one city — Berkeley — has pushed through a tax on soda in the past eight years, despite at least 45 attempts at the state or local level to do so.The success in Philadelphia, whose council passed the measure with a vote of 13-4, will probably provide a boost to other cities considering a tax, such as San Francisco and Boulder, Colorado.“The bold action by Philadelphia’s mayor and city council, in the face of $5m worth of industry pressure, is a win not just for the health and wellbeing of Philadelphia kids but for communities across the country,” said Dr Jim Krieger, executive director of Healthy Food America.“The move to recapture a sliver of profits from an industry that pushes a product that contributes to diabetes, obesity and heart disease in poorer communities in order to reinvest in those communities is sure to be inspirational to many other places,” he added.The ABA warned that it would take legal action against the 1.5 cent per-ounce tax, which it also said was regressive, unfair and against the law.“The fact remains that these taxes are discriminatory and highly unpopular — not only with Philadelphians, but with all Americans.”While Philadelphia’s tax alone will probably do little to hurt the profits of companies such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola, the tax is an unwelcome burden amid a decade-long slump in demand for carbonated drinks.Both companies have been diversifying their range of products away from sweet fizzy fare to energy drinks and more healthy offerings, such as yoghurt drinks, juices, water and milk, as well as smaller cans and bottles. However, many still can contain relatively high levels of sugar even if they do include other nutrients.Pepsi declined to comment, pointing to the ABA’s statement. Asked about the impact of various taxes on sugary drinks earlier this week, Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chairman and chief executive, said that regulation had not helped reduce obesity, and that it was better that businesses co-operate with government and civil society to find a solution. He pointed to the example of Mexico, where soda sales have started to rise again despite the 10 per cent tax on sugary drinks.The bold action by Philadelphia’s mayor and city council …is a win not just for the health and wellbeing of Philadelphia kids but for communities across the countryCoca-Cola and big packaged food companies are under pressure from regulations in other areas as well, as consumers demand increasing transparency over what they consume. Vermont is to introduce the US’s first mandatory labelling law for genetically engineered ingredients on July 1, while the Food and Drug Administration is introducing voluntary measures for reducing sodium content.Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University and also the author of two books on the politics of the country’s large food and drinks companies, said on her blog that sodas are an easy target for public health measures.“Nobody needs them, they are candy in liquid form, and they have no nutritional value. But it seems as though their makers are willing to spare no expense to stop any city that attempts to tax them. Americans are highly likely to support taxes that are earmarked for social purposes, as the Philly tax mostly is.”Jim Kenney, the mayor of Philadelphia, was credited with helping bolster the chances of the tax being accepted by promising to use the estimated annual revenues of $91m in expanding pre-school programmes for children under 5, community schools and reinvestment in parks and recreation. Philadelphia’s 26 per cent poverty rate makes it one of the poorest large cities in the US.

78;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-06-07T23:01:24Z;Advocates of virtual reality spot light at the end of the tunnel;Advertisers look beyond the novelty value of branding through immersive headsets;You are in a racing car, with a Nascar star, and two tunnels come into view. You must choose which one to enter and, wearing a virtual reality headset, you have to steer the car into it. One enters the “Pitch Black” experience reminiscent of the film Blade Runner, the other leads to the so-called “Baja Blast” and the southern California desert.This is the latest virtual reality advertisement for PepsiCo’s Mountain Dew brand released in late May. The tunnels represent the Mountain Dew flavours Pitch Black and Baja Blast. The driver’s choice of tunnel represents a vote for which drink they want to remain on grocery store shelves.Pepsi is one of a number of global companies including Volvo and Disney that have been experimenting with VR as an advertising medium — in Pepsi’s case since 2014.VR technology has been around for decades but it is only in recent years that costs have come down enough for the concept to be commercially viable. While its presence in advertising campaigns is fairly common, it has yet to reach the vast majority of consumers.This novelty value remains one factor in its favour. Being willing to dabble with different and novel platforms for advertising can help build brands, experts say, even if those experiments do not always fully work.Other recent Pepsi experiments include a New York restaurant, Kola House, themed on the kola nut, which contains caffeine and gives cola beverages their name. It displays little or no sign of the Pepsi logo, the idea being to get people talking on social media about not Pepsi but the restaurant’s products. “There may be no direct marketing impact but the buzz around it has a lot of value,” says Thomas Ordahl, chief strategy officer at Landor, a brand consultancy. “They [advertisers] want to be current, fresh and topical and to do that they have to be experimenting.”As a drink and snacks company, Pepsi may not appear to be the obvious choice for taking on the technology. Film and television studios, carmakers, and hotels might seem more obvious clients, for campaigns offering visually immersive experiences.Pepsi says VR works for a brand like Mountain Dew because it is closely associated with sports such as Nascar racing and is popular among gamers. “You have to find the right story that makes sense to tell in VR,” says Sadira Furlow, a senior marketing director at Mountain Dew. “Technology should never be used for the sake of technology.”As exciting as the prospect of VR in advertising is, there are several obstacles standing in its way. The most obvious constraint is a limited number of headsets now in use across the world. These are typically owned by serious VR gamers.Deloitte, the consultants, estimates about 2.5m headsets will be sold worldwide this year. But the number of households with VR equipment remains just a fraction of the total that global companies aim to reach.This limited audience means that companies such as Pepsi often aim to make their VR commercials adaptable to other platforms such as YouTube’s 360 degree videos and normal viewing.Albeit from a small base, the VR consumer economy is thriving. Deloitte forecasts that sales of VR products will breach $1bn this year. That may sound a large sum but two-thirds of it will be spent on hardware and the remainder on content, of which branded material is just a part.Improvements in headset design will continue to drive interest, says Tyler Hopf, a VR designer at Framestore in New York, which has worked with companies from HBO and Marvel to Marriott and Fiat.Clients still need to be patient in discovering what will and will not work. “Half the job is educating people, brands and agencies,” Mr Hopf says. “Ideas don’t necessarily translate well into VR.”
79;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Coca-Cola cans talk of sugar tax fight in favour of collaboration;Three-way merger of bottlers helps group to focus on products away from sugary drinks;Coca-Cola will collaborate with the UK government in fighting obesity and not go to court over a proposed sugar tax on carbonated drinks, said the head of the company’s newly formed west European bottler.Sol Daurella, chairman of Coca-Cola European Partners, which listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange last week, said in an interview with the Financial Times that the three-way merger of bottlers would boost lacklustre sales, as it prepares to pump out more low-sugar alternatives, including waters, juices and teas.“We don’t want only to think about carbonated soft drinks,” Ms Daurella said at Coca-Cola’s retro-styled offices in central London, where visitors pass under a huge glass chandelier shaped like soaring bubbles. “We have a wide portfolio of waters, like SmartWater, teas, energy drinks like Monster, and local jewels such as Vio in Germany, which is spring water with organic fruit juice and slightly carbonated.”She added: “We also have all the innovation around low sugar or zero sugar drinks. It is a great opportunity for growth.”Coca-Cola European Partners is now Coke’s biggest bottler with annual sales of €11bn across 13 countries, through the merger of three bottlers — Coca-Cola Enterprises, the US-based bottler covering the UK, France and some Nordic countries, with its Iberian and German counterparts.Analysts say Coke will be hardest hit by the UK’s proposed sugar tax since it is the country’s largest soft drinks producer. They estimate half of its portfolio would attract the tax, against 30 per cent for Britvic, the Pepsi bottler, which also produces Robinsons and Fruit Shoot drinks.Coke has two years to sell fewer sugary drinks before the tax kicks in. This month, it will embark on a £10m advertising campaign to rename Coca-Cola Zero as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, after discovering that many consumers did not realise the zero equated to having no sugar.Ms Daurella, whose Catalan grandfather ran an early Coca-Cola franchise in Spain, said she was “disappointed” about the UK government “singling out carbonated drinks” for a sugar tax.But in response to suggestions that Coke was intent on suing, she said: “I can’t imagine we will fall into legal issues with the government. We want to collaborate in taking actions that are effective in reducing obesity.”The group, which trades in New York and Madrid, chose Amsterdam for its listing because it “will be helpful in attracting European investors”, said Ms Daurella.The deal is structured as a tax inversion by creating a new UK-domiciled company, which will attract a lower tax rate than the US. The Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Company has an 18 per cent stake in the new bottler and John Brock, chief executive of the former CCE, will assume the same position at the new company.CCEP has promised to increase revenues by €1bn by 2020 and has targeted €315m-€340m of cost savings within three years.Three-quarters of its sales are in eurozone countries, principally Spain, Germany and France, with the UK making up 20 per cent.Ms Daurella said the merger is all about “putting this business in growth mode” but analysts said the company has its work cut out, even if the higher growth rates of Spain and Germany — respectively 3 per cent and 2 per cent in 2015 — help offset a drop of 1.5 per cent in revenue last year from countries served by the former CCE.William Marshall, analyst at Barclays, said: “We think the top line will be difficult. Health and wellness headwinds and a soft consumer environment are ongoing concerns. We are more optimistic about the synergy potential which should be the main driver for profit growth.”Three years ago Ms Daurella helped consolidate seven Spanish bottlers, which she says was a stepping stone to the bigger merger that created CCEP.“There was a lot of emotion,” she recalled about that merger. “We don’t expect this integration to be as tough to capture synergies.”
80;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-06-03T14:51:43Z;Roger Enrico, chief who led Pepsi in cola wars, 1944-2016;Risk-taker who enabled the brand to stand out in the battle for top spot;“You’re the Pepsi generation,” sang Michael Jackson to the tune of “Billie Jean”, as a child clutching a can of the cola drink expressed astonishment to find he had moonwalked into the pop icon.Securing Jackson for this game-changing 1984 advertisement was the brainchild of Roger Enrico, then chief executive of PepsiCo’s beverage and foods division. Enrico, who has died aged 71, contacted Jackson himself to seal his co-operation.As a follow-on from the hugely successful Pepsi Challenge, in which Enrico had been involved, his pioneering move for a soft drinks company to endorse celebrities helped Pepsi usurp — albeit temporarily — arch-rival Coca-Cola from the top spot in supermarket share in the cola wars.In 1985, Coke tweaked its recipe for the first time in almost a century in response to flagging growth, only to reverse course months later amid consumer horror at the change. The retreat enabled it to re-establish its historically higher market share.“That era was pretty much the golden age of the cola wars,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. “What was revolutionary was the number two player went for such a huge star. Michael Jackson was the kind of talent you’d expect Coca-Cola to grab and here was the number two company signing him.”It was unusual for an executive running an entire division to be involved in negotiations for an ad campaign as Enrico was with Jackson. This was what made him so different, recalled Allen Rosenshine, chairman emeritus and former chief executive of ad agency BBDO, who worked with Enrico when his company was responsible for PepsiCo’s account and was a close friend. “He enabled Pepsi to stand out.”Roger Enrico was born on November 11 1944 in the town of Chisholm, Minnesota, close to the Canadian border. His path to the top — before he retired he was chairman of DreamWorks — was peppered with pit stops. Having wanted to be an actor — to the disapproval of his factory worker father — he started out working at General Mills before serving with the navy in the Vietnam war. He joined Pepsi in 1971 as a brand manager for Funyuns at the company’s Frito-Lay division.After his success at Pepsi, where he became group chief executive in 1996, he stepped down in 2001 following a heart attack but stayed on for two years in the less demanding role of chairman.I’ve always believed you ought to go with the flow. Be a bit fatalistic. Don’t overprogramme yourself“I think ‘career path’ are the two worst words invented,” he told Fortune magazine in 1996. “I’ve always believed you ought to go with the flow. Be a bit fatalistic. Don’t overprogramme yourself.”This meant taking risks, even if they did not always pan out. Other celebrity endorsements included Madonna, which he admitted did not work so well amid a backlash from some religious groups in the US, despite the resulting advert’s popularity overseas.He also said in the Fortune article that he should not have written his book The Other Guy Blinked: How Pepsi Won the Cola Wars, explaining that he had written it to sell Pepsi but it had morphed into personal publicity.His legacy at Pepsi includes many successes besides commercials. In 1997 he engineered the sale of the restaurant division — what is now Yum Brands (KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell) — as a means to help the company sell more fizzy drinks to a broader range of restaurants with soda fountains. And he was instrumental in the acquisition of Tropicana and Gatorade, a move that has proved crucial as soda suffered a decade-long decline in US sales.“[Enrico] was a risk-taker, never afraid to challenge the status quo or make bold moves to get ahead,” Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s current chief executive. “He was tough as nails, always prepared to get the job done and beat the competition. At the same time, he had a true love for our people and a passion for empowering them to reach their full potential.”Enrico is survived by his wife Rosemary and son Aaron.His death comes just weeks after the passing of Bill Backer, another important marketing guru from a similar era, who made ads for Coca-Cola. Both left an indelible mark on American advertising history.
81;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-06-01T17:12:31Z;Big Food gets a salty message from the FDA;Processed meal makers under pressure to cut down sodium in recipes;Big Food is under pressure to further reduce salt in meals after US health officials released guidelines aimed at slashing sodium consumption by a third over the next decade.The US Food and Drug Administration, which issued the draft voluntary guidelines on Wednesday, said that Americans consumed on average 3,400 milligrams of sodium daily — almost 50 per cent more than existing federal guidelines.The US’s largest food companies from snack makers such as PepsiCo and Mondelez to ready-meal producers such as Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup have already had to set goals to reduce the amounts of salt and sugar in their offerings in response to a sea change in the way Americans are eating.A salty diet has contributed to around a third of Americans suffering from high blood pressure, and the FDA cited research that estimates that lowering the intake by 40 per cent could save 500,000 lives and nearly $100bn in healthcare costs over a decade.The draft plan includes a less stringent two-year target and also said that the guidelines would also include restaurants not just packaged food companies.“The majority of sodium consumed comes from processed and prepared foods, not the salt shaker,” the FDA said in a statement. “This makes it difficult for all of us to control how much sodium we consume.”While the FDA acknowledged the efforts of the big food companies in making changes to their recipes, it said that “many foods continue to contribute to high sodium intake, especially processed and prepared foods, including foods eaten away from home”.Americans are placing more emphasis on the quality of what they eat, demanding more wholesome, natural foods containing fewer unnatural ingredients used in additives and preservatives. In July, Vermont will be the first US state to introduce mandatory labelling of genetically modified ingredients. These shifts have been helped by the spread of social media, which has amplified consumer voices in the debate.“This is clearly a step in the right direction on a pretty big issue,” said Alexia Howard, a food company analyst at Bernstein. “What tends to happen is that the food companies’ wheels will start to turn ahead of this before the voluntary guidelines actually come into effect.”Analysts said that it was too early to tell the extent to which the proposed guidelines would impact food companies, but those most likely to be affected were the makers of soup and baked goods.The Grocery Manufacturers Association said it welcomed dialogue with the FDA on the issue and claimed the industry had reduced sodium levels by 16 per cent between 2008-2013.However, it stopped short of endorsing the draft guidelines, saying that: “We believe additional work is needed to determine the acceptable range of sodium intake for optimal health. This evaluation should include research that indicates health risks for people who consume too much sodium as well as health risks from consuming too little sodium.”Mars, the family-owned maker of pasta sauces and chocolate bars, said that the draft guidelines would not mean the company would be forced to accelerate its commitment to reduce sodium in its foods by 20 per cent over the next five years.Mondelez said it would review the proposed targets as they relate to its product portfolio, noting that it had pledged in 2010 to reduce sodium and had a plan to decrease its use by 10 per cent across all products by 2020.The FDA is providing 90 and 150 days for public comment on the two- and 10-year targets respectively.

To receive it every Friday by email, sign up here.This week, it has been a quarter of a century since Thelma & Louise sailed their battered convertible into the Grand Canyon, securing their place in Hollywood’s pantheon of heroes. This week is another in the saga of the Venezuelan government’s push on the gas pedal towards the approaching abyss.But unlike Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis – and to many Venezuelans, the late Hugo Chávez – if President Nicolás Maduro and his acolytes finally jump off the cliff, they won’t leave as heroes. In a prelude to a humanitarian crisis, the incidence of looting is soaring as Venezuelans become ever more desperate in their search for basic goods on barren supermarket shelves. “[It is] written in the Bible, people will kill each other for food,” the voice of a woman can be heard on an amateur video of a looting.Coca-Cola has halted production of sugary drinks due to a lack of sugar. Empresas Polar, the country’s biggest food producer, which also bottles Pepsi products, may soon follow suit. More worrying, inventories of maize -the base ingredient for Venezuela’s staple arepa- are running dangerously low.Amid a lack of medicines, Oliver Sánchez, a cancer-stricken eight year old boy who once participated in a protest holding a sign reading “I want to cure myself”, died this week. If “Lord of Misrule” Maduro tries to cling to power, for opposition leader Henrique Capriles, “that will be throwing petrol on to the fire.”But things seem poised to get worse. Venezuela’s government and state oil company PDVSA have decided to prioritise bondholders over its citizens and plans to continue to squeeze imports. Meanwhile, they are scraping every barrel, swapping gold and trying to restructure debts.The recent oil price rebound, and a deal with its main financier, China, to extend oil-for-loans deadlines may give this ravaged economy a little bit of oxygen. However, somebody made it clear this week that “China is now diversifying away from the seething cauldron of risk that Caracas has become.”Despite being geographically closer to the Grand Canyon, Mexico City is far from Caracas’ Thelma & Louise car sliding into the abyss. Yet endemic corruption, car fumes and a lack of running water are putting officials to test – while testing the nerves of my fellow correspondent there.One country that seems willing to change course is El Salvador, which last year took the baton from Honduras as the homicide capital of the world (Venezuela is also one of the most murderous.) Now the government has vowed to bring the gangs to their knees in a year. Decision, skill, and time will tell.That applies to Venezuela too, where the crash is nigh but has not yet occurred. “The question is,” someone said, “is it going to be a Thelma & Louise ending, where they drive off the cliff knowingly and deliberately, or will they just drive off the cliff? Their inability to change course, despite the obvious danger, is stunning.”Quote of the week“We have to change the government to stop this bleeding”- Brazil’s former interim planning minister Romero Jucá caught on tape telling Sérgio Machado, former president of a subsidiary of the national oil company, Petrobras, that a change of government was needed to contain a sweeping corruption probe.ChartwatchChinese to desert Venezuela infrastructure

Mr Heath stepped down a few weeks later.Stock Spirits said on Monday that it did not judge Mr Da Ponte and Mr Pankevicz to be independent and they will accordingly become non-independent non-executive directors. It will continue its own search for two independent non-executive directors to join the board.Several investor advisory groups, including Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, had come out in favour of Western Gate’s proposal to add the two men to Stock Spirits’ board.Mr Amaral welcomed today’s AGM result but questioned why resources are being spent on finding yet more board members. He said:We welcome the appointment of both independent candidates to the Stock Spirits Board and thank fellow shareholders for their support. We see no reason why the company should use company resources to appoint a further two non-executive directors in addition to the two elected today by shareholders. ISS, Glass Lewis, PIRC and Heidrick & Struggles consider Randy and Alberto to be independent. Today’s AGM result has delivered a clear mandate for change to address the performance and strategy issues which have been highlighted, and we would like the Board’s focus to be on this.Mr Amaral is the biggest shareholder in Eurocash, a wholesaler which is Stock Spirits’ largest customer in Poland.

Sales of squash and other non-fizzy drinks in the UK fell almost 8 per cent to £147.7m.Robinsons, Britvic’s best known brand, was impacted by a recent decision to remove its added-sugar range in response to increasingly health-conscious consumers in its home market.Britvic said it has experienced a reduction in sales volumes as a result of the move, while the group also had to increase promotional activity around Robinsons as supermarkets slashed the prices of their own-label squash.Pre-tax profit of the period, however, increased 7 per cent on the year to £54.5m thanks to the contribution of Empresa Brasileira de Bebidas e Alimentos in Brazil, which was acquired by Britvic earlier this year. Total revenues rose 4.3 per cent to £678m.A UK sugar tax, slated to be introduced in 2018 on drinks with high sugar content, is expected to hit the juice maker. Besides house brands like Robinsons and J2O, the company also produces and distributes brands such as Pepsi and 7Up in the UK market.Chancellor George Osborne made the announcement in his Budget in March and Britvic shares slid on the news. The company will reformulate its drinks prior to the imposition in order to reduce the impact.Britvic’s chief executive Simon Litherland said in a statement that it will continue with the strategy:We continue to invest behind the longer term drivers of growth – supply chain efficiency in GB, innovation and our international businesses – and I remain excited about our ability to drive sustainable revenue growth in the years ahead.He added that with the key summer trading period ahead and strong marketing plans in the pipeline, the company is confident to deliver Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) in the range of £180m to £190m for the full year.
85;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-05-17T11:53:29Z;Stock Spirits seeks compromise to avoid AGM battle;;Eastern European vodka maker Stock Spirits has tried to head off a battle with its biggest shareholder ahead of its forthcoming annual general meeting next week, by offering to find and appoint two independent non-executive directors to its board.The London-listed group’s offer to start looking for additional board members is the latest front in a battle it has been waging with activist shareholder, Western Gate Private Investments, the vehicle of Portuguese businessman Luis Amaral and his family.At the start of April, Western Gate called for the removal of Stock Spirits’ chief executive Chris Heath – a battle it subsequently won when Mr Heath announced his decision to take “early retirement” from the company later that month.But the shareholder has continued to push for the appointment of two non-executive directors: Alberto Da Ponte, a former Heineken and Cadbury Schweppes executive, and Randy Pankevicz, a former PepsiCo manager.Stock Spirits has urged shareholders to vote against their appointment at the AGM on Monday, arguing that they cannot be regarded as independent.But in an update on Tuesday, the company said it was willing to search for two alternative non-executive directors “who are suitably qualified and complement the experience of existing board members”. It said:The board has carefully listened to the company’s shareholders and acknowledges that some shareholders wish the Board to be strengthened.The company had hoped the offer would avoid a showdown at the AGM but so far Western Gate is showing no signs of backing down on its own preferred nominees.Stock Spirits added:The board had hoped that Western Gate would agree that this would be consistent with their objectives and accordingly agree to withdraw the Western Gate Resolutions ahead of the AGM, an outcome that a number of shareholders have expressed their preference for. The board will not support non-executive Directors who are not independent and who lack the suitable skills and experience necessary to supplement that of the existing Board.The board has contacted Western Gate to explain their intentions and to seek to reach agreement on the matters subject to the Western Gate Resolutions ahead of the AGM. The Board is disappointed that Western Gate and Mr. Amaral have chosen not to accept the Board’s proposal and have not withdrawn the Western Gate Resolutions.As the FT’s Scheherazade Daneshkhu reported yesterday, three investor advisory groups have backed Western Gate’s campaign.
86;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-05-13T19:55:32Z;PepsiCo drops after Peltz’s Trian exits stake;;Shares in PepsiCo lost a bit of their fizz on Friday after activist investor Nelson Peltz’s investment fund revealed that it has sold its stake in the beverage and snack giant, ending what had often been a contentious relationship between the two.Trian Fund Management, which had a reported 1.3 per cent stake in Pepsi at the end of 2015, said it sold its stake in March this year, which it had held for over three years, reports Lindsay Whipp in Chicago.PepsiCo shares fell by as much as 2.4 per cent on the news before recovering slightly to trade 1.65 per cent lower at $104.35.The sale comes more than a year after Trian and Pepsi reached a truce when the drinks and snacks company opened the door for a Trian fund adviser and former Heinz chief executive Bill Johnson to join its board. This came after a sustained push by Mr Peltz’s fund to break up the company.Trian said in a statement:Trian believes PepsiCo has addressed many operational issues identified by Trian – management has increased productivity efforts, reduced overhead, increased advertising investment, and delivered consistent earnings growth on a constant currency basis.The market has viewed these developments positively and PepsiCo currently trades at a substantially higher multiple than at the time of Trian’s initial investment in late 2012. Trian wishes PepsiCo’s management every success.Pepsi’s shares have gained 26 per cent over the past three years, in line with the broader S&P500.

The prosecutor added that he was “not opposed” to the sentence being suspended.The proposed sentence will come as a relief to some in the whistleblowers’ camp, who had been braced for a sentence of five or even 10 years. The court in Luxembourg is expected to issue a final judgement in June.

Although the shares pared back some of the losses to trade 4.8 per cent lower, if the stock closes at this level, it would mark its biggest one day drop since October 2014.The shares are still up over the past 12 months, however.Why the glum? While the headline numbers – a 4 per cent drop in revenues and a 5 per cent drop in earnings – were largely in line with market expectations, the wider downward trend is not an encouraging.Chart one: Revenue declineThe latest quarter marks the 12th out of the past 13 that revenue has fallen on a year on year basis.Chart two: Soda sales growth hit a wallLike rival PepsiCo, Coca-Cola has been pressured in recent years as consumers in developed markets scale back on soda in favor of healthier offerings. Indeed, the company increasingly depends on its non-carbonated brands for growth. Still drinks clocked in volume growth of 7 per cent during the quarter – a sharp contrast to the flat volume growth for its carbonated drinks.Chart three: Weak overseas salesWhile growth in North America has stablised, the bulk of Coca-Cola’s profits and revenues comes from overseas. The company on Wednesday flagged up China, Brazil and Russia where it is facing macro headwinds. Slowing sales growth is further compounded by the strength of the dollar, which is eroding the value of its sales from abroad.Chart: Profit marginsCoca Cola has sought to ride out the stagnant sales overseas and changing tastes at home by raising prices on the company’s beverages, but even this appeared to have reached its limits.As analysts at Susquehanna International noted:…while sales are in line, our main read is that less price realization in developed markets and now the inability to fully recover higher FX-related costs in emerging markets are squeezing gross margins. We doubt the company will maintain this lower SGA/sales pace.
89;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-04-20T11:27:52Z;First Pepsi, now Coke: strong dollar dampens fizz;;Coca-Cola failed to put the fizz back into its earnings during the first three months of the year.The company, best known for Sprite, Fanta and its eponymous brand of soda, saw revenues drop 4 per cent drop to $10.28bn as the strong dollar compounded its overseas sales woes.Although the figure was in line with expectations, the decline means revenues have now fallen in 12 of the last 13 quarters.Net income fell 5 per cent to $1.48bn, or 34 cents a share during the period. On an adjusted basis, which excludes certain items, profits came in at 45 cents a share, slightly ahead of analyst forecast of 44 cents a share.Like rival PepsiCo, Coca-Cola has been pressured in recent years as consumers in developed markets scale back on soda in favor of healthier offerings.In response, the company acquired Zico, maker of coconut water in 2013 and organic Honest Tea two years before that. Indeed, Coca-Cola increasingly depends on its noncarbonated brands for growth, with sales volume of still beverages up 7 per cent during the quarter while those for fizzy drinks were flat.Coca-Cola generates the bulk of its profits outside the US and on this front it was hit by both slowing growth in many of its overseas market as well as the continued resilience of the greenback, which erodes the value of any of the profits it brings back from abroad.The impact of the strong dollar was most pronounced in Latin America where the company took a 24 percentage point hit.Shares in Coca-Cola fell 1.6 per cent in pre-market trading.
90;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;PepsiCo: healthy returns;Slash and burn is not the only model that works at food companies;PepsiCo calls it “future-proofing”. The food and drink juggernaut, which over the years has faced calls to break apart its snack and soda units, stands stoutly behind its conglomerate model. There are important benefits to being a one-stop junk foodmaker, it insists. Such steadfastness has paid off: total return in the last two years has been 29 per cent, more than double the S&P 500.Yet the future it has been preparing for features a lot less junk. It includes such new products as an oats-based dairy drink sold in China that belie its legacy of gut-busting refreshment.On Monday, Pepsi reported solid organic growth of 3.5 per cent, albeit slightly lighter than its forecast of 4 per cent for the year. (A third of its total revenue comes from developing markets where economic growth has slowed sharply.) But such a clip for a company with a $175bn enterprise value is creditable, suggesting that consumers have responded to better quality offerings. Its so-called “everyday nutrition” portfolio comprises up to a quarter of total sales, its flagship Pepsi brand just a tenth of global revenue.And while R&D and marketing dollars have shifted up in recent years, Pepsi has wrung operating cost savings elsewhere, alongside tightening cash spend on working capital. While accounting earnings are relatively stagnant, having been shaved by foreign currency translation effects, operating cash flow typically registers at about 120 per cent of net income.Pepsi is effectively paying out all its $7bn in free cash flow in dividends and share buybacks (its dividend yield is 3 per cent). Since the first activist calls for a Pepsi break-up, the other key development among packaged food companies has been the rise of the cost-cutting private equity model first executed at Heinz. Pepsi’s operating margin of 16 per cent still trails the 20 per cent achieved at Kraft Heinz. Alas, organic growth at the latter is negative. Unlike Pepsi they have done nothing to develop a grain-based drink for China.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
91;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-04-18T10:54:41Z;Strong dollar takes fizz out of PepsiCo results;;Revenue at drinks and snack giant PepsiCo fell for a sixth consecutive quarter during the first three months of the year, as the strong dollar continues to weigh on its overseas businesses.The company behind Doritos and Tropicana orange juice as well as the eponymous soda saw first quarter revenues drop to $11.9bn, with a negative impact of 4.5 percentage points coming from foreign-exchange swings.While revenue was 3 per cent lower than the $12.2bn recorded last year, it was in line with analysts’ expectations.Net income fell by more than a fifth to $945m as a result of its decision to separate its Venezuela operations from its accounts because of an inability to exchange bolivars.Adjusted for one-time gains and costs, earnings came to 89 cents a share, ahead of the 81 cents a share forecast.This came as lower commodity costs and strong North American snack and drinks sales lessened some of the impact that the stronger dollar has had on its overseas businesses.PepsiCo has been focusing on cutting costs and bringing snacks and drinks to the market that are less unhealthy than its traditional sodas and salty snacks as it seeks to capitalise on a significant shift in the way Americans are snacking. It has introduced vending machines that give nutritional information on the “better for you” products it is selling and has introduced a “craft” Pepsi Cola drink based on the kola nut and real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup.

Schlumberger’s revenue declined 27 per cent last year.The Venezuelan economy has been hurt by the protracted drop in crude prices, and the state needs a far higher oil price than most other oil producing countries to balance its budget.US companies with exposure to Venezuela — including Goodyear, Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, American Airlines and PepsiCo — have been forced to take billions of dollars in writedowns.Schlumberger shares, which have declined 11 per cent since the beginning of last year, were little changed in extended trading.

Mr Johnston, 54, has been CFO of Pepsi since March 2010.The messaging platform also announced on Friday that it was awarding more restrictive stock units to Anthony Noto, the chief financial officer who joined from Goldman Sachs, as “compensation for taking on additional responsibilities”. If he stays with the company and meets his targets, he could receive extra stock worth about $5.8m at today’s share price.Mr Kordestani tweeted that he was “thrilled” to welcome Baronness Lane Fox and Mr Johnston to the board. “The entire board is working to bring greater diversity to our ranks.

94;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-03-30T22:27:30Z;PepsiCo North America snacks head Greco exits;;PepsiCo has promoted Al Carey to head all of the conglomerate’s North American divisions in a move that an analyst said potentially strengthens the executive’s position to succeed chairman and chief executive Indra Nooyi in the future.Mr Carey’s promotion was triggered by the departure of Tom Greco, Pepsi’s Frito-Lay North America division chief, who is leaving the $150bn market cap snacks and beverage conglomerate to become chief executive of an unnamed company outside the industry, writes Chicago correspondent Lindsay Whipp.Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote that Mr Greco’s departure suggested that he may have “seen a limited path” to succeeding Ms Nooyi in the near term.Ms Herzog added that there are two scenarios that could play out now in terms of succession. One would be that Ms Nooyi “decides to depart Pepsi relatively soon, in which case we believe Al Carey would be next in-line for the top spot,” adding he would be a “very capable candidate”.Alternatively, Ms Nooyi “remains at the helm for the next couple/few years, which could raise doubts on Carey’s candidacy for CEO given he is several years older than Nooyi”, Ms Herzog said.The decision to have an executive in charge of all Pepsi’s North American divisions is aimed at fuelling cross-pollination of ideas for product innovation and finding new opportunities for growth.Mr Carey has been at PepsiCo since 1981 and has worked across the company’s various divisions — mainly in North America — including a stint running its North American snack business.Meanwhile, Kirk Tanner, chief operating officer of Pepsi’s North American beverages and global foodservice will become president and chief operating officer of the company’s North American beverage. While Vivek Sankaran, COO of Frito Lay in the region has similarly become president and COO of the snack business for North America.Ms Herzog added that should her second scenario play out, it suggests that “Hugh Johnston [chief financial officer] as well as both Kirk Tanner and Vivek Sankaran are the ones to watch”.PepsiCo has been focusing on cutting costs and bringing snacks and drinks to the market that are less unhealthy than its traditional sodas and salty snacks as it seeks to capitalise on a significant shift in the way Americans are snacking. It has introduced vending machines that give nutritional information on the “better for you” products it is selling and has introduced a “craft” Pepsi Cola drink based on the kola nut and real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup.
95;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-03-16T15:10:22Z;The Budget’s sugar tax is half-baked;It seems strange to take the view that only soft drinks pose a risk, writes Tim Harford;I’m all in favour of a sugar tax, as I wrote in the FT Magazine on Saturday. It’s a shame, then, that — despite the headlines to the contrary — George Osborne hasn’t introduced one.His proposal instead is to tax the manufacturers and importers of a particular variety of sugary drink. I am no dentist or dietitian, but it seems strange to take the view that sugar in general poses no risk to the nation’s teeth or waistline, unless it comes in a soft drink.Coke and Pepsi are a problem, apparently. But it seems that sugar lumps in tea or coffee are not. Neither are cartons of chocolate milk. Nor syrupy concoctions from Starbucks and Costa. Nor soft drinks produced by boutique producers. Mars bars are fine. So are cakes. So are Coco Pops and Frosties, and for that matter the remarkable quantities of sugar that infuse cereals such as Bran Flakes, or are buried in the recipes of many ready meals. All these forms of sugar will continue to reach our taste buds free of a sugar tax.Mr Osborne’s proposal will work, after a fashion. There is abundant evidence that people adjust their behaviour in response to financial incentives, whether through the window tax-avoiding architecture of 18th-century Britain or the inheritance tax-avoiding feat of Australians in postponing the date of their deaths to a more tax-efficient time.Chancellor George Osborne delivers his eighth Budget at a time of huge political turbulence for the Conservative partySo yes, as Mr Osborne expects, large companies will try to put less sugar in their soft drinks, or raise the prices of those drinks, or both. Sugar consumption from those sources will fall. But they may well rise elsewhere. For many people, a chocolate bar and a fizzy drink are substitutes. If the fizzy drink gets more expensive, the chocolate bar is a tasty alternative for the sweet-toothed consumer. It has more fat in it, too.It’s clear enough why the chancellor has opted for this approach. He wants to blame large companies, not voters, and hide the fact that ultimately consumers will pay the tax. A broad-based tax on sugar itself would have been simpler, braver and far more effective. But Mr Osborne wanted his Budget to leave voters with a sweeter taste in the mouth.tim.harford@ft.com
96;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-03-02T15:23:54Z;Healthy bars and nibbles reshape US snacks market;Busier lifestyles and demographic shifts help change consumer tastes;Daniel Lubetzky became tired of waiting for a company to produce the sort of healthy snacks he craved. So he started making his own.“In the early 2000s, I was travelling a lot and kept finding that there weren’t healthy snacks available that tasted good and satisfied my hunger,” social entrepreneur Mr Lubetzky says. “These frustrations with my own snacking options sparked the idea for Kind.”He was not the only one with cravings for healthy snacks. Kind Snacks, which makes nut and fruit bars, sells its products in 150,000 stores, with sales rising 36 per cent last year. It is one of many start-ups either taking on America’s food giants in the growing healthier snack sector — or being bought by them.Sales of snacks — including bakery snacks, biscuits, confectionery, ice cream, snack bars, yoghurt and savoury snacks — jumped 17.4 per cent to $145bn in the five years to 2015, according to Euromonitor. This growth is being driven by products which are perceived as more healthy, analysts and executives say. And they are confident that trend will continue.“It’s certainly going to continue to be one of our growth platforms,” says James Snee, chief operating officer at Hormel Foods in a recent interview. “At our core we’re protein based so the idea of being able to . . . take from traditional formats [and transform] into snacking formats serves us well.”US sales of energy and nutrition bars have surged 87.5 per cent to $2.48bn in the five years to 2015, while nuts have increased 34.7 per cent to $4.55bn, fruit bars have risen 16.5 per cent to $1.17bn and yoghurt has risen 26.8 per cent to $8.38bn, according to Euromonitor.The shift towards foods perceived to be healthier is changing America’s food industry, and this is particularly the case in snacks. For a number of years, consumers have been more aware of the types of food they eat amid a nationwide obesity and diabetes type 2 crisis.Busier lifestyles and a more diverse population is also driving the rise in snacking, highlighting the growing importance of convenience. Driven by millennials, consumers are eating on the go more often than in the past, sometimes using snacks to replace meals, executives say. The average consumer eats five times a day, Tyson Foods points out. A shift to city dwelling means smaller kitchens for some and less cooking.Everyone is trying to get a piece of the snacking market. It’s bringing in a lot of companies“The traditional image of mom and dad sitting down for dinner at 6pm with two children . . . is as outdated as the typewriter,” Denise Morrison, chief executive of Campbell Soup, recently told investors. “We live in a polycultural society with diverse tastes and norms. The one size fits all approach is long gone.”But what exactly is a healthier snack? There is no single definition and what consumers find important health wise can change over time and between generations. For some, the focus on weight loss or low carbohydrates has shifted to eating less processed fare even if it is not so low in fat.Protein has become a focus, leading to a renaissance in high-end jerky sales, but the product still contains relatively high salt levels. And some nutrition bars may contain largely unprocessed ingredients but still have sugar levels comparable to candy bars.A key trend at the moment is having only simple and recognisable ingredients in food — known as clean labelling. This means free from artificial colours, preservatives and additives. Organic continues to grow in popularity as does GMO-free food.“The things that people are most worried about vary,” says Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein. “Over the past two or three years, there has been a massive conversation online about fillers and preservatives. There’s definitely been opting for ‘I don’t want artificial’.”Leaders in the snacks market, such as PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay and Mondelez, have for some time been introducing products and technology aimed at removing the guilt from indulging. Pepsi in December introduced a smart vending machine selling its “better for you” snacks with a digital function that gives nutritional information. Meanwhile, Mondelez is targeting half of its sales to come from its “wellbeing” snacks, up from a third now.Demand for healthier snacks has lured companies who previously had little or no exposure to the category as well as newer companies such as Kind and Graze of the UK, which sells trays of nuts and dried fruit via online subscription.Abbott Laboratories — a nutrition and medical devices company — this month introduced its first new range of snack bars in more than a decade.Tyson, a relative newcomer to snacks via its Hillshire brands acquisition, is capitalising on “gourmet” jerky sales, as is chocolate maker Hershey, which has bought jerky brand Krave.“Everyone is trying to get a piece of the snacking market,” says Jared Koerton, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor. “It’s bringing in a lot of companies into a new market [for them], or ones trying to expand into new product areas.”

Almost a third come from Russia and Nigeria, where falling oil prices are weighing heavily. CCH’s Russian volumes have begun to fall.Black markets for the naira suggest a 50 per cent devaluation. According to CCH’s estimates, if the Nigerian currency fell that much its net profits would be hit by 15 per cent. Still, CCH says its “established” markets in Europe (think Italy and Switzerland) are doing well, and price increases are on the horizon.CCH is in good shape as regards cash. Over the past five years, free cash flow has averaged €390m annually. Better operating margins, up a percentage point last year, will have only increased that number.The company needs to use these riches. It could return more to shareholders: a 2 per cent dividend yield is not too generous. Or it could buy growth. Coke is creating a joint venture with SABMiller begun in late 2014, known as Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which SAB would control.Anheuser-Busch InBev, which aims to acquire SAB, has considerable Pepsi assets — an uneasy fit. Buying out SAB would add a third to CCH volumes.Based on the latest data available for CCBA, and assuming a higher valuation multiple than CCH’s (given the difference in margins), SAB’s 57 per cent stake could cost as much as $6bn, thinks SocGen. Compare that with CCH’s market value of $7bn and a deal looks ambitious, even considering that CCH has relatively little debt.Increasing the dividend is safer. An acquisition offers higher potential gains. CCH should make its preference clear, and soon.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
98;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-02-15T03:16:43Z;Asian nations sweeten to idea of sugar taxes on fizzy drinks;Indonesia, India and the Philippines look to levies to tackle obesity and diabetes;"Some of Asia’s biggest soda-guzzling nations are preparing to impose taxes on fizzy drinks as the backlash against the industry mounts in a movement reminiscent of the anti-tobacco campaign.The $560bn global soda industry has come under attack worldwide as doctors and policymakers fret about the mounting toll — on health as well as government coffers — of obesity and diabetes.A sugar tax in Mexico has cut the consumption of sugary drinks by an estimated 12 per cent and raised more than $2bn in tax receipts. Berkeley in California, France and Chile have introduced similar taxes.The UK has scrapped plans to introduce a sugar tax of up to 20 per cent but companies will be expected to reformulate their products to reduce sugar content.Many liken the threat to the industry of greater taxes and regulation with curbs on tobacco — and say they could prove just as detrimental to the likes of Pepsi, Coca-Cola and other fizzy drink manufacturers.However, while cigarette makers have mitigated the impact of regulatory burdens in the rich world by ramping up sales in emerging markets, moves in Asia suggest the war on sugar may prove more globally consistent.Governments are looking to implement some form of sugar tax in Indonesia, India and the Philippines, where the soft drinks industry is worth an aggregate $18bn, according to Euromonitor, making it a vast potential market still only a fifth of the size of that of western Europe.Proposals are most advanced in the Philippines, where the House of Representatives is set to rule on introducing a 10 per cent excise tax on all sugar-sweetened drinks.“In India and Southeast Asia the prevalence [of obesity] is lower [than in Europe and the US] but the increase in prevalence over the past decade in many cases is alarming,” says Bruce Lee at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.Discussions are at an earlier stage in Indonesia, which scrapped a “luxury tax” on sweetened drinks in 2004, and India, where a government committee led by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended a 40 per cent levy in December.Drinks makers are braced for a big dent in sales if the measures go through. Mexico, which introduced a tax on sugary drinks and junk food two years ago, has become the benchmark for other emerging markets.Analysts caution that any new measures in Asia could have other unwanted consequences, however, deterring investments from multinational groups that governments have been eager to attract.Some warn that the new measures in India let domestic brands off the hook. The added duty targets aerated drinks, a category dominated by multinationals such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola; packaged juices, which are largely produced by local players such as market leader Dabur, would not be affected.“The agenda is not transparent and my hunch is there is an element of protectionism,” says Saurabh Mukherjea at Ambit Capital, the Mumbai-based brokerage.Coca-Cola in India has slammed the suggested taxes as being detrimental to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” campaign to draw foreign investors to the country, adding that the group and its bottling partners create employment for about 200,000 people.In Indonesia, where producers are already battling slowing growth and currency volatility, the proposed taxes are expected to deal a blow to the industry. New brands such as Peruvian Big Cola have heightened competition and industry lobby groups say any additional tax would throttle the market.“The category is still very small,” says Triyono Prijosoesilo at the Association of Indonesian Soft Drink Producers. “People change their choice of beverage easily — if they feel that a packaged tea becomes very expensive, they can switch into water or non-packaged beverages.”Industry analysts further question whether a tax would deter sweet-toothed Indians and Indonesians who tend to add large quantities of sugar to traditional unpackaged drinks.“Even tea in Indonesia is with sugar,” says Ade Elimin at PwC in Jakarta. “Indonesians love sugar — they like sweet drinks.In India 70m adults have diabetes, the world’s highest number behind China.Experts warn that the associated healthcare costs can be ruinous. World Health Organisation estimates suggest the family of a low-income Indian adult with diabetes could spend as much as 25 per cent of their income on diabetes care.With growing evidence of the harms of sweetened food and drink, experts emphasise the importance of discouraging consumption when the industry is still fledgling — as it is in much of emerging Asia.“There is evidence that sugar is both an acquired taste and potentially addictive,” says Mr Lee at Johns Hopkins. “It is best to act before you even acquire the habit.”"

The charge — $577m on a post-tax basis — pushed Goodyear into a $380m net loss for the quarter, against net income of $2.13bn for the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales fell 6.7 per cent to $4.06bn.The crisis in Venezuela looks set to push the country into a default on its debt payments, amid a dire recession and galloping inflation. After years of mismanagement, the country’s economy has also been one of the worst hit worldwide by the fall in the price of oil, which accounts for some 95 per cent of the country’s trade revenue.Tight currency controls imposed by the socialist government have created an acute shortage of dollars for companies seeking to do business with the country. Amid a byzantine foreign exchange system, which fuels distortions, the black market rate now trades at about 160 times the main government set exchange rate of 6.3 bolívares per dollar. The country has four exchange rates: three official ones and the black market one, which on Tuesday was trading at some 1016 per greenback.Conditions in the country have hit US airlines particularly hard, since they have been unable to repatriate from Venezuela revenue earned there. American Airlines — the most dependent of the US’s big three legacy airlines on Latin America — reported a $592m write-off for the fourth quarter for the value of its holdings of bolívares. Delta Air Lines took a $75m fourth-quarter write-off for its bolívar holdings, while United Air Lines announced a $61m write-off over Venezuela alongside its third-quarter results in October.The conditions have also hit other companies in the automotive industry, besides Goodyear. General Motors took a $600m charge because of the bolívar’s devaluation for the second quarter last year and a $100m writedown for the value of its manufacturing assets in the country. Ford in the fourth quarter of 2014 took an $800m charge for changes in its accounting for its Venezuelan operations.Other big US companies including Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, PepsiCo and AT&T have also taken write-offs in recent years.The country was for many years after the second world war one of the richest in the region, with a vibrant economy buoyed by oil exports.Goodyear’s shares were up 4.2 per cent in afternoon trade, at $27.45, as other aspects of the results exceeded expectations.Additional reporting by Andres Schipani in Bogotá
100;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-02-09T13:20:40Z;Goodyear takes $646m hit on Venezuela;;The economic meltdown in Venezuela continues to blow holes across the balance sheets of corporate America, with Goodyear, the US tire maker, the latest to announce a substantial write-down to its business there.The company said it took a $646m hit during the fourth quarter after it moved to deconsolidate its Venezuelan business from its financial statements. The write down pushed Goodyear into a loss of $373m for the December quarter, compared to a profit of more than $2.1bn a year earlier.Excluding the Venezuela write-off, net income came in at $257m.Major US companies with exposure to Venezuela – including Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, American Airlines, PepsiCo, AT&T and Ford Motor – have been collectively forced to take billions of dollars of write downs in recent years as Venezuela’s currency problems accelerate.Unlike bleach maker Clorox, which exited Venezuela altogether 16 months ago, Goodyear said it continues to maintain manufacturing and sales operations in the country.But like its peers, it has decided deconsolidate and write off nearly all of its cash and investment there amid little sign that it would be able to take the cash out of the country. The move comes as soaring inflation and the fast depreciating bolivar render the value of its bolivars lower by the day. Foreign currency exchange losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte came in at $34m for the 2015 year, Goodyear said.Goodyear generates nearly half of its revenues from outside North America and the collapse of a number of major developed and emerging market currencies against the dollar has sharply eroded the value of its sales in those countries.Sales for the fourth quarter were $4.1bn, compared to $4.4bn a year ago.“Sales were impacted by $339 million in unfavorable foreign currency translation,” the company said in a statement.Shares in Goodyear, up 4 per cent over the past 12 months, were largely unchanged in pre-market trading.
101;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Super Bowl ads capitalise on bumper day with new angles;CBS eyes record Super Bowl viewing as advertisers go digital for product push;"When is 30 seconds worth $5m? That is the question that faced Super Bowl advertisers as they geared up for February 7, the biggest day in US marketing.The price tag that broadcaster CBS was charging for a television commercial for this year’s National Football League championship game was double the average $2.5m price a decade ago, according to Kantar Media.But the game regularly breaks US TV viewing records, with 114m people tuning in last year. This Sunday’s pie was set to be even bigger, with CBS for the first time making its livestream of the game and all national commercials available over internet TV boxes including Apple TV and Roku.Advertisers were teasing their ads well before game day, using digital channels to extend their reach.“We’re seeing folks wanting to put their campaigns up earlier and earlier,” says Tara Walpert Levy, managing director of agency sales for Google.Google’s YouTube has been a destination for several years to promote Super Bowl ads, but the video site increasingly faces competition from Facebook, the other giant in online advertising.The social network, whose users watch 100m hours of video each day, says its ads complement television campaigns by targeting consumers on mobile devices. Facebook has signed up brands including Priceline, BMW’s Mini USA and Nestlé’s Butterfinger, promising that “priming” viewers online before showing them TV commercials would make them more likely to buy a product.YouTube touts its metrics which show that advertisers that put up their ads early on its AdBlitz site get twice the views and three times the social shares as those that wait to release their ads during the game. Last year, people watched 14m hours of Super Bowl ads on YouTube, with 60 per cent of viewers tuning in on mobile phones.“We have stopped thinking about the Super Bowl as a one-day event. Our campaign starts when the NFL season starts,” says Ram Krishnan, chief marketing officer at PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay, maker of Doritos and other snacks.Sunday’s matchup between the Carolina Panthers and the Denver Broncos brings the 10th and final instalment of “Crash the Super Bowl”, Doritos’ annual contest that invites fans to create their own Super Bowl ad for the crisps.It is being replaced by “Legion of the Bold”, another programme that encourages fans to create Doritos ads throughout the year.“Our focus is, ‘How do you have an ongoing conversation with the consumer versus just a one-way message at them during the game?’” says Mr Krishnan.Seth Kaufman, chief marketing officer for Pepsi’s North American beverage business, takes a similarly long-range view. The company has spent $172m in Super Bowl advertising over the past decade, according to Kantar. This year it is running one ad for its namesake cola and another for its Mountain Dew Kickstart drink, in addition to sponsoring the halftime show featuring Beyoncé and Coldplay.“We are thinking about how we leverage the Super Bowl, not just leading into the game, but coming out of it,” he says.Frito-Lay’s Mr Krishnan notes that the two weeks leading up to the NFL’s finale is one of the strongest sales periods for beverages and snacks.The company is creating 75,000 in-store displays to promote its products, hoping for a hefty portion of the 177m pounds of snacks Americans were due to eat during the game.Taco Bell was using its return to the Super Bowl to launch a new product. The fast-food chain began running teasers last week encouraging curious consumers to pre-order the mystery item before it landed in restaurants on Monday.“The new teaser is the postgame extension. If you’re an advertiser that is going to spend this kind of money, your return on investment shouldn’t end at the end of the game,” says Mike Sheldon, chief executive of Deutsch North America, Taco Bell’s advertising agency.The new teaser is the postgame extension. If you’re an advertiser that is going to spend this kind of money, your return on investment shouldn’t end at the end of the gameHow much pay-off can an advertiser expect from a Super Bowl bet?Wix.com, a website development company, credits some of its 34 per cent growth in registered users and 46 per cent boost in premium subscriptions in the first nine months of 2015 to its inaugural Super Bowl ad in last year’s game.The company was returning on Sunday with a TV ad and a multimedia campaign including a YouTube spot to be streamed during the game. Wix is one of the first marketers using Google’s new “real-time” advertising product, which places ads on the video site in response to what happens during televised events.Adobe, the software maker, estimates that brands that advertise during the Super Bowl see traffic to their websites jump more than 60 per cent, a boost that can last for more than three weeks after the game.“Advertisers should consider doing strong digital marketing in that period,” says Ann Lewnes, chief marketing officer. The most popular Super Bowl ads have a viral afterlife on social media that lasts on average 25 days, she added.Hyundai, the South Korean carmaker, was also coming back to the Super Bowl after a year off. Eric Springer, chief creative officer of Innocean, the carmaker’s agency, says the success of its Super Bowl commercials will be measured in part by monitoring social media chatter.“It’s about how well we own Twitter. If you can get people as engaged as possible from now through the Super Bowl — and to continue talking about it after — then you are really making the most of your money,” he says.But establishing a direct connection between social buzz and sales of Hyundai’s cars is not simple, he acknowledged.“Is it trackable how many Elantras they sell? Absolutely,” he says. “Can we take credit? That’s harder to do. But it certainly does not hurt to get that social conversation going.”Social media mentions are not always a sign of success, however. Last year, insurer Nationwide was the second-most mentioned brand on Twitter during the game, according to Salesforce Marketing Cloud. But three-quarters of those conversations were negative as viewers vented their disgust with Nationwide’s ad about a dead child, and the insurer had to issue an apology.The company is sitting out this year’s game.As thousands of football fans poured into the San Francisco Bay Area ahead of the Super Bowl, the start-ups of Silicon Valley were hoping to make their mark, writes Leslie Hook in San Francisco. Companies including Uber and Airbnb are hoping to reach new fans.Uber, the ride-hailing app, announced its first ever mass transit partnership with Caltrain, the commuter rail service, to mark the event. The new service allows riders to carpool to and from train stations in the Bay Area, including stops near Levi’s Stadium, to help ease congestion. The company’s promotions ahead of the game include events with football stars, and delivery of chicken wings, a classic American football food, during the game on Sunday.However, a protest over fare cuts by Uber drivers threatened to disrupt traffic around San Francisco International airport on Super Bowl Sunday, a move that could be embarrassing for the transport company in its home town area.Airbnb, the home-sharing company, was expecting a surge in guests at the weekend. The company forecast 15,000 would come to the Bay Area, quadruple the figure from last year’s Super Bowl. Airbnb says that its nightly rates have stayed around $225 on average despite the surge.However, some entrepreneurial hosts who live near the stadium jacked their fees up to more than $6,000 per night for the weekend.Both Uber and Airbnb see big events like conferences or sports matches as an important part of their business, and have been working to integrate better with such occasions. Airbnb was providing extra safety tips for Super Bowl hosts and guests, for example, and at this summer’s Rio Olympics the company will be an official service provider.When the Super Bowl kicked off on Sunday, it was in the heart of the classic Silicon Valley — just a short walk from the headquarters of companies like Intel and Oracle. But it was the newer arrivals who were hoping they could capture the game.shannon.bond@ft.com

102;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2016-01-22T10:13:19Z;Leaked proposal: Plugging up the LuxLeaks;;Next week, the European Commission will take its latest step in its ongoing quest to move beyond the LuxLeaks corporate tax avoidance scandal that has periodically dogged President Jean-Claude Juncker.Pierre Moscovici, the EU’s tax policy chief, is set to unveil a flurry of proposals aimed at tackling so-called base erosion and profit shifting: in other words the aggressive tactics used by multinationals to shrink their tax bills by as much as possible. This morning, we’ve done a story about the new proposals, which we obtained. But we’ve also now posted them here for others to read.The so-called LuxLeaks revelations emerged shortly after Mr Juncker became commission president in November 2014, and dogged his early days in office. They documented how during his two decades as Luxembourg prime minister, up to 340 multinational companies, ranging from Ikea to Pepsi, funnelled profits through the tiny country to lower their tax bills to as little as 1 per cent.The commission has embarked on a wave of regulatory changes to close loopholes, including making a renewed push for the longstanding EU goal of having a common consolidated corporate tax base for companies. It is also pursuing high profile competition cases against tax deals Luxembourg and others struck with multinationals such as Apple, Amazon and Fiat.Most recently, the European Commission ordered Belgium to recoup about €700m from 35 multinational companies that have benefited from the country’s generous fiscal incentive scheme.Mr Moscovici’s plans, which are outlined in a 13-page summary posted here, enshrine international agreements reached by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development into EU law, and in some cases go even further – notably when it comes to restricting the ability of companies to shift of profits from parent companies to lightly taxed subsidiaries.In other areas, campaigners say the measures fall short. While they toughen rules on the information companies must disclose on taxes paid to individual governments, contained in a draft directive posted here, the data won’t be made public.Social NGOs such as the European Network on Debt and Development point out that this step would be a major advance in preventing large companies playing governments off against one another.Another bugbear is that the plans don’t tackle what campaigners call the “Amazon scenario” – the issue of a company avoiding paying tax in a country because they aren’t considered as having a permanent establishment there.One key issue will be how much of the Commission plans finally make it into law. As every long-suffering former EU tax commissioner knows, getting this type of regulation through requires unanimous approval from governments, something which historically has proved a major challenge to obtain.Nations have paid a lot of lip service to tackling tax avoidance. Moving on from an era where governments aggressively compete with one another to attract multinationals into a new era where they work together to make sure companies pay their fair share has always proven harder. The Moscovici plans will be one litmus test of how serious they really are.
103;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

Ms Nooyi graduated from Yale in 1980.Edward Snyder, the inaugural Indra Nooyi dean, says the fact that Ms Nooyi, was born outside the US is a positive signal for a school that has aspirations to be one of the world’s most global management institutions. Ms Nooyi is also one of the few women to give a substantial donation to a business school.This is not the first time that the PepsiCo boss has donated to the school — indeed a classroom is already named after her, following a previous substantial gift. She has also been a member of the Yale Corporation, the governing board and policymaking body for the university.Prof Snyder, who joined Yale as dean in 2011, was recently appointed to a second five-year term at the school. Since 2012, he has spearheaded the formation of the Global Network for Advanced Management, which comprises 27 top business schools from around the world. These include big-brand schools such as Insead, Berkeley Haas, Fudan and HEC Paris as well as schools in emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.

106;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Pope and Kim Kardashian help turn emojis into marketing phenomenon;Messaging icons move beyond smiley faces to emerge as new social vernacular and commercial opportunity;What do the Pope, Pepsi, Playtex tampons and reality-television star Kim Kardashian have in common? They all exist in emoji form, the messaging icons that have gone beyond smiley faces to become a marketing phenomenon.On Monday, Ms Kardashian released a set of emojis themed on her, on to the App Store. Popemoji is a set of cartoon icons developed by Swyft Media to coincide with the pontiff’s visit to the US earlier this year.Pepsi has made a short film and an emoji keyboard while Playtex uses emoji sentiment analysis to understand how women are feeling about its products.“It’s been this concentrated burst of emoji fever,” says Robert Candelino, vice-president and general manager for haircare at Unilever, the consumer goods group. “We saw emojis emerging as this new social vernacular, by which three-quarters of people in [the US] are communicating in a daily basis.”Consumers are spending more time in messaging apps from Facebook Messenger to Instagram, the photo-sharing site on which nearly half the captions contain an emoji, and less time where marketers have been used to reaching them: in front of the TV.Emojis are also becoming a business, with start-ups employing teams of artists to design up-to-the-minute images and advising marketers eager to become part of consumers’ conversations.“Emojis are the largest shift in consumer behaviour on the internet since social media,” says Travis Montaque, founder of Emogi, a marketing data company.Walt Disney, the media group, allowed Twitter users who used the hashtag #StarWars on Twitter to automatically insert an icon of a droid into a tweet. You can order a pizza from Domino’s by simply sending a pizza emoji via SMS.Brands want to create a “visual lexicon” that people can incorporate into their online conversations, says Christian Brucculeri, chief executive of Snaps, a company that creates branded content, such as emojis, “stickers” and gifs.The company has worked with 75 brands including fast-food chain Burger King, Unilever and Comedy Central, the television network, and says users have shared 100m images through messaging and social media.The company is working on a new product for retailers that will attach emojis to digital coupons, which consumers can add to their mobile wallets and use in stores.“We are seeing an increase in visual communications among consumers. Brands want to be part of that, whether with emojis or gifs and videos or animated experiences,” says Mr Brucculeri.For Unilever’s Dove brand, Snaps made an emoji keyboard consisting of 27 curly-haired women with various hair lengths, hair colours and skin tones, as part of its “Love Your Curls” campaign. The keyboard has been downloaded more than 850,000 times since its launch on November 4.For the second season of the Comedy Central sitcom Broad City, an emoji, sticker and gif keyboard were aimed at “superfans” who might spread the word about the show, says Lesley Robin, director of social strategy. “We’re always looking to reach our fans where they already are, using their existing behaviours,” she says. “Fans of Broad City are heavily into messaging: texting their girlfriends, using emojis on various apps.”Evan Wray, co-founder of Swyft media, says that if companies are strategic about their approach, a consumer can quickly become “brand advocate”. For example, placing a Dell laptop emoji in a “Back to School keyboard” or creating a L’Oréal set of emojis that people want to share with friends and family.“Three to four years ago, in every meeting people were talking about disruption: how do we break through the clutter?” says Ms Robin. “Now the real key is figuring out how people are interacting with new technology and new platforms and taking advantage of that behaviour.

107;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Pepsi drops sponsorship of scandal-hit Indian cricket league;US beverage maker ends sponsorship of Premier League tournament 2 years early;PepsiCo has pulled out of a Rs4bn ($62m) sponsorship deal with the Indian Premier League cricket tournament, dealing a further blow to the lucrative but scandal-plagued annual event.The US-based beverage group signed a five-year title sponsorship arrangement in 2012, but formally ended its association with the event on Sunday after just three seasons.The Board Of Control For Cricket In India, the sport’s governing body and the IPL’s owners, said Chinese phonemaker Vivo Electronics would become the IPL’s title sponsor for the two remaining seasons of Pepsi’s contract.Neither the BCCI nor PepsiCo commented on the reason for the termination. The BCCI also gave no details of the financial deal struck with Vivo, although in a statement it said the Chinese company would provide a bank guarantee for payment in the “next 10 days”.However, reports earlier this month in the Indian Express newspaper suggested that PepsiCo had sent a termination notice to the BCCI citing issues relating to the governance of the IPL. The US group declined to comment on the document.“Losing a global company like Pepsi is obviously a blow,” said Ayaz Memon, a Mumbai-based cricket writer and commentator. “They seem to have become fed up with these governance problems, and decided it wasn’t worth the reputation problems.”Since launching in 2009, the IPL has attracted huge audiences with its television-friendly shorter cricket format and showbiz razzmatazz, in turn convincing companies such as PepsiCo and UK-based telecommunications group Vodafone to sign up as sponsors as a means to connect with India’s sports-mad public.Blow for sponsors and broadcasters of lucrative Indian Premier League as two sides banned for two yearsRead moreBut despite its financial successes, the event has also been hit by repeated management bust-ups and corruption allegations. Most seriously a handful of players and administrators were caught up in a betting and match-fixing scandal in 2013.PepsiCo’s pullout is the latest aftershock of that scandal, which ultimately saw two of the tournament’s eight teams suspended in July, following an investigation led by a former Indian Supreme Court judge.On Sunday, the BCCI confirmed that it planned to hold an auction to create temporary teams to replace the banned franchises for the next two years.In a statement, Vipul Prakash, a vice-president at PepsiCo in India, said that the group’s termination decision had been “mutually agreed” with the BCCI. “We will continue to associate with sports and cricket as a platform to connect with our consumers,” he said.Vivo Electronics, which is relatively minor player in India’s fast-growing smartphone market, could not be reached for comment.However, the Chinese group’s decision to become a sponsor makes it the latest in a line of mobile and e-commerce groups to sign up with the IPL as they seek to build brand awareness in India.Online retailers such as India’s Flipkart and US-based Amazon advertised heavily during the most recent season, which ended in May. Indian mobile commerce company Paytm, which is backed by China’s Alibaba, has also been exploring potential sponsorship deals with the BCCI.

• 4CAST Economic CalendarDiary commentary from FT reporters; data and company announcements, unless otherwise stated, from Thomson Reuters. Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.Morgan Stanley performs its usual function of bringing down the curtain on earnings for the big US banks and brokers. Like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America, it is likely to report a big drop in bond trading from a much livelier period between July and September last year.But investors will be focused more on the effects of that muted quarter for markets on Morgan Stanley’s core wealth management unit, which runs a gamut from mass-affluent to ultra-high net worth. The bank had been doing very well in stock-based lending, but how did that business hold up as the market plunged then staged a very wobbly recovery? Were clients spooked into pulling assets from actively-managed funds?A day after Morgan Stanley comes BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custody bank, where analysts will be watching for progress on cost cuts. In a world of near-zero interest rates, no one is expecting a lot of growth. But at a Barclays conference last month, almost two-thirds of investors said they welcomed the recent arrival of a pair of activists on the shareholder register. Ben McLannahanEARNINGSIBM Q3 $3.32 ($3.68)Morgan Stanley Q3 $0.63 ($0.65)Whitbread releases its first-half results and has steered that like-for-like sales will be up 3.9 per cent and total sales up 11.8 per cent for the six months to August 13.Costa Coffee, perhaps the jewel in Whitbread’s crown, saw sales rise 16.2 per cent worldwide and 14.8 per cent in the UK. The coffee chain has already switched to paying the new national living wage, with anyone who has completed its training now earning at least £7.40 an hour, with extra payments for staff in London.Analysts are expecting further clarity from Whitbread on its higher wage bill, while the company has said it is exploring how to trim spending in other areas. “We shall mitigate the substantial cost increase over time with a combination of productivity improvements, efficiency savings and some selective price increases,” said Andy Harrison, Whitbread’s chief executive.Premier Inn grew its sales by 11.6 per cent and said that occupancy had remained at 87 per cent in the first half. In London, sales grew by 21.1 per cent as Premier Inn opened 20.3 per cent more rooms. Jamie Rollo, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, expects earnings per share to grow by 13 per cent. Malcolm MooreEARNINGSBank of New York Mellon Q3 $0.71 ($0.64)Lockheed Martin Q3 $2.72 ($2.76)Whitbread H1 126.27p (110.58p)After nearly two years as General Motors’ chief executive Mary Barra will publish her first quarterly results not overshadowed by the continuing fallout from the company’s ignition switch scandal.The scandal — involving ignition switches that could move while the vehicle was being driven out of the “drive” position, disabling the engine and airbags — started to emerge in February last year, just after Ms Barra took over in January. The company put most of the issues related to the scandal behind it on September 17 when it agreed to pay a $900m criminal fine and settled many of the civil claims.The settlement means, although GM will take a $575m charge for the quarter to cover the costs, that investors’ focus will once again be firmly on core performance. Most important questions are likely to be how GM is coping with the sharp slowdown in growth in demand for cars in China and whether it is managing to increase North American profits amid booming conditions.The company is seeking to achieve 10 per cent margins on adjusted earnings before interest and tax in North America by next year. In China, meanwhile, it is seeking to encourage consumers to buy higher-margin vehicles, such as its Buick premium and Cadillac luxury brands, to improve profits as sales growth slows.Analysts expect the company to report earnings per share for the quarter of $1.19, up 47 per cent on last year’s third quarter, on sales down 2 per cent to $38.3bn. Adjusted net income, which excludes one-off expenses like the settlement charge, is projected at $1.89bn. Robert WrightSimilar to rival PepsiCo, Coca-Cola’s third-quarter earnings will probably reflect its struggle to mitigate the effect of the strong dollar and weaker macroeconomic environment in emerging markets.But analysts and investors will be looking for further signs that its efforts to reinvigorate domestic sales through smaller packaging, and its focus on soft drinks and water are paying off.Consensus analyst estimates are for sales to drop 3.5 per cent to $11.6bn, producing 50.1 cents a share, or net income of $2.2bn, a 6.3 per cent decline.Coca-Cola’s extensive overseas operations make it even more vulnerable to currency swings and its focus on soft drinks alone also sets it apart from rival Pepsi, which has the Frito-Lay snacks business in its portfolio.Investors will also be keen to hear from executives about how they will react to the recently-agreed deal whereby SABMiller is to be acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev. SAB has a distribution agreement in Africa with Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, while AB InBev has a relationship with Pepsi in Latin America.In the run-up to a deal being agreed, Coke has declined to disclose its thinking. The merger may make it impossible to maintain both relationships. But it is worth remembering that Warren Buffett has a sizeable stake in Coke and he has partnered on a number of consumer deals with 3G Capital, the private equity group, the founders of which are key investors in AB InBev and are driving this merger with SAB. Lindsay WhippOnline marketplace eBay is set to report third-quarter results, the first full quarter since its separation from PayPal was completed. It has struggled to increase revenues in recent quarters, amid intense competition from rival Amazon. Last quarter, eBay saw a drop in gross merchandising volume from the previous year, resulting in lower revenues.The fast-growing payments subsidiary PayPal was spun off in July, following pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn. EBay’s share price has slipped 14 per cent since the spin-off, amid broader market weakness.Analysts expect that the company may report weak revenues again for the third quarter. In a recent note, Barclays said third-party tracking services had highlighted potentially disappointing revenue growth. “Spending on growth and products is still needed,” analysts wrote. “It may take a bit longer to see revenue growth, margin expansion and real material capital return.” The bank expects consolidated revenue of $2.1bn in the quarter, down 4 per cent from the year prior. Leslie HookThere is no doubt that, when Boeing reports its third-quarter results the commercial and military aircraft maker will be able to report revenue rises, based on increased numbers of aircraft deliveries. The company announced on October 5 that it had delivered 199 commercial aircraft in the June to September quarter, a 7 per cent increase on the same period last year.However, there are likely to be continuing questions about whether the company is maximising the profitability of some of its critical programmes. The company said in July that it cost an average $23.2m more to produce each of its 787 Dreamliner jets than it earned from selling it. It also announced ahead of those second-quarter figures that it was taking a $536m post-tax charge for its $35bn KC-46 air tanker programme for the US military.Investors will hope for encouraging news on both aircraft. Analysts already expect earnings per share up sharply — by 14 per cent against last year’s third quarter — to $2.17. Sales are expected to show a 3.5 per cent increase, to $24.6bn.

Analysts had expected the drug to contribute $800m of revenue in 2020, rising to $2.6bn in 2025, and many downgraded their targets for the company after the news.More positively, the company recently released a study into its diabetes drug Januvia, which showed it is the first of its kind to reduce the risk of death by a serious cardiovascular event, a finding that is expected to drive increased take-up of the product.Wall Street analysts are typically expecting the company to report earnings per share of 75 cents on $4.98bn in sales.

109;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-10-11T01:28:40Z;European fund groups warn tax rules could harm economy;Corporate transparency measures could harm the economy, say Efama and Aima;Two of Europe’s most influential fund associations have urged Brussels not to implement a number of corporate tax transparency measures over fears the changes would harm the European economy.The European Fund and Asset Management Association, which represents the interests of mainstream fund companies, and the Alternative Investment Management Association, which represents international hedge fund managers, raised their concerns in feedback to a European Commission consultation on corporate tax transparency.Their recommendations are likely to fly in the face of consumer sentiment. Large corporations including Apple, Google and Starbucks have come under fire from politicians and the media in recent years over their tax arrangements.Hundreds of companies also faced public ire earlier this year after it emerged that Luxembourg had granted sweetheart tax deals to groups ranging from Pepsi to Ikea.The commission’s consultation set out a number of options to improve corporate tax transparency across Europe, such as whether companies should be required to publicly disclose the taxes they pay in every country where they operate.In its initial consultation document, the commission said: “Some companies currently generate large profits in the single market, but pay little or no tax in the EU. Some multinationals are able to use aggressive tax planning, national mismatches and legal loopholes due to their presence in multiple jurisdictions.“Their use of complex corporate structures often puts small and medium enterprises at a disadvantage. It may also distort competition and pit EU and non-EU companies within the single market against each other.”Efama warned that enforcing tax transparency rules in Europe that were stricter than elsewhere would put domestic companies “at a competitive disadvantage”.The fund body added that additional tax reporting requirements would require “significant investments and technical expertise, and, potentially, would entail the disclosure of data and information that may be of a strategic or confidential nature”.Both trade associations also urged the commission not to force companies to disclose their tax affairs publicly. They were concerned that this could lead to “unjustified reputational damage” for companies seen to have beneficial tax arrangements.Efama said: “There are legitimate reasons for an enterprise not to be in the same tax situation as its competitors (eg different business model) or in situations where it appears to be paying a low level of taxes (eg use of existing tax losses).“[By making such tax information public] competitors would potentially have access to sensitive technical or commercial information essential to the activities carried out and this could put the enterprise at economic risk, [and] further increase their communication and compliance costs.”Aima also warned that public tax disclosures could be misinterpreted by the public and other interested parties, such as the press.The hedge fund body said: “The media often tries to piece together incomplete information that exists in securities filings, court papers and leaked documents, forcing entities to react on allegations rather than referring to accurate facts.”Christian Aid, the non-profit organisation that has campaigned against aggressive corporate tax practices, argued in favour of public disclosure of tax policies and payments.The non-profit believes public disclosure would provide a “deterrent effect” to corporate tax avoidance.
110;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-10-09T08:38:15Z;US equity dividend growth under pressure;Cash payouts threatened by economy worries and lacklustre earnings outlook;With the US bond market signalling no shift in the current low interest rate climate, equity investors face a tougher time securing a stream of ever rising dividend income from companies.While S&P 500 dividend payments continue to set records, the pace of growth has decelerated, as fears of a global slowdown keep executives from pumping up shareholder returns. The average dividend has increased 13.5 per cent for S&P 500 companies so far in 2015, compared with a 17.3 per cent rise a year earlier, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Cash payouts, as well as stock buybacks, have come under threat from concerns over economic growth and lacklustre earnings forecasts. Companies seeking to tap bond markets for shareholder friendly activities and mergers and acquisitions have been forced to increase interest payments to secure funding.“We’re not seeing many of the dividend increases we’d see in the past,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank, said. “Part of it was companies hoarding cash and it finally took someone like Carl Icahn to shake up Apple and get something moving. But left to their own devices, company management really does not want to stick their neck out.”In recent years, yield-starved investors have sought shares that pay hefty dividends, a point of attraction for stocks such as McDonald’s, Walmart and Exxon. The appeal of dividends remains strong, particularly as Wall Street economists and strategists are cutting their forecasts for where the benchmark 10-year Treasury will end the year.The benchmark yield is seen by some as falling back towards 2 per cent, as the market believes the Federal Reserve will not tighten interest rate policy until next year. That outlook has prompted investors to buy shares in utilities, with the sector having climbed 6.1 per cent since the end of June, outpacing all other sectors in the S&P 500.So-called dividend aristocrats, companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently raised dividends each year for the last 25 years, have also found a renewed bid. The total return from the group is roughly flat since the second half began, in contrast to a 1.8 per cent decline by the S&P 500.Companies are loath to cut dividends, a signal that the board of directors and management see the long-term earnings power diminishing. Buybacks tend to be more episodic. More than a tenth of the companies within the S&P 500 are on the aristocrats list, including 3M, AT&T, Chevron and PepsiCo.Strategists have warned that these companies may have difficulty continuing the run of increases, particularly those in the energy and materials complex that are under pressure from the drop in commodity prices.“The chances that dividend growth is in line with the last five years over the next couple of years is pretty remote,” Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, said. “Corporations want to see top-line growth before they start estimating earnings power.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
111;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-10-08T12:14:31Z;Real life catches up with the fantasy on Back to the Future Day;Flying cars, hoverboards and fax machines: how much did the 1980s film get right about 2015?;Well, the time machine presumably never came about — otherwise we would by now be inundated with travellers from the future trying to put right the stupid things we all got wrong (or they messed up themselves). But how did the other predictions from Back to the Future II fare?In the 1980s film, teenager Marty McFly is transported 30 years into the future to October 21 2015. Fans will this month mark the moment when real life catches up with the fantasy, dubbed “Back to the Future Day”.When they attend special cinema screenings of the movie or purchase a retro-futuristic Pepsi, they need not feel totally cheated by how it all panned out. The streets may not be full of the hoverboards Marty used instead of a skateboard but one US company, Arx Pax, raised more than $500,000 on Kickstarter last year in an effort to produce “Hendo Hoverboards”.The movie also shows people receiving phone calls on a visor not a million miles from the Google Glass. The scene at the dinner table where each family member is absorbed in their own devices seems pretty prescient too. The house of the future, meanwhile, features a thumbprint recognition lock, now a well-established technology.Inside the house, the view outside ap­pears on a screen rather than through a window. Curiously, we seem wedded to natural light and views, even though this technology exists in spades.What has become more familiar is teleconferencing, a large flatscreen on the wall allows a video conversation with a colleague, although when he gets fired Marty’s notice is printed via a futuristic fax machine, something that only seems to survive in US lawyers’ of­fices. Lawyers, incidentally, have become a thing of the past in the film. That didn’t quite work out.Back to the Future II’s flying cars are not quite mainstream but they too are here. Terrafugia has publicly test-flown its Transition model and is aiming even higher with the development of its elegant TF-X, with its mix of rotor (for take off and landing) and engine propulsion.Then there are Marty’s self-tying shoes, also (almost) here. Another Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign led to the Canadian Powerlace, an athletic shoe designed automatically to tighten to the wearer’s foot. The rejuvenation clinic has proved another miss, though the full-body blood transfusion at least lives on as a Keith Richards myth.If there is a big gap it is probably in the failure to predict anything resembling the internet and the ubiquitous smartphone. By contrast, in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1969), one of the astronauts is using something that looks exactly like an iPad.On the other hand, the urban realm itself has some interesting touches. The original Back to the Future in 1985 grew out of a period of nostalgia for the family values and small-town community of the 1950s (the then-US president Ronald Reagan is said to have loved the film and even quoted it in a State of the Union address). In keeping with this nostalgic mood, the 1980s version of the fictional town centre at the heart of the story is shabby and run down.In the future, however, it has been revived in a postmodern makeover with a retro café and glazed portico to the town hall. Buildings more in keeping with the early 1970s than the post-1980s have cropped up around the square. Does it predict the urban re­vival and the gradual move back to the city centre from the suburbs?More than anything, it is the clothing that shows how difficult it is to make predictions. Nothing dates faster than the future. The current 1980s revival in fashion shows that sometimes it is not worth depicting the future at all. Whatever we are wearing today will come around again.
112;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Dollar strength is only part of US earnings hit;Impact across the S&P 500 depends on how much companies sell at home and how much abroad;"Blame the dollar. That is what US companies are likely to say during the next few weeks as they report third-quarter earnings. SABMiller, PepsiCo and Yum Brands have already expressed their displeasure.And the dollar gripes will not just be around for the next few weeks. Pepsi, which this week warned that FX translation would take 11 percentage points off full-year core earnings per share, said it expected to have to deal with a strong dollar “ for a few years to come”.But hang on. Has the dollar really been such a bind for US corporate revenues since the start of July? Its impact was certainly evident during the first quarter, when the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its peers, rose an eye-watering 15 per cent.Barclays said in April the dollar’s strength was translating into a 5 per cent cut in S&P 500 revenues, though earnings estimates had adjusted to reflect this loss.But since April the dollar index has waned, as the Federal Reserve damped rate rise expectations. Hopes of a September move had driven the dollar’s first-quarter advance. In the second quarter the index fell 3 per cent, while the third quarter has recorded a slight rise of 0.8 per cent.The difference is that while the dollar trod water with partners such as the euro and the yen, it continued to play merry hell across emerging market currencies.So the pain of dollar strength will be felt by US companies that have EM exposure. Only there are not that many.Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC, says US groups are relatively underexposed internationally — a third of their revenues come from overseas. And of that international component, only 7 per cent is from EM.European companies have much greater EM exposure. The likes of Daimler, BMW, Rémy Cointreau and Banco Santander derive more than half their sales from abroad, says HSBC.European exporters would have loved the 21 per cent decline of the euro against the dollar in the five months leading up to March 2015 — but not its 7 per cent rise since then.But back to their US counterparts. To get greater clarity on which US companies are affected by dollar movements, analysts have been looking at them on a sector basis.Some sectors, such as telecoms and utilities, are almost exclusively domestic in nature, says Hamish Pepper, currency strategist at Barclays.“There is no consistent relationship between the S&P 500 and dollar movements,” he says.But information technology, materials, energy and industrials derive about half their sales from abroad, he says.Companies such as Qualcomm, Flextronics and Texas Instruments fall into this category, according to data complied by HSBC.But a strong dollar also hurts those US retailers and speciality stores that rely on overseas visitors, such as Fossil Group and Abercrombie & Fitch. Nomura expects a bad first half of the year to be followed by a worse second half for this sector because of FX pressures.Based on actual and estimated third-quarter reports, the impact on earnings across the S&P 500 is clear, and depends on how much US companies sell at home and how much abroad.FactSet says growth rates for S&P 500 groups with more than half their sales abroad are likely to be 15 per cent down. Excluding the energy sector, the decline falls to 5.7 per cent.Those with more than half their sales at home are heading for a 2.3 per cent rise, or 7.8 per cent discounting energy.But it’s not all about the dollar. Mr Laidler says weakness in US earnings is “much more due to low oil prices, which will impact the energy sector in the short term; 30-year-high US corporate margins; and sluggish topline growth”.No wonder it can seem easier to blame the dollar."
113;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-10-07T14:35:02Z;Third-quarter EM pain for dollar earners;Earnings hit to be felt most by US exporters to emerging markets;US companies with global operations focused on emerging market countries are bracing for weaker earnings courtesy of a stronger dollar as the quarterly results season unfolds over the coming weeks.Investors soured on the S&P 500 during the third quarter, alarmed by signs of slowing global growth, led by China and other emerging market countries.Now, as S&P 500 companies report results and outline their prospects for the rest of the year and early 2016, investors expect weakness from EM operations will be offset by the dollar trading relatively steadily against major developed currency partners during the third quarter.In a sign of what beckons for US earnings, SABMiller this week revealed a big hit from the continuing weakness of emerging market currencies against the dollar. The London-based producer of Miller Lite, Grolsch and Peroni makes 70 per cent of its sales to emerging markets.PepsiCo, the US snacks and beverage group, also saw roughly $2bn sliced off revenues in its just-completed quarter as currency swings cut into its sales abroad. Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Taco Bell and Dupont, also warned this week of the dollar’s impact on earnings.A strengthening dollar hurts US companies with large overseas operations since the same amount of money made outside the US is worth less when translated back into dollars.A blended rate of reported results and estimates shows third-quarter revenue for companies in the S&P 500 with less than 50 per cent of sales in the US fell 13 per cent year over year compared with a rise of about 1 per cent for those with more than half of sales in the US, according to FactSet.While the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its major peers such as the euro, sterling and Canadian dollar, rose only 0.8 per cent during the period, it significantly appreciated against emerging market currencies during the period.JPMorgan’s emerging market currency index, which measures the most heavily traded EM currencies against the dollar, is down 8.25 per cent.Indeed, investors said the impact of the dollar would be bifurcated.“Broadly speaking, if you look at the S&P 500 the impact of currency in the third quarter will be significantly less than in the first half of the year, but the impact will be in companies that are doing a lot of business in Russia, China or Latin America,” said Oliver Pursche, chief executive at Bruderman Brothers.The dollar will be less of a drag for US multinationals doing business in the western hemisphere as well as in Japan and Australia, he said.James Liu, global market strategist with JPMorgan Asset Management, sees “a light at the end of the tunnel” for the dollar and earnings.“The third quarter should be the last quarter we have these real negative year-on-year comparisons,” he said.With the earnings season about to get under way, the Commerce Department this week reported that in August the gap between US exports and imports swelled more than 15 per cent to $48.3bn, highlighting how a strong dollar has affected the trade balance.
114;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-10-06T16:02:39Z;Pepsi expects strong dollar for ‘years to come’;Beverage group’s earnings hit by $1.4bn Venezuela charge;PepsiCo said it expected a strong dollar for “a few years to come”, as the snacks and beverage company said third-quarter earnings were held back by the currency and a $1.4bn charge related to Venezuela.The strong dollar has posed challenges for many American multinationals, eroding the competitiveness of their products in overseas markets. But it also reflects the weakening external macroeconomic environment that companies are grappling with, particularly in emerging markets such as China and Brazil.Revenue dropped 5 per cent to $16.3bn in the three months ended September 5, a decline that was less than analysts had forecast, while operating profit dropped by half to $1.42bn. Excluding the negative currency effect, sales rose 7 per cent and operating profit increased 12 per cent.Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, said that while the year-on-year impact from the falling Russian rouble should start to dissipate at the end of the year, the falling Mexican peso and Brazilian real should continue to have a negative impact on the company.“The expectation is the dollar will probably be relatively strong for a few years to come,” Mr Johnston told the Financial Times after the company reported its third-quarter earnings.PepsiCo has managed partially to mitigate the effect of the strong dollar and slower global growth thanks to resilience in North America, which accounts for 60 per cent of sales and two-thirds of operating profit. Higher sales of still drinks, as customers shift away from its namesake Pepsi and other soda, helped drive a 4 per cent increase in sales in its beverages business and a 14 per cent increase in operating profit.Frito-Lay snacks, which gives the company a further diversification away from declining sales of soda that rival Coca-Cola lacks, also recorded higher revenue and profit of 1 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.The company has been increasing productivity as part of a plan to reduce $5bn in costs by 2019. It is increasing automation at its packaging factories, outsourcing some of its financial back-office operations and has implemented its own version of zero-based budgeting where each cost must be approved at the start of each year.Its cost savings, which should tally $1bn this year, are partly being reinvested for innovation. Customers are demanding healthier snacks and drinks and in smaller packaging.Venezuela has been a particular problem for companies including Pepsi. The multiple exchange rate mechanisms, dwindling access to the greenback and difficulty in importing some products triggered Pepsi’s decision to deconsolidate its subsidiaries and joint venture from its income statement. This caused a $1.4bn one-off charge, pushing its net income down 73 per cent to $543m.The shift away from soda was underscored by the company’s volumes during the period. Still drinks rose 10 per cent, helped by Gatorade, which has a top market share in energy drinks, and carbonated soda was down 2 per cent. Diet drinks dropped 6 per cent, while non-diet fell 1 per cent.In late August, Pepsi, unlike rival Coca-Cola, removed aspartame from its Diet Pepsi to replace it with sucralose amid health concerns. Mr Johnston said that while it was too early to give any sales figures, the initial indications from social media were that consumers “liked the concept” and those who had tasted it had liked the flavour.Mr Johnston said that convenience stores were emerging as a solid corner of demand for PepsiCo, recording a 5 per cent increase in like-for-like sales in the quarter.Investors focused on the positive aspects of Pepsi’s earnings, which included raising its earnings per share forecast from 8 to 9 per cent growth, excluding foreign exchange swings and extraordinary items.Shares in the company were trading 1.7 per cent higher at $97.44 in early trading in New York.

the ensuing stock market rout have sent shockwaves around a financially troubled world that has been banking on China to stimulate demand.But while sales of luxury goods from Prada handbags to Rolls-Royce cars have slumped, some companies focused on ordinary consumers in China are finding ways to maintain their businesses, selling more washing machines and rice crackers as the economy slows.Analysts say the dramatic, negative headlines belie a vast, complex and increasingly competitive consumer market where companies have to fight harder to boost their sales, whether by offering cheaper, smaller package sizes at the lower end or improving their products and customer service.Retail sales have been growing at an annualised 10 per cent in recent months, according to official data, but analysts are sceptical about the government’s figures and believe that even in the best case they cover up wide divergences between companies.“Consumer demand has always been there in China and in the past it was easy for companies to grab it,” says Spencer Leung, a consumer industry analyst at UBS in Hong Kong. “But things have slowed down and only those who can offer differentiated goods can capture demand.”He says that multinational companies focused on the mass market in China have been particularly good at maintaining their performance as annual gross domestic product growth has dropped from more than 10 per cent in 2010 to 7 per cent in the second quarter this year.Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nike all reported expanding sales in China in their most recent updates, while Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, arrested the slide in his company’s shares on Monday after telling a US TV show host that he was seeing “strong growth” in China in July and August.Ben Cavender, an analyst at China Market Research Group in Shanghai, says that while the stock market turbulence has worried some consumers, few are directly exposed given that only 6 per cent of households own equities.The slowing economy, dragged down by the underperforming industrial and property sectors, has undoubtedly hit consumer confidence but it has also changed the way people buy.“People are still spending but they are more careful about how they spend, with more focus on features and functions, after-sales support and how products fit in their life,” says Mr Cavender.Samsonite, the suitcase maker, saw its China sales suffer over the past couple of years but delivered an annualised 28 per cent jump in sales in the first half of this year after it shifted its focus away from luxury to more affordable products.“Most consumer companies see that consumers in China are becoming smarter, they want to buy goods with better value,” says Ramesh Tainwala, Samsonite’s chief executive. “That trend was already starting over the last two years and will only continue.”Zhou Yunjie, chief executive of the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of Haier, China’s largest distributor of home appliances, says the company has mitigated the impact of the property slump in third and fourth-tier cities by becoming more nimble.28%jump in sales for Samsonite in the first half of this year after it shifted its focus to affordable productsHe explains that his division, Haier Electronics, has focused on selling high-tech washing machines to better-off consumers, promoting low-cost water heaters in rural areas and making a big push into e-commerce and logistics after signing a partnership with Alibaba, the Chinese internet group, in 2013.In the first half of the year, sales of air conditioners and refrigerators dropped but Haier Electronics reported an increase of 4-5 per cent in sales of washing machines and water heaters.“For white goods suppliers, sales really differ across categories,” says Catherine Chan, an analyst at Citigroup in Hong Kong. “Where we see growth, it is by increases in average sales prices, not just higher volumes, as people upgrade to better models.”Other leading consumer companies have seen similar divergences in their product lines.Want Want, which sells snacks and drinks, saw milk sales fall by 3 per cent year on year in the first half, while rice crackers sales jumped by 10 per cent because of promotional campaigns.Belle International, China’s biggest shoe retailer, closed 167 of its more than 20,000 stores in the three months to May as sales at its footwear shops dropped by 8 per cent year on year.But its sportswear stores increased sales by 12 per cent in the same period, as it capitalised on the rising fitness trend in China.Erwin Sanft, the head of China strategy at Macquarie in Hong Kong, says that while consumer companies have not delivered the stellar growth expected of them in the past, the best companies have managed to maintain their profits.“In other parts of the economy, like commodities and industrials, profits have been wiped out,” he explains. “When you include the growth of tourism, entertainment and e-commerce, we haven’t seen that much of a slowdown in the overall consumer sector.”Additional reporting by Gloria Cheung in Hong Kong and Jackie Cai in Shanghai
116;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-08-06T18:13:10Z;Pressure on Mondelez to take a bite out of costs;Example of 3G offers Bill Ackman a menu for more ambitious targets;"Oreos can be consumed in a single bite these days, thanks to the introduction of Oreo Thins. But Mondelez International, maker of the chocolate and cream biscuit, may need to bite off a bigger chunk out of its costs, following news on Wednesday that Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square fund had built a 7.5 per cent stake in the food group.It is not the first time that Mondelez, and its chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, have faced pressure from activist investors to cut costs. Early last year, the company allowed Nelson Peltz on to its board to make a case for savings, after he abandoned his public push for the company to merge with PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay snack business.Mondelez has since pledged to improve its operating margin, adjusted for extraordinary items, to 15-16 per cent, and drive further expansion after reaching that target. It has two $1.5bn cost-cutting plans: one focused on making its supply chain more efficient, which will end next year; and another aimed at both supply chain and overhead cost-cutting, to be achieved by 2018. As part of these, it has been slashing headcount and implementing “zero-based budgeting” where all costs have to be approved anew each year.So far, the plans have been working. In the first half of 2015, Mondelez’s adjusted operating margin increased by 190 basis points to 13.4 per cent, Bernstein estimated. Investors appear pleased: the shares are up 28 per cent year-to-date, compared with the S&P 500’s 1.4 per cent gain.However, peers in the food industry have already proved costs can be cut far more dramatically — and from a less flabby starting point.In April, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestlé, said the purchase of Kraft by Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital, showed how costs could be “pulverised”.“3G’s partners are known in our industry for ruthless cost-cutting and have already proven numerous times that they are capable of reducing operating costs in particular by between 500 and 800 basis points, which has a revolutionary impact on all the other members of the industry,” he noted.Even though Mondelez has been meeting its cost-cutting targets, Pershing Square reckons these could be substantially more ambitious — partly because Mondelez is a relatively new company. It was itself created from a split from Kraft in 2012 and reflects 15 years of acquisitions — from Nabisco, to Cadbury to Danone’s biscuits business — which Mr Ackman’s fund does not think have been fully integrated.Alexia Howard, an analyst at Bernstein, points out that after 3G bought Heinz in 2013, it managed to improve the company’s operating margin by 700 basis points, which was more than twice Mondelez’s own ambitions at the time. At one point, she says Mondelez had more than 100,000 suppliers, which would have been more than one supplier for every employee.“There is massive margin opportunity [for Mondelez],” Ms Howard said.In recent years, the food industry has undergone massive upheaval as changes in consumer tastes and demands have forced the likes of companies from Mondelez to Coca-Cola to reassess their place in the global consumer market. Many have had to win over new consumers among the emerging middle classes of China, Africa and India.For Mondelez, this has meant increased marketing expenses, making its cost-cutting measures elsewhere more important.But other analysts believe Mondelez has scope to race ahead with further cost cuts, while still expanding its business thanks to the strength of its brands.Erin Lash of Morningstar estimated that if Mondelez can drive out $2.5bn in annual costs starting in 2020, or nearly 10 per cent of the company’s cost of goods sold and operating expenses — which would be similar to the Kraft Heinz target — it would generate operating margins approaching 20 per cent.“If Kraft-Heinz ultimately makes good on its aims to extract costs, management at other industry bellwethers, including Mondelez, will need to fall in line or risk being taken out,” she said.Mr Ackman knows both Ms Rosenfeld and 3G well, and the threat is that if the former is not able to achieve the cost cuts he wants, then the latter might be induced to make a bid and do that work themselves.The ironic endgame here could be that, after only a few years separated from Kraft, Mondelez could be brought back into its fold under the cold embrace of 3G."
117;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-07-22T19:15:45Z;Arm needs to prove it has value longevity;Low-energy chips offer entry to next stage of tech revolution;"“A hotel minibar allows you to see into the future and what a can of Pepsi will cost in 2020,” the comic Rich Hall once quipped.Deflation is usually a greater threat to technology than inflation. But perhaps the equivalent to Pepsi is Arm Holdings, the Cambridge chip designer, whose share price is close to 30 times forecast earnings for next year. It is a vision of the future when it won’t just be our phones that are smart.But managing such high expectations is tricky. Even for Apple. On Tuesday, the US company said sales of its iPhones — all of which contain an Arm component — rose 35 per cent in the third quarter, but the market had hoped for better and Apple’s shares fell 5 per cent. In April, Arm’s shares slipped as it warned results could be hit by a decrease in industry-wide revenues from smartphones. On Wednesday it said it was back on track. Yet its shares fell another 5 per cent despite beating estimates and reporting a 28 per cent rise in first half pre-tax profits on a 15 per cent rise in revenues.The market still frets about Arm’s exposure to fancy mobiles and the threat of lower-priced products from China. Arm’s assurances that its components are in 95 per cent of all smartphones and that it can play on all sides of the phone game are not enough.Investors may be underestimating the Cambridge group. It has a canny strategy of selling licences and earning royalties on its brainwaves and blueprints. It does not spend money on factories and drones to build its products. Instead, it is recruiting engineers to develop new processors for “the internet of things” which Simon Segars, Arm’s boss, sees as the next stage in the smart revolution — low-energy chips that connect everyday objects from cars to washing machines. That will secure high-margin revenues well into the future.Still, Mr Segars must convince the market that Arm can succeed a second time when so many tech empires fail to make the transition to the next revolution. If he can’t, Arm will be the butt of the joke, not the hotel mini bar.A Just So story“How the Brewers got a new business plan”*, a homage to Rudyard Kipling.In the high far-off times of 2008 the Brewers, O best beloved, had no strategy to speak of. They had only a blackish, bulgy beer-tie which meant tenants paid rent if they bought the house ale. But there was a Brewer’s child from Wolverhampton called Marston’s, who was full of ’satiable curiosity, for which he was regularly spanked. He was spanked by politicians who banned smoking in pubs; by consumers who wanted food not beer; by tenants for the beer tie; and by MPs again for good measure.One day, Marston’s asked a new question: “How do other retailers make money?” To cut the story short, he travelled to the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo where he asked a café owner: “How do you make money?” And the restaurateur caught the Brewer’s child by his little business plan which was no bigger than a boot and pulled. And Marston’s pulled. And his business plan began to stretch.Then a bi-coloured python-rock snake came, saying: “My young friend, we will devote ourselves to a little high tension. If we do not, yonder self-propelling man-of-war with the armour-plated upper deck [he meant the restaurateur, O best beloved] will permanently vitiate your career.”At last the restaurateur let go. “Oh,” said Marston’s, “my poor business plan is badly out of shape.”“Some people do not know what is profitable and good for them,” said the python. “It is a franchise model. Instead of forcing landlords to take your beer and pay rent, you extract a share of their revenue. The new plan will lift margins and also be useful for spanking other brewers.”So Marston’s went home and spanked his dear family till they, too, went to see the restaurateur. And since that day, O best beloved, brewers are adopting business plans like that of the ’satiable brewer’s child. But this week’s update shows Marston’s sales and margins still outspank his kin and brokers forecast 30 per cent earnings growth over the next three years.*How the Elephant got his nose.Hargreaves hands downThe corporate governance code is like water wearing away rock. About 40 per cent of FTSE 350 companies now comply with the UK’s code’s canon that outsiders should evaluate board performance every three years. One recusant in 2014 was Hargreaves Lansdown. The investment business’s explanation was fulsome: it was doing nicely without external interference; its biggest shareholder, Peter Hargreaves, was on the board to keep the focus on shareholder value; and it just wasn’t worth spending the money.This year, though, HL changed its mind. It is short on explanation but two things have happened since December: HL hasn’t done so well and Mr Hargreaves has quit the board. One down, another 209 to go.kate.burgess@ft.com"
118;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-07-09T18:03:59Z;PepsiCo drinks and snacks sales rise in North America;Stronger than expected North American sales offset impact of strong dollar;PepsiCo raised its full-year earnings forecast after delivering second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ expectations.Lower commodity costs and strong North American snack and drink sales lessened some of the effect that the stronger dollar has had on the overseas businesses of the company that owns the Doritos and Tropicana orange juice brands, as well as the eponymous soda.Net revenue for the three months to June 13 was $15.9bn, a 6 per cent drop from the same period last year but ahead of the $15.8bn the market had forecast.Net income for the quarter was $1.9bn, or $1.33 a share, easily beating expectations of $1.24 a share.Shares in the company fell 1.1 per cent in New York at $94.60.Hugh Johnston, Pepsi’s chief financial officer, said the results showed that the company’s drive to increase productivity was paying off and allowing it to invest those cost savings into innovation.“Productivity is driving growth and growth is driving productivity, it’s a careful balance and is really working well,” Mr Johnston said.Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said the company faced some headwinds in the months ahead. Pepsi’s Frito Lay North America volumes were flat, the slowest performance in 10 quarters.Indra Nooyi, chief executive of Pepsi, said the company was focusing on revenue and profit over volume in uncertain environments to avoid hurting the business as a whole.The solid earnings came despite the currency headwinds produced by the resurgent dollar— which wiped out any sales gains in core regions, such as Latin America, and heaped further pain on its European business which has been suffering from lacklustre sales.“The macroeconomic environment around the world remains volatile and foreign exchange headwinds persist in many of our international markets,” the company said. Mr Johnston said the volatility, combined with commodity pressures, were factors in Pepsi being cautious about the second half, which is generally tougher than the first.It said developing and emerging market organic revenue rose 11 per cent. On a reported basis, developing and emerging market net revenue declined 13 per cent, which reflected “unfavourable foreign exchange translation, in particular, related to the Russian rouble, Venezuelan bolívar, euro and Mexican peso”.In Latin America, Pepsi has combined its food and beverages businesses to be more cost effective.Although PepsiCo has been battling a shift in US consumer spending towards healthier options, North America proved to be the unexpected bright spot during the quarter.Sales at PepsiCo Americas Beverages and Frito-Lay North America, its two biggest units, were up 2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively to $5.3bn and $3.4bn.The company also raised its “core constant EPS growth target” for the year to 8 per cent from 7 per cent.However, PepsiCo said it expected the strong dollar to shave 9 percentage points off full-year net revenue growth and approximately 11 percentage points off full-year core EPS performance in 2015.

However, early gains were diluted by the close of trade.Investors sought financial and healthcare stocks, while the defensive sectors of telecoms and utilities declined.PepsiCo shares closed down 1 per cent to $94.59, paring an early jump of 1.6 per cent after the company beat analysts’ expectations for second-quarter earnings.Lower commodity costs and strong sales in North America helped mitigate the impact of the strong dollar on the company’s overseas business.Net income for the quarter was $1.9bn, or $1.33 a share, easily beating expectations of $1.24 per share, but the company said the global macroeconomic environment remained “volatile”.“Foreign exchange headwinds persist in many of our international markets,” PepsiCo said in a statement as it also raised its full-year earnings forecast.Walgreens Boots Alliance also reported results ahead of expectations, with shares closing up 4.24 per cent to $89.55. The drugstore chain delivered $1.02 a share net income for the quarter, ahead of market expectations of $0.87.Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods group, rose slightly in midday trading after merging $12.5bn of its beauty assets with Coty, the US beauty firm.P&G shares fell 0.4 per cent to $80.66 by close, while Coty closed down 4.7 per cent to $30.04 after peaking at an all-time high of $32.68 at the start of the month.QLogic Corp, a maker of storage networking equipment, fell too, losing more than a fifth of its value after issuing a profit warning, citing weakness in server and storage markets.Shares fell 21.32 per cent to close at $11.00, their lowest level since October, as the company said it expected to report quarterly net income of between $0.16 to $0.17 per share, lower than previous guidance of $0.23 to $0.27 per share.Implied equity volatility touched the highest level in five months as investors awaited further developments from Greece’s negotiations with its creditors.The CBOE’s Vix rose 1.6 per cent to 19.97, after briefly breaching the 20 mark which is considered a threshold of escalating investor concern.US-traded Chinese stocks recovered some of the week’s losses, with the Bloomberg China-US Equity Index climbing 5.8 per cent to 122.50.Energy and commodity groups pulled back too, with Freeport-McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, up 1.7 per cent to $16.78 and Chesapeake Energy Corp up 3.27 per cent to $11.68.The S&P 500 rose 0.23 per cent on the day to close at 2,051.31, after gaining as much as 1.3 per cent earlier.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.19 per cent to 17,548.62 after reaching a five-month low on Wednesday when trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted for more than three hours because of a computer glitch.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.26 per cent to 4,922.40, recovering some ground from Wednesday’s loss of 1.8 per cent.
120;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;AB InBev’s hard-nosed kings of beer;The deal-thirsty brewer opens up in the first of a two-part series on its culture and ambitions;"Working for the world’s largest brewer is not to everybody’s taste — and that is fine with Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev’s chief executive.After Anheuser-Busch, owner of Budweiser, agreed to be taken over by InBev in 2008, Mr Brito and his InBev colleagues arrived at the US group’s St Louis headquarters within 24 hours to start shaking up its comfortable way of working and to assess which senior people would fit in. “In any company, there’s 20 per cent that lead, 70 per cent that follow and 10 per cent that do nothing,” Mr Brito recalls. “So the 10 per cent, of course, you need to get rid of . . . They’re always unhappy anyway and complaining.”The 55-year-old Brazilian — who likes to be called just “Brito”, never “Mr Brito”, let alone “Carlos” — leads AB InBev by example. “My life is the company and my family,” he says in an interview. He professes to have no hobbies and the sole pastime to which he admits is a daily 30-minute treadmill workout.The CEO’s dedication to the company is typical of AB InBev managers, who, when they have time to dream, are encouraged to “dream big” — just like the three Brazilian investors who helped create the company that in just over 25 years has grown into a world leader, through bold acquisitions and relentless cost control.Just how big AB InBev is dreaming is a question to which many would love to know the answer. Recent speculation has suggested that the company, which already has a market capitalisation of €172bn, could be marching towards one more enormous deal. The M&A chatter suggests the group could be involved in a takeover of the world number two brewer SABMiller (market capitalisation £54bn), the sector-leading distiller Diageo (£47bn) — or even Coca-Cola ($174bn) or PepsiCo ($138bn).To gauge AB InBev’s ambition and management approach for a two-part series of articles, the Financial Times interviewed current and former executives, staff, analysts and consultants in the US, Brazil and Europe.They depicted a tightly run, ferociously determined multinational that believes it can still move like an agile insurgent despite being the biggest incumbent in many markets. Critics allege, however, that its steely culture is hard on a workforce increasingly managed by young graduates, whose devotion and enthusiasm are matched only by their lack of operational experience.For a flavour of what it is like working for AB InBev, register online to join its elite global management training programme. A short game tests whether you have what it takes, as you play the role of an up-and-coming trainee preparing a presentation. One clue: when your alarm goes off at 6am and the game offers you the option of a few minutes’ lie-in, do not press “snooze”.Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Andrew Hill conclude by examining AB InBev’s growth challenge — and speculation linking the brewer and its Brazilian billionaire backers with one more huge acquisitionIn 2014, nearly 100,000 applied for 147 graduate jobs. The admission hurdles get progressively higher with up to seven interviews and exercises, including a final stage in which candidates might be asked to judge which of their interviewers they would select. Each trainee starts with the same ambition. In the words of Ties Soeters, a graduate of the scheme who has worked for AB InBev for eight years: “Everyone has a belief they could be Brito.”Mr Brito himself had to hustle to become “Brito”. As a young executive at Shell in Brazil, he successfully asked Jorge Paulo Lemann, a financier and former Brazilian tennis champion, for funds to pursue an MBA at Stanford.Not long afterwards, in 1989, Mr Lemann and his partners — Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira — led the purchase of Brahma, a local brewer. Mr Brito ended up working for them, playing a pivotal role in Brahma’s audacious deal-led expansion.First it morphed into a regional powerhouse, Ambev. Then, in 2004, it joined forces with Belgium’s Interbrew, maker of Stella Artois and Beck’s, to create InBev, a merger topped by the $52bn Anheuser-Busch deal four years later.The Brazilian billionaires have put their native country on the investor map. Richard Dobbs of McKinsey Global Institute cites “Brazilians running one of the best US companies better than the Americans” as an example of emerging markets’ growing power.AB InBev sees itself as a meritocracy. Luiz Fernando Edmond was on its first management trainee programme in Brazil in 1990 and is now head of sales. “I came here with nothing,” he says. “If you work hard, you focus on your results and you work with people, bring people together, promote people better than you, you have a chance to become a CEO of the company.”A second clear principle is that every employee should behave like an owner-entrepreneur, committed to building the company and not, in Mr Brito’s words, to “building their résumés”.This translates into a fierce attention to costs. AB InBev executives stay in the same mid-market hotels as team members and travel in the same class of airline seat — economy for short-haul, business class for some longer-haul flights. “We don’t torture our people,” jokes Mr Brito.Zero-based budgeting — in which planned expenditure is reset to zero each year — is one element of control. Meanwhile, benchmarking and other efficiency and quality programmes are inspired by Japanese lean manufacturing, which revolutionised Brahma after it was introduced in the 1990s by Vic­ente Falconi, a Brazilian management consultant who still advises the group.Mr Falconi laughs as he recalls meeting German brewmasters who behaved as though brewing was a magical thing: “Beer isn’t magic; beer is process.”Other elements of the culture are informality and transparency. For his FT interview, Mr Brito is preppily dressed in pressed jeans and blue shirt with an embroidered red Budweiser logo. Staff are encouraged to quiz their leaders, who sit at central desks in open-plan offices. Younger staff liken it to the way start-up employees have access to their company’s founder-entrepreneur.Do not confuse transparency with equality, however. Considerable rewards, in cash and equity, are available to those who hit tough targets at company, unit and individual level. Miss them and bonuses vanish. “In our company we say that fairness is to treat different people differently,” explains Mr Brito. He earned €2.2m last year in salary and bonus, but also received an exceptional options grant in 2008, set to be worth more than €250m at current share prices, for integrating Anheuser-Busch and cutting deal-related debt.Performance is constantly monitored, and reviewed formally once a year, using 360-degree feedback. Underperforming staff are given six to nine months to improve. Mr Brito denies AB InBev operates a forced ranking system. Yet, he says, at some point you must say to laggards: “Look, you’re a very smart guy, there are other companies out there but for us it’s not working. You live only once, don’t waste your time here, go somewhere else while you are young.”In 2008, after the InBev team had done its triage of the Anheuser-Busch management, Mr Brito says he“changed the whole first tier . . . Some were too rich to care, some were too old to work, some wouldn’t fit the culture anyway”. One senior former Anheuser-Busch executive recalls, with something like awe, how the company took tough decisions without emotion, based only on the best interests of the business.Others are more critical. One Belgian union official, speaking on condition of anonymity, complains about “cost-chasing” — including petty approval requirements for reordering printer ink. He alludes to the rapid churn of managers, saying, “bosses are only in place for three years maximum and then they have to go somewhere else. We have a culture that’s not long term — nothing is stable”.On Glassdoor, a site that allows staff and former staff to rate employers anonymously, its rating is lower than that of three main rivals — SABMiller, Molson Coors and Heineken — in every area except career opportunities and business outlook. Comments, impossible to verify, refer repeatedly to the pressure. “The workload is completely unrealistic but they keep trimming headcount,” said one person described as a “former full-time employee” in March. “Everyone is so stressed out that there is lots of fighting and tension.”Andrew Hill on how the UK telecoms group got its swagger back, for now at leastThe group’s global HQ in Leuven, 30km east of Brussels, is decorated with poster-size reminders that AB InBev staff “pour themselves into their work”. Even young and ambitious staff admit that maintaining a social life is hard. Adrien Mahieu, who joined five years ago having worked at his family business, says outsiders sometimes say AB InBev trainees have been “brainwashed”: “My brother can’t understand how deeply involved in the company I am, because I sometimes assume more ownership for ABI than for my own shares [in the family company].”Freddy Delvaux is emeritus professor of brewing at KU Leuven university, and now runs a small craft brewery with his sons, called De Kroon. He too uses the term “brainwashed” to describe AB InBev staff he has encountered as a teacher. At first it seems positive, he says, “but I’m not so sure: they are also instilling a company view and they create an enormous internal competition”. To get promotion at AB InBev, he jokes, first “you have to kill three others”.The company encourages a sense of discomfort. Mr Brito says: “We believe that people only grow when [they’re] from time to time sat outside of [their] comfort zone.” When smugness sets in, the group “shakes the tree” to reproduce the rush of having to learn something new quickly. Mr Soeters, who has never worked in one role for more than two years, says: “I never get to that stage of being bored and looking elsewhere.”Jim Collins, the business author and an ardent admirer of AB InBev’s obsessive culture, wrote in the foreword to Dream Big, Cristiane Correa’s book about Mr Lemann, Mr Telles and Mr Sicupira, that “when fanatics come together with other fanatics, the multiplicative effect is unstoppable”.Mr Brito offers a parallel with swimmer Michael Phelps’s tireless efforts to become the most decorated Olympic athlete ever. What the analogy leaves out is that Mr Phelps will eventually retire for good. Mr Brito, in his latest letter to shareholders, says AB InBev intends to create investor value “for the next 100 years”.

Click here to read the second and final part of the series, on AB InBev’s growth challenge — and the speculation about one more huge acquisitionOn AB InBev culture: “This is [a] very deep, ingrained culture and . . . if you like it, you love it. It’s about common sense. I always say great athletes and students do the same thing. They have a great dream . . . they surround themselves with the best people they can find and they own what they’re doing, they’re not being forced. That’s why they’re successful.”

On ranking and rewards: “People that are brighter, more committed, deliver more, produce more, create more value, build better teams, are better leaders, inspire people to achieve higher things — those guys need to be treated in a very different way than the other guys that are good, but not amazing.”

On preventing complacency: “Every year we look at the top talents and we say, OK, are they stretched, are they getting too comfortable? . . . [If they are] it’s time for us to start taking people more often out of their comfort zones . . . Let’s shake the tree and get people to feel underdogs again and [feel] that crunch, that ‘Oh my God, I have to learn this, I’m excited, this is new!’”

On benchmarking: “Our whole life here as managers is looking for those companies that do it better than we do — in different industries of course because then we can visit them, we can talk to them, get to know where they are in that specific metric compared to where we are — and that’s the gap . . . I would say we’ll never get there because there’s always more to do.”

On perks and company cars: “People are never happy . . . Whichever car you assign them to drive they’ll always say, ‘Oh yeah but my colleague drives a different car’. Forget it. Let’s focus on the business and pay a great bonus if the results are good. You buy your car, do whatever you want.”

121;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-05-10T11:09:31Z;Bottled water flies off shelves as fizzy drinks go flat;Global soft-drinks companies battle for share amid surging demand for the simplest beverage of all;"Amid retailers’ displays of ever-more exotic soft drinks — ranging from coconut water to lime and cardamom or pomegranate and blueberry — there is one beverage that is increasingly flying off the shelves.It is water. Sales of plain bottled water are this year set to soar above carbonated drinks for the first time, according to Canadean, the market research group. That would make water the world’s best-selling soft drink.The thirst for water has sparked intense competition for market share among the biggest producers — France’s Danone, Switzerland’s Nestlé, and Coca-Cola and PepsiCo of the US.Sales of packaged water have grown globally at an annual average of 6 per cent since 2008, easily outstripping carbonated drinks’ 1.3 per cent, according to Canadean.This faster growth will propel water sales to 238bn litres by the end of this year — more than Canadean’s forecast of 227bn litres for carbonates, the current leader in soft drinks.In the food industry, millennial consumers in developed markets are increasingly concerned about additives and heavily processed foods; and in beverages, they are tending to favour bottled water over sodas.Globally, demand is being driven by Asia, principally China and India, where governments are struggling to provide consistently reliable tap water to rapidly growing cities. If they can afford it, middle-class families prefer to buy bottled water.China’s consumption of bottled water has almost doubled in five years — from 17bn litres to 33bn litres, according to Euromonitor, the market research group.Danone sells more water than infant formula in China, driven by its Mizone-flavoured water brand. “Asia remains a key engine of growth,” says Cecile Cabanis, Danone’s finance director, of the water business, which is also strong in Indonesia.Bottled water, which suffered during the recession in developed markets, was the fastest-growing of Danone’s four businesses last year, and sales have risen by double digits each year since 2011.Some analysts doubt that this growth rate — driven by fruit-flavoured aquadrinks that now account for 40 per cent of Danone’s water business — can be maintained, but the company says that sales are “very resilient”.The French group has increased its share of the water market over the past five years, partly because of greater advertising spend that has helped give it just over 10 per cent of the global market, according to Euromonitor.Outside Asia, the US is the fastest-growing market, with rates that are similar to those of emerging markets, according to Marco Settembri, chief executive of waters at Nestlé, which got into the bottled-water business in 1992 when it bought Perrier-Vittel.While Danone’s water business is skewed more to emerging markets, Nestlé sells most of its water to developed markets.Sales of the Swiss group’s Pure Life brand have grown so rapidly in the US — where half its SFr7.4bn ($7.9bn) 2014 water sales were made — that Nestlé last year supplanted Dr Pepper Snapple, producer of 7UP, as the country’s third-largest soft-drinks company (after Coca-Cola and PepsiCo), according to Beverage Digest, the US industry publication.Mr Settembri said: “There is a huge growth in the water category in the US, driven by concerns about health and obesity.”Carbonated soft drinks marked a 10th year of decline in the US in 2014, having fallen by 14 per cent in volume over the past decade, according to Beverage Digest.Coca-Cola, which is trying to reduce its dependence on carbonated drinks, is rolling out its Smartwater “vapour-distilled water with electrolytes” into the UK, another strong market, where it already sells Vitaminwater.Sales of bottled water rose 10 per cent in the year to the end of March in the UK, according to Nielsen, the market research company.Smartwater’s entry into the UK last year came exactly 10 years after the ill-fated launch of Coke’s Dasani brand. The Atlanta-based company pulled Dasani weeks after introducing it to the UK because of a contamination scare, but the brand had already been pilloried by the British media as little more than expensive enhanced tap water.Some beverage companies, such as the UK’s Britvic, have been caught out by water’s rising tide. Water is “a category which is not material for us”, it said in November, a factor that contributed to a 5 per cent fall in the volume of its still-drinks business that includes J20 and Robinsons.Nevertheless, it hopes to ride the water wave by expanding Ballygowan, its Irish water brand, into the UK.The battle between the industry leaders, particularly intense in emerging markets, has even spilled out into public hostility.In Mexico, Danone, the owner of Evian, Badoit and a flood of local brands, is fighting a price war unleashed last year after the government imposed a tax on sugary carbonated drinks.Emmanuel Faber, Danone’s chief executive, in February accused Coke and Pepsi of “destroying value” by ramping up their water distribution in Mexico to compensate for falling soda sales hit by the tax. Though Danone’s fruit-flavoured water drinks are also affected because they are sweetened, the tax has had a bigger impact on the cola companies.“Pushing water in a non-strategic manner with no marketing skills means destroying value. That’s what they do,” Mr Faber complained to analysts in February. “And therefore we are facing price competition in waters that turned into some negative sales for us in total in Mexico in waters last year.”Defending market share is important because pricing power in still water — which accounts for 82 per cent of volumes sold — tends to be weak, as the product is so similar between brands.Fintan Ryan, analyst at Berenberg, says: “Bottled water is dilutive to group margins. At Nestlé, the water business has operating profit margins of about 10 per cent compared to the group average of 15 per cent. There’s no intellectual property involved and it’s hard to put capital actively into a business that is dilutive — but it is generally fast-growing.”Nestlé Waters’ Mr Settembri says that the key to profitability lies in its distribution.“Margins depend on the model. To make money in water, it is critical that production is close to the areas of demand so you reduce the cost of transport,” he said.Demand for bottled water looks here to stay. The outlook “remains bright with medium-to-strong double-digit growth expected at least until 2019,” says Canadean.The healthy, clean image of bottled water portrayed by marketeers sits at odds with the views of environmentalists.Peter Gleick, author of Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind our Obsession with Bottled Water, argues that in developing economies “the answer to bad municipal tap water systems is not bottled water; it is to build high-quality, low-cost, reliable municipal water systems. Bottled water will always be too expensive for the poorest populations and it is grossly inequitable to make safe water available only for the rich.”In wealthy countries, safe water is, literally, on tap, though it may not taste as good as some bottled water.“While it may be better to drink bottled water than carbonated sugary soft drinks, it is even better to drink safe and far cheaper tap water,” says Mr Gleick.Nestlé, whose chairman, Peter Brabeck urges water conservation, argues that the main competitor to bottled water is not tap water, but other types of soft drinks.Denied bottled water, consumers are more likely to drink sugary sodas, or fruit juice than tap water, says Marco Settembri, head of Nestlé Waters.He argues that the amount of water used to manufacture a bottle of water is a fraction of that needed for milk, orange juice or beer, so “if you want to save water you must drink water, bottle or tap”.Activist concern appears to have had little impact on bottled water sales, which have accelerated in recent years.But they could come under threat from changes in technology, says FX de Mallmann, global co-head of consumer retail & healthcare at Goldman Sachs.“A number of companies are working on developing technologies to improve consumers’ ability to purify water and ultimately to do it in a cost-effective way and from home. This represents a risk to the longer-term growth prospects of bottled water,” he says.In the UK, Virgin Pure uses water filtration technology developed by Israel’s Strauss Group.Oliver Osgood, chief executive of Virgin Pure, says the system “takes ordinary tap water and triple filters it. The impurities and bacteria that are picked up through mains water pipes are removed or killed, but the essential minerals remain. Virgin Pure is like having mineral water on tap”."
122;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-04-26T14:54:59Z;Apple set to be latest to suffer dollar impact;Currency strength set to wipe more than $2bn from quarterly sales;A surge in the US dollar has already wiped more than $20bn from first quarter sales at the largest US companies, a sum larger than revenues generated by Intel, Caterpillar or Goldman Sachs in the first three months of the year, according to an analysis by the Financial Times.With the US earnings season approaching the halfway stage, that figure is likely to jump further. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, reports results on Monday and warned in January that the currency move could slice more than $2bn from quarterly revenues.So far during the current reporting period, General Motors, IBM, Procter & Gamble, Amazon and Johnson & Johnson have experienced $1bn-plus haircuts on sales as they translated revenues earned abroad back into US dollar terms.Known as “top-line growth”, revenues reflect how quickly a business is growing. In recent years, large multinational US company’s sales have benefited from the combination of a weaker dollar and robust expansion across emerging market economies.However, a sustained rise in the dollar since last summer and weakening global activity has weighed heavily on a host of blue-chip US companies.While 71 per cent of S&P 500 companies have eclipsed first-quarter earnings expectations, 55 per cent of corporates have failed to beat revenue forecasts, according to S&P Capital IQ.“Top-line growth is incredibly challenged. The dollar is even a bigger problem than people thought,’’ said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG.However, US equities indices have reclaimed record territory, with investors cheered by overall earnings topping lowered expectations of analysts. The S&P 500 closed last week at a new peak of 2,117.69, while the Nasdaq has surpassed the dotcom bubble high set in 2000.“While earnings are not great, they’re better than expected,’’ said Mr Greenhaus.The analysis of earnings statements, slide presentations, conference calls and executive commentary spanned more than 100 of the roughly 190 S&P 500 constituents that have reported first-quarter results.The FT analysis showed a $20.1bn reduction in sales, which would have lifted the groups’ reported revenues of $762bn by 2.6 per cent. When excluding financials, sales would have been more than 3 per cent higher. While the technology industry has been particularly exposed to the shift in the dollar — it generates more of its sales abroad than any other sector — a broad swath of companies have warned of the effects.$20.1bnReduction in sales of the more than 100 S&P 500 constituents that have reported so farMcDonald’s, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Tyco, Coca-Cola, Kimberly-Clark, 3M, Caterpillar and PepsiCo were among the dozens that pointed to currency swings when delivering results.“Currency has been powerful headwind for all multinational companies,” said Dan Kelley, portfolio manager at Fidelity. “It is something companies are having to think differently about — what the implications are going forward and whether it makes sense to alter their cost structures.”Only half of the companies disclosed enough information to calculate the dollar’s effect on sales — itself a somewhat nebulous figure as executives must consider changes to underlying operations, volume of goods sold and divestitures or acquisitions along with foreign exchange swings.
123;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US blue-chips’ overseas sales feel impact of strong dollar;Domestic economic recovery countered by emerging markets slowdown;International sales at US blue-chips ranging from PepsiCo to Google are being hit by the strong dollar and the emerging markets slowdown, despite the companies enjoying a recovery at home.Overseas revenues account for about 30 per cent of sales at S&P 500 companies, highlighting the dollar’s effects on earnings. The US currency’s first quarter rise against a basket of major currencies was its sharpest since 1981, according to Barclays.Currency swings weighed on technology groups’ earnings, with Google saying its first quarter revenues would have been $795m higher at constant currencies and Microsoft saying the dollar lowered its reported sales by $534m.Pepsi, the drinks and snacks group, blamed the dollar’s strength for stagnant operating profits, increasing the amount it expects the strong currency to shave off its full-year earnings per share to 11 percentage points.Consumer products group Procter & Gamble’s third-quarter sales fell nearly 8 per cent to $18.1bn, reflecting an 8 percentage point hit from the dollar. Like other US multinationals, P&G is expecting the pummelling from the strong dollar to continue, forecasting a 5-6 per cent fall in net sales for its full year to the end of June.Several companies said they planned to mitigate the adverse currency effects by cutting costs and sourcing materials closer to the countries in which they operate.AG Lafley, P&G’s chief executive, said: “We’ll offset foreign exchange over time through a combination of pricing, mix enhancement and cost reduction.”The dollar’s strength has weighed on emerging markets, where the International Monetary Fund expects growth to decrease to 4.3 per cent this year, as China’s slowdown sends ripples across the global economy.Caterpillar was among the companies reporting weaker demand for its equipment as emerging market economies continue to slow and energy companies back off from capital spending plans.Both Pepsi and Caterpillar highlighted instability in Brazil as a cause for concern. The South American country is expected to have fallen into recession in the first quarter as a tumbling real and the Petrobras graft case exacerbate its economic woes.Indra Nooyi, chief executive of Pepsi, said on Thursday that its Brazilian business was “still holding” but she added that the company was watching the region “very carefully”.We can expect an appreciating dollar to eat into the sales of export-oriented firms and compress the margins of those with substantial operations abroadRussia’s economic woes took their toll on GM’s first-quarter earnings as the carmaker’s shrinking business in the country put a brake on profits as it took a $400m charge to cover the cost of revamping its operations.Hershey’s hopes for China also received a blow in the first quarter after the chocolate maker missed forecasts. John P. Bilbrey, head of the company, blamed the external economic environment in Beijing for its woes.“We can expect an appreciating dollar to eat into the sales of export-oriented firms and compress the margins of those with substantial operations abroad,” said Dana Saporta, an economist at Credit Suisse.Earlier in the week, drinks group Coca-Cola also reported headwinds from the strong dollar, which wiped 7 percentage points from its pre-tax profit for the January to March quarter. Fast food retailer McDonald’s saw currency woes exacerbated by company-specific problems including a loss in consumer confidence as it struggles to overhaul an image tarnished by food scandals in China and Japan.Additional reporting by Anna Nicolaou and Eric Platt in New York
124;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-04-23T17:04:14Z;Pepsi earnings buoyed by cost cuts;Company is battling weaker emerging market economies, the strong dollar and changing tastes;PepsiCo reported increased profit in the first quarter as its cost savings programme kicked in and it expanded in the US, but the maker of Doritos was hit by the strong dollar and warned its impact would be bigger than originally expected this year.Net income was $1.22bn in the first three months, or 81 cents a share, which represented a 3 per cent increase, it said in a statement on Thursday. However, net revenue dropped 3 per cent to $12.2bn.Pepsi did better when earnings were adjusted for one-off costs, with EPS of 83 cents a share beating consensus analysts’ estimates of 79 cents, while revenues adjusted for currency swings and other costs, rose 4.4 per cent. PepsiCo’s gross margin widened 150 basis points.Like many US multinationals Pepsi has been battling macroeconomic headwinds, not least the strength of the dollar, which wiped 8 percentage points off net revenue.The company said that although the strength of the dollar had started to ease, the rates it uses for forecasting its profit meant that it expected the negative impact of foreign exchange to wipe 10 percentage points off net revenue and 11 points off its core EPS this year. That was worse than the 7 points it had previously forecast for both.Pepsi’s international presence — it earns half its revenues in the US but just a fifth of its pre-tax profit from its domestic market — has made it vulnerable to the slowdown in emerging markets.PepsiCo chairman and chief executive Indra Nooyi insisted that the underlying businesses in key markets such as Brazil, Russia and Venezuela were doing well to cope with the volatile economic environment. Pepsi would have increased operating profit in all its regions had it not been for the strong dollar.But she added: “Our business is still holding, but . . . probably in the last quarter Brazil is where we saw some on-the-ground action that we are watching very carefully at this point.”Hugh Johnson, Pepsi chief financial officer, said Pepsi was continuing to localise its costs “more aggressively” in a bid to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange while managing its capital spending “tightly”.Pepsi and Coca-Cola have been working to match shifting consumer tastes, prompting them to expand their range of beverages and introduce more healthy options.Pepsi’s snacks divisions have helped buoy profit, particularly in North America, where the macroeconomic environment has been improving. Its exposure in the soda segment — which is where consumers’ tastes have been rapidly changing — is also limited to less than 25 per cent of net revenue, the company said.Pepsi’s Frito-Lay regional division increased net revenue by 3 per cent, while operating profit rose 7 per cent. Its American beverage division increased operating profit 9 per cent.“What you’re seeing is as people move to still drinks from sparkling, PepsiCo is stronger in non-carbonated than carbonated,” said Mr Johnson. He added that the company is introducing drinks that “sit somewhere in the middle”, aiming to meet consumer demands for lower calorie, or healthier, drinks that still have some sweetness.Pepsi maintained its forecast for the full year of 7 per cent adjusted constant currency EPS growth. It added that it is on track to meet its target of $1bn in productivity savings and return between $8.5bn and $9bn to shareholders.
125;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-04-01T16:05:39Z;Companies are preaching to a new audience;Younger consumers with liberal attitudes are a bigger market than religious conservatives;By stepping into the furore over Indiana’s religious freedom law, in defence of gay rights, Tim Cook is boldly taking Apple where companies have been wary about going before. But he is not the only US business leader advocating for a deeply-held personal belief — so have Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com on the same issue, and Howard Schultz of Starbucks on racial discrimination and violence.In addition to chief executives speaking out about social matters on which they might have remained silent a few years ago, they are adopting liberal stances that often clash with political and religious conservatives. On gay marriage in particular, companies are ignoring the traditional advice that they should stick to maximising profits within what Milton Friedman, the economist, called “the rules of the game”.“Discrimination, in all its forms, is bad for business,” Mr Cook declared in an article in the Washington Post this week. Having nodded to the shareholder value caucus, he then made very clear where his heart lies. “It isn’t a religious issue. This is about how we treat each other as human beings,” wrote Mr Cook, who is himself gay, in his effort to change the rules in Indiana and conservative states such as Arkansas.On a narrow view of corporate self-interest, Mr Cook is misguided to criticise Mike Pence, Indiana’s Republican governor. If employers with conservative religious views do not employ gay people, or refuse to serve them, that merely weakens the competition for Apple and others. Prejudice drives up his rivals’ wage costs and reduces the size of their addressable market.On a broader view, including how Apple and Starbucks project their brands, these leaders are talking sense. There would be a far bigger tension between shareholder value and the chief executive’s beliefs had Mr Schultz argued for racial discrimination rather than launching Starbucks’ “Race Together” campaign, which started awkwardly with baristas trying to engage customers in conversation on the topic.Friedman was essentially right in his book Capitalism and Freedom that the discrimination tends to be curbed by the market because it is irrational — it introduces unnecessary costs, giving a company that is colour or gender-blind an edge. “Those of us who regard colour of skin as irrelevant can buy some things more cheaply,” Friedman wrote, with his customary detachment.He drew on The Economics of Discrimination, the 1957 book by the Nobel-winning economist Gary Becker. As Catherine Rampell noted in the Washington Post, Becker found that prejudice imposes costs on discriminators as well as those discriminated against. Prejudice tends to linger in closed institutions such as churches, while being driven out by competition.All things being equal, companies take a liberal view of, for example, immigration because they want to gain access to skilled labour. That is evident in US companies’ support for immigrant visas and UK companies’ backing for free labour movement within the EU. Employers do not mind where a worker was born if he or she is productive, adaptable and hard-working.Oct 30 2014: Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, has revealed his sexual orientation publicly for the first time. Michael Skapinker, columnist on business and society for the FT, talks to Ravi Mattu about what the disclosure means for the corporate world.It does not always work as it should, of course. Whatever their theoretical self-interest, employers are often prejudiced. One study, for example, found that young people applying for internships at German companies were 14 per cent more likely to be called back if they had German, rather than Turkish, names. Smaller companies discriminated most — the national name premium was 24 per cent.Plenty also depends on customer attitudes. Wage discrimination has fallen over time in US professional basketball, where most players are black — white players were heavily overpaid in the 1980s, adjusted for skill, but they now tend not to be. This may be because fans have become less prejudiced and will no longer pay more to see white players, another study suggests.This is the key. Employers can argue narrowly that prejudice is an administrative problem. Some 379 companies including Apple, Amazon, eBay, PepsiCo and Starbucks, have signed a brief to the Supreme Court on a forthcoming gay marriage case. They claim that having different state laws “breeds unnecessary confusion, tension and diminished morale” internally and raises employers’ costs by $1bn a year.But these chief executives are not taking a public stand because of a fine operational calculation. They are doing it because they believe in what they say, and they think that their customers do too. Younger consumers with liberal social attitudes are a bigger target market than religious conservatives, and companies are quickly reorienting themselves to millennials.Aaron Chatterji, associate professor at Duke University, argues that such companies want to “reach younger, more diverse, more progressive customers and potential employees”. Mr Cook’s pledge that “Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love,” could equally serve as a marketing slogan.The US is not the only country where religion and anti-discrimination laws clash. Churches in Germany have historically resisted equal rights for employees who are gay or divorced. The Catholic church is now thinking of reforming its ecclesiastical labour rules. It clearly feels in a minority.john.gapper@ft.com
126;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-03-10T09:23:29Z;Buybacks sustain US bull run;Apple alone bought $45bn of its own stock last year;The fatigued US bull-run has one piston that continues to fire.S&P 500 companies spent more than $900bn on share buybacks and dividends over the past 12 months, more than twice the level recorded five years ago as the US began to emerge from the financial crisis, and a key driver in the stock market’s ageing six-year rally.The consistent buying by US corporates, often prompted by shareholder activism, has supported the stock market rally into 2015, offsetting wide selling by investors who see more opportunity in European equities. Investors have pulled roughly $28.5bn from mutual funds and exchange traded funds invested in the S&P 500 since the year began, data from fund tracker Lipper shows.Flush with cash, US multinationals spent $553.2bn on buybacks and $350.4bn on dividends in 2014, choosing shareholder returns over investment in research and development and capital expenditures given the bumpy global economic backdrop, according to preliminary data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.“Cash in the fourth quarter set another all-time record in the index,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It’s what they chose to do. In this case [companies] are being pushed by outside people to give back more. It does not mean they are being generous at all.”The practice, while appeasing shareholders, has been cause for criticism as analysts wait for a meaningful rise in sales — the missing link in the current recovery. S&P 500 corporates are not expected to move the needle this year, with bottom-up consensus forecasts projecting a meagre increase in revenues, largely the result of a slump in oil prices.Investors expect cash to continue to funnel to buybacks and dividends. Despite the record levels of returns, dividend payouts stood at 38 per cent of earnings last year — below historic levels, Mr Silverblatt noted.Orrin Sharp-Pierson, a strategist at BNP Paribas, added that buybacks have been “very important” to the S&P 500’s gains and that slower earnings growth “will generally not impact the flow”.He added: “The ‘stock effect’ is that companies have bought back around 20 per cent of market capitalisation since Lehman’s collapse, or around $3.8tn using today’s equity prices.“Compare that to the $4.5tn Fed balance sheet or a very similar expansion of $3.5tn.”Apple has become the exemplar for share buybacks, purchasing $45bn-worth of its stock last year, more than the combined value of shares bought by ExxonMobil, Intel, IBM and Wells Fargo, the SPDJI data show. Analysts on Wall Street expect the iPhone maker to increase its programme this April, with those at Credit Suisse forecasting $165bn-worth of buybacks to be completed over the next two and a half years.The Cupertino-based group is not alone, as companies increase buyback schemes to negate expiring employee options. On Monday, Qualcomm lifted its buyback authorisation to $15bn and the management team said they intended to complete two-thirds of the purchases within the next 12 months. Home Depot, Gilead Sciences and PepsiCo have also authorised $10bn plus buybacks since the year began.Two-thirds of companies in the S&P 500 have reduced their share count in the past year, including more than a fifth who have done so by more than 4 per cent. Those reductions signal capital discipline, investors say, particularly amid the frenetic pace of dealmaking at the start of the year.“Once you use cash to buy back stock, it can’t be used to overpay for an acquisition or invest in an underperforming division,” Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, said. “That’s a constructive message to shareholders in what remains a very sluggish global growth environment.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
127;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-03-02T09:48:52Z;Activist investors’ success owes much to wider bull run;Why a bear market will hit activists again, as it did in 2008;The activist attacks come in wave after wave.Sotheby’s settled with Daniel Loeb last year only to find a second hedge fund, Marcato, demanding yet more share buybacks. From Pepsi to MSCI to Zoetis to Dow Chemical, companies are accepting activists’ nominees on to their boards rather than fight. Activism has outpaced other hedge fund strategies in terms of returns, and the uber-aggressive Bill Ackman was 2014’s most successful high profile hedge fund manager by a mile, up 40 per cent.Take the frenetic pace of headlines together, and little wonder investors sniff something important happening. They have poured money into activist hedge funds — a record $14.2bn last year, according to HFR, taking the global total in these funds to almost $120bn.However, investors’ hopes for fat profits may be based on a misunderstanding. Rather than a secular trend that will reap bumper profits for activists forever, more likely they are chasing a cyclical bull market phenomenon that will leave them bruised when the markets turn.A cheerleading report by the Alternative Investment Management Association, the hedge fund industry’s trade group in London, recently surveyed all the academic literature and concluded that activism is good for the companies that get targeted and good for the market as a whole.That may be the case, although as Aima shows there is a lot of contradictory evidence from different markets around the world. It is not a debate likely to be settled without more evidence, if it can be settled at all. What is more interesting about this latest survey is how weakly it supports the investment case for backing an activist fund.First and most obviously, there is the question of returns. The HFRI activist index climbed 4.8 per cent in 2014, on top of 16 per cent and 21 per cent in the previous two years, so it handily outpaced all other hedge fund strategies, which is why money is clamouring for entry into these funds now. Except that this outperformance is hardly surprising, given the go-go equity market in which these funds are making their stock picks.The activists have not performed markedly differently from the stock market as a whole. They underperformed the S&P 500 in five of the past seven years, roughly one market cycle, but not by much, suggesting they are heavily influenced by market beta.If they were justifying their fees and hedging out this stock market exposure, isolating only the upside attributable specifically to their corporate agitation, then one would expect them to outperform in a down market, but they matched the S&P 500 leg-for-leg on the way down in 2008.A new bear market will have consequences again for activists, as it did in extreme form seven years ago.First, economic uncertainty will make it notably less attractive to pile debt on to a corporate balance sheet and return cash to shareholders, staples of the activist playbook. Second, it will snuff out the merger and acquisition activity that has been a key ingredient in the only incontrovertible value-adding strategy for activists, namely getting their target company to put itself up for sale.$14.2bnThe record amount of money poured into activist hedge funds last yearSomething else dispiriting for activist hedge fund investors: the averages that show industry-leading returns versus other hedge fund strategies obscure huge variations in activists’ returns, according to Aima’s survey of the evidence. A small minority of managers make Ackman-size returns, skewing the HFRI data. A JPMorgan Asset Management survey found that the mean activist return is three times larger than the median. In other words, the average investor is unlikely to match the HFRI index returns.As a collective, activist managers can be applauded for advancing the cause of shareholder democracy and good corporate governance, which was otherwise moving at a glacial pace in the hands of traditional institutional equity owners. That is one secular shift that investors can take comfort in, but it brings societal and market-wide benefits, not ones that accrue to activists specifically.Actually, by encouraging companies to act pre-emptively to respond to shareholders and improve their businesses, activists may be doing themselves out of potential future targets.Activists are the most heavily influenced of all the hedge fund strategies by the ebb and flow of the stock market, and when the ebb tide comes, it will surely wash many of their strong records away.stephen.foley@ft.com
128;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-02-26T13:54:09Z;Asia’s coconuts go global – but what about the farmers?;;"For centuries, street vendors across southeast Asia have hacked open fresh coconuts, selling their refreshing water to thirsty passers-by to drink through a straw. For just as long, teenage girls have doused their hair in the coconut’s fortifying oil.More recently, western consumers have discovered the benefits of coconut products thanks to diet fads and celebrity endorsements — but will those benefits extend to producing countries?As dairy-free diets catch on, coconut milk has become a popular alternative to soy, prompting Starbucks to offer it in its US outlets from this month. Coconut water has benefited too, as glossy magazines and food blogs extol its health benefits.“It’s just this messaging about enhanced rehydration has resonated with consumers… when the big fizzy drink manufacturers are struggling with the war on sugar,” says Alex Beckett, drink analyst at Mintel, a market researcher company.The US market for coconut water is dominated by names such as Zico, owned by Coca-Cola, and Vita Coco, which counts pop star Madonna and actor Matthew McConaughey among its investors and sells one-litre packs of the fashionable drink for $5.29. Meanwhile, Pepsico has two labels, One and Kero-Coco, produced and widely sold in Brazil.Euromonitor valued Vita Coco’s global sales at $420m last year, with Kero-Coco making $406m, Zico $115m and One $49m. That remains modest compared with more established beverages like cola, where Euromonitor estimates market leaders Coca-Cola and Pepsi made sales of $52.5bn and $18.2bn last year. But the market is growing fast.As demand for a variety of coconut products ramps up, proving to be more than just a temporary fad,producers in emerging markets are now looking to make the most of the boom. Sri Lanka is one example.Along with tea and rubber, coconuts are big business in Sri Lanka. The country has a dedicated government department, the Ministry of Coconut Development and Janatha Estate Development. Coconut products contributed 0.8 per cent of GDP in 2013, according to the country’s Coconut Development Authority.To some extent, the south Asian economy has upped coconut exports as global demand has picked up. Some 445.7m nuts were exported in 2013, according to the Coconut Development Authority.But this is a small fraction of the country’s total 2.5bn production and many in the industry lament the fact that Sri Lanka hasn’t been able to grow to its full potential on the back of the new fashion for coconuts abroad.The processing industry is trying to move into higher value-added items. A spokesperson for Vita Coco told beyondbrics that one barrier is the fact that farmers in many countries see coconut water as a by-product and lack the technology to bring it to market – the water must be packaged very quickly after the nut is opened. In Sri Lanka, one of the 12 countries where Vita Coco produces, this is beginning to change“We have some technical barriers to get that coconut water into commercial production,” says Nemindra Manamperi, assistant director at the Sri Lanka Export Development Bank. “People are trying now and some mills are converted, and their water is coming into the industry.”Despite encouraging developments in western markets, the family that own Horathapola Estate, a 50 acre coconut plantation an hour from Colombo, converted their home into a luxury hotel in 2001 in an attempt to open new revenue streams – one sign that the Sri Lankan coconut industry hasn’t benefited as much from new global demand as you might expect.One reason is strong demand for coconuts at home, which has eclipsed the export market. Political commentators say onion prices can sway an election in neighbouring India, where the pungent bulbs are an essential ingredient in any curry, and the same claim is made for coconuts in Sri Lanka, where no meal is complete without a curry cooked in coconut milk or a dish based on desiccated coconut.Until production rises significantly, serving the home market will be the priority for the island’s farmers – whatever the demand abroad.“Demand by the Sri Lankans is inelastic, they will pay more and still want their daily consumption,” says Murtaza Lukmanjee, of Adamjee Lukmanjee and Sons, a Colombo trading house.Some producers would like to see the government encourage imports of other edible oils, such as palm oil, to serve domestic needs, freeing up coconut oil for export.Another problem is an inability to expand production in response to recent demand. Over 80 per cent of the land under coconut plantations is part of small holdings, often run by poorly-off farmers. The country’s famous ‘Coconut Triangle’, just north and east of Colombo, is valuable real estate, which also creates pressure for development.“You have to understand that Sri Lanka is a small country with a growing population, with simply a growing need for land, and coconut land is probably flat land and most suitable for housing and real estate,” Lukmanjee says.Sri Lanka’s coconut plantations are ageing as farmers have been slow to replant, even as overseas demand provides new opportunities. Planting anywhere involves risk. Weather conditions affect harvests and market prices change over time, so landowners are inclined to choose crops that can be harvested more quickly.“The problem with coconut is that it’s a five year cycle from plantation to a decent harvest and in today’s day and age people don’t have the patience for that,” says Lukmanjee. “How do you feed your family for the five years that you wait for the coconut tree?”Colombo is trying to tackle this problem and invested Skr596m ($4.5m) in subsidies in 2013, including spending on seeds.For farmers and producers to really invest in changing their ways and expanding exports, however, they must be convinced that overseas demand really is more than a fad and will not evaporate as soon as Madonna stops clutching a carton of coconut water or model Miranda Kerr begins touting an alternative beauty secret.“Yes, there’s a lot of growth,” says Lukmanjee. “But the growth needs to be sustained for, say, another decade to have long-term significant positive impacts.”Related reading:

129;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

The case examines the 100 years of rivalry between Coca-Cola and Pepsi.David Yoffie, with co-author Penelope Rossano, also won in the strategy and general management category for their 2012 study of Apple, exploring Steve Jobs’ successes and the challenges facing his successor, Tim Cook.Scholars from Harvard also topped the case-writing ranks in the categories of: knowledge, information and communication; finance, accounting and control; production and operations management (with Innsbruck University School of Management); and entrepreneurship. The entrepreneurship case charts the rise of Dropbox, the Silicon Valley start-up.On an individual level, the second big winner was Debapratim Purkayastha, a professor at the ICFAI Business School. He won the category award for human resources and organisational behaviour, as well as scooping the prize for the outstanding contribution to the case method.Further category prizes went to HEC Paris (marketing), Stanford (economics) and HEC Geneva (ethics and social responsibility). The individual prize for outstanding new case writer was won by Copenhagen Business School’s Laurel Austin, while that for outstanding case writer on a hot topic went to Steve Muylle and Stijn Viaene from Vlerick Business School.The Case Centre introduced a new award in 2015 for outstanding case teacher. This was won by Casey Lichtendahl, associate professor of business administration at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia. Like Harvard, Darden is renowned as one of the world’s top case-writing centres.HEC Paris, Innsbruck University School of Management and Vlerick Business School won awards for the first time, but absent from the winning list this year were several European business schools that have been big winners in the past. These include Iese Business School, IMD, Insead and London Business School. Also missing from the winners’ podium was the Ivey school at Western University, in Canada, which has traditionally been viewed as a “mini-Harvard” case-writing school."
131;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-02-22T16:58:14Z;‘I am not a martyr’, says LuxLeaks whistleblower facing jail;Deltour faces jail for leaking 28,000 pages of tax-related documents;When Antoine Deltour decided to carry out one of the biggest financial leaks in history, he did not know what he was getting into.“I had no idea of the consequences,” admits Mr Deltour, the softly-spoken 28-year-old French whistleblower behind LuxLeaks.The documents — which came from auditor PwC and ran to 28,000 pages — revealed how companies ranging from Ikea to Pepsi funnelled money through Luxembourg to lower their tax bills to as little as 1 per cent.Mr Deltour, then a junior accountant at PwC, came across the files in 2010 while searching for training documents on a shared drive and decided to leak them to a French journalist. His motivation? “I thought it was my duty to stimulate public debate.”The leak triggered a global scandal, as newspapers from across the world gorged on tax rulings that demonstrated how 340 of the world’s biggest companies avoided tax through sweetheart deals with the authorities.There was no suggestion the arrangements were illegal under Luxembourg law. But the disclosure fed into a wider debate which was reignited this month by the revelations of widespread tax avoidance in HSBC’s Swiss private banking arm.It also prompted an unsuccessful vote of no-confidence in new European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who had been prime minister of Luxembourg while the rulings were granted.Now Mr Deltour has been charged with five offences, ranging from theft to breaking Luxembourg’s professional secrecy laws, and potentially faces jail and a stiff fine.But he says when he handed over the documents, he did so to reveal the methods used by big businesses to lower their tax bills, rather than shame the companies themselves. “I gave precise instructions not to disclose name of clients or the auditor,” says Mr Deltour. “It was just to enlighten practices, but not to disclose everything.” The journalist in question declined to comment on this claim.Mr Deltour only learnt that the names had not been blanked out when he sat down to watch the first airing of the leaked files on a French current affairs TV show in 2012 at a friend’s house. How did he feel? “I was surprised,” said Mr Deltour. “I discovered that I was potentially in trouble.”Considering the size of the leak — and Luxembourg’s prized reputation for discretion on financial matters — the Grand Duchy’s authorities were slow off the mark in tracking down Mr Deltour. Four years passed between Mr Deltour taking the documents to his being charged in December.“The more I waited, the more I thought I would not have trouble,” said Mr Deltour.Unlike the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, he was not hiding in a South American embassy. Instead, he was working for the French civil service in the northeastern city of Nancy — a two-hour drive from Luxembourg city.Mr Deltour’s rather low-key situation differs from other whistleblowers, such as Hervé Falciani, the computer engineer behind the HSBC leaks who claims to have received death threats. By contrast, Mr Deltour still works for the French civil service but has reduced his hours to focus on his upcoming case.The debate on how to treat Mr Deltour has split Luxembourg. Many in the country’s finance industry want LuxLeaks resolved as quickly and as quietly as possible — without making an example of him. “I hope they have the intelligence not to make him a Julian Assange,” said one senior Luxembourg financier.Others, however, want a strict punishment as a warning to those tempted to follow suit. PwC Luxembourg declined to comment, but in a previous statement in December said it would not respond to remarks by a former employee “who has admitted the theft and has been charged with five criminal offences.”In any case, companies are still keen to run their tax affairs through the Grand Duchy. After suspending tax rulings in November, Luxembourg’s tax authorities face a backlog of hundreds of applications, according to one person familiar with the situation.Most lawyers predict that Mr Deltour will be given a short sentence — probably of less than two years, with much of it suspended — as well as a fine. But with no similar cases in Luxembourg’s history, “this case is a precedent setter”, according to Professor Stefan Braum, a criminal law professor at the University of Luxembourg.While other whistleblowers, such as Edward Snowden, have expressed willingness to serve a jail sentence, Mr Deltour is less keen on the idea, and is raising funds for his defence on a website. “I fully take responsibility,” he says. “But I am not a martyr.”
132;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-02-11T23:38:23Z;Public scientists urged to quit over food and drink group links;British Medical Journal probe sparks accusations of bias and conflict of interest;Leading public health scientists who advise the government on nutrition have received millions of pounds in research funding from food and drinks companies, according to a British Medical Journal investigation that will reignite the row over obesity in the UK.The links have sparked accusations of bias and conflict of interest at the heart of the government’s response to the growing obesity epidemic, with some people calling for the scientists to step down from their advisory roles.Scientists working for the government-funded Human Nutrition Research (HNR) unit were found by the BMJ to have received a total of almost £250,000 a year for the past decade from companies including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Mars, and Nestlé.The BMJ’s report also found extensive research links between members of the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), which advises the government on diet and nutrition, and the food and drinks industry.Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist and science director of the campaign group Action on Sugar, said the public would be “appalled” by the report and said the scientists involved “should consider stepping down”.“It is a scandal that members of the nutritional committee advising us on how much sugar we should consume have received significant funding from companies that profit from selling sugar,” said Dr Malhotra.Fears about the health effects of sugar have grown amid a worsening obesity epidemic. Last year, the World Health Organisation halved its daily recommended allowance for sugar, while the Labour party has pledged to introduce limits on the levels of fat, salt and sugar manufacturers are allowed to include in food primarily marketed to children.In 2011, the government asked the food and drinks industry to pledge voluntarily to reduce salt and saturated fats from the products under the Public Health Responsibility Deal.The report criticises Susan Jebb, a former HNR scientist and now chair of the food network for the government’s Public Health Responsibility Deal, who it says was the lead or joint lead investigator on industry-funded research projects worth £1.37m between 2004 and 2015.It is a scandal that members of the nutritional committee advising us on how much sugar we should consume have received significant funding from companies that profit from selling sugarProfessor Jebb said the industry-funded studies did not involve research into the effects of sugar on health and were all completed before she was appointed to the role in 2011. “All have been conducted according to all the Medical Research Council governance arrangements for working with industry and the industry involvement has been declared,” she said.Tom Sanders, emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics, King’s College London, said that Prof Jebb had been “unfairly vilified in the context of sugar and health — especially as she was an author of papers suggesting a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages”.The Medical Research Council, which is responsible for the HNR unit’s funding, said its research was “free of any influence from those with whom we collaborate, be they a charity or a commercial organisation”.Last year it emerged that five of the eight members of the SACN’s carbohydrates working group had advised or consulted for the food and drinks industry, including Coca-Cola and Mars. The working group’s chair, Ian Macdonald, received funding from the two companies, according to the report.Following the revelations in 2014, the working group published a report recommending people slash their daily sugar intake by half or risk rising levels of obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.An SACN spokesperson said there were “robust checks and balances” to ensure the impartiality of the committee’s work.Mars, PepsiCo, Nestlé and Coca-Cola declined to comment.

Sales gained 5 per cent to $710.3m.Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of 53 cents a share, on sales of $721.9m. Adjusted earnings of 92 cents a share also topped forecasts for earnings of 71 cents a share.The company said that fourth-quarter subscription revenue declined 5 per cent from the year-ago period, as the number of subscribers fell 11 per cent. And on the company’s earnings call, AOL’s chief executive, Tim Armstrong, said 2015 would be an “investment year”.AOL shares, which have declined 12 per cent in the past year, fell 10 per cent to $40.22.PepsiCo shares climbed 2.5 per cent to $100.40 after the company that is behind Doritos and the eponymous drink, said it would return $8.5bn-$9bn to investors through a mix of dividends and share buybacks.The news accompanied disappointing fourth-quarter profits.

Sales of $19.9bn also topped Wall Street expectations.Shares of Lions Gate Entertainment, the entertainment company behind the Hunger Games franchise, rallied 9 per cent to $32.42 after the company announced a stock-swap deal with affiliates of John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media Corp.The company said it will issue shares to Mr Malone, for shares of two classes of stock in cable channel Starz that represents 14.5 per cent voting power. The company also said Mr Malone would join its board of directors.Rite Aid’s move to acquire EnvisionRx, a pharmacy benefit manager, for $2bn, pushed shares of the drugstore chain nearly 7 per cent higher to $8.08. Rite Aid will pay about $1.8bn in cash and $200m in stock.Utilities were the worst performing sector on the US benchmark on Wednesday, declining more than 2 per cent.The S&P 500 was little changed at 2,068.53, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the session little changed at 17,862.14.

He added that the company’s snacks and beverage businesses — which it has been under activist investor pressure to split — “mutually reinforce each other”.Indra Nooyi, chief executive, said Pepsi was the largest contributor to US retail sales growth among all food and drinks manufacturers in 2014.The news comes one month after Pepsi added a representative of Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management to its board, ending a two-year stand-off that had seen the activist investor call for the company’s split.Pepsi returned $8.7bn to shareholders in 2014 and has announced a series of annual $1bn productivity initiatives, which has helped alleviate some of the pressure.On Wednesday Mondelez, a major snacks rival, warned that it could see revenue growth drop about 11 per cent on the strong dollar, while a day earlier Coca-Cola cautioned that currency fluctuations would hit its 2015 profits and revenues. Coke, the world’s largest beverage group — which does not have the benefit of a snacks business to help offset weakness in fizzy drinks — reported a 55 per cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings.Both companies have been coping with dwindling demand for carbonated drinks in the developed world, as consumers become more health conscious. The companies have responded by building up their still drinks businesses, including juice and water.Pepsi’s North American still-drink volume grew 4 per cent during the quarter, while its carbonated soft-drink volume fell 2 per cent.“But the consumer doesn’t really want to walk away from bubbles,” Mr Johnston said, noting the recent launch of Mountain Dew Kickstart, a multi-hundred million dollar business “built almost from nothing”.Fourth-quarter net income fell to $1.3bn from $1.74bn a year earlier. The company earned $1.12 a share, excluding items including foreign exchange conversion, restructuring changes and a pension settlement.Sales slipped 1 per cent to $19.95bn. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.08 on $19.66bn in revenues.Shares in the company closed up 2.45 per cent to $100.39 in New York.
135;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2015-01-30T11:37:42Z;Super Bowl brands find a digital playbook;A maturing online ad market means this year’s budget-busting extravaganza has a familiar flavour;Since the Super Bowls of the first dotcom boom, advertisers have competed to turn the highlight of the American football year into a testing ground for the edgiest digital stunts.This Sunday, as more than 100m Americans tune in to see the Seattle Seahawks face the New England Patriots, the television advertisements that cost $4.5m per 30 seconds will once more be just part of a multimedia marketing strategy tailored to create a far longer-lasting buzz online.Yet this year’s budget-busting brand extravaganza looks less experimental and more familiar: as digital advertising matures, the tricks on display at the Super Bowl are starting to resemble a tried and trusted playbook.From social media “war rooms” to online teasers for televised ads to a stream of football-related hashtags, marketers are deploying a blizzard of promotional campaigns that will extend for weeks before and after NBC’s broadcast.The playing field has carried rewards for those who broke the mould, as with Oreo cookies’ much-lauded impromptu tweet during a blackout in the 2013 Super Bowl, and risks for those who fall flat or offend consumers.But with Facebook’s user base overtaking China’s population, Google’s YouTube reaching more than 1bn sets of eyeballs every month and Twitter counting 284m active monthly users, the digital advertising market has grown up.Budweiser’s war rooms are already up and running in New York, Phoenix, St Louis and Palo Alto, with staff fine-tuning the Anheuser-Busch InBev beer brand’s ads to whatever happens before, during and after Sunday’s game. Facebook, Google and Twitter representatives are there alongside the company’s creative personnel, public relations staff and media-buying partners.Twitter alone has tripled the number of people it sends to man marketers’ war rooms to about 40 as it seeks to be the place to follow the game in real time.“They weigh in from a creative perspective, showing what does very well on their platform and to help make sure media decisions are enacted very quickly, whether that is buying more space quickly or changing how existing buys are deployed,” said Azania Andrews, AB InBev’s senior director of digital connections.American football continues to draw huge viewing figures, even as TV audiences fragment. The NFL has increased its audience even amid heightened scrutiny over its handling of domestic violence cases and head injuries.NBC has said it will be a “huge disappointment” if Sunday’s audience does not beat the record 112m viewers who tuned in to Fox’s 2014 broadcast.Faced with soaring TV rates — Kantar Media says the cost of a 30-second ad rose 75 per cent from 2005 to 2014 — and a crowded field of rival ads, marketers are turning once-exploratory tactics into standard practices.“A Super Bowl commercial is not a TV spot. It’s a social, fully integrated stunt that happens to have a TV spot as part of it,” said Mike Sheldon, chief executive of ad agency Deutsch LA.THE ROOKIE: First-time advertiser Mophie, maker of portable mobile device battery cases, is throwing its hat in the ring to help generate buzz for the entire market.While acknowledging that the price tag is a “significant” chunk of Mophie’s advertising budget, Ross Howe, vice-president of marketing, said: “We didn’t just buy a 30-second ad, we bought all the conversation in the week leading up to it.” Continue readingThis year, first-time Super Bowl advertiser Carnival, the cruise operator, is letting viewers vote on which of four commercials it should run, a crowdsourcing tactic pioneered by Doritos. Nissan has tapped YouTube stars to create videos promoting its game-day spot. During the Pepsi-sponsored Katy Perry halftime show, the singer’s fans can buy merchandise through Twitter, YouTube, Shazam, Samsung smart TVs and Delivery Agent’s ShopTV ecommerce app.Advertisers are treating social sites more like television, investing in glossy videos that can be targeted at specific groups, said Travis Freeman, head of social media strategy at the Dentsu Aegis Network, whose clients include Mondelez, Toyota and Coca-Cola.Viewers increasingly turn to YouTube to watch and re-watch Super Bowl ads, with the number of hours spent viewing ads almost doubling to 6.3m in 2014 from the year before. Last year, the ads were watched more than 160m times on the video site even before kick-off, gaining 2.5 times more views than commercials released on game day.“YouTube marketers know to use the platform several weeks before like rolling thunder leading right up to game day — and afterwards too,” said Suzy Reider, managing director of brand solutions at the Google-owned video platform. “Pepsi is doing 15 spots just made for YouTube.”Facebook, which has been selling itself as a rival to YouTube in online video, is hoping to step up its appeal to marketers this year. It is partnering with Toyota, Pepsi, AB InBev and Intuit TurboTax, among others, to reach consumers playing with their smartphones on the couch.Facebook said 170m people saw related stories on Super Bowl Sunday last year, 85 per cent of whom were on mobile. When Microsoft advertised on Facebook in 2014, they saw an increase in the proportion of 18 to 49 year old Americans reached by their marketing from 35 per cent to 57 per cent, according to Facebook.160mNumber of times viewers watched Super Bowl ads on YouTube before kick-off last yearBut the rising expense of sprawling online and offline Super Bowl campaigns, however, has left some brands cold.“The stakes in the past three to four years have gone up so dramatically. The costs are bigger than just the TV spot,” said Deutsch LA’s Mr Sheldon. “There are advertisers that we’ve worked with in the past, Super Bowl stalwarts, who are saying, ‘You know what, the price has gotten so out of hand, we might just sit this one out’.”Several carmakers will be on the sidelines this year, including Hyundai and Volkswagen. Both were among the top five Super Bowl spenders since 2010.VW said it had “opted to not participate due to other priorities and initiatives across all platforms”.The tortoise beats the hare. That’s the theme of a new ad from Mercedes that will air during the Super Bowl on Sunday, in front of more than 100m viewers. The ad’s 60-second time slot likely cost more than $15m to secure.Continue readingThe proliferation of social media has also opened a third option: catch the Super Bowl wave without paying for a premium TV spot. Newcastle Brown Ale, the Heineken-owned beer brand, had a viral hit last year with a video poking fun at the fact it could not afford a pricey Super Bowl ad.This year, Volvo is piggybacking on rivals’ budgets by asking viewers to tweet at the carmaker anytime a car ad airs during the game.“Twitter lets us reach a targeted audience. We thought it was the best channel for a time-sensitive, people-focused campaign like this one,” said Bodil Eriksson, a Volvo North America marketing executive.Mr Freeman of Dentsu Aegis said such strategies reflected that, particularly for the younger viewers that advertisers were keenest to reach, keeping up with social networks on the “second screen” of handheld devices might take precedence over television. “The phone is the first screen. That’s where we’re putting more of our energy and efforts leading up to these big live event buys.“It’s a campaign that for some will start again on March 1.”Back to the top of the page
136;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Pepsi and Peltz end two-year feud;Representative of activist investor’s Trian fund to join drinks and snacks group’s board;A two-year stand-off between PepsiCo and activist investor Nelson Peltz over whether the company should be broken up ended on Friday evening with a representative of Mr Peltz’s fund joining the Pepsi board.The fizzy drinks and salty snacks group said Bill Johnson, a former chief executive of Heinz turned adviser to Mr Peltz’s Trian Fund Management, would become a director in March.The appointment ends what was an escalating war of words between Trian and Pepsi over whether it should separate its snacks business, which owns Frito-Lay and Walkers crisps, from its drinks operations.While some investors had expressed enthusiasm for a Trian representative joining the board, few had supported Mr Peltz’s repeated calls for a break-up, and Pepsi’s strong share price performance took the edge off the activist’s campaign.“Trian has always believed that PepsiCo is a world-class company with a portfolio of iconic brands, and enormous potential,” Mr Peltz said in a statement, adding praise for chief executive Indra Nooyi.“We support Indra’s commitment to operational excellence, which has resulted in improved performance of the company,” he said.Pepsi shares are up 55 per cent since Trian first revealed it was building a shareholding in the company. Its 1.2 per cent stake is now worth $1.7bn.Mr Johnson was chief executive at Heinz when Mr Peltz launched a campaign for board seats at that company, and Pepsi lauded his 31-year record in the food industry.Ms Nooyi struck a conciliatory tone with regards to Trian. “We have had constructive discussions with Trian for nearly two years,” she said. “They have provided valuable input to many aspects of our business, and the recommendation of Bill as an independent director to the board.”Trian has always believed that PepsiCo is a world-class company with a portfolio of iconic brands, and enormous potentialThe mutual appreciation is a far cry from the language last year, when Trian co-founder Ed Garden called Pepsi “bureaucratic and dictatorial” and said there was a “culture of sycophants” around Ms Nooyi.Trian has not signed a formal settlement deal with Pepsi, as is typical for activists, so is free to continue arguing for a break-up, although sources familiar with both sides suggested this was unlikely. The fund last week launched a new campaign to win board seats at DuPont, a chemicals group it believes should split.Pepsi has undertaken cost-cutting initiatives and buybacks after rejecting pressure to split its stronger snacks business from the slower-growing beverage segment.In October, the company reported better than expected third-quarter profits on the back of higher food sales, which offset a flat drinks business. Pepsi said it expected a 9 per cent rise in fiscal-year earnings per share from an earlier forecast of 8 per cent, excluding the impact of currency.The company saw carbonated drink volume drop 1.5 per cent in North America, echoing a trend felt across the beverages industry.Pepsi and rival Coca-Cola are struggling against a long-term decline in fizzy drinks consumption, particularly in the west. In recent years, even diet soda sales — which had helped offset drops in full-sugar soda consumption — have also shrunk.Pepsi and its peers have begun launching lower-calorie drinks that employ plant-based sweeteners to boost growth.
137;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Target axes struggling Canadian business;;Target abandoned its struggling Canadian business on Thursday after failing to turn around its operations, putting more than 17,000 jobs at risk and wiping out the company’s full-year profit with a $5.4bn writedown.The US retailer, celebrated for bringing fashionable offerings to middle and low income consumers, failed to connect with Canadian tastes and executives feared that the four-year-old venture would fail to reach profitability for another six years.Target, which operates 133 stores in Canada and employs 17,600 people, filed an “application for protection” under Canadian law as it liquidates the business.The company could record loss of more than $2.2bn for the year ending January 31, according to the latest Wall Street estimates, after taking a writedown of about $5.4bn in the fourth quarter.Cash costs to discontinue the Canadian business could reach as high as $600m and are likely to take place in the company’s upcoming fiscal year.Brain Cornell, who took the reins of America’s second-largest discount retailer last year, said that the company could not find a “realistic scenario” in which its Canadian operations would be profitable until at least 2021.“Of all the options that we evaluated, there is no question that a complete exit from Canada was the most difficult,” Mr Cornell said. “After extensive internal due diligence and research, paired with counsel from outside experts, we fulfilled our obligation to do what was right for our company and our shareholders.”The US retailer’s expansion into Canada, which began in 2011 with the first stores opening in 2013, was closely scrutinised and followed by American competitors who viewed the country as an untapped market.Nordstrom, the luxury department store chain, has opened the first of six stores, with plans to bring its low-cost Rack division in the coming years.Empire builders often fail to understand facts on the groundContinue readingTarget said it would set aside roughly $59m, pending court approval, for an employee trust that would provide nearly all of the unit’s staff members with 16 weeks’ pay.Jason Kenney, minister of employment and social development in Canada, said the government would “work as quickly as possible” to provide assistance to those retrenched.The Canadian arm, which was called a “mess” by some analysts, drew criticism from the start as Target opened stores rapidly but stocked shelves with merchandise that was met with antipathy from local customers.Target also drew ire for its prices in Canada, which were higher than those found in the US.Mr Cornell, who joined from PepsiCo, insisted that the exit was the “right decision for the company.” A cyber hack in late 2013 that exposed the details of millions of customers followed by lacklustre performance in the US sharpened the pressure on Mr Cornell.Wells Fargo said the move was “an indication of Cornell’s leadership style, that there are no ‘sacred cows’.” David Schick, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, noted Target could now return more capital to shareholders and invest in its digital operations.“This allows Target to refocus on the US and, over time, buy incrementally more stock back while reinvesting in the business transformation,” Mr Schick said.Shares in Target climbed 3 per cent to $77.50, nearing an all-time high reached earlier this month, after the company also said sales in the US eclipsed its expectations over the holiday period and that its adjusted fourth-quarter earnings would be about 6 cents higher than projected.eric.platt@ft.com@ericgplatt
138;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-12-12T12:00:20Z;10 years from now;;The task set for last Wednesday’s leadership class was an unusual one: to write a retrospective from year 2026, which is when the 10-year reunion of our MBA class will take place. However, before writing a reflection, we had to read a number of 10-year and 20-year reflections from the class of 1976.These were certainly not epitomes of success. Instead, the lives described were either normal, unremarkable or charged with failures. There was the MD of a large bank who ‘settled for’ his position, a divorced female performing odd jobs, a happily married woman with two children who put her career on hold, a man who never spent enough time with his kids. They all seemed content with their lives (who wouldn’t skew towards a positive portrayal in a relatively public document?), however the vast majority of my class found their writings depressing.While at HBS, we are often told that we are “leaders who will make a positive difference in the world”, “future industry titans” or that we can “change the world”. These grand statements are then backed up by a plethora of cases based on the lives of HBS MBA alumni – the famous such as the founder of online marketplace Rakuten and the less well-known but equally remarkable such as Toby Johnson, PepsiCo executive. However, these are the positive deviations from the mean. We are just as likely, if not more likely, to be non-remarkable in both our professional and personal lives.With the seemingly despondent biographies fresh in mind, many of my classmates incorporated trade-offs in their biographies. A common theme went: ‘I went into consulting, worked long hours and almost ruined my relationship, settled down somewhere in Vermont [insert another idyllic place] and had a better work-life balance spending time with my family’.After hearing three consecutive biographies that involved high paycheck / no personal life for 5-10 years, before settling peacefully down, I started to wonder: why do you need to ruin the first years of your post-MBA life before living the life you want? Why do you keep sacrificing life now for a very uncertain payoff later? Why don’t you take a job in the industry that you love?Another observation I had is that most of the reflections defined job and relationship statuses but few described the impact one will have on people and the environment around us.Of the recent Harvard MBAs I admire most, all followed their passions during or straight after graduation: the founders of Rock Health, MBAs Across America and the Gilt Groupe, for example. They took action immediately and didn’t set out to compromise.As we ponder our summer internship choices, we shouldn’t compromise. However hard it is, we should choose a role that brings us joy on Mondays and fulfills us with a sense of purpose. It is extremely hard to find and execute but I believe focus and lack of compromise will enable us to write 10-year reunions we are proud of.

Other companies named include Skype, the internet phone division of Microsoft, and FTSE 100 consumer group Reckitt Benckiser.It comes just weeks after a leak of 28,000 documents from PwC revealed how 340 of the world’s largest companies, including Pepsi and Ikea, had orchestrated their tax affairs within Luxembourg.The new documents will renew pressure on newly installed European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker, who was prime minister of Luxembourg when the bulk of these deals were reached.Mr Juncker saw off calls to resign from European lawmakers last month, defeating a motion calling on him to step down just weeks into his role. He has said that he was not the “architect” of Luxembourg’s tax model, which allowed some companies to pay as little as 1 per cent in tax.But Mr Juncker did praise Luxembourg’s tax code as prime minister, saying that Skype was based in the Grand Duchy because of its “favourable fiscal environment”.Tax campaigners complain that companies are able to reduce their tax bills via a series of complicated loans funnelled through Luxembourg. The Grand Duchy contends that it has a similar tax regime to other EU countries.In a statement to The Guardian, Koch Industries said it “pays its taxes in accordance with applicable laws” and that its affairs in Luxembourg were “legal”.Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of Skype in late 2011, said that it “adheres carefully to the laws and regulations of every country in which we operate”.Disney told the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists: “We manage our tax affairs responsibly and aim to fully comply with all applicable tax rules.”
140;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Danone and PepsiCo targeted in Russia crackdown;Agriculture minister Nikolai Fedorov claims dairy products contain small fraction of fresh milk;Danone and PepsiCo have become the latest victims of Moscow’s crackdown on western companies after Russia’s agricultural minister accused them of adulterating their products with cheap ingredients.On a visit to Omsk, Siberia on Friday, Russia’s agricultural minister Nikolai Fedorov claimed that both Danone and PepsiCo dairy products contained just a fraction of fresh milk.“In these products a maximum of 20 per cent comes from real milk – the rest is a processed milk mixture with coconut, palm oil and other additives,” Mr Fedorov said, according to Itar-Tass, the state-owned newswire.Mr Federov asked regional governors to start paying special attention to the activities of Wimm-Bill-Dann, which is owned by PepsiCo, and Unimilk, which is owned by Danone, “and not let them skim the cream off the cheap raw product that our poor peasants produce”.He accused the companies of taking advantage of government subsidy schemes while passing on inferior products to consumers.Danone and PepsiCo are two of Russia’s biggest foreign investors. PepsiCo entered the market during the Soviet period and in 2011 it paid $3.8bn for Wimm-Bill-Dann, the Russian juice and dairy group, the biggest foreign acquisition in PepsiCo’s history.Danone created Russia’s largest dairy group after merging with local producer Unimilk. It currently operates 20 factories in Russia and employs 12,000 workers.To counter western sanctions imposed because of the crisis in Ukraine, Russia in August implemented a ban on US and European meat, fish, dairy and produce, a move designed to both hurt western farmers and promote Russia’s own agricultural sector, which has lagged behind since the fall of the Soviet Union.In a statement released over the weekend, Danone accused the agricultural minister of defamation. “We are not only outraged by the official’s statements but regard them as defamation, causing damage to our reputation both in Russia and around the world,” the company said.“Danone Russia demonstrates the highest industry quality standards and product safety, as confirmed by repeated inspections by Rospotrebnadzor [Russia’s consumer inspection watchdog . . . We demand a public denial of these lies and this defamatory information.”PepsiCo has not yet commented publicly on Mr Federov’s statements.Analysts say that the domestic fruit, vegetable and milk sectors need government-sponsored incentives to help modernise. But they question government claims that the import ban will actually help local producers, noting that the sector’s broken logistics could take years to rebuild.While the foreign import ban came in the form of a presidential decree signed by Vladimir Putin, lower-ranking officials and ministries have led their own ad hoc attacks on western companies, a campaign that may be implicitly encouraged by the Kremlin, if not officially sanctioned by it.The most high-profile target so far has been McDonald's. Regional health officials shut down eight McDonald's outlets in August after alleging that the company had misrepresented the health facts of many of its dishes and also violated certain health standards. The company’s biggest Russian location by sales was finally allowed to reopen in November, after being shut for three months.
141;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-10-21T15:49:58Z;Coke shares slide as profits disappoint;US drinks group flags $3bn in cost cuts to combat flat sales;Shares in Coca-Cola fell by as much as 7 per cent on Tuesday after flatlining sales, a stronger dollar and heavy restructuring costs led to a weaker-than-expected third quarter for the world’s largest beverage company.Profits fell to $2.1bn for the three months to September 26, from $2,4bn a year before. Revenue totalled $11.9bn, falling short of the $12.1bn forecast by Wall Street.Coke outlined plans to cut annual costs by as much as $3bn by 2019, and warned it expects profit for 2014 to be “below its long-term EPS [earnings per share] growth targets”. The company added that currency effects would squeeze operating income for the full-year by 6 percentage points.Chief executive Muhtar Kent, who has come under activist investor pressure this year over a controversial pay plan for senior executives, stressed that Coke was facing currency pressures and volatile economic environments in both developed and emerging markets.Sales volume rose 2 per cent in Latin America and Asia, but fell 5 per cent in Europe and 1 per cent in North America.“We continue to face a challenging macro environment – far more challenging than was expected at the start of the year,” he said, adding that geopolitical issues were weighing on travel and customer confidence.“There just is a lot of apprehension and so . . . mobility is down. When traffic is down that impacts our immediate consumption business,” he said.The explanation contrasts with the confidence of arch-rival Pepsi earlier this month. Buoyed by sales from its more robust snacks business, it raised its full-year forecast after posting better than expected profits in the third quarter, saying it had not felt the brunt of a summer of political and economic global volatility.“One of the nice things about our portfolio is that we power through geopolitical challenges pretty well. In good times and bad, people tend to want the simple pleasures we are able to offer them,” chief financial officer Hugh Johnston told the FT.Both companies have been grappling with a long-term decline in carbonated drinks sales in developed markets such as the US and Europe, where consumers have cut back on sugar.A bid to diversify its portfolio away from fizzy drinks has led to a number of high-profile acquisitions for Coke. In August, it said it would pay $2.15bn for a 16.7 per cent stake in energy drink brand Monster, following its buyout of Zico coconut water and stakebuilding in Keurig Green Mountain.Mr Kent said on Tuesday that Coke would sell back most of its company owned North American bottling operations to independent bottlers by the end of 2017, and a substantial portion of the remaining territories no later than 2020 as part of a bid to streamline costs.Shares in the company have risen 4.8 per cent this year, lagging PepsiCo’s 12.8 per cent increase but outperforming the S&P 500, which has gained 3 per cent. Shares fell 6 per cent to $40.68 on Tuesday in New York.

Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.29 a share on sales of $17.1bn.PepsiCo lifted its full-year earnings growth forecast to 9 per cent from a previous projection of 8 per cent.“While there has been some underlying expectation for, perhaps, somewhat bigger news with these results, we believe that the top- and bottom-line beat along with a full year EPS guidance raise should be enough to allow the stock to continue to grind higher,” Michael Branca, an analyst at Barclays, said.Shares of Destination Maternity slipped 5 per cent to $14.64 after the maker of maternity clothes issued a profit warning.The company said it now expects full-year earnings between 81 and 86 cents a share, as much as 33 per cent below earlier guidance.Shares of Apple advanced 0.2 per cent to $101.02 after analysts at Oppenheimer raised their rating on the stock to “outperform” from “market perform” with a price target of $115.Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn called on Apple to boost its share buyback programme in a letter to chief executive Tim Cook.Apple responded curtly that they “always appreciate hearing from our shareholders”.Shares of United Continental climbed 3 per cent to $45.04 after the company said third-quarter passenger revenue climbed between 3.5 and 4 per cent from a year earlier.Analysts at Deutsche Bank increased their third-quarter and full-year earnings expectations for United following the results.The S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent to 1,928.21, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2 per cent to 16,659.25 and the Nasdaq Composite eased 2 per cent to 4,378.34.Email: mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
144;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-10-09T13:41:39Z;PepsiCo raises forecast as profits rise;Strong food sales offset flat drinks business;PepsiCo raised its full-year forecast after posting better than expected profit in the third quarter, boosted by its strong snacks business and increased product pricing across developed and emerging markets.The company said that net income rose 5 per cent to $2bn, or $1.32 per share, compared with $1.91bn, or $1.23 per share a year earlier, beating Wall Street estimates. Overall revenue, including currency impacts, was $17.2bn, up 2 per cent from a year earlier.“We delivered good third-quarter results in the face of an ongoing challenged macroeconomic environment driven by increasing volatility in the emerging markets and continued sluggish consumer demand in developed markets,” said chairman and chief executive Indra Nooyi.She added that Pepsi now expects a 9 per cent increase in earnings per share this year, up from an earlier forecast of 8 per cent, excluding currency impacts.Globally, higher food sales offset a flat drinks business, as did a 3 per cent increase in effective net pricing. The world’s largest snack maker also continues to accelerate cost-cutting initiatives and buybacks across the board as it deflects unwelcome attention from activist investors. Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Partners owns a 0.8 per cent stake in the company, has put pressure on PepsiCo to split its more successful snacks business from the sluggish beverage unit.“We continued to show that the combination of beverages and snack foods works really well together,” said chief financial officer Hugh Johnston, adding that the company was the largest contributor to US sales growth in the latest quarter ahead of 30 food and beverage rivals.But the company still reported that carbonated soft drink volume in the key North American market declined 1.5 per cent in the three month period to September 6. Pepsi and its rivals Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple have been grappling with a long-term decline in fizzy drinks consumption in developed markets like the US and Europe, where consumers are cutting back on sugar. More recently, the companies’ diet soda sales have also shrunk, which executives and industry watchers attribute to concerns over artificial sweeteners.Last week PepsiCo introduced a new cola that uses the natural sweetener stevia to cut the calories by more than a third from its conventional sodas. Pepsi True, which will be sold exclusively on Amazon.com this month, will have 60 calories per 7.5 ounce can.In emerging markets, the company continues to enjoy robust growth despite a summer of geopolitical volatility. Revenue in its Latin America foods division rose 6.3 per cent to $2.18bn, while Asia, Middle East and Africa sales climbed 11 per cent to $1.78bn.“Pepsi’s combined emerging market sales growth of 8 per cent, helped by an acceleration of both pricing and turnover volume, flies in the face of other peers,” said Rahul Sharma, retail analyst at Neev Capital.Mr Johnston said: “One of the nice things about our portfolio is that we power through geopolitical challenges pretty well. In good times and bad, people tend to want the simple pleasures we are able to offer them.”PepsiCo shares edged up 1.2 per cent to $95.08 in morning trading in New York on Thursday. The stock is up 18 per cent this year, versus a 6.5 per cent gain for the S&P’s 500 Index.

146;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;India pressures Pepsi to reduce sugar in drinks and snacks;;India has urged PepsiCo, the US-based drink and snack-food company, to reduce the sugar content in its carbonated beverages, making it the latest country to formally express concern about the impact of growing fizzy drink consumption on the health of its citizens.The suggestion to Pepsi came in a meeting between Indra Nooyi, the US-based company’s India-born chief executive, and Harsimrat Kaur Badal, India’s recently installed minister of food processing industries.“PepsiCo has been further requested to bring down the sugar content of soft drinks so that the health aspects of such products are duly taken care of,” the ministry said in a statement issued after the two women met.Pepsi, like rival Coca-Cola, plans to invest $5bn in India by 2020 to cater to rising demand from increasingly affluent consumers of soft drinks and snacks.Pepsi did not respond to requests for comment, though Ms Nooyi has set a long-term goal of transforming the company’s portfolio to focus on healthier products with less sugar, salt and fat to meet changing consumer preferences.The US-company is looking to growth in emerging markets such as India at a time of long-term decline in fizzy drinks consumption by increasingly health conscious western consumers, who are spurning both sugary soft drinks and their artificially sweetened low-calorie versions.But New Delhi, wrestling with twin challenges of a worsening incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease among the affluent, coupled with pervasive malnutrition of the poor, has appeared ambivalent about Pepsi’s plans for growth.In its first budget in July, the new administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi levied an additional 5 per cent excise duty on sugary carbonated beverages to help plug the government’s fiscal hole.The move appeared to class carbonated soft drinks with other traditional “sin” items – cigars, cigarettes, Indian chewing paan and other tobacco products – which also were targets of a steep increase in duties.Pepsi also suffered embarrassment in India in February after Amitabh Bachchan, the Bollywood star who served as the company’s brand ambassador between 2002 and 2005, told students at a prestigious business school that he severed his affiliation with Pepsi, after a schoolgirl publicly questioned him for promoting drinks that her teacher had said were harmful.His comments, which were caught on video and went viral, caused a stir in India’s advertising and marketing community, and put a spotlight on health concerns over Pepsi’s fizzy drinks.In March, the World Health Organisation issued draft guidelines that advised adults not to exceed the equivalent of six teaspoons of sugar a day to avoid health risks such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. However, a single can of Pepsi has the equivalent of nine teaspoons of sugar.Besides its fizzy drinks, Pepsi also offers juices, as well as Lay’s potato crisps, Indian-style salty snacks marketed under the Lehar brand and its Quaker Oats.However, in their meeting, the Indian minister urged Ms Nooyi to focus on healthier, more nutritious foods that could be used in India’s vast school lunch programmes, especially for rural children suffering from anaemia.
147;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-08-22T16:34:34Z;The taste test: colas;The earliest form of the drink contained cocaine from coca leaves but today it is more benign, relying on caffeine for its kick, caramel for its colour and spices for its flavour;"On a warm summer evening I carefully draw the blinds to conceal what’s on my kitchen table: a line of coke that four of us are about to enjoy. OK, before ’elf and safety are on to me, I should clarify that we’re tasting 13 colas. But, in truth, there is a connection, since the earliest form of the drink in 19th-century America contained cocaine elements from coca leaves (if you’ve ever chewed them, as I have, you’ll know that they numb your mouth within minutes).Today the drink is rather more benign, relying on caffeine for its kick (particularly the diet varieties), caramel for its colour and a range of citrus and spices for its flavour. Coca-Cola is notoriously coy about its recipe, which it obfuscates with the word “flavourings” on the label. But in the land of the free there’s now, predictably, a range of drinks called “open source colas” that reveal all their ingredients, featuring the likes of citrus oils, coriander, nutmeg and lavender.None of this exotica should make us forget that full-fat cola contains about 10 per cent sugar, which is why diet versions have become so popular (Pepsi says that diet variants now account for more than two-thirds of its sales).Our panel comprised the Discerning Litigator (DL), the Gourmet Celeb (GC), the Carnivorous Graduate (CG) and the Gluttonous Pig (GP). They tasted both the diet and the full-strength, both big brands and small. Lest we should appear over-influenced by the marketing might of Coke and Pepsi, let’s start with our reaction to the indie labels.Our favourite here was Cockta, imported from Slovenia, which came fourth in the overall tasting. Rather charmingly, its chief flavouring is rosehip and, unusually, it claims to be caffeine free: “very strong vanilla nose, very fizzy”(GP); “a touch too sweet”(GC).Then there was Gusto, brewed in west London, in seventh place. It uses trendy old Amazonian guarana as its source of caffeine. Its makers say that it “blends 14 rare botanicals … inspired by a 12th-century Taoist recipe” in order to give “clarity, energy and focus”. Indeed. What we liked about it was that, sweetened by apple juice, it had a balance of acidity that gave it a more adult taste. But the overall flavour reminded us of a favourite pudding: “stewed prunes” (GC); “an old person’s cordial?” (CG).For those with a self-denying nature, I’m afraid the best two colas were not diet versionsDalston Cola, from fashionable east London, is very upfront about its ingredients: juiced lemon, lime, orange, sultanas, fresh ginger root, nutmeg, cinnamon, star anise, lavender and fresh cola nuts. The clever Discerning Litigator blind-spotted the star anise but didn’t altogether approve: “smell of aniseed, medicinal”.For those with a self-denying nature, I’m afraid the best two colas were not diet versions. But Pepsi Max did come third, doing better than both Diet Coke and Coke Zero. Its obvious artificial sweeteners are aspartame and acesulfame-K: “very serviceable, typical cloying aftertaste”(GC); “OK, artificial sweetener, but sharper cleaner flavour”(GP).Original Coca-Cola came second. It was spotted immediately by the Gourmet Celeb: “tastes like ‘the real thing’.” Two other tasters approved, albeit grudgingly: “standard cola, classic kids’ party stuff” (CG); “OK, I’ll drink it” (DL). But the Gluttonous Pig was less impressed: “slightly dead taste”.And now to our top cola, which is a supermarket own-label product. Simply M&S Cola comes in a two-litre bottle, is coloured with barley malt rather than caramel, uses citric acid rather than the more common phosphoric acid and, intriguingly, contains apple, carrot and hibiscus concentrates. M&S does not specify its flavourings but we found some interesting traces: “tastes of lime with cinnamon notes”(GP); “cinnamon nose, classic recipe” (DL); “delicious”(CG). The Gourmet Celeb was more grudging (“standard fare”) but it was a clear winner nonetheless.It may be churlish to point out that M&S’s diet version did not do nearly so well. With similar ingredients we wondered whether this is because it uses a different artificial sweetener: sucralose.1. Simply M&S Cola£0.89 for 2l bottle; marksandspencer.com2.

148;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-08-20T17:59:20Z;Calm force during Goldman’s darkest hours;James Schiro, ‘Brooklyn guy’ who led PwC;"Five years ago, with Goldman Sachs a whipping boy for regulators and politicians, Jim Schiro decided to join its board.From his seat as an independent director he faced regulators and politicians, who would accuse the bank of mis-selling complex debt instruments, air its internal emails and harangue its executives. Rolling Stone magazine was about to brand the group “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity”.Schiro, who died last week aged 68, played his role in dealing with the crisis as he had dealt with others during his career at Price Waterhouse and Zurich Financial – calmly, methodically and with a quiet charm that worked as well on union activists as business leaders.“There has been so much controversy, and he showed how it can be done, and how it should be done,” says fellow Goldman director Bill George. “Over the time he was on the board our reputation improved considerably”.In 2012, Schiro was elevated to lead independent director and gradually was given more power than chief executive and chairman Lloyd Blankfein had ever ceded since he took Goldman public in 1999 – including the responsibility of setting the board’s agenda. Those gestures and Schiro’s deft handling of restive investors helped quell the calls for Mr Blankfein to lose one of his roles.In internal meetings, he brought an accountant’s eye to board meetings, arriving with detailed checklists. “Rigid in that,” says Mr Blankfein, ""but not trapped by it.”Born on January 2 1946 and raised in an Italian-American family in New York, Schiro’s first job during high school was as a delivery boy for the local butcher. He won scholarships from the Knights of Columbus and Citibank to attend New York’s St John’s University.After graduating he began his career in 1967 at Price Waterhouse, where he would spend more than three decades, and the following year married his wife Tomasina, who survives him along with two children and a granddaughter.“He was not ‘to the manor born’,” notes Mr Blankfein. “He was a Brooklyn guy who went to local schools and found himself chairman of Price Waterhouse.”At Price Waterhouse, he worked his way to become chairman and senior partner, where he spearheaded the most momentous shake-up of his career: merging with Coopers & Lybrand in 1998 – an unusual and tricky combination of two storied partnerships – and became chief executive of the new PwC, a commanding force in accountancy and consulting.He left in 2001 and took the reins at Zurich Financial Services, helping put the company back on its feet after a near-collapse in 2002 and then steering it through the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, becoming a regular visitor to New Orleans and contributing to rebuilding the city.The first non-Swiss to lead it, Schiro is widely credited with turning that company around with his textbook “Zurich Way”. His cost-cutting strategy streamlined operations, eliminated non-core businesses and cleaned up the portfolio.As a director of PepsiCo, Schiro helped select Indra Nooyi as chief executive at the food and drinks company. She says he improved audit standards and “knew PepsiCo had to go through a transformation because the world was transforming”.He continued with several big board roles after leaving Zurich Financial in 2009 and, though he did not retire, he did have a house in Florida, recalls Ms Nooyi. But he used it – “above the call of duty” – to get to know executives. “He’d say, ‘rather than just a dinner, come spend a weekend with me and my wife.’”He attended board meetings at Goldman and PepsiCo until late July this year before undergoing treatment for multiple myeloma, the blood cell cancer that took his life."
149;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-08-15T16:53:31Z;Retailers retreat as discounting hits margins;;The US retail sector weakened on Friday as discounting continued to weigh on margins of some of the country’s largest department chains, despite relative strength in the crucial back-to-school season.The week saw both Macy’s and Nordstrom report lower gross margins as each invests further in online operations, which has proven one of the few growth areas for legacy retailers.Executives with the two retailers also cited continued “promotional” activity across the industry as companies try to goad consumers back into their stores, although some commentary indicated discounting has moderated in recent months.“Each of the department stores attributed their gross margin performance to various factors: excess spring inventory, elevated promotions, mix shift, and expansion,” said Stephen Grambling, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.“In our view, promotions likely remained elevated but were more manageable as demand improved.”Nordstrom was among the hardest hit on Friday after reporting a sharp increase in inventories, primarily for its off-price Rack division, compared with same-store sales growth.“Nordstrom may face margin pressure as it adjusts its strategy in light of the highly promotional environment,” Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said. “While high investment spending may be good for the long term, we expect it to continue to impede near-term results.”Shares of Nordstrom declined 5 per cent to $65.11, Macy’s fell 1 per cent to $57.45, Sears fell 2 per cent to $35.16 and Dillard’s, which also reported results, fell 8 per cent to $106.11.Shares of JC Penney, whose last two years have been scarred by a battle with activist investor Bill Ackman and the ousting of former chief executive Ron Johnson, slid after climbing 10 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday, following the broader sector lower.The initial investor enthusiasm followed quarterly results that showed same-store sales climbed 6 per cent in the quarter to August 2, ahead of consensus expectations.Overall sales advanced 5.1 per cent to $2.8bn while its loss narrowed to $172m, or 56 cents per share.Both figures topped Wall Street expectations. Since the return of former chief executive Mike Ullman in April 2013, the retailer has restored the coupons and brands that helped lure middle-income shoppers to its stores.JC Penney shares slid 2 per cent to $9.50.Coca-Cola agreed to pay $2.15bn for a 16.7 per cent stake in Monster Beverage, sending shares of the latter up 27 per cent to $90.73.Monster, whose energy drinks include Monster Energy, Monster Rehab as well as Peace Tea iced teas, has been mooted as a possible target for Coca-Cola as it seeks new sources of growth.Coca-Cola said it would transfer its worldwide energy drink business to Monster and would amend current distribution agreements to bring Monster drinks to markets outside of the US and Canada.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chief executive, said the deal would support the soft drink company’s long-term growth plans.“Coca-Cola has historically had a difficult time gaining significant traction in the energy category and with this partnership agreement, will be able to quickly gain access to one of the most attractive beverage categories in a capital efficient way,” Bonnie Herzog, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Coca-Cola shares advanced 2 per cent to $40.88 while rival PepsiCo rose less than 0.1 per cent to $91.85.SeaWorld, the US theme park operator that has come under fire for its treatment of captive killer whales, advanced 4 per cent to $18.66 after it said it would build new facilities for the animals.The US company, which operates theme parks in Orlando and San Diego, will spend $10m creating new killer whale tanks.The announcement comes after SeaWorld acknowledged that the publicity generated by a documentary about its parks, Blackfish, had hit attendance. Its shares slumped 33 per cent on Wednesday.Overall, US equity markets ended flat after a day of volatile trading following reports of a military clash in Ukraine.The S&P 500 was virtually unchanged at 1,955.06 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 16,662.91. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 4,464.93.eric.platt@ft.com@ericgplatt
150;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Target turns to PepsiCo for new head;;Target has appointed Brian Cornell from PepsiCo as its first chief executive from outside the company since the second-largest US retailer was founded more than a century ago.Mr Cornell, 55, who will start on August 12, will have to contend with the continuing fallout from a damaging cybersecurity breach late last year that rattled consumers’ confidence. He will also spearhead a turnround effort in Canada, following a botched push into the market that began in 2011.The experienced retail executive, who resigned as head of PepsiCo’s Americas food business last week, previously worked at Target’s bigger rival Walmart, where he was head of the Sam’s Club division.Target has had a bruising six months since hackers broke into its systems during last year’s busy Thanksgiving holiday shopping period and stole the personal information of 70m people and the payment card data of 40m.It has been looking for a new chief executive since the board forced Gregg Steinhafel to step down in May amid concerns about the direction of the business.“Our company has made it very clear in recent months that we have a lot of work do in order to improve in the eyes of our customers and shareholders. A new leader was required to accelerate that effort,” said Dustee Jenkins, vice president of public relations on Thursday.“In Brian the board has chosen an outsider, but more importantly someone with global experience in both grocery and consumer product retailing, plus a history of leading transformational efforts at a time when we need a transformational figure at the helm.”Target cut its full-year forecast as it said it would need to spend more than a year fixing the various problems across its business. Its first-quarter net profit fell more than expected, down 16 per cent to $418m.Mr Cornell will not only have to find a way of reigniting sales in the US. Analysts believe his main priority will be to get a grip on Target’s troubled expansion into Canada. Tony Fisher, the president of Target Canada, was fired in May.“The most pressing concern for investors will be Canada, a disastrous path that was meant to lead to growth but has seen Target burn through $1.64bn in cash and could even result in the company pulling out of the country all together. With consumers, you don’t get a second chance at a first impression,” said Stacey Wilditz, retail analyst at SW Retail Advisors.She added that unlike more downmarket rivals, Target had enjoyed a wave of customer popularity thanks to its distinctive home and apparel offerings at premium, which had been lost as the company focused more on mass-market product and groceries.“They need to rediscover fast their unique brand identity and position, which is what really made them stand out from the crowd,” Ms Wilditz said.Mr Cornell acknowledged the task at hand, saying: “I will focus on our current business performance in both the US and Canada and on how we accelerate our omnichannel transformation.”Target’s shares have underperformed the wider US stock market over the past 12 months, with a 14 per cent drop. The S&P 500 has gained 17 per cent and Walmart has fallen 4 per cent.Before joining Walmart, Mr Cornell held the position of chief executive at Michaels Stores and before that was chief marketing officer for Safeway.Target is due to announce its second-quarter earnings on August 20.
151;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-07-29T18:52:45Z;Food industry boosts lobbying on product labelling;;The food industry has beefed up its lobbying efforts in 2014 as it seeks to beat back bills mandating the labelling of food products containing genetically modified ingredients.During the first three months of the year the food and biotech industry spent $9m on lobbying that made mention of labelling, nearly as much as in all of 2013, according to a report by the Washington-based Environmental Working Group.The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which counts Mondelez, Kellogg, and Hillshire Brands as members, spent $1.2m on lobbying efforts that mentioned labelling in the first quarter. Members Coca-Cola and Pepsi spent an additional $2.7m and $1.2m, respectively, according to the report.The association called the EWG report “inaccurate and misleading” because “GMO labelling is just one of the many policy issues that we engaged with policy makers on during that period”.Scott Faber, a former lobbyist for the GMA who now works for EWG, countered that the report specifically notes that the lobbying efforts include but are not exclusive to labelling. “No one knows more about misleading consumers than the food industry,” he said.The growth in spending is a sign that the industry sees a serious threat in state laws that mandate labelling, like a recently passed bill in Vermont and those up for a vote in Colorado and Oregon later this year. Around 30 other states are set to introduce such bills, according to advocates.It also reflects an industry effort to push the debate to the national stage by promoting its own national voluntary labelling law that would replace the state-by-state laws it has spent millions fighting. In 2012 anti-labelling groups spent more than $45m to defeat a California ballot initiative and $22m in Washington last year.Last month a group of consumer activists, led by Jerry Greenfield, the co-founder of the Ben & Jerry’s ice cream chain – presented Congress with a petition with 400,000 consumer signatures in support of a mandatory nationwide labelling requirement.“It’s very simply about a consumer’s right to know what is in the food they eat,” Mr Greenfield said.The food industry counters that labelling is cost prohibitive and stigmatises GM foods as “Franken-foods”. They also argue that there is no evidence that their products are unsafe for human consumption.“What [the activists] are trying to do is create a patchwork of laws that would be disruptive to interstate commerce,” said Mike Gruber of the GMA. “The end goal … is to get our companies to re-source our ingredients to non-GMOs”.Such a change, he says, would bring a large reduction of usable food ingredients. More than three-quarters of all corn grown in the US, along with 93 per cent of soyabeans, is genetically modified, according to the Department of Agriculture. Over 70 per cent of processed foods in the US contain GM ingredients by some estimates.“There is a war against modern agriculture, and the battlefield is on the label”, said another industry lobbyist close to the debate.But Mr Greenfield contends that the food industry’s voluntary labelling proposal will centralise the industry’s control and deprive consumers of basic rights. “If these companies think GMOs are so great, why don’t they trumpet that they have GMOs in their products instead of trying to hide it?”The Obama administration, which has been supportive of biotechnology and active on other food issues – such as promoting organic food and healthier school lunches – has yet to offer clear guidance on GMO labelling.
152;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-07-23T17:05:04Z;Pepsi: treatment, not surgery;Trian has made the case for a shake-up, not a break-up;"The patient is not in perfect health. Symptoms of illness are visible. But surgery is not yet required.The results of Pepsi’s second-quarter check-up were a bit better than expected. Organic revenue growth was 4 per cent; operating profit grew faster. The North American Beverages business, the locus of the worst aches and pains, showed a bit of growth. The target for 2014 earnings per share was bumped up ever so slightly. Pepsi shares ticked up, and have now returned 40 per cent in two years.None of this will appease Nelson Peltz. The head of activist fund Trian Partners has been calling for the scalpel. Separate beverages from snacks, he says, and costs will decline, focus will make both businesses more competitive, and value will be unlocked. There is truth in this diagnosis. Shares in Mondelez, a pure-play snacks spin-off from Kraft, have outperformed Pepsi since it was separated in 2012, and it has a tighter cost structure. Over a decade, Pepsi’s stock has performed like Coke’s – little credit for snacks. The snacks unit has grown 6 percentage points faster than drinks, on average, over two years. Investors might pay up for growth in a separate entity.But standard arguments for disaggregation depend on multiple arbitrage – the idea that the higher-growth business will trade at a higher valuation once separated. The arbitrage opportunity does not seem that great in this case, however: Pepsi’s multiples of earnings and cash flow are not very much lower than those of pure-play Mondelez. The case for separation depends heavily on the idea that the snacks and drinks will perform better operationally when separated. So why not first work on performance in the current structure? Pepsi is busy taking costs out. Trian has made the case for a shake-up, not a break-up, of the patient.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
153;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-07-23T16:51:58Z;Calstrs calls on Pepsi to give Trian place on board;;One of the US’s largest pension funds has asked Pepsi to give activist investor Nelson Peltz a seat on the board, after becoming disillusioned with the soft drinks maker’s performance.The demand from Calstrs, the California teachers’ retirement system, which owns a $250m stake, was made in a letter to Pepsi’s senior independent director, Ian Cook, last month and is echoed by at least one of the company’s top 10 shareholders, the Financial Times has learnt.Although Mr Peltz’s investment firm, Trian Partners, has made little headway in its year-long battle to persuade Pepsi to split off its snacks business, his meetings with scores of shareholders have persuaded some that his voice should at least be heard in the boardroom.Calstrs is not backing the break-up call, but wrote in a letter dated June 30 that Trian could help Pepsi address its operational performance and open management to new ideas.“Trian has a long history of doing very well at these food and beverage companies,” said Aiesha Mastagni, investment officer at Calstrs, who wrote the letter, citing its previous activist positions at Heinz, Snapple and Kraft.Calstrs’s stake amounts to 0.2 per cent of Pepsi shares, putting it in the top 60 shareholders, according to Bloomberg data, and its concerns were echoed by top 10 shareholders who did not want to be identified.One said: “They are good shareholders and they have ideas worth looking at, so we are hoping everybody comes together.”Another top 10 investor explicitly backed the idea of a board seat for Trian, saying Pepsi could learn from the investor’s industry experience while Mr Peltz could learn more about the business before continuing his campaign to split it in two.“The bigger issue is leadership,” this shareholder said. “The CEO does not have the respect of the investor community. If Trian were on the board, maybe she would listen. I would like to think she is still flexible enough to adapt.”The move came as Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, raised the group’s full-year adjusted earnings forecast to 8 per cent from 7 per cent after announcing higher than expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday.Pepsi’s snacks business, which includes Quaker Oats and Doritos, outshone a drinks division that is home to Pepsi, 7Up and Tropicana. Organic revenue at the former climbed 5 per cent in the quarter to June 14, compared with 2 per cent at the latter.Carbonated soft drinks volume in the North American market fell 2 per cent, mirroring the second-quarter results of rival Coca-Cola, which said its soda volumes in the region were flat as customers were becoming more health-conscious.Faster growth at the snacks division was not enough to prevent PepsiCo’s quarterly profits dipping to $1.97bn from $2bn.Revenues rose to $16.89bn, up from $16.8bn. PepsiCo shares rose by more than 4 per cent to $92.89 during early-morning trading on Wall Street. The company refused to comment when asked about Calstrs’s demand to put Mr Peltz on the PepsiCo board.The battle between Pepsi and Trian has become increasingly heated, with Trian accusing Ms Nooyi of presiding over a bloated head office and a “culture of sycophants”. Pepsi rejected splitting the company after a review this year.Calstrs’s position puts it at odds with the other big California pension fund, Calpers, which has a 0.3 per cent stake in Pepsi and is not backing Trian for a board seat.Anne Simpson, corporate governance head at Calpers, said: “The problem Nelson Peltz has got is that he has gone into the public arena being nasty about Ms Nooyi. If he hadn’t been so ungentlemanly, it could have worked.”Additional reporting by Elizabeth Paton
154;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-07-23T16:50:56Z;Delta gains on domestic demand underpin;;Delta Air Lines lifted the US airline sector on Wednesday after it said results were underpinned by strong domestic demand, offsetting weaker international figures.The Atlanta-based carrier was the first of the country’s major airlines to report quarterly results, which showed a 16 per cent surge in US passenger revenues.Overall, sales climbed 9 per cent from a year earlier to $10.6bn, in line with Wall Street expectations. Profits advanced 17 per cent to $801m, or 94 cents per share.The sales figures in the US were eclipsed only by the company’s operations in Latin America, which jumped 23 per cent.Delta, which acquired a 49 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic last year, has tried to improve its offering to economy passengers on the New York to Los Angeles route – one of the most profitable ones for carriers in the US.Delta’s performance in the quarter was also helped as oil hedges cut its fuel expenses. Cost cuts, consolidation and a steady improvement in the US economy have swelled profits at US airlines over the past year and sent their shares soaring.The wider Dow Jones Transportation Average, which includes Delta, has risen 30 per cent in the past 12 months.Delta shares climbed 4 per cent to $39.15. United Airlines rose 3 per cent to $46.00 while American Airlines advanced 2 per cent to $43.33.Shares of Hawaiian Airlines, which reported better than expected results, soared 14 per cent to $14.75.Puma Biotechnology shares nearly tripled after the company said results of a late-stage experimental breast cancer treatment study helped prevent the return of the disease.The drug, neratinib, was studied in women who had undergone surgery to remove a tumour and completed treatment under Roche’s Herceptin IV infusions.Puma said patients who were then treated with neratinib showed a 33 per cent improvement in disease free survival, compared to those on placebo. Disease-free survival indicates the length of time a patient lives without signs of the illness returning.Analysts with Citigroup said the study “was a game changer” and sales could reach $4.1bn a year.“This is a solid result and will lead neratinib to be a part of the standard of care,” Yaron Werber, an analyst with Citi, said. Mr Werber expects the drug to gain regulatory approval in 2016.The results come amid a volatile year for the biotech sector, which has been under renewed pressure after the Fed voiced concern about the valuations of biotech, social media and small-cap stocks.Although the Nasdaq Biotech index has recovered much of its losses since touching a February peak, it has often swung wildly. The index slumped more than 20 per cent from February to an April low before rebounding.Puma shares surged 295 per cent to $233.43, valuing the company at $7bn. Roche rose remained essentially unchanged at $36.82. The broader biotech index advanced 2 per cent to 2,709.89.PepsiCo, the company under pressure to split itself in two, said on Wednesday that sales at the US company’s snacks business continued to outshine its drinks division.Organic revenues at the company’s Americas foods group climbed 4 per cent in the quarter while those of beverages inched 1 per cent higher.Faster growth at the snacks division was not enough to prevent quarterly profits dipping 2 per cent to $1.98bn, or $1.29 a share. PepsiCo, which is cutting $1bn in costs, also raised its full-year profit forecast.Pepsi shares climbed 2 per cent to $90.82.Apple shares continued a years long climb, rising 3 per cent to $97.19, after the company reported quarterly profits ahead of Wall Street expectations.While iPhone and iPad shipments fell short of forecasts, the company said it was seeing strong growth in emerging markets.Overall, US equity markets shifted higher as earnings season barrelled on. Of the 148 companies within the S&P 500 to report thus far, more than four-fifths have met or exceeded expectations.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,987.01, after touching a record high of 1,989.23, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 17,086.63.

155;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-07-22T17:07:16Z;Chipotle outpaces rivals on strong sales;Results contrast with those from McDonald’s;Chipotle continued to outpace rivals in the fast food sector, reporting strong gains in same store sales as peers including McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fail to ignite consumer interest.Profits at the chain known for its steak and barbacoa tacos climbed 26 per cent to $110.3m, or $3.50 a share, in the quarter to June 30. Sales climbed 29 per cent to $1.05bn as same-store sales rose 17.3 per cent.Analysts on Wall Street had expected profits of $3.09 a share from sales of $990m.The results contrasted with those from McDonald’s, which once again saw tepid demand in the US for its burgers and fries. Same-store sales at the company’s US outlets declined 1.5 per cent in the quarter, a steeper dip than analysts expected.While McDonald’s has continued to focus its strategy around lower cost items through its dollar menu, executives at Chipotle have lifted prices at the chain’s 1,600 restaurants since April, a decision they argue has offset rising food inflation.The move received little push back from Chipotle’s fervent following and the company now expects same-store sales to increase by a “mid-teens” percentage over the remainder of this year.“We continue to believe Chipotle [is] the best growth story in restaurants,” Jeffrey Bernstein, an analyst with Barclays, said. “With most restaurants struggling to drive positive traffic, Chipotle remains an anomaly, justifying an outsized valuation.”Shares in the Mexican restaurant chain soared 12 per cent to $659.77 on the news, while McDonald’s retreated 1 per cent to $96.27. Taco Bell owner Yum Brands advanced 1 per cent to $74.84.Harley-Davidson led the benchmark S&P 500 lower on Tuesday after the company cut its outlook for full-year shipments.The motorcycle maker now forecasts a 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent rise in shipments this year compared to 2013. In April, it had predicted growth of between 7 and 9 per cent.The company pinned the blame on poor weather and a lull in sales of one of its models before the release of a new version later this year.Harley-Davidson shares fell 5 per cent at $63.46.Profits at Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest soft drinks maker, slipped in the second quarter as sales in the US failed to lift off.The company said net income fell 3 per cent to $2.6bn, or 58 cents a share, in the quarter to the end of June. Revenues were also under pressure, falling to $12.6bn from $12.7bn.Coca-Cola, which built its brand and fortune selling the world fizzy drinks, is grappling with a US market that is losing its taste for sugary drinks.The company said Coca-Cola volumes in North America edged up 1 per cent in the quarter, while overall sales in the region were flat.Shares in the company fell 3 per cent to $41.19 while rival PepsiCo declined 1 per cent to $89.17.Crocs, the struggling maker of colourful plastic clogs that were ubiquitous a decade ago, announced it will close or convert up to 100 of its stores and lay off 183 employees.The closures are expected to save $4m in 2014 and $10m in 2015, as Crocs seeks to save cash and revive its business.Crocs announced the move along with second-quarter earnings that were ahead of Wall Street expectations. Shares of Crocs advanced 13 per cent to $16.72.Netflix shares dipped 5 per cent to $431.09 after the company said its international expansion would drive losses in the division higher.The company, which started in the US, has expanded aggressively across Europe and racked up losses of $712m abroad since 2012.The initial losses have not dented Netflix’s ambition beyond the US. It plans to add service in France and Germany this September. Analysts with Jefferies said the expansion would “pressure” the company’s margins.Overall, US equity markets rose after a report showed the sale of previously owned homes recovered more than expected and core inflation in the country eased.The S&P 500 advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,983.53, touching a new record high earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 17,113.54.

156;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-07-21T12:30:14Z;Peruvian upstart AJE takes on Coke and Pepsi in Asia;AJE knows how poorer consumers think about value for money;"Sebastianus Hendro Kistanto, an IT technician in the Indonesian city of Semarang, always drank Coca-Cola, even after he stop­ped working for the US soft-drinks company’s operation in the country.That was until he picked up his first bottle of Big Cola last year, attracted by the low price – just Rp3,000 (25 cents) for a 535ml serving. “Coke has the best taste but Big Cola costs much less,” he says, adding that he drinks about four bottles a week.Like many of the growing number of Big Cola drinkers in Asia, Mr Kis­tanto wrongly believed it came from the UK, an easy mistake as the logo of the English Football Association looms larger on the bottle than the brand name. In fact, Big Cola is from Peru, and the FA logo is there as part of an ambitious marketing push.The company that owns Big Cola, family-owned AJE Group, is one of the Andean nation’s biggest international corporate success stories.A combination of a low-cost strategy, clever marketing and relentless focus on emerging markets has helped this little-known company take on Coke and Pepsi, the global soft drink giants, in Latin America and Asia. In the process it is showing how a nimble developing-world rival can use its home market experience to tap into demand from hundreds of millions of new consumers in emerging markets.“This is one of the most competitive categories in the world,” says Antonio Soto, smooth-talking Spanish head of AJE’s Asian business and former president of Pepsi Bottling Co in Spain, which merged with PepsiCo in 2009. “If you had asked me five years ago, when I was running PepsiCo in Spain, if what these guys have done is possible, I would have said no.”Ironically, this capitalist triumph owes its origins to the Shining Path Maoist rebellion of the 1980s, when tens of thousands were killed. AJE was started by five siblings in the Añaños family in 1988 after waves of violence sweeping the countryside forced them to flee their farm for the small city of Ayacucho. As Ángel Añaños, AJE’s president and one of the founders, once put it: “Thanks to terrorism, we were able to change sectors and start in this industry.”With access to many products inc­luding Coke cut off, they made their own cola – called Kola Real in Peru – in their back yard and sold it in empty beer bottles. “It was quite a difficult time, [but] when many people saw problems and risks, the Añaños siblings found an opportunity and took advantage,” says Gonzalo Beg­azo, the Lima-based executive financial vice-president for AJE.The four brothers and one sister, who own 100 per cent of the company, ex­panded into other Latin American countries before making the leap into Asia in 2006, starting in Thailand.The fifth-biggest soft drinks company in Latin America, AJE last year ranked 21 of all soft drinks makers globally, according to market res­ear­cher Euromonitor, with sales of about $2bn. AJE’s global sales grew at an average of 22 per cent a year from 2000 to 2013, but its share of the global market was 0.4 per cent, compared to Coke’s 25 per cent and 10.7 per cent for Pepsi.Based in Madrid so he can bridge the times zones between Latin America and Asia, Mr Soto is in southeast Asia 15 days a month. He says the family entered Asia because they felt in­stinctively that they could win over “bottom of the pyramid” consumers rather than because they had undertaken detailed market studies.That epitomises a corporate culture focused on risk-taking and moving fast – in stark contrast to Mr Soto’s former employer, he says, on a tour of AJE’s newest, state of the art bottling plant on the outskirts of Jakarta, its third factory in Indonesia. “At AJE, you have access directly to the board and decisions are made like this,” he says, clicking his fingers.Whatever the corporate structure, consumer goods companies need an extensive distribution network if they are to conquer Indonesia, the world’s biggest archipelago nation. While Coke relies on a global network of local bottling companies, AJE does all the manufacturing and then works with local distributors.From its headquarters in the Cikarang industrial estate outside Jakarta to the roadside shacks from Java to Sulawesi where its products are often sold, AJE’s aim is to keep costs, and therefore prices, low. “The consumption of soft drinks in emerging markets is a question of affordability, as well as availability,” Mr Soto says.It is also a question of tapping demand among those less attuned to the health risks of sugary drinks.Catherine Eddy, managing director of the Indonesian office of Nielsen, the researcher, says that as wealthier consumers become more health conscious, companies selling sugary soft drinks will focus more on lower in­come consumers in countries such as Indonesia. “Big Cola has a very low price point and the low-end consumers are not worried about health,” she says. “They want products that are fun and affordable.”The company’s strategy is to sell products that are similar to its rivals’ but at a price 25 per cent lower.Although AJE had no previous experience of southeast Asia and its diverse cultures, religions and tastes, it does understand poor consumers’ concept of value.For UK shoppers at a Tesco supermarket in Surrey, value is about how many items they can fit in their trolley each week for the same amount of money, Mr Soto says. For people living on the crowded outskirts of booming Asian or Latin American cities, earning a few dollars a day, value is all about the money in their pocket. If Big Cola consumers only have Rp3,000 they can buy Big Cola but they cannot afford to buy the more expensive rival products, he says.When costs rise and spending power is squeezed, as has happened in Indonesia because of a rise in fuel prices and a weakening currency, companies serving lower-income consumers cannot risk raising their prices. Instead they shrink the unit size, as AJE did by launching a 300ml Big Cola bottle selling for Rp2,000. Coke and Pepsi have responded with advertising, discounts and smaller bottles.But Mr Soto claims that after just four years in Indonesia, AJE has sec­ured about 40 per cent of the Indonesian market for carbonated soft drinks, which reached about 1bn litres last year, and is worth about $1bn according to Euromonitor. The aim is to grow by double digits in Indonesia, faster than the market, which is predicted by Euromonitor to expand by an average 5.6 per cent annually during the next four years.As southeast Asia’s biggest economy and Big Cola’s biggest market in Asia, Indonesia must take the lead for AJE if its Asian sales are to rise from 30 per cent to its target of 50 per cent of total revenue.The company is also moving into non-carbonated drinks, a much bigger sector in Indonesia, with juices and energy drinks. Most of the products will be the same as sold in Latin America, but AJE makes some ad­­just­ments for local tastes, for example removing caffeine from Big Cola in Asia.As its international business grows, AJE recognises it must increase its investment and build a bigger corporate structure, a move previously avoided by the family.Does AJE risk losing the pioneer spirit that drove its initial growth? Mr Soto admits it is still “taking baby steps” towards becoming a leading multinational but says AJE can find the right balance.“What brought us here in the last 25 years is probably not what will take us to where we want to be,” he says.Additional reporting by Irene Astuti

Getting bigger by thinking small“Think Big” – Big Cola’s tagline – aims to stir the aspirations of first-time consumers in emerging markets who have limited disposable incomes.But AJE’s marketing and distribution strategy is more about thinking small. “We don’t create our brand by having huge shelf displays for Big Cola in supermarkets,” says Antonio Soto, head of AJE in Asia. It is more important to work with local retailers and distributors to get the product out to the mini-marts, small eateries and street stalls where lower income Indonesians spend their cash.Since the AJE and Big Cola names are little-known, the company has looked to football to raise their profile, sealing a sponsorship deal with Spain’s FC Barcelona in Latin America and with the English Football Association in Asia.“The partnership with the FA has been critical for us in Asia in having something else to offer the consumer,” Mr Soto says. AJE has run competitions offering the chance to train with England footballers or watch them in action. “There are far more fans watching the England team in Asia than there are in England.”But the low-cost approach still holds when it comes to these football branding deals, he says. “The FA England deal was good for both sides. They were looking at Asia at a great moment of its development. It’s a good match.”"
157;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Leading Russian entrepreneur criticises offshore crackdown;;"One of Russia’s most successful entrepreneurs has criticised the country’s recent crackdown on offshore corporate structures. He also revealed plans to invest more in his native Georgia.David Yakobashvili, who sold his dairy and juice company Wimm-Bill-Dann to PepsiCo in 2010, said that restrictions on offshore companies could be more damaging to the Russian economy than any western sanctions.At the same time, he said he was planning to invest more of his wealth – estimated by Forbes at $1.3bn – in Georgia, a country he left in the 1980s to seek his fortune in Russia.Many Russian businesses structure themselves under offshore holding companies in order not to fall under Russian law, but President Vladimir Putin, faced with persistent capital flight from the economy, has launched a “de-offshorizatsiya” campaign to encourage them to register in Russia.Mr Yakobashvili, one of the few Russian billionaires to have built his business from scratch rather than inheriting previously state-owned assets, said this was one of several policies that were discouraging investment in Russia.“No American or European sanctions can compare with our common sanctions, sanctions taken sometimes against business by our own Duma [the Russian parliament],” he says. “Sometimes they are implementing rules which don’t come into conjunction with any kind of sense.”Speaking over a lunch of a dozen Georgian delicacies prepared by his personal chef – “her husband is from Mingrelia [a Georgian culinary heartland]”, he says with a grin – Mr Yakobashvili instead praises the investment climate in Georgia.“Georgia was one of the most corrupt republics in the Soviet Union,” he says. Now it is “much more attractive than many post-Soviet Union countries”.The pledge for greater investment from one of Georgia’s richest sons comes at a critical moment in the country’s development.Last month, it signed an association agreement and free trade deal with the EU – a move that president Giorgi Margvelashvili said would give Georgian business “a new impetus”. At the same time, relations with Russia, which reached a nadir during the five-day war of 2008, are tentatively improving following a change of government.No American or European sanctions can compare with our common sanctions, sanctions taken sometimes against business by our own Duma [the Russian parliament]Mr Yakobashvili says he has invested “millions” in a $6bn private equity fund set up by Bidzina Ivanishvili, the country’s richest man and backer of the Georgian Dream coalition that swept to power in 2012. He adds that he has told the prime minister he is prepared to invest $200m in the country, a sum that compares with annual foreign direct investment into Georgia of about $1bn.He says there are investment opportunities in hydroelectric energy, natural resources, agriculture and tourism. “Whatever concerns food, wine, sun, and fruits, Georgia was always very well known.”At the same time, he warns the government not to back away from reforms initiated by former president Mikheil Saakashvili, whose legacy has been under scrutiny amid prosecutions of his allies for corruption and abuse of power.“With Saakashvili, yes there were some political issues, sure, but from other side they did tremendous things and novelties which will be written in the history of Georgia,” Mr Yakobashvili says. “It is important that they [the new government] continue today to be more transparent, more tolerant.”Mr Yakobashvili started out importing second-hand cars into Russia in the early 1990s before building Wimm-Bill-Dann into one of Europe’s largest food companies and then selling it to PepsiCo for $5.8bn in 2010.Since then, he has invested in Petrocas, an oil trader and fuel retailer with operations across the Caucasus and Central Asia. In Russia, he has investments in real estate and agriculture, as well as a small shareholding in Sistema, a group with investments in telecoms, oil and property.He adds there are still opportunities in Russia, but says protection for local investors were not sufficient. “People are taking money out and then bringing it back because of the insufficiency of our legal system.”● The headline and first paragraph of this article have been amended as the original versions might have been understood to mean that Mr Yakobashvili directly criticised Mr Putin and the Kremlin; he did not do so.——————————————-This article is subject to a clarification and has been amended."
158;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-07-03T07:59:52Z;Big US dividend payers prosper as equities soar;;“Show me the money.” That is the cry from equity investors – and US companies have heeded it this year.The number of US dividend rises has hit its highest since 1979, helping to sustain a record-breaking run for the S&P 500. General Motors, Apple, ExxonMobil and PepsiCo are among the big blue-chip groups to have raised their dividends by more than $500m.Investors’ marked preference for dividends shows just how many are engaged in a long-running hunt for yield against a backdrop of meagre bond returns. And with good reason. Sticking with stable companies that keep increasing their payouts has been a solid strategy given a still lacklustre US recovery.“‘Shareholder return’ continues to be the battle cry from boardrooms (and those knocking at the boardroom door),” says Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.He expects strong dividend growth to continue in 2014, albeit possibly at a slower pace, with cash payments for 2014 recording a double-digit increase in percentage terms over a record 2013.But how long will this preference for payouts – over “growth” or “momentum” stocks – last?Low bond yields and soaring equity prices speak to sharply diverging views of where the US economy is heading and the performance of high dividend shares will hinge on which of the equity or bond bull camps prevails.Within the S&P 500, dividend-paying stocks have outperformed the non-payers by a percentage point so far this year, posting a return of 9.77 per cent versus 8.76 per cent for the latter.But that situation could reverse in favour of non-dividend payers should the economy pick up speed in the months ahead.George Pearkes, analyst at Bespoke Investment Group, says: “So long as companies can keep growing their dividends, it remains a pretty attractive trade. Lots of people living on a fixed income are big fans of dividend-paying stocks.”Mr Pearkes says the desire for dividend payers was stronger earlier in the year when momentum stocks experienced a pronounced dip.Now though, with social media names and biotechs climbing again, he says more attention is being paid to growth or momentum shares.Indeed, in recent weeks, smaller companies have notably outperformed larger names that tend to pay higher dividends, suggesting that the market is looking for an acceleration of economic growth in the next few months.The Russell 2000 index of small companies has risen 10 per cent since mid-May, nearly double the S&P 500’s gain of 6 per cent over the same period.You are getting a smaller piece of the pie – companies are making more, but paying out less. They are not sure where they are going and not sure where sales are going“As the market goes up, in general the non-payers do better because they are more oriented as a group toward growth,” Mr Silverblatt says.As long as the bond market continues to keep long-term yields anchored near recent lows, the dividend trade remains a good strategy. But, should the economy pick up and push bond yields higher – particularly when the US Federal Reserve ends its emergency bond-buying programme in the autumn – it will look less attractive.Diane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager for TCW, expects higher bond yields and says the price of high-dividend paying stocks will be short-term pain.For all that though, the dividend trade could well remain in vogue as the capacity for companies boosting their payouts is significant.The current payout ratio for S&P 500 companies is around 36 per cent, lagging behind the long term rate of 52 per cent.“Companies can increase their dividends and that will be very important, as I do think there is a market for high absolute dividends for people who, say, want a 4 per cent yield and don’t care how the underlying stock price performs,” says Ms Jaffee.Payouts are still relatively low for the same reason that companies are not aggressively investing in the expansion of their businesses.They prefer to try to boost share prices through a combination of dividends and share buybacks, which together rose to a record level in the first quarter.Even though the global financial crisis and recession are receding, companies remain nervous, especially with sales growth still less than robust.Heading into second-quarter earnings season, Wall Street analysts have been lowering growth estimates for S&P 500 companies, according to FactSet.“You are getting a smaller piece of the pie – companies are making more, but paying out less. They are not sure where they are going and not sure where sales are going,” Mr Silverblatt says.
159;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Activist Peltz turns attention to BNY Mellon;;The activist investor Nelson Peltz has revealed a $1bn stake in Bank of New York Mellon, firing the opening shot in a campaign for the custody bank to improve shareholder returns.Mr Peltz’s hedge fund Trian said it would like to meet the bank’s management and board, to discuss “ideas and initiatives to drive long-term growth and enhance shareholder value”. The bank said it looked forward to engaging with them.The polite opening salvos belie Mr Peltz’s history of aggressively pressing his case for change at companies, most famously in the food and drink sector, where he agitated for the sale of Cadbury to Kraft Foods and is at present trying to persuade Pepsi to split off its snacks business.He has also targeted financial companies, including asset manager Legg Mason and, in 2011, BNY Mellon’s rival custody bank, State Street. Trian argued that State Street should cut costs, return cash to shareholders and consider separating its asset management division from the custody operations.The hedge fund refused on Monday to elaborate on its ideas for BNY Mellon, but people close to the situation said it had been tempted into the stock by investor discontent over the company’s recent operating performance.“Trian had success at State Street and steered them to think more of shareholder returns, so BNY Mellon has a good partner,” said Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “It still has a way to go before operating margins and returns get to the levels of the guys doing a better job.”Years of low interest rates have eaten into the profits BNY Mellon can make from the business of safeguarding trillions of dollars’ worth of customers’ assets, forcing it to look to new sources of revenue and reduce expenses.It announced this year that it would take a $80m-$100m charge in the second quarter as it trims jobs and invests in new technology to automate services. It forecast that these cost-cutting efforts would save it about $100m a year.Two top-30 shareholders in the bank told the Financial Times in April that they were disillusioned by a failure to keep expenses under control and meet targets on profitability since the company was formed in 2007 from the merger of Bank of New York – the oldest bank in the US, created by one of America’s founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton – and Mellon Financial, an asset management company.Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA, has suggested the bank could be split up, but Gerald Hassell, chief executive, made a public defence of keeping the asset management division– which manages $1.6tn in assets – at the company’s annual meeting in April.“This segment provides very consistent earnings that enhances our performance under stressed scenarios and it also requires very minimal use of our balance sheet,” he said.
160;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-06-24T15:33:55Z;Tate & Lyle finance director leaves;;Tate & Lyle’s finance director is quitting the sweeteners group after a turbulent year for the British company, during which its share price fell 15 per cent.The decision by Tim Lodge to depart was a surprise for investors, but the announcement that he was to be replaced by a PepsiCo veteran showed the company had been planning for it.Javed Ahmed, chief executive, said that after six years in the job and a 25-year career at the group, Mr Lodge “indicated to the board that he was ready for a new challenge. I am sorry to see him go”.Mr Lodge will step down at the end of August when he will be replaced by Nick Hampton, who has worked 20 years at PepsiCo, the snacks and carbonated drinks group that is one of Tate & Lyle’s biggest customers for its sweeteners products.Mr Hampton will quit his job as president for West Europe, a division which is twice as big in terms of sales as Tate & Lyle.The British group said that it would make Mr Hampton a one-off award of £1.2m worth of Tate & Lyle shares “to compensate Nick for incentive awards that he will forfeit at PepsiCo Europe”.He will also receive a performance share plan award this year of £1.44m worth of Tate & Lyle shares, in addition to an annual salary of £480,000 and performance-related bonuses. The share awards will not be made if he leaves within three years.He will join Tate & Lyle at a delicate time as the company strives to recover from February’s profits warning that Chinese competition had hit its sucrolose pricing. The warning wiped 16 per cent off the shares overnight, though they have since recovered by 4 per cent.The warning shook investor confidence in the group, which enjoyed a re-rating in 2011-12 on the basis that it was shifting its business from volatile bulk commodities, such as sugar, into the more profitable speciality ingredients business, such as sweeteners and starches.Martin Deboo, analyst at Jefferies, said in a note: “We think Lodge will be missed, but also expect Hampton to bring fresh energy and perspective to bear on the next phase of Tate’s development. To this, he brings the benefits of commercial and financial experience honed at a major multinational and major customer of the firm.”Mr Lodge was already finance director when Mr Ahmed joined Tate & Lyle in 2009. The chief executive said that Mr Lodge had been “a great support to the board and to me personally . . . and has led key aspects of the transformation of Tate & Lyle with distinction.”

He acted as interim chief executive in the first half of 2012.After working at Scholl Consumer Products and Pepsi Cola, Mr Walsh joined entertainment retailer HMV in 1994. By the time he left, he was managing director for HMV Germany. He went on to spend eight years as managing director of Coral.During his time as managing director of Coral, he steered the company through two private equity transactions.“Carpetright is a great brand and I am looking forward to working with the team to drive profitability and share going forward,” Mr Walsh said of his appointment. “Lord Harris has 56 years in the carpet business and will be a hard act to follow, but the market-leading position he has built for the business is an excellent place from which to start.”Mr Walsh will retire from his post at Fortuna at the annual general meeting in June.
162;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-05-16T16:41:11Z;Coffee capsules revive the market;;Hermetically sealed capsules have opened up a huge range of possibilities in the food industry.They have “rejuvenated” the coffee market, according to Richard Rawlinson, partner at Strategy&, the consultancy firm formerly known as Booz and Company.Sales of coffee in capsule form have trebled over the past five years to $10.8bn, according to Euromonitor, against a rise of 35 per cent for the total coffee market.That success has spurred interest in other drinks, as well as food, that can be prepared from a pod with the push of a button.Keurig, which Euromonitor estimates has 85 per cent of the $2.7bn US coffee pod market, is teaming up with Campbell’s to sell soup capsules that fit its hot drinks machine.Nestlé, which dominates the coffee capsule market in Europe with Nespresso, has also used the technology for tea. It rolled out its Special T capsules to Japan in 2013, a year after its Europe launch.Soft drinks are another fast-growing market as the world’s biggest beverage companies seek to diversify in the face of declining fizzy drinks sales, according to Ali Dibadj, analyst at Bernstein.Coca-Cola announced this week it would increase its stake in Keurig to 16 per cent from 10 per cent. Coke invested $1.25bn in February and signed a 10-year deal to put its brands in Keurig’s forthcoming cold drinks maker, which is expected to launch later this year.Rival PepsiCo has a 7 per cent stake in Bevyz Global, a European maker of at-home drinks machines that is also set to launch in the US this year, although it is not clear if Pepsi’s brands will be available on the appliance. Keurig also holds a minority stake in Bevyz.The deal with Coke is in line with Keurig’s strategy of offering a vast range of drinks. It has built a dominant position among at-home brewers by offering brands from Starbucks and Folgers coffee to Snapple iced teas and Ghirardelli cocoa.The next market for capsules is likely to be baby formula, says Lawrence Hutter, head of European corporate solutions at Alvarez & Marsal, the professional services firm.Nestlé launched its BabyNes system in 2011 using capsules to make bottles of baby milk, but has so far not expanded it beyond Switzerland and France.

Citigroup said last week that Mike Corbat, its chief executive, would not be going, and people familiar with the matter said that Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was likely to delegate to more junior colleagues.PepsiCo said on Thursday that chief executive Indra Nooyi, who had been due to go to the meeting for the first time, would not attend.“Indra Nooyi’s schedule changed and she will not be travelling to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum this year,” a spokesman said. The drinks and snacks company’s Russia business accounts for about 7 per cent of total revenue.Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive of Alcoa, also pulled out of the forum on Thursday afternoon. The company said he had withdrawn “in light of the US government’s requirements,” but that it would participate via senior Russian executives.The White House is keen to prevent Mr Putin from having the kind of propaganda victories he enjoyed with the recent visits of the Siemens and Royal Dutch Shell chief executives to Russia after its takeover of Crimea.However, there are several heads of US businesses still listed on the conference programme, including John Faraci, chief executive of International Paper; Dennis Muilenburg, chief operating officer of Boeing; Hans-Paul Bürkner, chairman of the Boston Consulting Group, and Donald Umpleby, group president of Caterpillar.Russia’s President Vladimir Putin moved swiftly to annex Crimea, in the first land grab in Europe since the second world war, and the EU and US are worried over Moscow’s intentions elsewhere in UkraineLast week, Boeing and BCG said their executives would attend the forum, while Caterpillar said Mr Umpleby still planned to attend, but it was monitoring the situation.Jan Dirk Waiboer, a Moscow-based senior partner of BCG, said: “In the current volatile environment, it is especially important to keep the dialogue going on key economic and business topics.”There are also several European companies attending that have large US operations, including Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Statoil, the oil groups, and Schlumberger, the oil services company. They also have significant operations in Russia, which is one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers. BP last year took a 19.75 per cent stake in Rosneft, the state-controlled Russian oil company.Both Shell and BP have previously said their chief executives would attend the forum. Other European business leaders, including the chief executives of Telenor, the telecoms group, Metro, the retailer and Schneider Electric, the engineering company, said last week that they planned to attend.It is not clear if any other government has asked its business leaders to avoid the event in St Petersburg.Additional reporting by Shannon Bond and Tom Braithwaite"
164;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-04-30T13:09:55Z;India elections: Modi miscues over hero’s name;;Narendra Modi, the BJP’s prime ministerial hopeful, has hardly put a foot wrong in the current Parliamentary election campaign – at least tactically. This week, however, has seen Mr Modi make a rare, embarrassing mis-step as he invoked the name of a famous Indian war hero while trying to rally voters against the soldier’s mother.The blunder came while Modi was in Palampur, in the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh, where the local BJP Parliament member, Anurag Thakur, faces a challenge from the upstart Aam Aadmi Party whose candidate is Kamal Kant Batra, the 69-year-old mother of Captain Vikram Batra, a martyred soldier from the district.Captain Batra died in July 1999 in the high-altitude Kargil conflict, when Pakistani soldiers infiltrated the line of control in Kashmir to seize strategic peaks in Indian held territory. Indian soldiers battled for months to dislodge the invaders in what was essentially the country’s first televised war.Batra, just 24, nicknamed “Sher Shah”, or “Lion King,” led a successful offensive to recapture strategic peaks. He won Indian hearts, when he used a then popular Pepsi advertising slogan, “ye dil maange more” – or “this heart wants more” – to tell a reporter from an Indian television news channel about how he motivated his men in the dangerous battle.Within days he was dead, killed while trying to rescue a wounded colleague, as Pakistani soldiers counterattacked, following the recapture of another peak.Batra was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India’s highest military honour, a month after his death, and was played by Bollywood heart-throb Abhishek Bachchan in a 2003 Bollywood film, LOC Kargil, based on the conflict.Campaigning for Thakur at several rallies in Captain Batra’s home district, Modi invoked the name of the slain soldier – and his famous tag-line. “Vikram Batra died for the country – he had said – yeh dil maange more,” the BJP prime ministerial hopeful roared. “I say it too. I want all four seats in Himachal. I want 300 lotuses across India.”Capt. Batra’s family was not amused. In an open letter, Mrs Batra, who has condemned Modi as a “pseudo-secularist” and challenged him to a debate on conditions of soldiers, slammed him for appropriating the name of her son – and the slogan he adopted – to trawl for votes for the BJP.“Now you are using Vikram’s name and slogan,” she wrote in an open letter. “I ask you – in 15 years, how come neither you nor the BJP used either? Just for the elections, you have suddenly remembered it and are using the sacrifice of a brave soldier. This is corrupt politics.”But the damage was compounded when Meenaskhi Lekhi, a BJP spokesman, scoffed at the family’s criticism “It was a company’s slogan..it’s not their slogan…and isn’t she asking for votes as Vikram Batra’s mother?”Yet sensitivities must have finally kicked in. Late in the day, Modi tweeted that he was “deeply pained” how “petty politics” had taken over his tribute to Capt. Batra.He tweeted: There is no question of insulting our martyrs who give everything to the nation. I would rather quit politics than insult our martyrs. Modi, at least, is unlikely to invoke Capt. Batra’s name again.Back to beyondbrics
165;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-04-23T08:47:18Z;Post-Easter bond market sales heat up;;"Bankers are gearing up for a busy post-Easter bond issuance splurge from companies eager to lock in cheap, longer-term financing while rates remain low.Big deals are expected from groups including Numericable in France, China’s Cnooc and Pepsi.Cnooc is likely to be the biggest, with the Chinese national oil company announcing on Wednesday a three-part dollar bond sale with tenors at five, 10 and 30 years. It comes hot on the heels of Tencent, which issued a $2.5bn bond late on Tuesday.Pepsi expects to raise €1bn through the sale of two bond tranches maturing in 2021 and 2026, with bankers whispering of a slender price of just 60 to 65 basis points above midswaps, the European pricing benchmark.One of the most notable will be Numericable, which is expected to finalise an upsized €8.5bn junk bond sale to finance the acquisition of SFR, France’s second-biggest telecoms group. That is the biggest euro-denominated junk bond sale on record, underlining the voracious demand for European corporate bonds.Combined with a dollar tranche, loans and a separate bond sale by parent Altice, the financing package will come to €16.5bn.Other deals expected to be announced on Wednesday are Woori Bank, a South Korean lender; Philippines developer Vista Land & Landscapes; and Netherlands-based aluminium producer Constellium, which is marketing a two-tranche deal in dollars and euros for a total of €590m.This week bankers are expecting bond sales from Credit Immobilier de France (which will be government guaranteed) and National Bank of Greece, which is making a long-awaited return to the bond market after the Greek debt crisis.A senior syndicate banker said that treasurers and fund managers were now back from their Easter holidays and forecasted a busy period ahead: “The markets are open, conditions are good, so why wait?”Indeed, corporate borrowing costs remain near rock-bottom lows, with the average yields of Bloomberg’s global investment grade and high-yield bond indices at 2.48 per cent and 5.14 per cent respectively."

Stripping out restructuring charges and commodity hedges, earnings lifted nearly 8 per cent to 83 cents a share, beating analysts’ forecasts of 75 cents.Revenue of $12.62bn was 0.3 per cent higher than $12.58bn in the first quarter of 2013 and exceeded Wall Street’s estimate of $12.4bn. Excluding restructuring changes and currency effects, organic revenue was up 4 per cent.Global sales of food, including Lay’s crisps, Quaker oatmeal and Sabra hummus, rose 2 per cent, while sales of drinks such as Pepsi-Cola, Gatorade and Tropicana juice were flat around the world. Organic revenue rose 5 per cent for global snacks and 3 per cent for beverages.“This was a solid global performance for PepsiCo,” said Nik Modi, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, noting that the company beat estimates for volume growth in most regions.Pepsi and its rivals Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple have been grappling with a long-term decline in fizzy drinks consumption in developed markets like the US, where consumers are cutting back on sugar. More recently, the companies have also seen diet soda sales shrink, which executives and industry watchers attribute to concerns over artificial sweeteners.In North America, Pepsi’s biggest market, beverage volumes were flat, with a 1 per cent drop in fizzy drinks offsetting a 2 per cent increase in non-carbonated drinks like water, tea and juice. Still, the results were better than the 2.7 per cent drop in drink volumes analysts had expected.On Tuesday, Coke reported its first fall in global sparkling beverages in nearly 15 years and said first-quarter profit was down 7.5 per cent from a year ago.Pepsi’s Frito-Lay North America snack businesses posted 3 per cent volume growth, beating estimates of 1.7 per cent.In Latin America, beverage sales fell 1 per cent and snack sales were down 3 per cent as Mexico’s tax on sugary drinks and junk food went into effect.Overall emerging market organic revenue increased 9 per cent in the quarter, led by growth in Russia, Brazil and India, but net revenue was down 2 per cent due to restructuring and unfavourable foreign exchange rates.Pepsi has come under additional pressure from Nelson Peltz, the activist investor whose Trian Partners owns a 0.8 per cent stake in the company, to split its fast-growing food business from the slower beverage unit.Indra Nooyi, Pepsi chief executive, has pushed back against Mr Peltz, saying the businesses can grow better together. On Thursday she said: “Our results reflect the power of our portfolio of products and brands and our geographic footprint.”Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, pointed to the company’s 9 per cent net profit growth in 2013, saying, “it’s not clear that anyone would want to disrupt that kind of performance with large-scale M&A transactions.”Ms Nooyi has said Pepsi expects about two-thirds of future revenue growth to come from snack sales, and two-thirds to be driven by emerging markets.She said the company was on track with its plan to cut $1bn in costs this year, part of an existing three-year plan. Pepsi said in February it would cut another $5bn over five years starting in 2015.Mark Swartzberg of Stifel said the better than expected sales in the Frito-Lay North American and Americas drinks units “aids management’s defence of its one-company decision but [we] also think management remains in an active conflict with shareholders”.Pepsi shares rose 0.8 per cent to $85.55 on Thursday in New York.
167;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-04-15T17:15:07Z;Indian Premier League overcomes sticky wicket to start new season;;The Indian Premier League starts bowling in unfamiliar surroundings on Wednesday, as the world’s most lucrative cricket tournament begins an enforced vacation in Abu Dhabi, pending the conclusion of India’s continuing national elections.The inconvenience of moving eight teams and dozens of star cricketers aside, the event’s organisers are likely to feel a sense of relief when the first ball is bowled – given that a few weeks ago the annual extravaganza seemed unlikely to go ahead at all.India’s supreme court demanded in late March that two prominent teams be banned, having been caught up in a turbulent match-fixing scandal that dominated last season’s event, threatening the IPL’s season.The court relented a few days later, but not before forcing the temporary resignation of N Srinivasan, the powerful president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which owns the league, to be replaced by Sunil Gavaskar, a former cricketer.In turn, Mr Gavaskar last week hired Deepak Parekh, a respected banker, to help him avoid a repeat of last season’s debacle. “This is the biggest show in India,” Mr Parekh says. “And this year everything needs to go right, from logistics to governance and reputation.”All this turmoil has not put off the IPL’s many corporate backers. Beverage group Pepsi spent $72m to be its main sponsor two years ago, and stuck it out through last year’s shenanigans, as did UK-based mobile group Vodafone.Other global brands have been busily buying up advertising around the 2014 contest too, including retailer Amazon, which launched in India last year.Some sponsors have pulled out, however, including electronic group Samsung. Television advertising sales are down too, according to CVL Srinivas, chief executive of GroupM, a media buying agency. “This year has been slower,” he says, citing both India’s weak economic climate and confusion over the event’s location.Indian cricket fans may not be much inconvenienced by the move abroad: matches in the United Arab Emirates will be played at times suitable for domestic television viewers, while the tournament returns home for its final stages during May.The IPL is entering a phase of catastrophic risk to its reputation, it cannot withstand another year like last yearThe same cannot be said for franchise owners, which include billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani and Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan. Moving abroad will stretch team finances, and while Indian cricket authorities have promised compensation, they have given few details on how much.“It is going to be a challenging year,” says Venky Mysore, chief executive of the Kolkata Knight Riders, one of the league’s most financially successful teams. “My guess is none of us are going to make money this time.”The aftershocks of 2013’s scandal are another worry – a further hearing in the supreme court’s investigation is also due on Wednesday – but it is the risk of a further match-fixing scandal that most threatens the IPL’s financial future.Last June, the BCCI launched “operation clean-up”, a 12-point programme to combat illegal betting and tame the IPL’s raucous image, which the body hopes will deliver results this season.At least one such measure seems quickly to have been forgotten, however – a promised ban on the tournament’s glamorous cheerleaders, who organisers confirm will be strutting along the pitch side during Wednesday’s opening match.But any failure to crack down on corruption more generally could have grave financial consequences, warns Unni Krishnan, managing director at Brand Finance, a consultancy that studies the economic value of the IPL.This dropped from more than $4bn in 2010 to just $3bn last year, a figure Mr Krishnan hints is set to fall further when his latest study comes out next month, following the recent spate of scandals.“The IPL is entering a phase of catastrophic risk to its reputation, it cannot withstand another year like last year,” he says.“Unless there are deep institutional changes they risk losing this property in its entirety …There needs to be a purge, to flush out the poison, but no one is sure whether that is happening or not.”
168;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Dr Pepper slips on drinks sector fears;;Dr Pepper Snapple Group fell by the greatest rate in more than a year after a broker downgraded the beverage group to “underweight” as concerns mount over the resilience of the US drinks market.Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog lowered her view on the company as the industry continues to contract, which has also put pressure on rivals PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.“We have become increasingly concerned about Dr Pepper Snapple Group’s current positioning and outlook, especially given the challenged operating environment of the US carbonated soft drink market,” Ms Herzog said.The bank noted margins were likely to decline over the coming year and Dr Pepper was particularly exposed to weak soda sales as consumers turn to healthier options.The company’s Sunkist, A & W and RC Cola sodas are also at risk of losing shelf space in supermarkets and drugstores as retailers refresh options.“Coca-Cola, and Pepsi to a lesser extent, are well-positioned to maintain shelf space while Dr Pepper Snapple has the most risk of losing shelf space given its overexposure to second-tier brands,” she added.The shift at Wells Fargo follows a report last week from Beverage Digest, the influential industry publication, that showed sales volume of carbonated soft drinks down 3 per cent in 2013.Dr Pepper Snapple shares closed down 3.8 per cent to $51.62. Coca-Cola shares rose 0.7 per cent to $38.90 while PepsiCo fell 0.5 per cent to $83.47.Nike climbed as analysts at Stifel Nicolaus lifted their rating to “buy” from “hold” following the company’s 10 per cent retreat on Monday.Analyst Jim Duffy said the recent declines as well as lower earnings estimates had made investing in Nike shares more attractive.“Stand-out fundamentals in combination with correction in both the consensus numbers and relative multiple leave us more constructive on the risk-reward for Nike shares,” Mr Duffy said.Across Wall Street, analysts have trimmed their 2015 earnings expectations by a dime over the past four weeks to $3.36 per share, which takes forecasts closer to Nike’s guidance. The shares advanced 2.9 per cent to $72.92.Tesla shrugged off recent weakness, rising 3.8 per cent to $215.46, after announcing it would begin leasing its Model S to businesses.The programme, which will be run through a finance subsidiary, will allow small and medium-sized businesses to purchase the car with the right to return it for resale after three years.Gigamon, the manufacturer of network traffic management software, fell by a third after the company said it would miss its first-quarter sales guidance.The company blamed a transaction with a customer that did not materialise, crimping its results.Sales for the three months to March 29 are expected to be in a range of $31m to $31.5m, as much as 11 per cent below its forecasts.“While we are disappointed in these preliminary results, we remain confident in our business strategy and the market opportunity,” said chief executive Paul Hooper.Shares in Gigamon fell 33.9 per cent to $17.31.BlackBerry advanced after a Florida jury ruled in its favour in a lawsuit accusing it of infringing on patents.The lawsuit, brought by Dutch semiconductor company NXP in 2012, alleged BlackBerry phones and the company’s PlayBook tablet infringed three patents related to design and data transmission.NXP said it would explore its options for appeal. BlackBerry shares climbed 1.3 per cent to $7.96.Overall, US equities struggled for direction for much of the day despite a rise in job openings and improving small business optimism.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 1,851.96 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged up to 16,256.14. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 per cent to 4,112.99.
169;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;US fizzy drinks lose pop on health fears;;Americans drank fewer fizzy drinks last year, accelerating a sales decline dogging Coca-Cola and PepsiCo as they face mounting health concerns over sugar and artificial sweeteners.Even as the beverage giants boosted their marketing spending, sales of carbonated soft drinks fell 3 per cent in 2013 to 8.9bn cases, the lowest level since 1995, according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication. It was the ninth straight year of decline and much sharper than falls of 1.2 per cent in 2012 and 1 per cent in 2011.The decline was moderated by the continued popularity of energy drinks such as Monster and Red Bull, which increased sales by 5 per cent. Stripping those out, carbonated sales fell 3.3 per cent, compared with 1.7 per cent last year.The worsening performance of fizzy drinks dragged down the overall bottled beverage category, which includes water, teas, juices and sports drinks such as Gatorade. Total sales volume fell for the first time since 2009, down 1.6 per cent, after growing 1 per cent in 2012 and 0.8 per cent in 2011.Consumers have been turning away from sugary colas for nearly a decade, choosing instead to sip flavoured water, tea and juice drinks. Public health advocates have drawn links between added sugar and health problems – including obesity, diabetes and cancer – and backed ad campaigns warning about fizzy drinks.Coca-Cola, which holds 42.4 per cent of the US fizzy drinks market, fared slightly better than second-place PepsiCo. Coke’s sales slipped 2.2 per cent last year, half the rate of Pepsi’s 4.4 per cent decline. Sales of number-three drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple fell 2.4 per cent.Overall, Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple gained market share, while PepsiCo lost ground.Monday’s figures also confirmed reports that sales of diet drinks are falling faster than regular sodas, which executives have blamed on worries over the health effects of artificial sweeteners like aspartame.Diet carbonated soft drinks are now struggling. At least some consumers seem to be shying away from the legacy diet sweeteners, according to sourcesDiet Coke and Diet Pepsi sales volumes were each down nearly 7 per cent and both brands lost market share. Sales of PepsiCo’s Diet Mountain Dew brand fell 3.1 per cent.“Diet carbonated soft drinks are now struggling. At least some consumers seem to be shying away from the legacy diet sweeteners, according to sources,” Beverage Digest said.In recent years, drinks makers have maintained revenue growth amid slowing fizzy drink sales by lifting prices, but were unable to do so last year. When Coca-Cola reported its latest earnings in February, it said North American revenue was flat in 2013. Pepsi’s Americas beverages division reported a 2 per cent revenue loss.Beverage Digest’s figures bore out that trend: even with a 2 per cent increase in pricing last year, the value of the fizzy drink market fell 1 per cent to $76.2bn. John Sicher, editor, said that marked the first year the overall retail value had declined since the publication began tracking the figure in 1998.Coca-Cola shares closed down 0.7 per cent at $38.66 in New York. PepsiCo was up 0.7 per cent at $83.50.
170;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:44+0000;Water shortages pose growing risk for American companies;;Some of the best known companies in the US are taking water supplies into account when deciding where to locate their facilities amid growing concern about a resource long taken for granted.AT&T, the telecommunications giant, and Hershey, one of the world’s largest confectionery makers, are among those taking such steps as California confronts a prolonged drought and other markets confront stressed water supplies.“I think water is becoming the next big issue,” said John Schulz, assistant vice-president of sustainability operations at AT&T. “There is a rising awareness from a business risk perspective that if we don’t start getting control of this, it could become a real business-impacting issue.”Water availability has not yet stopped the company building anywhere, Mr Schulz said, but it is a criterion used when deciding where to locate its facilities.Hershey uses the same criterion, but mostly when looking at facilities abroad, said Todd H. Camp, the company’s senior director for corporate social responsibility.“One of our key goals is to grow globally and while our plants in the US may not really face water scarcity or water stress situations, there are certainly facilities outside the US that either are on the brink of facing those, such as in Mexico and India, or based on the most credible projections we follow, will in future,” he said.The two companies have been identified in research that shows some US businesses believe water risks are likely to affect profits and growth in the next five years.The report was done by California’s Pacific Institute, an environmental research group, and Vox Global, a public affairs firm.Its authors do not claim their findings reflect a national average as they are only based on 51 companies. However, they point to a growing corporate awareness of water scarcity.This has grown since Coca-Cola was forced to close a bottling plant nearly a decade ago in the southern Indian state of Kerala, after activists accused it of depleting the local water table.Since then, both Coca-Cola and its rival, Pepsi, have vowed to do more to conserve the billions of gallons of water critical to their products.More recently, water shortages have put pressure on the US oil and gas industry, which often operates in dry states and uses large volumes of water for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.The Pacific Institute/Vox report found that a majority of companies surveyed said water was already affecting their decisions on where to locate facilities. Nearly 60 per cent said water issues would affect both business growth and profitability in the next five years.Many have started monitoring and trying to cut their water use recently.Hershey has sharply reduced its water consumption from more than 4bn gallons a year in 2009 to 1.2bn gallons last year, largely by investing in conservation technology at its flagship plant in Hershey, Pennsylvania and across its manufacturing network, and by making workers more aware of water use.AT&T found it was using 3.3bn gallons a year of water in 2012, nearly a third of which was used in cooling towers, and has discovered the cost of conserving water can be offset by significant savings.It says it spent $4,000 upgrading one site’s cooling system that returned savings of nearly $40,000 a year.Such measures represent a big shift compared with the way companies thought about water a decade ago, said study co-author, Jason Morrison of the Pacific Institute.“Historically many companies have thought of it as a low-cost input and looked at it mostly within the context of their direct operations,” he said. “Now companies are increasingly thinking about water more broadly.”Companies also realise poor water use can affect their brand, Mr Morrison said. “Again, a decade ago, companies may not have thought about water and reputational risk in the way they do today,” he said.
171;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-03-11T17:46:58Z;Disney nears $500m deal to buy Maker Studios;Agreement would provide foothold in online video market;Walt Disney is nearing a deal to acquire Maker Studios in a deal worth $500m which could rise to as much as $900m if certain financial conditions are met, according to people familiar with the situation.The move will give Disney a hefty presence in the rapidly expanding online video market. Maker promotes, produces and distributes video aimed at “millennials” – the generation of young people born between 1982 and 2002 – attracting 5.5bn video views a month.Disney’s talks with Maker come at a time of upheaval in the company’s television division.Anne Sweeney, co-chairman of Disney Media Networks – which includes the ABC network and ESPN sports network – is stepping down, after 18 years with the company.Ms Sweeney, one of the most powerful women in Hollywood, is leaving to pursue a career as a television director. She said in a statement that the switch was “a long realised dream”.Maker, which operates a network of 60,000 online “channels”, has already attracted outside investors, including Time Warner, Elisabeth Murdoch and Canal Plus. Its most recent funding round last summer valued the company at about $300m.Disney and Maker declined to comment. News of the talks was first reported on the Re/code website.The deal could be announced in the next two weeks, according to people familiar with the situation, and comes as other big media companies have stepped up their efforts in online video.Rupert Murdoch’s 21st century Fox invested $70m in Vice Media last year, valuing the anarchic publishing and online video group at $1.4bn, while Awesomeness TV, a YouTube network aimed at younger audiences, was sold to DreamWorks Animation for about $100m.Maker attracts more video views than both and would give Disney access to younger consumers who have drifted away from traditional television. Maker does not disclose financial performance, but the group has scored with advertisers and this week announced a “branded entertainment” deal with Pepsi.Pepsi wanted to “connect with our consumers in the place where they are spending time”, said Ken Strnad, senior director of brands, content and entertainment for PepsiCo.Disney has taken a lead in online video among its Hollywood peers. The company was the first studio to make its television programming available for sale on the iTunes store and also the first to stream its shows after broadcast on its ABC network.It was also an early investor in Hulu, the online video site, alongside Comcast and 21st century Fox.Maker would not be Disney’s first online acquisition, but would be its biggest to date. The company initially agreed to pay $700m for Club Penguin six years ago, but Club Penguin eventually cost Disney only about half of that figure when the site was unable to meet targets associated with the transaction.Maker would join a portfolio of Disney brands that includes Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm, Pixar and ESPN.
172;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-03-10T12:12:14Z;Maker Studios stakes its claim on new frontier of Hollywood;;"History is repeating itself in Hollywood. A century after hardy entrepreneurs from the east coast moved to southern California to build the first movie studios, a new generation of digital companies has sprung up, building sound stages and producing content at a rapid pace.Maker Studios, which promotes, distributes and produces programming for some of the biggest stars on YouTube, is the most widely viewed of these companies, generating 5.5bn video views a month for a portfolio of stars that includes PewDiePie, Epic Rap Battles of History and Bad Lip Reading. “Millennials” – those born between the early 1980s and early 2000s – are the company’s target market, rather than cinema or television audiences.Millennials have proved elusive for advertisers, which are increasingly turning to digital video to find them. Maker will this week unveil a “branded entertainment” deal with PepsiCo as the soft-drinks maker tries to reach younger people who have drifted away from TV.“This is a new medium,” says Ynon Kreiz, Maker’s chief executive. “People tend to compare it to other things but it’s a new industry . . . it’s growing faster than any other segment in entertainment.”Maker’s valuation has risen as online audiences have increased. The company, which does not disclose its financial performance, has completed three funding rounds: the first, in 2010, valued the company at $7.5m; the second, a year later, valued Maker at $22m but its latest round, which was completed last summer, valued it at approximately $300m.In the most recent round, heavyweights from the media sector bought into the company, including Time Warner, Canal Plus, Elisabeth Murdoch and the film star Robert Downey Jr.Their investments came as other digital video groups have also attracted outside capital and interest from older, more established media groups. Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox invested $70m in Vice Media last year, valuing the anarchic publishing and online video group at $1.4bn, while Awesomeness TV, a YouTube network aimed at younger audiences, was sold to DreamWorks Animation for about $100m.Maker produces and licenses content from others much like a typical Hollywood studio would with television programming. Mr Kreiz, an Israeli who is the former chief executive of Endemol, the independent TV production company that produced Big Brother, says the digital video sector is following a similar trajectory to the television industry.“Our thesis is: there used to be three, four, five broadcast networks [in the US]. Then cable TV comes along and you have 30, 40, 50 channels. Then digital satellite comes along and you have 300 or 400 channels.” Online video is following the TV model of “verticals”, he adds, with programming arranged around channels and networks.“In the early days of cable TV, new brands were created around vertical domains and targeted around niche audiences,” Mr Kreiz says, rolling off a list of cable networks, such as CNN in news and ESPN in sport. The web, he says, will be no different.Maker has a network of about 60,000 “content creators” ranging from hobbyists to web superstars such as PewDiePie, a Swedish video game commentator who has racked up hundreds of millions of views and a YouTube channel that has close to 25m subscribers.Maker organises its content around four “verticals” – men, women, family and entertainment – with 23 themed channels grouped around topics such as comedy, video games, fashion and cartoons. It works with established stars, such as Ben Stiller’s Red Hour Productions and the hip hop artist Snoop Dogg, as well as up and coming video makers, says Courtney Holt, the former president of MySpace Music who is Maker’s chief operating officer. “We know how to package [content], we know how to promote it and we know how to increase audiences.”[It is] clear that the landscape is changingAudiences are increasing but digital video advertising revenues still lag behind broadcast advertising. Total digital video advertising revenues in the US were estimated at about $4.12bn in 2013 – an increase of 42 per cent on 2012, according to eMarketer, a research firm. US television advertising, by contrast, was worth about $66bn in the same period.Mr Kreiz and Mr Holt say digital video’s share will increase. “We’re getting feedback from media buyers that this is the first year they will move money from broadcast to online,” says Mr Holt.Broadcast advertising will continue to grow, according to eMarketer – but not as quickly as digital, which is expected to more than double to $9.2bn by 2017.Online video is a better deal for advertisers, says Mr Kreiz. “Advertisers look for targeted reach, engagement [with viewers] and accurate measurement. Television can deliver large audiences but engagement with viewers is passive and measurement is inaccurate.” Online video “has better measurement and better audience engagement”, he says.“We don’t say that TV will disappear,” says Mr Kreiz. “But it’s also clear that the landscape is changing.”Technology has changed the media landscape, he adds. “Our role is to be an intermediary between technology and media and make sense of it.”——————————————-Pepsi looks to weave itself into showsWhether they are time-shifting their viewing by using digital video recorders or not watching television at all, the viewing habits of younger consumers present a problem to consumer brands eager to sell them products, writes Matthew Garrahan.“Media fragmentation is continuing to intensify, making it difficult for brands to engage with their consumers,” says Ken Strnad, senior director of brands, content and entertainment for PepsiCo.The company has agreed a 12-month deal with Maker Studios to produce “branded entertainment” in which its soft-drinks brands such as Mountain Dew will be woven into online programming. Neither Pepsi nor Maker would comment on the financial terms.Pepsi wanted to “connect with our consumers in the place where they are spending time”, he says. Maker’s “millennial engagement” was key, he says. “We know [millennials] are watching on YouTube.”The company’s brands will be featured on episodic programming, such as sketch comedy shows and online reality series, he says. “It’s not a spray and pray for video views,” he says. Instead, Pepsi is looking for strong online brands and shows with high levels of audience engagement.“This is not a traditional brand and [advertising] agency relationship,” he adds. “We are developing new concepts so they work for the content creators and they stay authentic with their audience.”"
173;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;‘Cut the sugar’ WHO warns in new guidelines;;One can of regular cola. Or one Mars bar. But not both in one day.Under proposed new health guidelines from the World Health Organisation, adults should limit themselves to no more than the equivalent of six teaspoons of sugar a day to avoid health risks such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease.There are nine teaspoons in a can of Coca-Cola or Pepsi and eight in a Mars bar.The UN offshoot put its draft guideline out to consultation on Wednesday, fuelling an already charged global debate between the food and drink industry and doctors about sugar’s role in health problems.Governments around the world are increasingly taking interventionist measures to curb excess intake of sugar because of the growing burden on health budgets. The WHO said the cost of treating cavities and other dental problems was also placing “a heavy burden”, taking up 5 to 10 per cent of healthcare budgets in industrialised countries.But the food and drink industry argues that calorie consumption and lack of exercise are primarily to blame for weight increase.The US Food and Drug Administration announced new labelling rules last week, including the disclosure of added sugars for the first time. The FDA estimated that the move could spur food and drink companies to reformulate their products, which could cost the industry up to $495m.In Mexico, where nearly one in three adults are obese, a tax has been imposed on fizzy drinks to discourage consumption.While the WHO stuck to its decade-old recommendation that sugar should make up less than 10 per cent of an adult’s daily calorie intake, it said that 5 per cent was its goal.Dr Francesco Branca, director for nutrition for health and development at the Geneva-based body, said: “Five per cent is the ideal one and the 10 per cent is the more realistic one.”He said obesity affected 500m people and was rising in the developing world.The Sugar Association, a US-based industry lobbying group, said in a statement that more scientific evidence was needed. “We are concerned that the draft guidelines’ suggested limits – which would lump together sugar (sucrose) and other caloric sweeteners – rely heavily on insufficient scientific evidence,” the group said.The industry has long argued that sugar has been unfairly condemned along with other sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup.Health advocates counter that a reduction in consumption of all sweeteners is necessary to combat obesity. The WHO guideline refers to “free” sugars, which includes sugar that is added to food and drink as well as the sugar in fresh fruit juices.In the UK, the Food and Drink Association, the biggest industry body, said: “Excess calories, whether from fat, sugars or other nutrients, can result in weight gain which is why UK food and drink producers are working to reduce calories in their products.”Professor Graham MacGregor, cardiologist and chairman of Action on Sugar, a campaigning group, said: “We have known about the heath risks of sugar for years and yet nothing substantial has been done. Setting [voluntary] targets for sugar reduction has had no measurable effect on calorie intake.Alison Tedstone, director of nutrition at Public Health England, said the UK population needed to reduce its sugar intake. The average intake for adults is 11.6 per cent and for children is 15.2 per cent, which is above the current UK recommendation of 10 per cent.Americans get 16 per cent from added sugar only, according to the FDA, with the top sources being fizzy drinks and energy and sports beverages.Additional reporting by Neil Munshi in Chicago——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Not so delightfully / From Mr Jonathan P Kahn
174;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-02-20T23:38:26Z;Nelson Peltz to take Pepsi break-up case to shareholders;;Nelson Peltz will take his campaign to split PepsiCo directly to fellow investors, less than a week after the US drinks and snacks company maintained that it would keep the businesses under one roof.Mr Peltz’s Trian Partners, which owns a $1.2bn stake in the maker of Pepsi soft drinks and Doritos crisps, said it was “highly disappointed” with Pepsi’s decision not to spin off its slow-growing beverage division as Mr Peltz has advocated.A split would “create two leaner and more entrepreneurial companies”, accelerating the food unit’s sales and margins and returning more cash to shareholders of a standalone drinks business, Trian argued in a letter and 31-page paper sent to Pepsi’s board on Wednesday.But Pepsi stuck to its argument that snacks and beverages complement each other.“We’ve looked at this from every single angle and we’re absolutely convinced that this is the best route for our company,” said Brian Cornell, head of the company’s Americas food division, at an industry conference in Florida.He noted that the drinks division’s connection with Taco Bell had led to the snacks segment collaborating with the US fast-food chain to create the popular Doritos Locos Tacos.Some analysts and investors remain concerned about how Pepsi and its peers are grappling with declining sales of fizzy drinks in developed markets, including the US, where consumers are turning away from sugar and artificial sweeteners.Pepsi’s latest results showed North America beverage sales volumes slipped 3 per cent in 2013 after falling 1 per cent in 2012. Global food sales rose 3 per cent last year, while worldwide drink sales rose 1 per cent.“We believe PepsiCo’s business has enormous opportunity to improve,” said Ali Dibadj, analyst at Bernstein. “They can probably improve as one company, but they simply haven’t yet. Focus often helps, so perhaps a break-up would make capturing the improvements even easier.”Pepsi shares closed up 1.2 per cent at $78.01 on Thursday.Mr Peltz has been meeting Pepsi’s board over several months to press his case for separation, although in January he dropped a proposal for Pepsi to merge with Mondelez after joining the board of the Oreo maker.If its hidden value can be realised, Pepsi may become the choice of a new generationContinue readingLast week, Pepsi said that after an “exhaustive” review it had concluded that keeping food and drink together was the best way to maximise shareholder value. At the same time it announced plans to boost shareholder capital returns through higher dividends and more buybacks.Trian responded on Wednesday, saying that it “does not agree with the outcome of PepsiCo’s strategic review, particularly following another quarter of uninspiring performance and weak 2014 guidance”.Mr Peltz has successfully agitated for the break-up of large food companies, including Cadbury, which spun off drinks maker Dr Pepper Snapple in 2008, and Kraft, whose split in 2012 created Mondelez.Our focus is on delivering results for our shareholders, not new, costly distractions that will harm shareholder interestsTrian said it “remained open to continued dialogue” with Pepsi’s management and board, but that it would now take its case directly to investors, including possibly holding public forums.“Trian believes the decision is one for shareholders, and it will immediately begin to engage fellow shareholders in a public dialogue with the goal of creating a groundswell of support for a separation of snacks and beverages.”Pepsi said the management and board were “fully aligned” in opposition to a split. “Our focus is on delivering results for our shareholders, not new, costly distractions that will harm shareholder interests,” it said in a statement.A person close to the matter said Pepsi had spent “tens of millions of dollars” analysing Mr Peltz’s proposals.In July, when Mr Peltz first launched his public campaign, Larry Fink of BlackRock – Pepsi’s largest shareholder – said he was not sure that a split would add long-term value.Sarat Sethi, managing director at Douglas C Lane & Associates, which owns $30m-worth of Pepsi shares, said: “Pepsi has great brands, and whether they separate the two companies or not, they have to do something to enhance shareholder returns.”He added: “[Chief executive Indra Nooyi] has been there five years and the stock has underperformed,” he said. “You come to a point where it’s been ‘wait and see’ for too long.”Trian said in its letter to Pepsi that under Ms Nooyi’s tenure, the company has underperformed in stock price, operating margins and earnings growth compared with its peers.Mr Sethi said: “Having Peltz bring this to bear puts more onus on management and the board to say ‘how do we take Pepsi into the next decade?’”Additional reporting by Neil Munshi in Boca Raton
175;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Pepsi / Coke: cola wars;If its hidden value can be realised, Pepsi may become the choice of a new generation;The Pepsi Challenge ads from years ago had consumers blindly sipping Pepsi and Coke and then indicating their preference (shockingly, Pepsi frequently won). Anyone tasting the shares of the soda stalwarts today might just spit out both. Cola sales continue to fall in the US, and foreign markets are now buffeted by currency and economic woes, as the earnings from the pair in the past week reveal.But the Pepsi bottle, unlike the Coke one, comes with a bag of crisps. Half of Pepsi’s revenue comes from food, and the strength of that business has encouraged activist investor Nelson Peltz to press for its separation. So with Coke’s total reliance on beverages, along with the possibility that Mr Peltz can find hidden value, Pepsi just may become the choice of a new generation.Pepsi’s snack revenue grew at a solid 5 per cent in 2013 while drinks sales slipped 2 per cent (although the two businesses are broken out only in its largest region, the Americas). With only drinks to sell, Coke’s 2013 group revenue fell 2 per cent. Even its volumes, which are not affected by currency movements, only inched up 2 per cent. But that tasty snacks business has not kept Pepsi from being a laggard. Its total shareholder return over the past five years is 77 per cent, compared with 102 per cent for Coke.Since 2009 Pepsi has traded on average at 15 times forward earnings. Coke has enjoyed a premium, trading on average at 17. Snack specialist Mondelez (which was spun out of Kraft in 2012) trades at 20 times. This all suggests that Pepsi’s drinks business is being valued at only a multiple of 10 times, which looks too cheap. A demerger perhaps would realise that value. Pepsi defends its “Power of One” model, though, saying that a split would lead to $1bn in incremental costs. Split or not, however, the essential question is how to fix the soda business.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
176;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
177;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Pepsi shares slip after split rebuff;Soft drink maker’s 35% lift in capital returns fails to persuade;PepsiCo shares fell after it said it would not split off its drinks business despite a declining US soda market and activist investor pressure.Its announcement that it would lift shareholder capital returns 35 per cent to $8.7bn this year and extend its cost-cutting plan failed to shore up confidence, with Pepsi shares falling 2.21 per cent to close at $79.69 in New York trading.The world’s second-largest soft drink maker by market share delivered another rebuff to the call from activist investor Nelson Peltz to divide its drinks and snacks businesses, saying it would “maximise shareholder value” by keeping the units together.While the decision not to restructure had been widely anticipated, the share price fall might reflect disappointment with Pepsi’s insistence on its “power of one” strategy, said Tom Mullarkey, analyst at Morningstar.Ali Dibadj of Bernstein Research said that the main issue was “a broader industry concern” as drinks makers grapple with changing consumer tastes.Analysts also pointed to the company’s 2014 core earnings forecast of $4.50 – well below Wall Street’s consensus forecast of $4.69 – as a source of investor disappointment.Pepsi said unfavourable foreign exchange rates would trim 4 percentage points from core profit growth this year, and gave a forecast of a 7 per cent rise this year – at the low end of its long-term “high single-digits” target.“The cash return and productivity helps, but probably not enough to get the stock up today,” said John Faucher of JPMorgan.Mr Peltz has been pressing Pepsi to split off the sluggish North American beverage business to allow its food brands, including Doritos and Quaker Oats, to grow faster.North American drink sales volume dropped 3 per cent in 2013 after falling 1 per cent in 2012, as US consumers turned away from both high-calorie sodas and artificially sweetened diet drinks.But on Thursday Indra Nooyi, chief executive, said that after an “exhaustive” review, the company concluded “our portfolio is truly better together . . . our presence in beverages contributes to our snacks growth.”“We are encouraged with the progress we made in North American beverages with a category that remains challenged,” Ms Nooyi said.While she said demand for colas had been particularly affected, she added: “it’s too big a business and too profitable a business not to let the transformation play out.”Soda makers are trying to adapt to changing consumer preferences by marketing “mid-calorie” sodas that have less sugar than regular drinks but eliminate the artificial sweeteners typically used in diet drinks. Pepsi said it plans to test drinks sweetened with a mix of sugar and stevia, a natural calorie-free sweetener, in the US this year. Rivals Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple have similar plans.Ms Nooyi also suggested a foray into so-called “at-home” drinks – such as SodaStream or Green Mountain’s Keurig system – could be in Pepsi’s future. It has been testing single-serve home delivery products but, she said, it would be “premature” to commit to a technology at this stage.Last week, Coke took a $1.25bn stake in Green Mountain and announced a partnership to make its brands available in a forthcoming at-home cold drink machine.The news came as Pepsi reported a 9 per cent rise in 2013 net income to $6.74bn, or $4.32 a share, from $6.18bn, or $3.92 a share, in 2012. Full-year revenue was up 1 per cent to $66.4bn from $65.5bn, in line with Wall Street’s forecast.Stripping out one-off costs including losses on commodity hedges, restructuring charges and the impact of Venezuela’s currency devaluation, core earnings per share were $4.37, ahead of $4.10 in 2012 and beating estimates of $4.34.Global food sales volume rose 3 per cent last year while drink sales were up 1 per cent. Declining drink sales in North America and Europe were offset by growing demand for snacks and by growth in emerging markets.In the fourth quarter, net income rose 5 per cent to $1.74bn, or $1.12 a share, from $1.66bn, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. Revenue was up 1 per cent to $20.1bn from $19.95bn, matching analysts’ estimates. Core earnings in the quarter were $1.05 a share, ahead of Wall Street’s forecast $1.The new five-year cost-cutting plan extends a three-year programme that ends this year. Of the $1bn annual savings target, 40 per cent will come from cutting labour costs, said Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer. He would not give a number of jobs that could be cut, however.Pepsi said it would raise its annualised dividend 15 per cent to $2.62 a share starting in June and accelerate its buyback programme to $5bn this year from $3bn in 2013.
178;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-02-12T23:33:26Z;Mondelez struggles amid tough environment for food groups;;Mondelez International’s fourth-quarter earnings and sales missed analyst expectations as the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate continues to struggle for growth amid tough economic conditions for food companies.Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive, promised to improve margins, which have been the target of criticism from activist investor Nelson Peltz.She said the company had been hit hard in emerging markets, which contributed about 40 per cent of revenues during the quarter. “Particularly in the Brics [Brazil, Russia, India and China] markets, we’ve seen a steady decline in GDP,” she said. “Though our categories there are growing nicely, they are very much tied to GDP.”“Near-term economic conditions will remain challenging,” she said, but added she was confident in Mondelez’s “potential to significantly expand margins and deliver strong top-line growth in 2014”.Ms Rosenfeld said the company expected organic net revenue, a measure that strips out the effect of acquisitions and other items, to grow about 4 per cent in 2014. The company forecast earnings of $1.73-$1.78 this year, against analyst expectations of $1.71.The Illinois-based company reported earnings of $1.77bn, or 42 cents a share excluding items, in the three months to December, compared with $569m, or 38 cents a share excluding special items, during the same period last year. Sales fell 0.1 per cent to $9.49bn.Analysts had expected earnings of 44 cents a share on sales of $9.57bn. Shares in the company fell 3 per cent, to $32.20, in after-market trading in New York.Mondelez’s headline earnings were boosted by a $1.6bn gain, net of taxes, after the resolution of a licence and supply dispute with Starbucks.Mondelez joins other food companies grappling with a tough operating environment. On Tuesday, ConAgra Foods, which makes Hunt’s ketchup, lowered its forecast for its fiscal year, while Kellogg last week cited difficulties in its core breakfast cereal category.But Mondelez has faced criticism that it has not lived up to the fast growth executives promised when it was spun off from Kraft in 2012, particularly from Mr Peltz.Last month, Mr Peltz said he would drop his campaign for PepsiCo to buy Mondelez after Mondelez added him to its board.Mr Peltz has long advocated lowering costs at Mondelez, and has criticised the company’s profit margins. He will stand for election to the board, which would expand to 12 members with his addition, at the annual meeting later this year.Analysts expect his involvement on the board will force the company to become leaner as it streamlines its supply chain and increase manufacturing efficiency that Mondelez last year said would result in $3bn in gross productivity savings over three years.
179;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-02-03T18:53:03Z;Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan causes embarrassment to Pepsi;;PepsiCo of the US is facing embarrassment in India after its former brand ambassador, the Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, said he decided to sever ties with the company after a young girl asked why he was promoting a product that her teacher said was harmful.Mr Bachchan, a 71-year-old superstar who rose to fame as “the angry young man” of Indian film in the 1970s, served as Pepsi’s brand ambassador from 2002 until 2005, appearing in numerous television commercials – many of which can still be viewed on YouTube.But last week, Mr Bachchan said he decided to end his affiliation with Pepsi after a schoolgirl at a public function in Jaipur asked why he was promoting a drink that her teacher had told her was “poisonous and contains these negative products”.“When you say to drink Pepsi, I feel you are doing something wrong,” the actor recalled the girl saying. “I just felt if this is an impression that we create in the mind of a possible buyer, I must not be doing it. And I stopped endorsing Pepsi.”Mr Bachchan made the remarks while talking to students at Ahmedabad’s Indian Institute of Management, a top business school. The comments drew wide attention both in mainstream and social media, causing a storm within India’s advertising community.“It’s definitely embarrassing,” said Dheeraj Sinha, chief strategy officer in south and southeast Asia for Grey, the ad agency. “It’s not easy building a brand, and the last thing you want is your wife going out and criticising you in public.”In an email statement to the Financial Times, Pepsi said: “Amitabh Bachchan is a living legend and it is only natural for employees of any organisation to look up to the brand ambassadors. Pepsi is loved by millions of Indian consumers.”The company declined to any answer further questions about the actor’s comments. A Pepsi spokesman previously told an Indian newspaper that “statements such as his can sadden employees of any organisation”.Amitabh Bachchan, Scarlett Johansson and the art of the celebrity endorsementAt the World Economic Forum last month, Indra Nooyi said that since she took over as chief executive, Pepsi had striven to transform its business to reflect changing consumer preferences, and develop a healthier product portfolio, with reduced salt, sugar and fat.February 2010: Amitabh Bachchan, one of India’s most celebrated Bollywood actors, talks about mixing stardom with businessPepsi’s discomfort in India comes amid a furore over Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson’s endorsement of SodaStream, an Israeli fizzy drinks company that makes some of its dispensers at a factory in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Ms Johansson’s promotion of SodaStream prompted an outcry that forced the actress to drop her long-term role as a goodwill ambassador for Oxfam, the UK-based charity, which opposes all trade with the Israeli settlements.Together, the incidents highlight the risks to companies or other organisations of relying on celebrity ambassadors.Mr Bachchan, with his deep baritone voice, is one of Bollywood’s busiest celebrity product endorsers, with a portfolio that includes Nestlé’s Maggi noodles, local cement and jewellery companies and Gujarat tourism.But Mr Sinha said he did not foresee lasting damage to Pepsi, noting that the company’s target audience were young people unlikely to be moved by the veteran actor’s comments.
180;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-01-28T13:22:18Z;Davos wrap: EM winners (Mexico) and losers (Brazil);;"It would be exaggerated to call Davos the “money Oscars”, as Jon Stewart did on the Daily Show. But this year, WEF participants did like to think of countries as winners or losers, especially among emerging markets. In this last roundup, beyondbrics summarises who, to paraphrase the FT, “was hot – and who decidedly not.”The #1Mexico was the EM country most patted on the shoulder – and president Enrique Peña Nieto reacted by puffing out his chest.“When it comes to reforms, one country stands out and has done exceptional work,” Angel Gurria, secretary general of the OECD and himself a Mexican, told beyondbrics. “I said this with great pride: it’s Mexico.”During the conference, business leaders not only said they believed Peña Nieto; they announced new investments in his country. Cisco announced plans to spend $1.3bn, Nestlé $1bn, and PepsiCo a whopping $5.3bn.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s CEO, said in Davos that “this investment shows our confidence in [the president] and his cabinet,” and that she hoped to grow “in Mexico, with Mexico, and for Mexico.”The runners-upGrowth countries in Africa, such as Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda were another group of EMs that convinced participants good things will happen in 2014. They could count on a well-received pep talk from Aliko Dangote, Africa’s richest man and co-chair of the WEF.“Don’t wait until the next elections to do business in Nigeria,” he said. “I say, go ahead, invest: there is no government that is going to be against business. You can’t make a mistake coming into our countries.”WEF participants, by and large, welcomed Dangote’s comments. “We believe in Africa because it’s the last frontier,” Tenbite Ermias, head of Africa at consulting firm BCG, told beyondbrics. Africa’s fundamentals are improving, the native Ethiopian said, and that allows for a positive spiral. “Before, the view of opportunity was limited, and therefore the reality was limited. That has changed now.”Mark Bowman, managing director of SABMiller Africa, agreed. “It’s not easy to do business in Africa. If it was easy to do business in Africa, all of our competitors would do it. But it’s worth the investment, because on average, things are moving up.”In the balanceParticipants worried, as so often, about whether China would be able to provide fast enough growth for its upcoming middle class to stay contented.But the fact that it has successfully done so in the last decades gave the country’s leaders credibility that some other EM leaders lacked. “I’m both worried about emerging markets and bullish on China,” said Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, summarising those feelings.The execution of the country’s reform plans constitutes its Achilles’ heel. “Everyone knows that from good policy and good intent, there’s a long way to reality,” said Rich Lesser, CEO of Boston Consulting Group. Blankfein agreed. “The execution is going to be critical. Everything won’t go well.”On average though, optimism prevailed. “This could be China’s century,” Blankfein said, and in the room, people nodded in agreement.Neutral to negativeBased on its growth prospects, of 5 to 6 per cent, it would be unfair to categorize India as a loser. But certainly, neither India’s representatives, nor the other WEF participants, were very enthusiast about the country.“I think the Indian economy has gone a bit off the rails,” said Vineet Nayyar, vice-chairman of Tech Mahindra. “We spent a fortune subsiding oil, diesel, gasoline during the last five years, instead of spending it on the infrastructure we need. We’ve become an entitlement society.”According to Nayyar, “any growth below 9 per cent is bad for India,” given its population growth and inflation. But with the exception of S Gopalakrishnan, this year’s co-chair of the WEF and co-founder of Infosys, most participants weren’t optimistic on the prospects of achieving that number in the next years. Or as Paul Fletcher of Actis put it eloquently: “I’m neutral, wanting to be positive.”The loserBrazil was the country least mentioned on the “hot” list of Davos. With a perceived lack of structural investments and the feeling that too much growth was coming from consumption, it wasn’t easy to hear a positive note about the country.“Brazil cannot rely on more consumption to resume growth,” Ilan Goldfajn, chief economist at Itaú-Unibanco, Brazil’s biggest private-sector bank, told beyondbrics. “It needs more investment in infrastructure. To attract such investments, you need investor confidence on a horizon of up to 20-30 years. The government struggles to provide this confidence.”That Dilma Rousseff came straight from opening a World Cup stadium to Davos didn’t do anything to change that mood. “She said the right words, but what about execution?” wondered Ana Clara Costa, a financial journalist from Brazil’s influential publication Veja.com.In the final debate of the meeting, Haruhiko Kuroda, governor of Japan’s central bank, told participants they could be “cautiously optimistic” on the world economic outlook. The optimism, most likely, was about the US. The caution, we may assume, was about EMs. That caution is at least partially warranted.Further reading:

181;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-01-24T21:53:22Z;Mexico set for $7bn foreign cash boost;;Mexico is set for a wave of foreign cash as PepsiCo, Nestlé and Cisco announced investments totalling more than $7.35bn in Latin America’s second-largest economy.Enrique Peña Nieto, Mexico’s president, said in Davos that the pledges revealed “the enthusiasm that our country has awakened through the structural reforms it is making and the platform it is building to boost economic growth and social development”.Mexico’s government pushed through energy, financial, labour, tax, telecoms and political reforms last year that Mr Peña Nieto said were “designed to boost economic growth and develop attractive productive investment”.The investments by PepsiCo, maker of Pepsi and Mountain Dew sodas and Lay’s crisps, and Nestlé, producer of Purina pet food, come despite higher taxes on sugary drinks, calorific snacks and pet food that were part of the reforms.The biggest of the reforms, which opens up the energy sector after 75 years in state hands, is expected to lure billions of dollars of investment.Pemex, Mexico’s state oil monopoly, said on Friday that it had signed a deal with Russia’s Lukoil at Davos, but gave no figures.The co-operation agreement “lays the foundations to work together in areas related to exploration and production”, Pemex said.Pepsi said it would invest $5bn in Mexico over the next five years. It plans to expand the range of products it sells and increase manufacturing and delivery capacity, creating 4,000 jobs.Indra Nooyi, chief executive, said Mexico was an “enormously important market” with a promising future.Pepsi and other big consumer companies have been looking outside developed markets for faster growth. Emerging markets contributed more than a third of Pepsi’s revenues of $65.5bn in 2012, and Mexicans drink soda at a per-capita rate second only to the US, according to Euromonitor International.While the US is still the largest market for Pepsi and Coca-Cola, soda sales there have slowed as Americans turn away from fizzy drinks amid concerns over obesity and artificial sweeteners.In November, Pepsi said it would invest $5.5bn by 2020 to expand its presence in India. Coca-Cola made similar $5bn pledges in both Mexico and India in 2012.Nestlé’s chief executive, Paul Bulcke, said the Swiss food group planned to invest $1bn to build new baby food and pet food plants, as well as to expand a cereals facility. The investment will create 700 new direct jobs and 3,500 indirect jobs, he said.They are Nestlé’s first totally new factories since 1992 in Mexico, the second-biggest market in Latin America for the food giant and the sixth worldwide, and will boost production for regional markets. The expanded cereals factory will become Nestlé’s biggest in Latin America.“The investment we are making is a clear sign of the commitment we have to Mexico and our long-term view of a market,” Mr Bulcke said.Cisco, the US IT company, unveiled a $1.3bn investment, and said it saw Mexico as a long-term partner and hoped to boost its spending there in years to come.Mexico faces an intense couple of months as Congress hammers out secondary legislation to implement the historic reforms.The country has suffered a renewed surge of violence in the western state of Michoacán, which prompted the state to take over security there and send in more than 9,000 police and troops. But Mr Peña Nieto said investors were actively eyeing Mexico and the country was “on the right path” in its security strategy.The president also highlighted record foreign direct investment of $28.2bn in the third quarter of 2013, 98 per cent more than the same period in 2012, saying that was “why I said this is a good time to believe in Mexico . . . many investors from all over the world are already doing so”.
182;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-01-21T18:00:13Z;Peltz drops campaign for PepsiCo-Mondelez merger;Activist investor to urge instead for drinks company split;Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, will drop his campaign for PepsiCo to buy Mondelez International, the snacks business behind Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Trident gum, after Mondelez added him to its board on Tuesday.The move saves the company from further agitation in the public campaign Mr Peltz launched last year urging PepsiCo to merge its snacks division with Mondelez.Mr Peltz’s Trian Fund Management has billion-dollar stakes in both companies.“Now that Nelson Peltz is a director [at Mondelez], as long as Trian is a significant shareholder of PepsiCo, Mr Peltz will recuse himself from discussions pertaining to PepsiCo,” said Anne Tarbell, a spokeswoman for Trian.As PepsiCo has made clear that it is not interested in pursuing a merger with Mondelez, Mr Peltz will instead encourage PepsiCo to separate its snacks and beverages divisions, Ms Tarbell said.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, has argued that the company’s drinks and snacks brands complement each other and has resisted Mr Peltz’s calls for a split.PepsiCo is nevertheless considering restructuring its underperforming North American beverage business, which has suffered from declining US demand for fizzy drinks. It intends to update shareholders in February. The company declined to comment on Tuesday.Trian is Mondelez’s fourth-largest shareholder, with a 2.3 per cent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data. Mr Peltz will stand for election to the board, which would expand to 12 members with his addition, at the annual meeting later this year.In a statement, Mr Peltz said his focus would be “driving growth, improving margins and increasing value for all shareholders”. In October, he criticised Mondelez’s profit margins, telling a conference in Chicago it had not done enough to control costs.Mr Peltz has been a central player in the evolution of Mondelez. He advocated the spin-off of Dr Pepper Snapple from Cadbury, the purchase of Cadbury by Kraft and the break-up of Kraft into Mondelez and Kraft Foods Group.Mondelez has struggled since the split, with chief executive Irene Rosenfeld acknowledging early “executional missteps” in Brazil and Russia, markets which are important to the company’s emerging markets-focused strategy.Amid criticism that the company has not lived up to the fast growth executives promised when it was spun off, Mondelez in September announced a plan to streamline its supply chain and increase manufacturing efficiency, saying this would deliver $3bn in gross productivity savings over three years.Shares in Mondelez were down 2.6 per cent to $34.33 in afternoon trading in New York. PepsiCo was 0.8 per cent higher at $82.85.
183;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2014-01-14T04:54:44Z;India’s slowdown trips up consumer goods groups;;Burgeoning demand for toothpaste – an item considered an everyday necessity in developed countries – is proving to be a rare bright spot for consumer goods companies in India.For it is not all gleaming smiles for the international consumer goods groups operating in the Indian market – a list that includes the likes of Hindustan Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Procter & Gamble and Nestlé.The combined effect of a slowing economy, rising local input costs, recent sharp rupee depreciation and greater competition is beginning to pinch. Profit growth is slowing, and previously high expectations are being tempered.“They are not going to grow at the pace at which they were growing,” says Nitin Mathur, a consumer industries analyst at Espirito Santo Securities in Mumbai.India’s gross domestic product growth slowed from a peak of 9.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2011 to a mere 4.8 per cent in the quarter that ended in September, while consumer prices have risen by an average of 10 per cent annually for the past five years. Increasingly anxious about the future, Indian consumers are tightening their purse strings, especially for discretionary spending.Jubilant Foodworks, a listed Indian company that has the Domino’s Pizza franchise in India, has seen its same-store sales growth fall from a high of 36 per cent two years ago to just 6.3 per cent last quarter. Same-store sales for Yum Brands India– which owns KFC and Pizza Hut – fell from 13 per cent two years ago to a mere 2 per cent in the quarter that ended in June.Fast-moving consumer goods companies are also being hit. “The whole game for these companies was to upgrade consumers regularly to more expensive brands, which is clearly not happening right now,” says Mr Mathur. “They are buying toothpaste but they are buying the more economic range.”At Shri Ambico Medicos, a tiny family-owned pharmacy in New Delhi’s Khanna Market, India’s economic malaise is reflected in declining sales of men’s deodorant and facial creams.Global fast-moving consumer goods companies such as Unilever and L’Oréal, and their Indian rivals Enami and Paras, have been aggressively promoting men’s personal grooming products – including deodorant and even men’s fairness creams – for the last three years. They have effectively created a market where none existed.Continue readingCompanies’ cost equations have also been hard hit by the impact of the depreciation of the rupee on the prices of palm oil and soda ash – which are key ingredients for soap and detergents – and higher packaging costs.Wrestling with these twin problems of souring consumer sentiment and higher but volatile costs, companies are being forced into tough decisions between raising prices and accepting an erosion of their margins.“It’s a ‘revenue versus margin’ equation for them,” says Vivek Maheshwari, a consumer goods analyst for CLSA. “There will be some price increases, but companies will also have to absorb some cost inflation.”He says Nestlé, which sells dairy products, Maggi instant noodles and other packaged foods in India, has been the most aggressive foreign company in raising prices: “They have been sacrificing growth for margins.”GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, the UK-based pharma company's Indian arm, has also increased the price of Horlicks, a popular malted nutritional drink that Indians give children to boost energy levels.Nandu Nandkishore, executive vice-president of Nestlé, told the Financial Times: “Our strategy is about sustainable value creation. Margin creation is something we don't compromise on too much.”Yet Mr Nandkishore says Nestlé has held prices steady for its lowest-cost, entry level products. “The 10-rupee noodle pack has been 10 rupees for 10 years,” he says.December 18 2013: India’s economic growth has slowed. For investors, lower growth may mean lower profits, but for some people inside the country, it could be a disasterIn general, Mr Maheshwari says, “packaged food companies are in a sweet spot. The market is small so they can kick up prices without worrying as much about competition.”But price increases are tougher in personal care categories, where multinationals face fierce competition – among themselves, but also from big local brands, and even traditional unbranded alternatives. To cope, many companies are ratcheting up their advertising and promotional spending to chase growth despite the gloom, posing a risk to earnings.Hindustan Unilever spent Rs9.54bn ($155m) on advertising and promotion in the last quarter, while its volumes grew 5 per cent. That compares with advertising and promotion spending of Rs7.43bn and volume growth of 13 per cent, in the quarter that ended December 2010.In spite of their current difficulties, global consumer goods companies are still believed to have bright prospects in India, given the low penetration and household spending on basic personal care products such as toothpaste, and even convenience items like packaged foods.Many global companies are now increasing their stakes in their publicly listed Indian subsidiaries – and paying handsomely to do so.In mid-July, Unilever spent €2.5bn to increase its stake in its listed Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever, from 52.5 per cent to 67.3 per cent, paying a generous 36 times this year’s consensus forecast earnings, and a 26 per cent premium on the undisturbed share price.That deal came only months after GlaxoSmithKline also paid a 26 per cent premium to lift its 42 per cent stake in its consumer healthcare business, to 75 per cent. GSK has announced a similar offer for its Indian drugs unit.Companies such as Cadbury India, part of Mondelez International, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have also outlined ambitious investment plans for India for the coming years, anticipating ever greater demand for their wares as the economy grows.“The growth potential is huge in India,” says Mr Maheshwari. “It’s just about managing the short-term cyclical headwinds.”
184;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;BritVic in deal with Pepsi to grow Fruit Shoots further into US;;Britvic, the drinks group behind Fruit Shoot, has signed a 15-year deal with PepsiCo as it attempts to grab a bigger chunk of the US’s $2bn children’s drinks market.The distribution and bottling deal with Pepsi will make Fruit Shoot available in 41 states in the US – up from 32.The news came as Britvic posted a 27 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to £108.1m for the year to September 29, as the group put the memory of last year’s product recall behind it.A product recall of its redesigned Fruit Shoot bottle wiped about a fifth off the company’s bottom line last year. This triggered the start of an eventful period for the company, which late last year agreed a merger with AG Barr, the Scottish group behind Irn Bru, before backing out this summer after its performance had improved.Shares have risen by about a fifth since Britvic walked away from the deal. Simon Litherland, chief executive, said: “What we are doing is outlining a very clear strategy as a standalone business. We are executing against that strategy and the market is reacting well.”Revenues rose just over 4 per cent to £1.3bn.There is vindication for serial deal denier Gerald Corbett in the full-year results of Britvic…Continue readingMr Litherland said that the increased focus of regulators on sugary drinks – particularly those aimed at children – is “an issue for us”.The chief executive explained that Britvic had cut the calorie content of its drinks, adding that “low sugar” varieties of Fruit Shoot now make up 85 per cent of the drink’s sales.Shares in Britvic rose 2.9 per cent to 624.5p.
185;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Cool reception from business for an independent Scotland;Battle for country’s soul in run-up to next year’s referendum;Two archetypes define the battle for the soul of Scotland in the run-up to next year’s independence referendum. On one side is Braveheart, the fright-wigged patriot as whom movie actor Mel Gibson represented Sir William Wallace. On the other are the great empirical philosophers Adam Smith and David Hume, whose statues occupy prime sites in Edinburgh.Emotion comes first in arguments over national self-determination. Only a cold fish votes for or against independence because it would make him modestly better or worse off. But the separatist argument set out in Scotland’s Future from the Scottish National party is nevertheless viewed with cool scepticism by many businesspeople north of the border.The document proposes a rosy future where corporation tax is 3 per cent lower than in England, protection for employees is increased and the Bank of England still stands ready to bail out Scottish financial institutions. According to one Scottish observer “the content of the report does not change anything because the outcome cannot be guaranteed”.Alex Salmond can only realise his dream with help from Westminster politicians who have good reasons for withholding it. The leader of the SNP wants a) the BoE to consider Scottish priorities alongside English ones in setting sterling interest rates b) prudential regulation to reflect political drivers in both countries, and c) a breakaway watchdog to provide financial regulation “harmonised” with the UK.We do not know what Christmas present Mr Salmond has requested from David Cameron, but you can bet it is big, shiny and unaffordable.The English market has historically been worth more to ingenious Scots than their country’s natural resources or location. For all Mr Salmond’s assurances, independence would split the UK market for financial services. Big Scottish groups such as Standard Life, Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal Bank of Scotland would sit in a separate silo to about 90 per cent of their customers. That would increase costs and damage confidence.The business verdict on the case pressed by Mr Salmond is an appropriately Scottish one: not proven.He shoots, he scoresThere is vindication for serial deal denier Gerald Corbett in the full-year results of Britvic. A recovery in the sales of Fruit Shoot helped the soft drinks group, which Mr Corbett chairs, raise profits before tax 27 per cent to £108m. That was just ahead of recent expectations and miles better than anyone would have predicted after Britvic recalled the kiddie-invigorating cordial on safety grounds in July 2012.The possibility that wee Jonnie might swallow a bottle cap was not much of an advertisement. Discountenanced Britvic mulled the idea of a reverse takeover by AG Barr, the Scottish alchemist that turns girders into pop. But the talks went flat this summer, partly thanks to Mr Corbett, even as Britvic put the zing back into the Fruit Shoot brand. The shares have risen 133 per cent since the recall, 20 per cent since the group spurned Barr and 2.8 per cent since the results announcement.Thanks to an agreement with PepsiCo, sugary Fruit Shoot will shortly be demoralising dentists in 41 US states. Underlying earnings for 2014 are on track to hit £152m, compared with £138m this year. The shares, trading on a forward earnings multiple of 16.5 times, compared with Barr at 21.4 times, will look like a good value to believers in momentum.Betfair, another company Mr Corbett hustled away from a sellout, is up 17 per cent in six months. Chairmen pressured to do deals can learn from his obtuseness.Carry-on up the LMEIs Europe’s last-remaining open outcry trading pit set to close? Futures broker Jefferies Bache has announced it will quit the ring of the London Metal Exchange, where traders still shout out orders and seal deals with a gesture. The rumoured departure of a second firm would reduce the number of members occupying the curved leather benches to a historic low of nine. There were 15 of them 20 years ago.The LME itself is in passable shape, weak metals prices notwithstanding. A £1.4bn takeover by Hong Kong Exchanges has given the historic market support for its own clearing house, an important vertical diversification.The bulk of trading on the LME, which specialises in non-ferrous metals, is now conducted by telephone or online. The ring is the redoubt of gesticulating specialists in the “carry trade”, who act for investors who want to swap exposures of different tenors. If a review in 2015 ends outcry trading, some of the Dickensian colour would bleed from the City. The markets, impersonal and unsentimental, would thunder on regardless.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
186;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-11-14T00:59:34Z;Prevention: Carrots and sticks approach wins mixed reviews;Health schemes face an uphill battle in an era of junk food and drink;With the cost of diabetes growing, pushed by swelling obesity rates around the world, companies and countries are using bigger sticks and carrots in a bid to contain the problem.This year, CVS, the US pharmacy company, said it would charge its workers an extra $600 annually if they refused to submit to tests of their glucose levels, body fat and weight. Humana, the insurer, will not hire smokers in some states. Jones Lang LaSalle, the property company, pays workers for meeting certain medical goals.Governments are stepping up their efforts to combat diabetes and the US is a prime example. President Barack Obama’s healthcare law is designed to encourage corporate health programmes and ensure that people with pre-existing medical conditions – such as diabetes – can get insurance.Type 2 diabetes – when the body becomes resistant to insulin – is often linked to obesity and can lead to debilitating complications such as heart disease, blindness, nerve damage and amputation.The fact that in many cases diabetes can be delayed or prevented has made it a target for government and corporate health programmes. These seek to nudge people into healthier lifestyles and away from behaviour that leads to obesity, elevated glucose levels and the consequences that follow.According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than half of large US companies offer biometric screening to workers and 11 per cent of those groups reward or penalise employees based on the outcomes of those tests.Do such programmes work? The reviews have been mixed.A 2011 study in Health Affairs journal examined Johnson & Johnson’s worksite health promotion programme and found that its growth in medical spending was 3.7 percentage points lower than other big companies from 2002 to 2008. The health of its employees improved and the company saved an average of $565 per worker in 2009 dollars. J&J’s “return on investment” was up to $3.92 for every dollar spent.Other studies are less positive. Another report in the same journal this year put the case that such investment might not be so worthwhile because over-screening can lead to more tests and treatments that come with other side effects. “Programme costs are typically born immediately, whereas savings may not appear until later, accruing to future employers or the public,” the authors wrote.Schemes that take a “stick” approach can function as a regressive tax, penalising lower income workers who struggle to meet health requirements. A recent Georgetown University study on wellness programmes said: “Women, low-income, and minority individuals can be at a disadvantage when employers tie the cost of insurance to the ability to meet certain health targets. These populations are more likely to have the health conditions that wellness programmes target and face more barriers to healthy living.”Derek Yach, a former PepsiCo executive who recently launched the Vitality Institute, which researches prevention, says that striking the right balance is crucial.“The right ratio of carrot to stick is important,” Mr Yach says. “In the US, the level of investment in prevention is still paltry compared with the money spent on cures.”On the macro level, the returns on prevention can be great. According to the Centers for Disease Control’s diabetes prevention programme, diet and exercise changes can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people with pre-diabetes by 58 per cent.That can mean big savings in hospital bills and lost wages. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that the US could save $18.4bn over the course of 75 years if “interventions” could help 1m obese people between the ages of 45 and 54 reduce their weight to a normal level.New technology is one method that regulators and companies are using to intervene more effectively. Wearable technology and mobile health devices are allowing people to monitor their glucose levels and keep track of the calories they are burning.The consultancy PwC estimates that in Europe such technology could prevent more than 160,000 cases of diabetes by 2017 and save more than €18bn in earnings lost to absenteeism and early retirement.Medical monitoring could be the future, although even the industry’s keenest evangelists acknowledge the technology is not fully developed.Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute, says that although it is possible to measure glucose every one to five minutes with the data being sent to the patient’s smartphone, the applications have not yet been adequately tested.“With nearly all the biosensors, there’s a gap between measuring accurately and demonstrating improved outcomes,” Dr Topol says.While many companies are investing in health programmes, those that sell unhealthy products are only slowly coming around to the notion that they must play their part in ensuring that their customers achieve longevity.Giants such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have been selling more zero-calorie products and drinks as they attempt to fend off criticism that they are responsible for the rise of obesity and diabetes. There is, however, more to be done.Mr Yach, who left PepsiCo last year after serving as its in-house public health expert, says industry still has a long way to go because junk food sells and Wall Street is focused on short-term profits.He points to the case of the recent Hostess bankruptcy and the subsequent rescue of the Twinkie, a snack cake of sponge filled with cream, as evidence that progress is needed.“It’s amazing that the Twinkie got bailed out, if you look at the contents of it,” he said. “But that’s the reality.”——————————————-Another FT special report, The Future of the Food Industry, is to be published on Wednesday November 20
187;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-11-06T22:16:23Z;Mondelez lowers sales guidance;Activist Peltz given ammunition over food group;Mondelez lowered its guidance for 2013 organic net revenue growth as it reported lower-than-expected third-quarter revenues in a further sign of the challenges facing the food industry.The maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate said it expected organic net revenue, a measure that strips out the impact of acquisitions and other items, to grow around 4 per cent for the year, against its earlier forecast of about 5 per cent.Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive, said weak biscuit sales in China, low coffee prices and slower global growth, particularly in emerging markets, had hit third-quarter revenue.“We expect these factors will continue to pressure our top line for the remainder of the year,” Ms Rosenfeld said. “We believe that the recent industry-wide slowdown in key emerging markets, especially China, is temporary. But this slowdown, along with lower coffee prices, will moderate our top-line growth in 2014 to be in the 4 to 5 per cent range.”Mondelez is not alone in facing a challenging operating environment. Earlier this week, Kellogg, the breakfast cereal maker, said it would cut 7 per cent of its global staff by 2017 in response to competition and weakness in overall food spending that has hit the likes of McDonald’s as well.Kraft Foods, the company from which Mondelez was spun off, also faces difficulties. Tony Vernon, chief executive, last week told analysts that shoppers “have little interest or minimal ability to buy more than what they need for a given week or even a given day”.The news came the week after activist investor Nelson Peltz again put pressure on Mondelez, telling a conference in Chicago that the company was not doing enough to cut costs.Mr Peltz, who is the company’s fourth-biggest shareholder with a 2.3 per cent stake, according to Thomson Reuters, has also pushed PepsiCo to purchase Mondelez.Amid criticism that the company has not lived up to the fast growth executives promised when it was spun off from Kraft last year, Mondelez in September announced a plan to streamline its supply chain and increase manufacturing efficiency that it said would deliver $3bn in gross productivity savings over the next three years.Mondelez reported earnings of $1.02bn, or 57 cents a share, compared to $652m, or 36 cents a share, during the same period last year. Revenues rose 1.8 per cent, from $8.33bn to $8.47bn.Excluding one-off items, including a 21 cent benefit related to the 2010 acquisition of Cadbury, the company reported earnings of 41 cents a share. Analysts had expected earnings of 40 cents a share on revenues of $8.56bn.Shares in the company were relatively flat in after-market trading in New York, at $33.43.
188;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-10-25T18:57:47Z;Carl Icahn: the blogger;The investor’s website would be more compelling if he discussed his missteps;"The latest item 77-year-old Carl Icahn can cross off his bucket list: becoming a blogger. He is already a media darling on cable television, on Twitter – where 107,000 followers await his cryptic musings – and on op-ed pages. This week Mr Icahn unveiled his website, Shareholders’ Square Table, where he waxes eloquent about boardroom fails. Mr Icahn’s $20bn net worth speaks to his investing acumen. Based on his first few posts, however, it appears that finding a clever niche as a pundit will be trickier than accumulating a fortune.Corporate America and activist investors have had a war; the activists have won. Companies still win their share of proxy fights, but the balance of power has tipped. Almost every company, even big ones such as Microsoft and Pepsi, spend millions warding off agitators.Because there are gadflies buzzing everywhere in search of the smallest cracks in corporate facades, the golden age of activism may have passed. The easy targets have been hit. So why should Mr Icahn not step off the field and into the broadcast booth, where the media and the public hang on every syllable he utters? He has gamely positioned himself as the champion of underdog investors everywhere. A castle besieged by barbarians is the illustration on the new site – a populist sheen that would make even the Tea Party grin.Regrettably, Shareholders’ Square Table offers white papers on the evils of golden parachutes and poison pills. Borr-riiing. These topics have already been tackled by proxy advisers, pension funds and academics. Better idea: a discussion about Mr Icahn’s missteps.Mr Icahn’s $20bn says he has been more right than wrong. So no harm in telling us, Mr Icahn, why you advocated for a sale of Netflix a year ago, just before the stock quintupled. Or why you sold into the Dell buyout when you said you would not. Bill Ackman, Mr Icahn’s nemesis, has shown some humility recently – although he had little choice given the amount of investor cash he has squandered. Mr Icahn’s blog would be much more compelling, and much more influential, if he came clean about his miscues too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
189;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Food Inc acquires taste for healthier options;;Reduced-fat french fries. Diet drinks made with natural sweeteners. Fruits and vegetables served with kid’s meals. The purveyors of salt, sugar and fat are trying to clean up their images.As consumers have grown more aware of exactly what is in the products they buy, food and beverage groups are stepping up efforts to shed their unhealthy reputations to capture or retain customers looking for alternatives to the fare they have traditionally peddled.“We are seeing a fundamental shift in consumer habits and behaviours,” Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, told investors last week. She was talking about “an accelerated decline in diet drinks” as consumers wary of aspartame and other artificial sugar substitutes are demanding naturally sweetened drinks.That push is also behind Coca-Cola’s move to replace Sprite in the UK and France with a lower-calorie version sweetened with sugar and stevia – a plant-derived sweetener – and the June launch of similarly formulated “Coca-Cola Life” in Argentina.Coke also recently patented a stevia product that analysts say may be used in zero-calorie drinks, while Pepsi is working on its own natural sweetener.Sales of sugary drinks have been falling for years, with fizzy drinks now making up about 40 per cent of the US beverage market, compared with more than 50 per cent a decade ago, Ms Nooyi said. But now diet drinks are struggling too.Sales of Diet Coke fell 3 per cent last year, compared with Coke’s 1 per cent decline, while Diet Pepsi’s 6.2 per cent drop was nearly double the 3.4 per cent decrease for Pepsi, according to Beverage Digest.Diet Coke and similar food and drinks “are under a bit of pressure as people are questioning ingredients [and] ingredient safety,” said Steve Cahillane, who heads Coca-Cola’s North American and Latin American business.The focus on healthier options is spreading throughout the food sector. In snacks, companies such as General Mills and Danone are playing catch-up to upstart Chobani, which has ignited a craze for Greek yoghurt.Dan Wald of Boston Consulting Group said the packaged foods industry alone has a $150bn annual US sales opportunity in healthier food, which will grow 4 per cent annually.Fast-food chains are not immune either. Amid continued criticism of its role in the US obesity epidemic, McDonald’s last month said it would only advertise milk, juice and water with Happy Meals. It would also offer fruit, salads and vegetables as alternatives to fries in value meals. The move followed Burger King’s introduction of reduced-fat, reduced-calorie fries.The restaurants are in part responding to losing higher-income customers to chains such as Chipotle, the fast-growing burrito chain with more than 900 stores, which serve food that is perceived as healthier. Chipotle’s shares are up more than 75 per cent this year, compared with 6.8 per cent for McDonald’s.“It’s really about building their brand perception around healthy and quality ingredients because . . . that’s what gets people into the restaurants,” said Dylan Bolden, of BCG.Recently we’ve seen faster growth in new innovations . . . [with] positive nutritional benefits rather than manufacturers making existing things less badThis is not the first time the food industry has made a health push. SnackWells low-fat cookies, now owned by Mondelez, launched 21 years ago. Low-calorie frozen foods, such as LeanCuisine, have been around even longer.However, some of the products in the industry’s early push were not really healthy at all, according to Bob Goldin, of food industry consultancy Technomic, with lower fat but high levels of sugar or sodium to give them taste.Today, however, it is no longer enough to create “less fat” or “low salt” versions of products.“Recently we’ve seen faster growth in new innovations . . . [with] positive nutritional benefits rather than manufacturers making existing things less bad,” said Mr Wald, citing Chobani and Roll Global’s Wonderful pistachios. They have succeeded by chipping away at the compromise between taste, convenience and health, he said.For PepsiCo’s Ms Nooyi, there is no question that the industry is grappling with serious change. She struck an urgent tone at a conference in New York earlier this year, stressing the need for a solution that brings customers back.“We actually believe that if you let this go too long, in another three or five years the consumer will walk away from [soda],” she said.

192;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-10-16T22:13:53Z;Coke vs Pepsi in EMs: different strategies, same gloom;;"By Luke Smolinski and Pan Kwan YukCoca-Cola and Pepsi are known for their cheery attitudes to the world. Their slogans include: “open happiness”; “life tastes good”; “the best drink created worldwide”.But these days, life is tasting a lot less sweet for the two drinks giants as both struggle with waning growth in key emerging markets.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chief executive, set the tone during the company’s third quarter earnings call with analysts on Tuesday:As we have all noted, emerging markets have become increasingly more volatile, further exacerbating a challenging global landscape. Hence, disposable income and consumer spending have become challenged and consequently have impacted the overall growth of the non-alcohol ready-to-drink industry.For the three months to the end of September, Coke’s net revenues fell 9 per cent in the Pacific region, 4 per cent in Eurasia and Africa and stayed flat in Latin America compared with the same period a year earlier.Pepsi didn’t fare that much better, with revenues and operating profits from its AMEA (Africa, Middle East and Asia) division down 3 per cent and 7 per cent respectively for the third quarter. Drinks sales in Latin America, which are not broken out separately but are instead grouped under PepsiCo Americas Beverages (PAB), were down 2 per cent. Sales at Latin Americas Foods (LAF), Pepsi’s LatAm food unit, were up 9 per cent however.Both companies blame pressure on household income and the sharp decline in EM currencies over the summer – notably in India, Brazil and South Africa – for the revenue drops.Currency headwinds dragged Coke’s EM revenues down by between 6 per cent and 9 per cent. Although EMs account for only about 19 per cent of Coke’s total net operating revenues, they generate around 45 per cent of its pre-tax profits. (Note: the numbers are approximate and are skewed by the fact that Japan, a non EM country, is included in the Pacific division and Eastern Europe is grouped under the Europe unit).At Pepsi, foreign currency translations dented EM revenues by 1 per cent (at PAB), 6 per cent (at LAF) and 7 per cent (at AMEA). As is the case with Coke, it is hard to get a precise breakdown of EM revenue and profit at Pepsi, because LatAm drinks sales are grouped under PAB, which includes the US and Canada, and Eastern Europe is grouped under Europe. However, Pepsi has said in the past that EMs now account for about a third of its group revenues.While Coke remains the global cola leader, Pepsi retains a distinct advantage with its food business, which is arguably the dominant force in the global snack market. Aside from its flagship Pepsi fizzy drinks, the company also produces Doritos and Walkers crisps as well as Quaker Oats porridge, among other staple goods. In periods of unsteady income, consumers are most likely to shun junk food like fizzy drinks for essential goods. This was underscored by the 9 per cent revenue increase at its LAF division.As Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive said on Wednesday:Because we are in the staples business, the swings in our business are probably going to be less than swings you might see in hard goods.There is also a distinction in strategy. In Mexico, China and India, Coke took the bulk of the market in fizzy soft drinks in 2012, according to Mintel, a market research consultancy.As the dominant player in this respect, Coke may be better placed to reduce prices. When asked in Tuesday’s conference call about his plans in EM markets, Kent said pricing was key:We have an incredibly sharp focus on brand price pack channel architecture, new price points, lower price points, more focus on affordability, more focus on returnable packs and smaller packs. Individual packs that help continue to keep the drinkers’ base growing, which is key… when disposable income starts heading north.The response from Pepsi’s Nooyi was the dead opposite. When discussing EM strategy, she said:The thing to be very, very careful about, if you just focus on market share [...] Don’t try to chase pricing down with B brands, local brands, don’t try to hit the pricing so much just to drive volume, because in these volatile times, buying volume is like renting volume.So expect different strategies to the slowdown in growth, but don’t expect too much good cheer.Related reading:

193;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-10-16T15:39:39Z;Americas snack sales boost PepsiCo;;PepsiCo earnings rose in the third quarter as strong sales of its snacks in the US and Latin America helped the company weather continued declines in drink sales.Indra Nooyi, chief executive, said she was “pleased” with PepsiCo’s performance and reiterated its full-year forecast of a 7 per cent increase in core earnings, excluding a 2 per cent decrease from foreign exchange rates.PepsiCo has been under pressure from Nelson Peltz, the activist shareholder, who is pushing for it to buy Mondelez, the Oreo cookie maker, and spin off its less profitable beverage business.The maker of Pepsi, Gatorade and Doritos said profit was 0.6 per cent higher at $1.91bn or $1.23 a share, compared with $1.9bn or $1.21 a share in the same quarter last year.Stripping out one-off items, including restructuring charges and losses on commodity hedges, the company reported core earnings of $1.24 a share, ahead of Wall Street’s expectations of $1.17.Revenue rose 1.5 per cent to $16.91bn from $16.65bn a year ago, but fell short of estimates of $17.02bn. The company benefited from a lower tax rate in the quarter that lifted earnings per share.Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday that the drinks business was “largely in line” with competitors and that “we think that’s enough to satisfy the broader investor base”. The company has argued that its portfolio of snacks and drinks complement each other.Warren Buffett, the largest shareholder in rival Coca-Cola, told CNBC that he disagreed with Mr Peltz’s proposal for the company.“Why break them up?” Mr Buffett said. “I believe in running the company for shareholders that are going to stay, rather than the ones that are going to leave and if you are going to stay as a shareholder of Pepsi I think you like the idea of them having two good businesses.”In the quarter, global food sales volume was up 3 per cent, while beverages rose 1 per cent.Why break them up? I believe in running the company for shareholders that are going to stay, rather than the ones that are going to leaveSales of North American snacks, including Lays crisps and Sabra hummus, climbed 3 per cent, offsetting a 4 per cent decline in Americas drinks volume. That included a “mid single digits” fall in North American soda sales and a “low single digits” drop in non-carbonated drinks, which PepsiCo blamed on competition in bottled water.Mr Johnston said the company had raised drink prices about 3 per cent in the quarter. That did not make up for the sales decline, however, and net revenue for the Americas beverage unit fell 2 per cent. Analysts had expected a 1 per cent increase.The Latin American snack business recorded 3 per cent sales growth, despite difficult economic conditions in many emerging markets including Mexico. In Europe, a 3 per cent gain in snack sales contrasted with a 1 per cent fall in beverages.Both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have struggled with decelerating sales in the US market, where consumers have been drinking less soda for years. Ms Nooyi noted on Wednesday that fizzy drinks now make up 40 per cent of the North American beverage industry, down from more than 50 per cent a decade ago.On Tuesday, Coke reported a 2 per cent rise in North American sales volume.PepsiCo shares rose 2.1 per cent to $82.27 on Wednesday morning in New York.
194;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;EM headwinds to sweep through Q3 earnings season;;"It was only two paragraphs long. But the fallout from a surprise sales warning issued by Unilever last week was anything but minor.Shares in consumer goods companies across Europe and the US all fell after Unilever warned that weak growth in emerging markets, exacerbated by currency weakness in countries from India to Indonesia and Brazil, would result in underlying sales growth of 3 to 3.5 per cent for the third-quarter. This compares with growth of 5 per cent reported during the first two quarters of the year.In Europe, Nestlé, SABMiller and Heineken were among those whose shares took a knock.This from Barclays:With European consumer staples stocks deriving 50 percent of profit from emerging markets, the downside risk to earnings of a significant growth slowdown in these areas could be material. The dark sky just got darker.Among US consumer staples companies, shares in Coca-Cola, Pepsi and McDonald’s all fell.Indeed, expect the emerging market slowdown and currency headwinds to be a recurring theme among companies in the US and Europe as the third-quarter earnings season kicks off this week.The sharp sell-off in EM currencies from May this year meant companies had to decide whether to pass on local price rises to squeezed consumers or lose margins on each sale. Either option will have hit profits this quarter.Carrefour said during its half year results in August that the weakness of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso against the euro would lead to a slight reduction in its guidance for full-year recurring operating profit.Elsewhere, L’Oréal told investors in August that currency swings could dent full-year sales by 3.6 per cent while Adidas warned that the weakening of currencies such as the Russian rouble, the Japanese yen, the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso in August and September would affect its third-quarter results.But it’s not just western companies that will feel the pinch. Companies in emerging markets will also affected.Latin America gave a hint of the potential damage to balance sheets during the last earnings season. As Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted last month, revenues and earnings growth for the basket of LatAm companies that it tracks were much lower in dollar terms:With over 90% of the 125 corporate bond issuers we track in Latin America having reported 2Q results to date, we see that aggregated revenues are up 3.9% YoY, while EBITDA is up 2.9% YoY – both in USD terms… In local currency terms, the results are somewhat more positive, with revenues up by 6.7% and EBITDA up by 6.6% YoY. This underscores the importance of weaker currencies in 2Q13 when compared with the same period in 2Q12.While a weaker currency can be a blessing for exporters that have dollar-based revenues and costs in local currencies, it can be a millstone round the necks of those that don’t.Among EM companies most at risk from the currency sell-off this year are Brazil’s Petrobras and airlines such as Gol of Brazil and Kingfisher of India.Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company, is in many ways caught between a rock and a hard place. As an oil company, Petrobras should in theory be protected against a rising dollar given that oil prices are denominated in dollars. But Petrobras has to pay global prices in US dollars for imports of refined products but sell domestically in local currency at artificially low prices. Plus it has a massive pile of dollar debt; its debt servicing costs have increased in the wake of the real’s more than 7 per cent decline against the dollar this year.Petrobras only reported a rise in Q2 profit thanks to its adoption of “hedge accounting” rules to limit the impact of a stronger dollar on its foreign currency debt. Without that accounting change, it would have posted its second quarterly loss in a year.From Petrobras’s Q2 results statement:Net finance expense of R$ 3,551 million, due to the impact of the depreciation of the Real against the U.S. dollar (10% impact) on net debt, affected by the lower foreign exchange exposure due to the extension of the hedge accounting practice to our future exports as from the middle of May, that avoided a R$ 7,982 million reduction in our financial results.Elsewhere, airlines in emerging markets are struggling to maintain profitability amid rising dollar prices for jet fuel. This is less of a headache for carriers with lots of international routes that yield revenues in dollars or euros but it is a big problem for companies like Gol, which operate mainly in local markets.“The currency is now, by far, the main problem for Gol,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, head strategist at Futura Corretora brokerage, told Bloomberg. “It was already struggling to boost profitability before the currency plunge, with sales declining. Things are even worse now.”Related reading:

195;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-09-26T19:30:08Z;Multinationals beach tax bills in Spanish shells;;A rented office overlooking a dusty rail track near Madrid’s airport was until recently the workplace of what would appear to be the most productive worker in all of Spain.From here a single employee presided over a company that from 2009 to 2011 made €9.9bn of net profits, all while earning an annual salary of only €55,000.The person was working for ExxonMobil Spain SL, a holding company for the world’s largest oil group by value, which for several years used a relatively unknown part of Spanish tax law to transfer billions of euros from foreign subsidiaries to the US, helping to significantly reduce its tax bill.Exxon’s Spanish subsidiary was structured as a so-called ETVE, a type of holding company used by many multinationals, including Hewlett-Packard, Pepsi, Eli Lilly, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Vodafone.In some cases, the vehicles are used as highly tax efficient ­conduits to transfer profits from foreign subsidiaries to parent companies far away from Madrid. While some ETVEs are combined with large operations in Spain, others are shadow companies that operate for only a few years before being quietly shut down. In 2008 Exxon seemed to have left Spain for good, selling its Iberian business to Portugal’s Galp Energia. However, a small trace of the US oil company remained in the form of an ETVE.According to the ETVE’s 2009 accounts, Exxon was able to transfer €3.6bn of dividends from its unit in Luxembourg to Spain. A dividend of €2.26bn was then paid on to its US parent without incurring withholding taxes that it would typically have to pay when moving money outside of the EU.No tax was paid in Spain, with this process repeated up to 2011 on profits totalling €9.9bn – more than half the combined net profits of Spain’s 35 biggest listed companies in 2012.Exxon declined to provide further details of the arrangement but transfers from a Luxembourg company to the US would have typically been subject to a withholding tax. Last year, after attracting the attention of Spanish tax authorities, Exxon quietly closed down the operation.Exxon said that ExxonMobil Spain SL’s income consisted entirely of dividend income paid by its affiliates and that the holding company “complied with all the requirements of Spanish tax laws, filed all tax returns and paid all taxes due”.Exxon added its use of an ETVE was “a legal and straightforward means to efficiently manage capital while avoiding double taxation” and that the dividends had already been taxed in the jurisdictions where they were earned. It said its Luxembourg holding was exempt from withholding tax to the US.“Normally you would have to pay a 10 per cent withholding tax at source to send profits to the US,” says Enrique Chinchilla, a professor of financial management at the IESE business school.Spain introduced the ETVE in the mid-1990s to encourage foreign investment, and better compete with Luxembourg and Holland for international companies seeking tax-efficient European holding structures.It also allowed for foreign companies to take advantage of Spain’s strong network of bilateral tax treaties with countries in Latin America, such as Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, which can offer more favourable tax rates than other countries.Once the ETVE has been established all overseas dividends that are paid into it are exempt from tax in Spain, and can be easily moved on to a final destination, providing a small number of conditions have been met.Most importantly, corporation tax must have been paid in the country of origin on the dividends being transferred, and companies using ETVEs to house shareholdings in foreign subsidiaries must not be resident in any country identified by Spain as a tax haven.ETVEs must then also have been established for at least 12 months before transfers can take place, have a minimum investment in their overseas assets of €6m, and should have a material presence in Spain in the form of offices and employees.In practice, as the example of Exxon’s Spanish unit with its single employee shows, the need for a material presence in Spain can be interpreted in different ways. Many Spanish ETVEs are little more than nameplates on rented office spaces in Madrid administrated by outside lawyers and accountants.A quick glance at the company accounts of Latin America South Investment SL, also known as Linthal Spain Holding, may not give much away about what the company really does.Although a Spanish company, Linthal’s board meetings take place in Buenos Aires, and it appears to have no employees in Spain. Its registered offices in 2009 were at the same address as offices registered to its auditor in Spain, PwC, later moving to a building shared by a Riojan cultural centre in Madrid’s upmarket Calle Serrano.In fact, Linthal is an ETVE used by Ambev, a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the Belgian-based brewer, to distribute dividends from several Latin American beer brands, such as Argentina’s Quilmes and Cervecería Boliviana Nacional, to its holding company in Brazil.According to its 2009 accounts, Linthal made €87.2m profits, on which it did not pay tax in Spain. The company has not filed accounts since 2010.The FT examines how and why governments help companies reduce their tax burdenAnheuser-Busch InBev said Linthal had been set up “to provide an investment vehicle for Latin American projects in a stable European business environment” and Spain was chosen as “there is a bilateral agreement in place between Argentina and Spain, so double taxation of the income streams could be avoided”. Corporation tax had already been paid on the profits at a local level.Spanish tax lawyers working for multinational corporations are reluctant to publicly discuss their clients. But they said that in their experience few companies had been questioned by the Spanish government over whether their investment in Spain was sufficient to justify their ETVE’s tax exempt status.While the centre-right government of Mariano Rajoy has pledged to tighten surveillance to prevent abuse of Spanish tax laws, Madrid seems content to continue with a regime that allows Spain to lure more holding companies away from Holland and Luxembourg.For now, it appears Spain’s most productive employees will continue to work away in the shadows, watching billions of euros briefly pass through small rented offices across Madrid before being sent on to a final destination far away.
196;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Aramark files to relist in New York;;Aramark, the global food and concession provider for facilities ranging from stadiums to prisons, has filed to return to the US public market six years after it was taken private by buyout groups for $8.3bn.The Philadelphia-based company plans to use the proceeds from the offering, which will include primary and secondary shares, to pay back some of its $6.1bn of net debt.The filing did not disclose the expected size or timing for the initial public offering, but a person familiar with the matter said the IPO was intended to raise more than $700m and to take place later this year.Aramark provides food services and catering at stadiums, hospitals, schools and universities. The company, which generated $13.5bn in revenues and $104m in net profits last year, employs about 250,000 people and operates in 22 countries.The deal is expected to mark the start of an exit for Goldman Sachs’ private equity arm, Warburg Pincus and Thomas H Lee, which acquired the company in January 2007 and each hold a 21 per cent stake.The take-private that year was led by Joseph Neubauer, then the company’s chief executive, who holds about a 10 per cent stake. JPMorgan Partners and CCMP Capital Investors also each own about 10 per cent and participated in the acquisition, which included about $2bn of Aramark’s debt.The valuation that Aramark receives from investors will determine the amount of secondary shares offered, from which the company is not expected to receive any proceeds. The sponsors plan to sell down their holdings in subsequent placements following the IPO.The IPO represents a big moment in the career of Eric Foss, Aramark’s chief executive, who for many years was a top deputy to Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive. Mr Foss was brought in last year with the aim of returning Aramark to the public markets.Mr Foss retired from Pepsi in 2011 amid a management shake-up following several years of declining market share in its sparkling beverage business. He had been widely seen as a potential successor to Ms Nooyi, but left the company after overseeing the integration of its bottling operations.Mr Foss had been chief executive of Pepsi Bottling Group from 2006 to 2010 and spent 30 years at the company.“We continue to grow our existing business and win exciting new clients, including Airbus, the Ohio and Michigan departments of corrections, American University, the Minnesota Vikings, the Chicago Bears, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,” the company said in the filing.The company disposed of its remaining stake in Seamless, the mobile and online service for ordering takeaway food, which it acquired in 2006, last year. It paid shareholders a dividend of $712m in 2011.Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley are underwriting the offering. The company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange.
197;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Mexico’s bottled water addiction;;"Mexico is not only one of the world’s biggest soda drinking nations. It also has an apparently unquenchable thirst for bottled water.According to a study from Inter-American Development Bank, the country has the world’s highest per capita consumption of bottled water, with Mexicans using on average about 127 gallons (480 litres) of bottled water per person in 2011. That’s more than four times the per capita level of consumption in the US.Whether it be giant canisters of water delivered by truck – despite officially safe drinking water, at least in Mexico City – or small bottles of water on sale in shops, it’s a booming market for the big drinks businesses. Danone, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, in that order, dominate the market – and profits are set to keep on flowing.Indeed, Mexico, which consumes on average some 7.2bn gallons of bottled water a year, is one of the world’s biggest markets for a commodity that westerners take for granted will emerge safely from a tap.In Mexico, though, some 15m people lack access to running water. The average Mexican monthly spend on bottled water is 240 pesos ($18) – out of reach of people on a minimum wage that can be as low as 61.38 pesos a day.Nonetheless, as Ana Trulin, an analyst in Mexico City with Euromonitor, told Forbes:Soft drinks are no longer such a great business in Mexico. Water is the big profitmaker.Value-wise, analysts reckon Mexican bottled-water sales could hit $13bn by 2015 and surpass the US to become the world’s largest market.Mexico’s government is due to unveil a tax reform on Sunday that could slap VAT (sales tax) on food and drinks. That might help combat Mexico’s soft drink-fuelled obesity epidemic. But profits from bottled H2O look set to keep running like water.Related reading:

She has an MBA in finance from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and has served as a non-executive director for the London Development Agency, which closed in 2012.In her spare time, Ms Wheaton enjoys running, skiing, hiking and visiting art museums.1. Who are your business influences?The standouts for me are: My first boss at Morgan Stanley. She was an exceptionally smart woman who was never afraid to ask the seemingly stupid questions; The leader at PepsiCo who introduced the “upside down triangle” organisation chart with the customer-facing staff at the top and the senior executives at the bottom. (It was quite controversial in the early 1990s); My chief executive officer at Mitchells & Butlers who managed to get a mix of executives with very different skills, perspectives and temperaments to work well together by having a common, worthwhile goal. And finally, my mentor on the FTSE 100 Mentoring Scheme, who reminded me I would one day make a better non-executive director if I continue to build my experience as an executive.2. What is an average day at work like?Since I am new to the higher education sector, I have spent a lot of time getting to know not only our staff and students but also learning about the landscape, challenges and opportunities by meeting key stakeholders such as policy makers and regulators.3. What is the best piece of advice given to you by a teacher?It was from my university tutor, who encouraged me to get a passport and get on a plane for two terms of study at the London School of Economics.4. What is your biggest lesson learnt?Don’t try to do everything yourself; harness the talents, enthusiasm and energy of others. And don’t be afraid to work with smarter, functional or technical experts. You just have to be happy to ask the occasional ‘stupid question’.5. What is the worst job you have ever had?Removing tassels from row after row of corn in a field one hot summer in central Pennsylvania – as good a motivator as any to do well in school.6. What advice would you give to women in business?Same advice as I give anyone. Think about what you want to be when you “grow up”. Look for opportunities to hone your skills and talents; occasionally get out of your comfort zone. Seek honest feedback. Make sure you identify and address your gaps and weaknesses en route. Take others with you. Don’t take yourself too seriously.7. What is the last book you read?Quiet by Susan Cain. It is about the power of introverts in a world that can’t stop talking.8. What is your favourite business book?There are two and both are remarkably corny, but have a meaningful message. The first is Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi. It’s about building networks. The other is Gung Ho! by Ken Blanchard. It’s about improving staff engagement by identifying a common goal, being clear what the rules are and celebrating success.9. If you could do it all again, what would you do differently?Nothing, besides doing more exercise in my 30s. I am making up for it now.10. What is your plan B?This is my plan B – after so many years in large, corporate organisations, I wanted to work in a sector which is very important and where I hope my skills can support the development of a great higher education institution."
199;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-08-16T18:19:08Z;Activists keep fighting despite setbacks;;A year ago the name of Bill Ackman was a threat, the polite but firm knock at the door which meant life for sleepy executives would never be the same again.Last summer the activist investor had arrived on the doorstep of Procter & Gamble – not only the world’s largest consumer goods company, but one famed for the managerial competence of “the P&G way”.Shareholders rushed to imagine the feats that his hedge fund, Pershing Square, could accomplish. Stock market investors were restless, rebelling over boardroom pay, frustrated by lacklustre profits since the financial crisis and willing to fall in behind rabble rousers who would voice their concerns.So, fresh from a sweeping victory to take over the board at Canadian Pacific Railway, Mr Ackman’s expectation that he could influence a $200bn company was par for the course.Activists had also set their eyes on another giant, PepsiCo, while the veteran raider Carl Icahn and Barry Rosenstein of the hedge fund Jana Partners spent their time deciding which companies should be broken apart.Now, however, the picture is far more muddied, with a string of setbacks raising the question of whether the wider shareholder enthusiasm for activism that gives agitators their power has begun to wane.Mr Ackman eventually forced out the chief executive of P&G in May this year, but this week he departed from the board of JC Penney, with Howard Schultz’s criticism that he was a “destroyer of companies” still ringing in his ears.Mr Schultz, the Starbucks founder and chief executive, had hit back at Mr Ackman’s criticism of his fellow board member Mike Ullman, who is also serving as the department store chain’s interim chief executive.Mr Ullman, a former head of JC Penney, had been brought back to save the company after a radical turnround championed by Mr Ackman ended in a disaster of collapsing sales and deep losses. Other agitators have also been shown to be human. Mr Rosenstein lost a close and bitterly fought campaign for seats on the board of Agrium, a Canadian fertiliser company. Mr Icahn has so far failed to disrupt the proposed $24bn buyout of Dell, which he argues undervalues the computer maker.One reason for the change may simply be that shareholder discontent has ebbed with every day that the stock market has risen. It is far harder to round up a mob when the US stock market is near an all-time high.The grey-haired Bill Ackman is a master of show business: 26 times he has taken his brand of activism to the stock-owning public, and with each spectacle he has grown Pershing Square, his $13bn hedge fund, into a firm to be reckoned with.In a risky business it is natural that the ringmaster might sometimes find a lion gnawing on his ankle instead of jumping through hoops. Yet the failure at JC Penney, where Mr Ackman this week resigned from the board, is different in character to the two previous setbacks the investor has suffered.At Target, where Pershing unveiled a special single stock fund in 2007 and then lost a hard-fought proxy campaign in 2009, his investors lost their stake when derivative bets expired worthless.He could at least claim the failure came because the retailer didn’t follow his advice: to sell its credit card business and to spin out its property portfolio as a separate company.Similarly, at the troubled bookstore chain Borders, where Pershing took a stake in 2006, and agreed to finance a mooted buyout of Barnes & Noble in 2010, its eventual bankruptcy was always a danger.JC Penney, however, embraced the Ackman plan. The stock market and bank analysts did as well, but it was the investor who became the face of the disaster as sales collapsed and losses piled up.Boardrooms have a ready-made reason to turn down his next transformation scheme, yet investors have stood by the showman. In a matter of weeks this summer Pershing raised capital for a new special purpose vehicle, one that does not use derivatives. This allowed Ackman to make his biggest bet: a $2.2bn stake in Air products.Roll up, roll up! The show is still on the road.When Nelson Peltz, co-founder of investment firm Trian Partners, recently unveiled his bold plan for PepsiCo to first supersize itself with a $60bn purchase of Mondelez, a multinational snack business, and then split itself in two, shareholder enthusiasm was muted: the stock had that week already hit a record high.There have also been reminders that the frontiers of activism remain largely limited to Anglo-Saxon-style regulatory regimes with strong shareholder rights. Dan Loeb, the founder of hedge fund Third Point, last year triumphed at Yahoo with a campaign of sharply written letters that ousted its chief executive.This year he sent some rather more polite missives to Sony, encouraging it to list a small part of its entertainment business. The company, one of the most international of the Japanese conglomerates, used an equally polite letter to say no. Similarly, TCI, the activist hedge fund, faces a challenge in its attempt to force EADS, the European aerospace group, to sell one of its most sensitive assets, a €4bn stake in Dassault Aviation.For all the validity of its arguments about returns, shareholders may be less important than the role of France’s socialist government.Yet, judged by activity at least, activists have been almost as busy as they were last year. In the first half of 2012 there were 129 companies worldwide targeted by 78 activist firms in a public campaign, according to Activist Insight, a data provider. This year 76 activist manifestos landed on the doorsteps of 127 boardrooms.Like most hedge funds trading equities, activists have trailed a rising stock market this year, but they are ahead the head of the pack as a group, up 13.4 per cent at the end of July, according to the data provider HFR, versus a less than 5 per cent gain for the average hedge fund.Some campaigns have been concluded quietly. Jana Partners quietly approached Oil States International and persuaded it to split into an oilfield services group, and a property specialist offering accommodation to workers near remote mines and drilling sites. The money is still there to fund campaigns, with $84bn of assets managed by dedicated activist hedge funds, according to HFR, a data provider. This is up from $47bn three years ago. “There is just a built-in supply of activism,” says Chris Young, head of contested situations for Credit Suisse.Furthermore Mr Icahn, a longtime adversary of Mr Ackman, is prepared to say in public what others will only say in private: “The setbacks are Ackman’s, not with activism.”Mr Icahn puts his success down to a simple formula: “If we get control, we find the right person to run the company, make sure he knows he’s accountable, and don’t try to micro manage what he does.”Nonetheless, after losses on JC Penney and his so-far unsuccessful short selling campaign against the nutritional supplement direct seller Herbalife, Mr Ackman’s own investors are still making money, if not nearly as much as the rise in the stock market.And there is more to come from the activist crowd in the autumn as they eye deadlines to nominate directors for new year elections.Mr Young says: “For every public fight there are three or four situations where clients have received private letters from activists, threatening to escalate if they don’t get what they want”.
200;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-08-09T05:53:33Z;Cadbury India: A new factory, and this time it’s for real;;"Cadbury India, part of the $35bn Mondelez International group, is setting up its biggest plant in the Asia Pacific region. And it has chosen the south eastern state of Andhra Pradesh for it. That’s a huge chunk of investment – especially since the plant appears to be real this time.Earlier this year, Cadbury was in trouble with the Indian government for allegedly dodging $46m of taxes by claiming to produce chocolate in a made up factory. It was part of a wider crackdown on tax collection in this country.But the company doesn’t seem to be put off by its experience in India – the constant complaints we hear from investors about regulatory flip-flop, red tape, land acquisition and the rest – as it plans to invest Rs10bn ($165m) in this new facility.“After evaluating several options and based on our own internal business needs, we decided to invest in Andhra Pradesh, in Sri City… a unique world-class integrated business city with access to multiple logistics hubs.Sri City, the largest private Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in India, is located near Chennai and is already home to some of India’s biggest FMCG brands, such PepsiCo and Colgate Palmolive. It offers an organised road system, a large and growing power network, efficient water supply, and telecom connectivity developed by the likes of Reliance and Aircel. A planned settlement with residential block and healthcare and entertainment facilities should help to attract employees.This is the sort of business environment, in terms of regulation and amenities, that India doesn’t offer often enough. This is a particular shame for a flailing economy with an unsustainable current account deficit, which is desperate to draw investment.Cadbury India, which already has facilities in Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh itself, has taken a 134 acre plot in the SEZ and expects to complete the project by 2020, creating almost 1,600 direct jobs.The Indian group’s revenues have grown from Rs7.5bn in 2005 to Rs 40.7bn in 2012, so the expansion seems logical.And news of the upcoming plant was closely followed by another titbit for FMCG watchers. Remember Manu Anand, the president of PepsiCo India who stepped down unexpectedly in June as the drinks company lost market share to Coca-Cola despite splashing out on IPL sponsorship? Well, he is the new president of Cadbury for India and South Asia.Sharing locations and top personnel? It’s getting incestuous in India’s FMCG sector.Related reading:

201;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-08-07T23:05:15Z;Mondelez raises buyback to $6bn;;Mondelez International has approved a $4.8bn boost to its share buyback programme as the global snacks group spun out of Kraft Foods faces calls from activist investor Nelson Peltz to merge with PepsiCo.The owner of the Trident, Cadbury and Oreo brands said on Wednesday it had authorised a rise in its share repurchase programme from $1.2bn to $6bn up until 2016, and raised its quarterly dividend 8 per cent.Mondelez reported second quarter net income of $616m, or 34 cents a diluted share, down from $1.03bn, or 58 cents a share, during the same period last year.After stripping out the contribution from Kraft Foods grocery business, Mondelez’ earnings rose nearly 26 per cent, on barely changed revenue of just under $8.6bn.Excluding special items, the company earned 37 cents a share, against expectations of 34 cents.Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive, split the company last year and stayed on to run the larger international snacks group.Mondelez has since become the target of Mr Peltz, who has launched a public campaign urging PepsiCo to merge its snacks business with Mondelez. Mr Peltz has taken billion-dollar stakes in both companies.Mondelez has struggled since the split, with Ms Rosenfeld acknowledging early “executional missteps” in Brazil and Russia, markets which are central to the company’s emerging markets focused strategy.Mistakes on pricing in developing markets, as well as a struggling gum business, have been reflected in the company’s shares, which are down over 24 per cent since the company split on October 1.The company has insisted that its struggles will subside, and remains bullish about its future because of its large emerging markets footprint. “If there’s a challenge there, it’s that we’re seeing our categories slow a little bit in response to the slowdown in GDP,” Ms Rosenfeld said. “But the good news is we have continued [to maintain market] share.”The group said it would “fast-track” a number of emerging markets investments that had been planned for the future, including efforts to improve distribution and marketing, along with new plants in China, Mexico and India. Capital expenditures will increase from about 4 per cent of revenues to about 5 per cent.The company reaffirmed its full-year operating earnings guidance of $1.55-$1.60 per share, and maintained its guidance for full-year organic net revenue growth at the low end of its 5-7 per cent range.The quarter ended June was the third full one in which Mondelez operated as an independent company. Last week Kraft Foods reported second-quarter net income of $829m, or $1.38 a share, up from $603m, or $1.02 a share, in the previous year.Mondelez shares rose 2.5 per cent in after-market trading to $32.05.This story has been amended to reflect reader’s comments.
202;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
203;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-08-02T17:43:31Z;The joys of going it alone;In almost every medium, it seems independence is finding a way;"At first, when you scan the cultural landscape, it seems like everything is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Times are tough – we all know that: only the strong will survive. For strong, read big. And not just big: huge.How will publishers counter the might of Amazon, which recently reported sales of $15.7bn in three months? By mustering their regiments into one giant army: the merger of Penguin and Random House will mean a single company controlling a quarter of the world’s book market. Last week it was announced that two of the biggest global advertising agencies, Publicis and Omnicom, are considering a merger– which, if it went ahead, would mean the same company trying to sell us both Pepsi and Coke, a conflict that makes the agonies over the Sunkist/Ocean Spray accounts in last season’s Mad Men look like pretty small potatoes.And yet, once you lay these huge tiles out on the table, a funny thing happens: there’s more room to move between them. In almost every medium, it seems, independence is finding a way. Last week I found myself chatting to musician Chris Wood, whose new album None the Wiser is just out. Wood is a star of English folk – and indeed the growing prominence of folk in the music industry, from Mumford & Sons down, speaks of an audience more interested in exploration than the big record companies give them credit for. Wood’s song “One in a Million”, written with Hugh Lupton, won Best Original Song at the BBC2 Folk Awards in 2006; his work on Cold Haily Rainy Night with The Imagined Village helped that win Best Traditional Song in 2008.Wood started his own label, RUF Records, in 1992, then merged it into his wider project the English Acoustic Collective: he controls his own music. “I was courted by various labels when I started out,” he says. “I went to see them with my dad – he couldn’t believe his ears. They were asking for everything and offering a maybe.”That initial refusal to sign, more than two decades ago, was a financial one; but of course it’s an artistic decision too. “Can I get to sleep at night knowing I’ve signed over a year’s work to someone I don’t trust? Obviously the answer’s no,” Wood says wryly.He knows that the business model for the music industry is changing: as with the publishing industry, there is no model but a brave new world. Spotify is great for the consumer but not so great for artists, whose income from streaming can be measured in fractions of cents. We don’t know what the new business model will be, Wood says, “but it will be the artists who lead the way. Adele is off Spotify, Tom Waits is off Spotify: they’ve had a good hard look and seen that it’s not sustainable.”The question is what “sustainable” really means. For huge companies such as Penguin Random House – which now controls nearly 250 separate imprints – sustainable means a very big number indeed: which is in part why David Fickling, founder of David Fickling Books, has chosen (amicably, he stresses) to part company with Random House, under whose auspices he’s worked for the past dozen years.…Fickling, with his distinctive bow tie and determinedly energetic manner, is a transformational figure in publishing, the man who stuck with Philip Pullman for years before the success of his His Dark Materials trilogy brought global renown; the man who discovered Mark Haddon and believed that The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time could be read by both children and adults.A week ago I paid a visit to Fickling’s pleasingly ramshackle Oxford office, where he and his managing director, author and editor Simon Mason were contemplating their new-found independence. On a sunny day among the dreaming spires, it was hard to imagine a better working environment. Fickling’s daughter Rosie was manning the phones; the staff of his reborn comic The Phoenix were beavering away next door.Fickling, with a laugh at his own pretension, is fond of quoting Einstein: “The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honours the servant and has forgotten the gift.” That gift, for him, is not the success of authors he’s already championed, but the discovery of new authors, and the ability to stick with them through thick and thin. “If your default position is huge commercial success”, Fickling says, “that’s not necessarily the default position for making good things.”He doesn’t scorn commercial success – far from it – but seeks the success that comes from supporting original talent. In the world of film, consider the trajectory of Fruitvale Station, the true-life drama of Oscar Grant, a young man wrongfully shot by police in Oakland, California. An independent debut from director Ryan Coogler, it was made for less than $1m, and the Trayvon Martin verdict makes it a timely release. It took Best First Film at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, and last weekend screenings were expanded to more than 1,000 screens in the US. It’s already heading past the $5m mark. Readers, listeners and viewers are hungry for independence and originality; increasingly, they know how to seek it out for themselves. A real revolution is well under way.——————————————-Peter Aspden is awayTo hear a podcast of this column, visit www.ft.com/culturecast"
204;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-07-29T15:13:50Z;Golden Wonder’s ‘third in line’ stunt;The crisp company combined two British obsessions, writes Andrew Bounds;"Territory: UK
Agency: Bottle
Verdict: 4/5A prince’s birth provides a rare opportunity for publicity. And since William arrived 31 years ago, the internet and social media have transformed the speed and sophistication with which advertisers can move.Ryanair, the no-frills airline, offered free flights to infants booked on July 23, the day after the royal birth, with the slogan “Ryan-heir.” Coca-Cola used its current personalised bottles campaign to feature a toast between two bottles marked “Wills” and “Kate”.But it was a small potato crisp brand that earned the crown for capturing the mood of the event. Golden Wonder, owned by Northern Irish foodmaker Tayto Group, sent its packet-shaped mascots to hand out a free bag of crisps to anyone queueing third in line – as Prince George is to the throne. In doing so, it married two British institutions: the royal family and the queue.Crisp bags were handed out at cash machines, shops and even lavatories (dubbed “the throne” in British slang).It was a relatively small stunt, with the same people featuring in some publicity shots because of a shortage of those willing to sign consent forms. But the campaign relied on being spread via Facebook and Twitter rather than its scale. This is a smart approach for a brand that dominated the market in the 1980s but lacks the marketing muscle of PepsiCo, which owns market leader Walkers."
205;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-07-28T06:04:43Z;Activist investors target bigger companies;Activist shareholders are building up stakes in larger, high-profile businesses;Activist investors are building up stakes in larger, high-profile companies. Large companies are twice as likely to be targeted by activists as in 2010.Global activist shareholders stepped up investments in companies with a market capitalisation of more than $10bn by 104 per cent between January 2010 and the end of June, according to Activist Insight, the data provider.The findings come as Nelson Peltz, the activist investor and founder of investment firm Trian Partners, called for a shake-up at PepsiCo earlier this month, urging the US drinks group to merge its snack business with Mondelez, the snacks group spun out of Kraft Foods, in a $60bn deal.Dell shareholders, including activist investor Carl Icahn, also voiced dissatisfaction earlier this month over the terms of a proposed buyout offer, which led to the PC maker postponing its shareholder vote.“The past few years have seen increased support for activists among other shareholders and an increase in the level of activist fundraising. As a result, activists are building significant stakes in much larger companies,” said Kerry Pogue, managing director at Activist Insight.About 60 public campaigns by activists, all still running, were initiated this year, although fewer are expected to be launched during the rest of 2013. A trend to focus on fewer companies when launching campaigns, drawing in several activists at the same time to gain muscle, is beginning to emerge.Out of 57 companies where global activists initiated public action in the second quarter of this year, over 10 per cent had more than one activist involved.Between April and June, the most popular strategy among global activist investors was to try and gain seats on company boards. Twenty-five attempts were made.Proposals for share repurchase campaigns comprised 12 per cent of their activity during the same period.
206;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-07-25T19:29:55Z;Brands pay £100m for music endorsements as performers get savvy;;UK musicians earned more than £100m from product endorsements and major brand tie-ins for the first time last year – in a sign that artists are becoming more commercially savvy as they grapple with the decline in CD sales.Artist endorsements – such as Madonna’s backing of a Smirnoff vodka line and One Direction’s deal to become the face of Pepsi – were one of the fastest-growing sources of performers’ income, rising by a third.The figures are a boost for the music industry, which suffered more than a decade of declining music sales until last year, when global recorded music industry revenues rose for the first time since 1999 thanks to digital revenue.“There has been an increasing recognition recently of the power of music to add value for brands,” said Robert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, the collecting agency which backed the research.Overall commercial tie-ups – including Volkswagen’s sponsorship of the Channel 4 series Abbey Road Studios, which featured performances from musicians such as Paul Weller – generated £104.8m in 2012. That represented a rise of 6 per cent from the previous year, despite a fall in sponsorship of live events, induced partly by the Olympics.“Artists, agents and labels are looking for incremental ways in which they can develop revenues,” said Howard Davies, a partner at Deloitte. “It’s been driven as much from the music industry as it is by brands. It definitely feels like hard work, but I’m encouraged by the degree of experimentation.”Commercial tie-ups tend to offer artists upfront payments, rather than the drip-feed of royalties generated by streaming services. But they have not been without hitches, with Smirnoff accused of targeting underage drinkers through its partnership with Madonna. The vodka maker was cleared after the Advertising Standards Authority ruled the singer’s age meant she was unlikely to appeal strongly to under 18s.
207;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-07-24T20:20:43Z;PepsiCo makes case against break-up in results;;PepsiCo’s profits rose in the second quarter as it raised prices and increased sales while cutting costs, results that the company said bolstered its case for keeping its snacks and drinks businesses together.Net income at the maker of Mountain Dew and Doritos rose 35 per cent to $2.01bn, or $1.28 a share, from $1.49bn, or 94 cents a share last year. On the basis preferred by the company and analysts, core profits rose to $1.31 a share from $1.12 a year ago, including gains from the sale of Vietnam bottling operations. That blew past Wall Street’s estimates of $1.19.Revenue grew 2.1 per cent to $16.8bn from $16.5bn, in line with expectations, as stronger food sales offset weak drinks performance in the US and Europe.The results came as chief executive Indra Nooyi has been pushing back against calls from activist investor Nelson Peltz to break up PepsiCo’s snacks and soda businesses. Ms Nooyi said she was “pleased” with the results and hailed the strength of the company’s “diverse but highly complementary portfolio of brands and products”.The company said its range of products, from Tropicana juices and Gatorade sports drinks to Quaker oatmeal and Lay’s potato crisps, enabled it to improve its results in the quarter despite a cold, wet spring that damped sales of rival Coca-Cola’s beverages.“The portfolio is what enables you to power through these things,” Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, told CNBC on Wednesday.However, Ms Nooyi acknowledged that PepsiCo faces structural difficulties in its largest drinks market. “The fact remains that the beverage category in the US has its challenges, especially [carbonated soft drinks],” she said.Global drinks sales volumes rose 1.5 per cent, while snacks were up 3 per cent.Beverage sales in the Americas fell 3.5 per cent, with North American sales dropping to the mid-single digits. As a result, the division’s revenue fell 2 per cent. Drinks sales were flat in Europe.By contrast, the Americas food business showed 2 per cent sales growth combined with price increases to help boost revenue 5 per cent, continuing the trend of higher demand for salty snacks and offsetting the impact of falling US soft drink consumption.International growth was also strong, with revenue rising 6 per cent in Asia, the Middle East and Africa as snacks and beverages sales volume rose 6 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.On a call with investors, Ms Nooyi reiterated her resistance to Mr Peltz’s push for PepsiCo to combine its fast-growing snacks business with Oreo and Cadbury maker Mondelez and spin off its slow-growth beverage division.“We do not need large-scale M&A to achieve our financial goals,” she said.Mr Johnston also rebuffed Mr Peltz’s plan, telling CNBC: “The complexity of taking on an $80bn acquisition and somehow trying to do all that integration, frankly, will distract the business from doing what it is that we’re doing right now, which is creating a lot of value for shareholders.”The company maintained its full-year outlook for a 7 per cent rise in earnings on a core currency basis, but said it now expects foreign exchange fluctuations to shave 2 percentage points from profits, higher than an earlier forecast of 1 percentage point.After earlier pressure from investors to split up food and drinks, Ms Nooyi last year announced a “reset” that saw the company increase advertising and marketing spending on its biggest brands while trimming costs.“We take this as evidence last year’s rebasing is working, producing broadly improved revenue trends,” said Mark Swartzberg, Stifel analyst, on Wednesday.PepsiCo has said it is considering restructuring its underperforming North American beverage business, which has lost share to Coca-Cola in recent years, and will update investors in February. Analysts say options include a spin-off of the unit or new distribution deals with independent bottlers.The company’s shares closed down 0.65 per cent at $85.64.
208;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;The food companies that make people fat;‘Traffic light’ labelling to identify healthier products is the best way to fight obesity;There was an end-of-term exuberance as the London Business School soon-to-be MBAs delivered their final presentations.I chaired a panel discussion while the students waited to hear which of their groups had won the prize for the best “business solutions to obesity” proposal.The winning idea involved people putting money into an online pot, which would be shared by those meeting a weight-loss target.Given the subject, and the opportunity to mingle with the graduating class of Europe’s highest-ranked business school, I expected both my panel and the competition judges to be packed with food industry executives. Who better to adjudicate on the best business solutions to obesity?There wasn’t a single person from the food industry. My panel consisted of two LBS teachers and an executive of Bupa, the private health insurer. The judges came from health think-tanks, consultancies and hospitals.The food companies had been invited, I was told, but had said that they couldn’t make it.I should not have been surprised. The industry is badly split. Some food companies can talk with pride about combating obesity. Others, including some that boast about their ethical behaviour, have every reason to hide their embarrassment.The UK government last month announced the companies that had signed up to a voluntary scheme to introduce “traffic light” labelling on the front of food packaging. The labels provide a quick red, amber or green guide to calories and to fat, saturated fat, salt and sugar levels.The large supermarket groups said they would use traffic lights, but this applies only to their own brands, not those of outside manufacturers.Of the big foodmakers, Premier Foods and the UK arms of Mars, Nestlé and PepsiCo pledged to introduce traffic lights. But large companies such as Coca-Cola and Unilever refused, so that 40 per cent of UK food sales will not be covered.Who says traffic lights are the best way to protect consumer health? The Stroke Association, Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation and Diabetes UK. Who says they aren’t? FoodDrinkEurope, the Brussels-based industry lobbying group and several of its members. You decide whom to believe.After listening to both sides and rifling through my kitchen cupboard and refrigerator, I have. Traffic lights are, by far, the best way to help people keep themselves and their families slim.The guideline daily amount (GDA) system, favoured by the anti-traffic lights crowd, has its place, but is difficult even for the best-educated consumers to use, and of little help to the poorest and least-informed, who need it most.GDAs require you to track the percentage of your recommended daily allowance of sugar, say, that you have consumed during the day. As a paper from the National Heart Forum pointed out, UK research found that 47 per cent of adults had difficulty using simple percentages.This debate is not about the nanny state. Individuals, particularly parents, must take responsibility for what they buy and eat. All food labels can do is help them exercise that responsibility.Mella Frewen, FoodDrinkEurope’s director-general, told me last week that traffic lights were simplistic, judgmental and did not help people achieve a balanced diet. Eating only foods with green lights would not be good for you.Coca-Cola said: “Studies show that consumers widely recognise and understand GDAs throughout Europe.” Unilever said that traffic lights do “not allow consumers to clearly identify healthier products within each food group and make informed choices. For instance, butter and spreads would both be labelled red for saturated fat, despite the fact that spreads contain four times less saturated fat than butter”.Ms Frewen’s argument is silly. No one is telling consumers to avoid red lights foods altogether, just to buy fewer of them.As to Coke’s studies, much research, including by Which?, the UK consumer body, found that people understood traffic lights best.Unilever’s argument has most force, although it suggests that while spreads are better than butter, the red light tells you to spread your spreads thinly too.Coke and Unilever are often at the forefront of corporate responsibility. Their problem with traffic lights, I suspect, is that they would lay bare which of their best-selling products make you fat.michael.skapinker@ft.com——————————————-Letters in response to this column:Asda customers chose the message they understood / From Mr Bernard Hughes‘Traffic light’ labelling on food / From Mr Maarten van Hasselt

Sure there are a few less names than there were. But the latest quarterly results from the likes of Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley all show an industry in rude – very rude if you’re a regulator trying to stymie banking – health. Investment banking is booming, credit losses are falling and businesses from trading to wealth and asset management are revelling in buoyant markets.That bankers are coining it again seems particularly unfair considering that good old companies that make real things seem to be having a tougher time of it. There were also numbers this week from toymaker Mattel, which saw double-digit declines in Barbie sales, year on year. Coca-Cola also suffered weaker than expected volumes but investors would be crazy to write the company off on the basis of one quarter. That said, activist investor Nelson Peltz seems to have lost patience with PepsiCo, wanting it to separate its beverages from its snacks.Confused by the conflicting signals?

210;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-07-18T23:19:03Z;Pepsi: half nelson;Proposed deal brings big risk;Grab some chips and a soda, and settle in. This will be fun to watch. Nelson Peltz, head of Trian Partners, made a detailed case for a split of PepsiCo’s beverage and snack businesses on Wednesday. His arguments have merit, but leave room for Pepsi’s management– which has rejected the idea so far – to mount a feisty defence.Mr Peltz argues that the drinks and snacks businesses have different distribution, strategic imperatives and financial profiles. The resulting conflicts have prevented growth and returns at Pepsi from matching peers’. Management has underinvested in beverages in order to siphon capital to the snacks. And the company does not get the premium that a standalone growth business (snacks) or a dividend-paying value play (drinks) would.Focus helps. But the disparity between Pepsi’s performance and valuation and that of the peers Mr Peltz selects – Coca Cola, Dr Pepper Snapple, Hershey, Mead Johnson and McCormick, among others – could be due to Pepsi’s structural problems, or to differences in, for example, product mix. It is hard to say. The comparisons on the food side are unsatisfying. Hershey, Mead and McCormick make candy, baby formula and spices, respectively. Pepsi sells chips and cereal.It is also uncertain that the companies would get much of a valuation boost. Would the beverage company trade like Coca-Cola’s, with its advantages of scale and brand? Would the snacks business, which had organic volume growth of 4.5 per cent last year, get a significant growth premium? Hershey, which grows faster, gets only a small premium to Pepsi.Mr Peltz also proposes that Pepsi, before splitting, buys the snack company Mondelez. His notion that $3bn in annual savings could be found at a company with $71bn in revenues is reasonable. But this must be weighed against all the risks of doing a $65bn acquisition (of a company that was itself just spun out of Kraft), then a spin out of a company worth at least that much.

211;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Pepsi chief pursues snack innovation;;While Nelson Peltz and other investors are pushing PepsiCo to split its portfolio of snacks and drinks brands, chief executive Indra Nooyi has something else on her mind – drinkable oatmeal.The company’s Quaker unit sells an oat-based drink in Latin America, and Ms Nooyi has pointed to the product as the possible future of “drinkified” snacks.“The lines between snacks and beverages are blurring,” she told an investor conference in May. “We keep talking artificially about snacks and beverages only because some people used to track this industry differently. I think that’s over. This is convenience.”In the 18 months since PepsiCo launched its turnround plan, Ms Nooyi has held firm against pressure from investors who do not share her vision of a “continuum” of eating and drinking.Her aggressive restructuring plan knit together food and drink marketing and boosted ad spending. She says of one of the company’s smoothie brands: “I don’t know if Naked Juice is a snack or a beverage.”The doubling down on PepsiCo’s identity as an “integrated food and beverage company” is fitting for the Chennai-born chief executive, who has led its expansion beyond fizzy drinks.Ms Nooyi, 57, joined PepsiCo as a corporate strategist in 1994 and rose to chief financial officer in 2001. She was involved in divesting its restaurants, now Yum Brands, in 1997, and engineered the 1998 acquisition of Tropicana and 2001 merger with Quaker Oats.Since becoming chief executive in 2006, she has overseen the purchases of Naked Juice and Russian dairy company Wimm-Bill-Dan, as well as joint ventures to sell Sabra hummus and Muller yoghurt in the US.But her focus on “good for you” products like juice and yoghurt drew criticism that she was ignoring PepsiCo’s biggest sodas and snacks. In February 2012, Ms Nooyi announced a “major reset”, pledging to spend $500m-$600m more on marketing and advertising “core” brands.Since then, PepsiCo shares have risen by nearly a third and this week hit an all-time high of more than $85.The company improved margins and posted better than expected earnings in the first quarter of 2013.But the long-term decline of US soda consumption is still a drag – and PepsiCo acknowledges that changes are needed.On Wednesday, a person familiar with PepsiCo’s thinking rejected the idea of a global split of snacks and beverages, saying it “just isn’t going to happen”.But the future of the US drinks brands is unclear. Ms Nooyi told investors in April that the company is exploring “meaningful structural alternatives” for its underperforming North American beverage business.That could mean shifting bottling back out to partners, similar to what Coca-Cola announced earlier this year, or something more dramatic. Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, has said all options are on the table, but PepsiCo does not plan to reveal its decision until February 2014.

He prefers to work in cloistered boardrooms, gently bringing a company round to the great potential of his schemes. Indeed, as he proposed a dramatic plan to supersize and then sunder PepsiCo on Wednesday, he referred repeatedly to Indra Nooyi, its chief executive, as a “good friend”.Yet the very fact that he was talking about his plans in public, to a conference of fellow investors and the live television audience of CNBC, pointed to the limits of friendship: Ms Nooyi does not want to do the deals.Tom Mullarkey, analyst for Morningstar said: “The fact that he had to go public means Pepsi is not interested. He’s trying to rally the troops.”Investors who have been waiting months to hear plans from Mr Peltz after his investment firm, Trian Partners, disclosed billion-dollar stakes in both Pepsi and Mondelez, agreed. “He needs help on the Pepsi side of things,” said one.They may be open to persuasion. The plan that Mr Peltz laid out on Wednesday is for Pepsi to buy Mondelez, a sweet snacks and coffee business that he said would complement Pepsi’s Frito-Lay food brands.Mr Peltz had a hand in creating Mondelez, pushing for UK confectioner Cadbury to spin out its drinks business, and then sell out what remained to Kraft. The chocolate maker then formed the core of Mondelez when Kraft undertook its own split last year.Trian wants Pepsi to buy the group with stock, in a deal worth about $65bn. Ms Nooyi could then use the balance sheet of the combined entity to take on debt and pay out a special dividend to shareholders equivalent to one-fifth of the combined group’s market capitalisation.The final step would be to spin out the beverage business to investors, separating a pedestrian drinks business paying investor-friendly dividends from the faster-growing snacks side. Analysts and shareholders, the theory goes, would then reward both parts with higher valuations.Kevin Dreyer, associate portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds and an investor in both companies, is a supporter. He said: “Kraft Foods, the slower growth company, has actually done quite well in the public market so you might end up with a better than expected valuation for the beverage company.”Mr Peltz also argues that Frito-Lay’s crisps are a better fit with Cadbury’s chocolates than with Pepsi’s sugary drinks. A deal would produce lower costs, the “synergies” craved by bankers.Pepsi can claim these already, for instance in some countries cans of soda go to stores in the same trucks that deliver crisps. But Mr Mullarkey said the efficiency gains of a merger with Mondelez would more than offset the loss of such existing synergies.Investors have also grown impatient with Mondelez, where profit margins have shrunk since Cadbury was acquired in 2010, and slow improvement is promised. One shareholder said: “They have had almost four years to run this business. There is nothing that they have proposed doing that they couldn’t have done already”.We don’t need any transformational M&AYet Ali Dibadj, analysts for Bernstein analyst, warned that theory might not meet practice. “From the Mondelez perspective there is a human element . . . you have a group of people who worked for Cadbury, then worked for Kraft, then worked for Mondelez, then work for Pepsi? It takes a toll. You lose people, you have stress on the system.”More fundamentally, however, while the mooted $35 to $38 price per share for Mondelez might win over its shareholders, it is Pepsi that must be convinced of the merits of a merger or acquisition in the first place.A person familiar with the company’s thinking called it a “non-starter”, and pointed to a share price that this week hit an all-time high of more than $85. Ms Nooyi told a conference of investors this year that “we don’t need any transformational M&A”.Mr Peltz said that 37 of Pepsi’s top 40 shareholders already own Mondelez, and encouraged them to “get your cards and letters out and send them to the board”. But he also said that left to their own devices Pepsi would anyway be a $105 stock by 2015. He may have to rally some new friends.
213;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-07-18T00:33:00Z;Peltz urges PepsiCo to buy Mondelez;;Nelson Peltz has launched a public campaign to transform PepsiCo, urging the group to first merge its snack business with Mondelez in a $60bn deal, and then to spin out its slow-growing soda business to shareholders.The call by the activist investor behind Trian Partners ends months of speculation as to his plans and sets the stage for a battle with Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, who said earlier this year that the company did not need any “transformational” deals.PepsiCo considers the proposal “a non-starter”, according to a person familiar with the company’s thinking. “While what was proposed would obviously be a good deal for existing Mondelez shareholders, for PepsiCo shareholders it would be an extremely risky $80bn acquisition of a company that has been underperforming, with huge exposure to slow-growth western European markets,” this person said.Mr Peltz has taken billion-dollar stakes in both companies, and on Wednesday he said that plan A was for PepsiCo to buy Mondelez with stock, paying a mid-teens premium for the Oreo maker of $35 to $38 a share that would value it at more than $62bn.Mondelez is a descendant of Cadbury, which in 2010 was acquired by Kraft. Last year, Kraft split into grocery-focused Kraft Foods and Mondelez, now owner of the Cadbury brand. Mr Peltz was once an investor in Cadbury Schweppes, before its demerger in 2008.He told CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference that PepsiCo could then pay a cash dividend to all shareholders equivalent to one-fifth of the combined group’s market capitalisation. The final step would be to spin out the beverage business to investors, leaving Mondelez’s sweet snacks and coffee units to complement PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay food brands.The investor said that without a deal, plan B would be to push ahead with a split at PepsiCo. “I really believe that beverages and snacks should be separated,” he said.PepsiCo has previously said that all options are on the table for restructuring its North American beverage business, which has been hit by declining US soda consumption, but would not announce its plans until early next year.The person familiar with PepsiCo’s thinking said of the proposed spin-off of all drinks: “The existing portfolio has been performing well. PepsiCo has been clear that splitting global snacks from global beverages just isn’t going to happen.”Mr Peltz said that he had held several meetings with his “good friend” Ms Nooyi, who was resistant to the split.“Pepsi right now doesn’t love the deal,” he said. He planned to have discussions with Mondelez management in the next few weeks.PepsiCo said in a statement that it was “confident in our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value as an integrated food and beverage company”.Mondelez said it “regularly engages in meaningful conversations with its shareholders and looks forward to meeting with Trian to learn about their perspectives in more detail.”Mr Peltz hopes to win over investors. He said that 37 of the top 40 shareholders of PepsiCo also own Mondelez stock. “We hope they will get on board and tell management that Trian has a very interesting proposal.”Mr Peltz praised Ms Nooyi and said that PepsiCo’s problems were structural. However, he said that Mondelez’s margins should be higher, and said that chief executive Irene Rosenfeld was a better strategic leader than operational manager.The investor also blamed the Mondelez name for affecting the company’s valuation. “It sounds like a disease, suffering from Mondelez.”PepsiCo shares closed up 1.5 per cent at $85.24 on Wednesday, near their all-time high. The stock has gained more than 20 per cent this year. Mondelez shares gained 2.1 per cent to $30.50.
214;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-07-16T22:22:30Z;Coke takes pop out of US stocks;;Coca-Cola helped take the pop out of the recent stock market rally, with shares falling sharply after the company reported disappointing earnings and the chief executive said he was “not happy” with its performance.Shares in the world’s largest soft drink company by sales fell 1.9 per cent to $40.23.The soda maker has faced a decline in US consumption while also battling poor weather in North America and Europe in the second quarter. The company’s share price is off 5.6 per cent in the past three months.PepsiCo, its main rival, fell 0.8 per cent to $84.02.Coke’s fall helped send the S&P 500 down 0.4 per cent to 1,676.26, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.2 per cent to 15,451.85.The Nasdaq retreated 0.4 per cent to 3,594.71, breaking a recent run in which it has outperformed the other two major US indices.The Nasdaq 100, which consists of the major non-financial companies on the greater index, fell 0.1 per cent after finishing up for 14 straight sessions.Elsewhere in earnings news, Goldman Sachs beat profit expectations. But shares in the bank dropped 1.7 per cent to $160.24.Other US banks, such as JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, have also reported impressive second-quarter results, but have been dogged by concerns about forthcoming regulations.Additionally, financials have been among the strongest stocks during 2013’s market rally, and Goldman remains up almost 26 per cent on the year to date.Tesla shares fell 14.3 per cent to $109.10 after Goldman downgraded the company’s six-month target to $84. The electric carmaker has been among 2013’s bright spots, up 222 per cent.McGraw-Hill Financial was also on track to end a recent rally, down 2.1 per cent to $57.56. The company was downgraded by Raymond James from “strong buy” to “outperform”.The company, which operates Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services in addition to other financial analysis brands, is up about 11 per cent since spinning off its education unit.The recent rally in US stocks has come after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke quelled concerns over plans to pare back the quantitative easing programme in the autumn.However, the brief sell-off in June and rising interest rates have been seen by some as a sign that the market has begun to price in the end of quantitative easing.Analysts say US stocks are primed to move higher despite trading at near record levels.“This market has no respect whatsoever . . . nobody believes it’s a bull market but the reality is it’s a bull market,” said Adam Hewison, chief strategist at INO, a financial advisory firm. “The perception is the market’s going higher and I think that’s also backed up with the technicals. The technicals are very, very strong in the market as far as we’re concerned.”Netflix was one of the best performers on the day, up 1 per cent to $260.48. The streaming content service has risen steadily on recent success for its native content and fresh deals to distribute other media.The company is up more than 21 per cent in the past month.Gold prices rose on Tuesday, providing some aid to the materials sector. Goldcorp rose 5.6 per cent to $27.16, but remains about 27 per cent lower in the past six months.
215;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-07-11T10:55:54Z;Royal Unibrew bolsters position with acquisition of Hartwall;;Royal Unibrew cemented its position as the Nordic region’s second-biggest brewer by buying Heineken’s Finnish business for DKr2.8bn (€375m).The Danish brewer, ranked only behind Carlsberg in the region, will partly fund the acquisition of Hartwall, Finland’s second-largest beer company, by selling 10 per cent of its own shares to the Hartwall family and by stopping its dividend and share buyback programmes.The acquisition, for a total enterprise value of DKr3.3bn, also strengthens Unibrew’s co-operation with Heineken and PepsiCo as Hartwall produces beverages for both under licence.Unibrew shook off competition for Hartwall from private equity groups Nordic Capital and Cinven as well as consumer goods company Orkla, according to bankers working on the deal.“Hartwall and the Finnish market are in many ways similar to our Danish operations, and we are confident that as a long-term focused owner . . . we will be able to increase Hartwall’s commercial and operational strength and thus improve earnings,” said Henrik Brandt, Unibrew’s chief executive.Heineken said the fact that 70 per cent of Hartwall’s business was in non-beer categories such as water, wine and spirits made it a difficult fit for the group.“Scandinavia is very much Carlsberg territory, so in Finland Hartwall was a standalone business, not really integrated in any other Heineken business,” said John-Paul Schuirink, a Heineken spokesman. “We thought the future growth perspectives would be better served if it were part of a dedicated multi-drinks Scandinavian company.”The sale also helps Heineken to reduce some of the debt load it built up last year with its $4.5bn purchase of Asia Pacific Breweries, the Singapore-based brewer that makes Heineken and Tiger beer in southeast Asia.That deal drove Heineken’s ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) to 3.1 at the end of 2012. The group has promised to bring the ratio down below 2.5 by the end of 2014.Unibrew at the same time extended its partnership with Heineken, meaning it has the rights to brew the Dutch beer in Finland and the three Baltic states. Unibrew already brews Heineken in Denmark and it and Hartwall together are distributors for the brand in Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.The Danish brewer said the debt burden resulting from the deal meant it would stop both dividends and share buybacks but that it hoped to resume them in 2015. It also cut its medium-term operating margin target from 14 per cent to 13 per cent, saying that last year if it included Hartwall it estimated its margin was 11.7 per cent.Unibrew said it saw opportunities to boost Hartwall’s earnings by optimising operations despite a declining Finnish market.Hartwall, which also produces water, soft drinks and cider, made revenues of about DKr2.3bn to Unibrew’s DKr3.3bn last year. But its operating margin was lower at 9.1 per cent compared with 14.4 per cent for the Danish brewer.Shares in Unibrew were down 6.4 per cent at DKr512 in Thursday morning trading.
216;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;US health group warns on chemical in Pepsi;;A health group says PepsiCo is still using an ingredient linked to cancer in mice more than a year after the US beverage company said it was reformulating the caramel colouring used in its flagship cola.The Center for Environmental Health, a US watchdog group, said Pepsi purchased in 10 US states contained 4-methylimidazole, or 4-MEI, a chemical that has been linked to cancerous lung tumours in mice.PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, the world’s largest beverage company by sales, said in March 2012 they were asking their suppliers to change how they manufacture the ingredient used to colour their colas to reduce 4-MEI. That came after California said it was adding 4-MEI to a list of carcinogenic substances, which would force the companies to put a warning label on their products.Pepsi and Coke drinks purchased in California did not contain the chemical, the Center for Environmental Health found. Nine of the 10 Coca-Cola beverages it tested from other states had little or no 4-MEI.“We applaud Coke for taking this health protective action for consumers nationwide,” said Michael Green, the group’s executive director. “Pepsi’s delay is inexplicable. We urge the company to take swift action to provide all Americans with the same safer product they’re selling in California.”PepsiCo said its suppliers were working to modify their manufacturing process for products outside of California. “By year end we will start rolling out to meet our target for the rest of the US, which will be completed by February 2014. PepsiCo suppliers are also undertaking this effort globally.”Coca-Cola said it had changed its ingredient first in California to avoid the warning labels, but said that because it did not make sense to have separate inventories for different locations, it was now using modified caramel in other states. Outside the US, the company said it was transitioning to using the modified ingredient “once we have the supplies we need and have worked through logistics.”The Center for Science in the Public Interest, another health advocacy group, has called on the US Food and Drug Administration to ban 4-MEI, arguing that the colouring is cosmetic and puts consumers’ health at risk.But the industry says its products are safe. In response to the CSPI’s petition, the American Beverage Association said that no regulatory agency has labelled the chemical a human carcinogen.PepsiCo said on Wednesday: “FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world, including the European Food Safety Authority and Health Canada, consider our caramel colouring safe for use in foods and beverages.”The FDA has said a consumer would have to drink more than 1,000 cans of cola a day to be exposed to the amount of 4-MEI that has been linked with cancer in rodents.
217;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;PepsiCo’s cardiac system billboards;Soft drinks maker gets its message across without words;"Agency: BBDO Proximity Düsseldorf
Territory: Germany
Verdict: 4/5Medical studies have linked sugary, carbonated drinks with conditions such as obesity and diabetes. The human circulatory system might therefore seem an odd choice of marketing image for PepsiCo.But the familiar red and blue colours of the human cardiac system proved irresistible for ad agency BBDO Proximity Düsseldorf. Its “Iconic Refreshment” billboard campaign is intended to remind customers that, like oxygenated blood, Pepsi delivers “refreshment and energy to all parts of the body”. The ad does this without a single typographical element. Viewers will enjoy locating the circled Pepsi logo but they will not find a slogan.The agency deserves credit for originality. As Christian Mommertz, creative and managing director, notes, “depicting refreshment in a refreshing way” is not easy.Similarly, the pared down motif is strangely beguiling and a welcome change from shouty, star-studded US soft drink commercials. It will also doubtless export well – there is nothing here that could not be understood in Cairo, Canberra or Caracas.So long as viewers do not impute health benefits, the image will do no harm. Ultimately, the human body is 70 per cent water and refreshment does not require an infusion of cola."
218;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-06-21T14:10:31Z;Pepsi’s tricky time in India: IPL woes and no boss;;"The president of PepsiCo India, Manu Anand, has stepped down after just two and a half years in the job.It’s difficult to separate the news from the company’s unfortunate decision to shell out millions of dollars to associate itself with the scandal-hit Indian Premier League (IPL).The company said in a statement:PepsiCo India Region President Manu Anand has decided to join another company and is leaving PepsiCo. His successor will be announced in due course.Get past the diplomatic PR-speak and the statement is telling. Anand, who has been president of the company since January 2011, had a very short tenure at the top and the fact that there is no successor announced yet indicates his departure was sudden.The news comes as people question one of the company’s most daring decisions. PepsiCo paid Rs3.97bn ($67m) to be title sponsor of the popular Indian cricketing tournament for five seasons. It always looked like a brave bid. The company spent almost double what DLF, the property developer, dished out to have its name prefixed to the popular Indian cricketing tournament between 2008 and 2012. And it’s widely acknowledged that the popularity of the IPL has fluctuated dramatically over time – initially high as fans were enthralled by the new, high speed format of the sport, and then dropping as scandalous afterparties and match fixing allegations left them disillusioned.But PepsiCo defended its decision. “Cricket is a religion in India. Its sheer popularity makes it an exciting property for key brands in the PepsiCo portfolio,” the company told beyondbrics. “Pepsi has been synonymous with cricket for close to 20 years and the association has been very strong and truly brings out the passion for the game. ”Speaking to beyondbrics back in March, the company said that: “we are confident that we will be able to derive tremendous value from Pepsi-IPL, which will be multiple times our investment.”PepsiCo has looked to get the most out of the IPL sponsorship. It has had several high-profile promotions over the past few months – from a game involving social media called “The Great Indian Catch“, to campaigns giving customers the chance to meet their cricketing heroes.It was all a big push to win market share in India’s large and growing market for fizzy drinks – mostly to chip away at the demand for Coca-Cola.Coca-Cola, meanwhile, made its own attempts to build its brand among India’s sports fans – without throwing cash at a glamorised sporting event. Its “Coca-Cola Cup” is a football tournament for under-16s which looks to unearth new talent. And the company organised cricket camps across the country, giving young players the chance to learn from eminent international coaches.Unfortunately, even after shelling out all that cash, PepsiCo – which includes Pepsi, 7UP, Aquafina water and Tropicana juices in its portfolio, as well as crisps and other snacks – doesn’t seem to have got the benefit it must have hoped for from its expensive sponsorship.It was bad luck for PepsiCo. This year’s tournament has been shrouded in a match-fixing scandal that has shaken even the top of the pyramid – international players and the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which owns the IPL. That reduced enthusiasm for the tournament and has led commentators to question whether Pepsi will continue its title sponsorship.The brand value of the tournament has taken a hit over the years, tainted by such scandals. This year the consultancy, Brand Finance, had said the value of the IPL name would grow to $3.03bn from $2.92bn last year – but that’s still well below a peak of $4.13bn in 2010. And as the spot-fixing charges have rolled out over the past few weeks, that value is only going to have eroded further.With the benefit of hindsight, it’s easy to suggest that the IPL deal was a bad one for PespiCo. And the guy at the top, who pegged their named to the tournament, would be an easy target in the blame game.Related reading:

219;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-06-17T02:00:28Z;Myanmar: foreign investment rush raises hopes… and concerns;;"One of the most visible symbols so far of Myanmar’s opening to the west was the recent launch of Coca-Cola’s new bottling operations at its joint-venture plant on the outskirts of Yangon. Less visible was the changing dynamic around the seemingly unstoppable surge of foreign investment interest in the previously secretive country.In a marquee festooned with trademark red and white signs and flanked by trucks emblazoned with company logos, dignitaries including former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright hailed Coca-Cola’s decision to set up bottling operations through a local partner, Pinya, as a “momentous occasion” in Myanmar’s international re-emergence.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chairman and chief executive, went a step further, comparing Myanmar’s opening to the fall of the Berlin Wall. “It’s a great moment in history, just like it used to be when we opened up our business in east and central Europe … right after the fall of the Berlin wall,” he said in a television interview.Theatrical, perhaps. But Kent is putting Coca-Cola’s money where his mouth is, announcing the company will invest $200m in Myanmar over the next five years, creating 2,500 direct jobs and 22,000 more indirect jobs as a result. Just as symbolic, perhaps, is the tentative entry of Coke’s archrival PepsiCo to Myanmar, signifying a new phase in their so-called “cola wars” – although Coca-Cola has a clear lead over its rival, as Pepsico is merely in planning stages for a bottling plant.One year ago, such moves by western companies would have dominated local media headlines. But there are too many announcements these days to make more than a fleeting impact on Myanmar’s increasingly active media – now freed from censorship.In the country’s largest-ever gathering of foreign executives, business people descended last week on Naypyidaw, the once-isolated capital north of Yangon, to attend the World Economic Forum’s Asia gathering.Between packed sessions, regional leaders and executives from companies including Microsoft, Chevron, WPP, Mitsubishi Corp, Citibank, Philips, General Electric, Visa and Mastercard International mingled with local figures, headed by Myanmar’s president Thein Sein and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.After two years of unprecedented economic and political reform, it was, as one local consultant remarked, “Myanmar’s true ‘coming-out’ party.Amid recent bouts of anti-Muslim violence wracking the country, policy paralysis over the fate of nearly 800,000 stateless Muslim Rohingya in western Myanmar, and unresolved ethnic conflicts in the north, there is a growing disconnect. Perceptions in the main cities of accelerating reform and robust growth contrast with tensions in many parts of the country.Even so, investors have good reason to hope that the modernisation push will steadily lift the country. In Yangon, the commercial capital, other signs of boom times include Ford Motor’s new showroom and factories such as Suzuki Motor’s newly recommissioned plant, abandoned when it withdrew in 2010, and a Unilever factory. The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant will produce food seasoning in Myanmar from next month, and is already planning a second facility under plans to invest $650m in Myanmar over the next decade. Meanwhile Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has launched its first electronics shop, in Yangon, and aims to move into other areas of business such as health care equipment.“It was time,” says Harjit Gill, Philips regional CEO. “This country is in a fantastic position to leapfrog, we want to be here.”The list of western projects goes on: in tourism, Hilton International’s 300-room luxury hotel, to open at year end, is leading the way.As Myanmar prepares this year to receive 1.3m visitors, surpassing its 2012 record of 1m visitors, other big hoteliers include US chain Best Western, which will open a renovated property later this year; French group Accor with a Novotel in Yangon; and most recently, Marriott International of the US, which plans its first hotel in Myanmar this year.Asian companies are also in the vanguard, with Vietnamese groups Hoang Anh Gia Lai and CT in advanced stages of large hotel projects.“It is reaching the point where in many ways, you can’t afford NOT to be here,” says another local consultant. Other western companies, meanwhile, are pursuing “phase one” strategies of distribution and joint venture deals including Microsoft which last week announced a partnership with local software company Myanmar Information Technology to initially focus on distribution of products.In other sectors, J Walter Thompson just sealed a deal with local partner Mango Marketing to tap the nascent advertising and marketing sectors, while Japan’s Dentsu has set up shop.In alcoholic beverages, Carlsberg, Heineken and ThaiBev, have all gained permission in the past few months to brew beer in Myanmar with local partners. Heineken is forging ahead with a majority-owned venture with local partner APB Alliance Brewery; Carlsberg recently announced a $50m brewery and marketing push with local partner Myanmar Golden Star Breweries; and ThaiBev plans to produce its Chang beer at three sites.Separately, ThaiBev “inherited” a 55 per cent stake in a venture with Myanmar’s biggest brewer, Myanmar Breweries, maker of Myanmar Beer through its recent takeover of Singapore-based Fraser & Neave (previously Heineken’s joint venture partner in Asia Pacific Breweries).Clearly the previous trickle of investment interest has exploded into a torrent, driven by belief in the country’s bright economic prospects. Myanmar’s economy could grow 6.75 per cent this fiscal year, up from 6.3 per cent last year and almost double the pace from 1990 to 2010, according to the IMF.McKinsey & Co in a report this month said Myanmar’s economy, at $45bn in 2010, could reach $200bn by 2030, while the country could draw $170bn in capital inflows, about $100bn of it in foreign direct investment, more than double the level over the previous 20 years.The opening of any new frontier market, as other emerging market economies have shown, can offer more hype than tangible profits in the short to medium-term. But in Myanmar’s case, some important elements have moved into place comparatively smoothly. Luc de Waegh, a consultant who is helping to set up a European business association in Myanmar, says the reforms and resulting changes are “close to a miracle”. But like many other Myanmar expats, he warns of “unrealistic expectations” among new entrants.The rapid easing or removal of western sanctions has been critical to boosting investor confidence – not least the European Union’s move this week to restore preferential trade access to Myanmar. For US and other multinational companies, however, the most significant development has been Washington’s move last month to clarify investment guidelines for its companies.The US has only eased rather than lifted a range of curbs on bilateral investment and business ties. In the process, it has introduced what many executives describe as onerous disclosure requirements.The new “responsible investment reporting requirements”, issued last month, includes requirements for regular detailed reporting on investments worth more than $500,000; reporting on any contact with military or non-state armed groups; detailing new investments with the military-controlled Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprises, which dominates the oil and gas sector; and stiff penalties for companies transacting business with individuals or entities on the so-called US “black list”.US law firm Pillsbury, Winthrop Shaw Pittman, a leading adviser to US companies on sanctions regimes, said in a client note: “This final rule does provide an interesting contrast – where the EU, Canada and Australia have largely dismantled their sanctions regimes, the US has maintained controls and is permitting new investment subject to reporting and transparency. It will be interesting to see what impact this has in practice. Our clients are paying close attention.”Indeed, says John Rice, a vice chairman of General Electric, on the sidelines of WEF in Naypyidaw, “There is enormous potential here, but it’s a very complicated process – you don’t just turn up and start selling.”For Myanmar’s local companies, the foreign rush is a mixed blessing. Win Aung, president of Myanmar’s main business group UMFCCI, readily acknowledges concerns about increased competition for local companies. “We know the opportunity for partnerships and development will be greater,” he told the FT. “With the increased competition, however, we must also prepare our SMEs to survive and thrive in the new environment.”With its base of nearly 30,000 small and medium companies in mind, the UMFCCI helped the government draft a new SME Development Law, aimed at promoting SME development.As a close presidential adviser and an urbane face of Myanmar business, Win Aung has pushed hard for business liberalisation and has been a key facilitator for many western and Japanese business executives in the country.Yet, his tale also illustrates the many aberrations in Myanmar’s transition period. In the process of building up his sprawling Dagon construction group, he ended up on the US “specially designated nationals” list (or so-called blacklist) due to his government dealings. The listing bars entry to the US and prevents US companies dealing with his group. As the US moves to “normalise” relations, not least through the likely removal by Congress this month of some remaining trade restrictions, Western diplomats believe he will be among the first to be taken off the US list.Western companies should be relieved at the outcome on Sunday of a critical contest for leadership of the UMFCCI, the main business group. In an election that will set the tone of how Myanmar business responds to the foreign investment rush in the next three years, Win Aung and his pro-reform supporters won a landslide victory against two competitors for a new, three-year term to lead the chamber.Given Win Aung’s agenda for deepening relations with western and Japanese business groups, the outcome proves that – for now, at least – Myanmar’s business lobby is more concerned with reaching out than turning inward, said some expat Yangon business executives.Related reading:

220;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-06-06T17:59:31Z;SodaStream: all those bubbles;Even if making fizzy drinks at home is not just a fad, Pepsi should probably wait;Pepsi isn’t going to buy SodaStream – this week. Yet reports that it might, pushed the home-soda machine company’s shares up 5 per cent on Thursday, even as Pepsi issued categorical denials. Some investors, it appears, had not ever noticed SodaStream’s shares (which have doubled since November), its sales (up more than 50 per cent in 2012), or its gross margins (above 50 per cent) until the chatter started. Nor might they have known that more than half of SodaStream’s revenue comes from canisters and syrups – and everyone loves the razors/blades model.So surely Pepsi or Coca-Cola will come around to acquiring SodaStream eventually. Coke paid 6 times sales, or $4bn for Vitamin Water in 2007, for goodness’ sake. At that valuation SodaStream is worth about $3bn, more than twice its current market value.Delirious growth investors may want to take a slightly deeper look at SodaStream’s numbers, though. Below the gross margin line, the profit and loss statement is not pretty. The company is expanding its marketing budget so quickly that, despite growing sales fourfold in three years, margins are hardly improving. Profitability is helped a very low tax rate that the company expects to rise. And the balance sheet and cash flow statement are no more encouraging: every dollar the business throws off is going towards working capital and capital expenditure.Still, SodaStream’s management aims to double revenue by 2016 and is building the capacity to do just that. Fair enough. That leaves buyers – Pepsi, Coke or the plain old shareholder – with a single determination to ponder. Is making fizzy drinks at home a fad, or a permanent change in the drinks market? If the latter, paying 25 times forward earnings for SodaStream makes sense. If not, better wait for the fizz to subside.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
221;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-06-04T18:06:28Z;Inside Business: Dishonour is staining India’s cricket business;N Srinivasan’s decision is one typical of a cricketing establishment that shows few signs of cleaning up;The scandal engulfing the Indian Premier League took a further turn this week, as the most senior figure at the world’s pre-eminent cricket tournament stepped aside in the wake of match fixing allegations.N Srinivasan, the formidable head of the Board Of Control For Cricket In India, left his post grudgingly and temporarily, following considerable public anger and unflagging media demands that someone ought to take responsibility for the mess afflicting the game.The decision was an unsatisfactory fudge, however, and one typical of a cricketing establishment that shows few signs of cleaning up its sport, or the sizeable commercial operations behind it.This matters partly because India is easily cricket’s leading market, and the IPL its marquee product. Its governance therefore has significant implications for its growth around the world.Yet the present tumult is also indicative of problems that afflict other fast-growing sectors in Asia’s third-largest economy. In the future, many global industries will come to be dominated by Indian enterprises. But cricket is one of the few in which they have yet done so, and the omens are far from encouraging.The IPL’s new difficulties began last month with the arrest of various cricketers and bookmakers, accused of rigging elements of matches. A subsequent criminal probe has hinted at yet greater scams involving gangsters and betting syndicates.Even if none of this is proven, the more limited cheating allegations remain the most serious to hit the event since it first brought a rush of capital and a dollop of marketing savvy to the sport six years ago. Cricketing purists have never taken to the IPL for just this reason, appalled by its television-friendly format and attendant cast of gaudy tycoons, including brewer Vijay Mallya and industrialist Mukesh Ambani, both of whom own franchises.In a pained essay, historian Ramachandra Guha wrote recently that the IPL displays the “worst sides of Indian capitalism and Indian society”. He also posed a telling question about the distance some of the country’s businesses keep from the event: “Why is it that companies like the Tatas, the Mahindras, or Infosys have not promoted an IPL team?”.The point is well made, and provides at least part of the reason why the BCCI’s recent response has been so disappointing.True, Mr Srinivasan stepped aside pending an inquiry, but that is to be dominated by BCCI loyalists, while his interim replacement is another stalwart of the system that oversaw the current farrago. None of this suggests a shake-up is likely.The episode also shines a light on the IPL’s management, and one that is dispiritingly indicative of problems that plague India’s business scene more generally – the most obvious being feeble governance.Recent events have shown the BCCI to be riven with disharmony and dominated by a motley band of cricket barons and politicians apparently unable to think beyond the agenda of their particular faction.Conflicts of interest are rife too. The BCCI is meant to regulate cricket as a game, but it also owns the IPL as a commercial entity. Worse, Mr Srinivasan heads a listed cement company that owns one of the major IPL teams. Both are obviously problematic arrangements.These two issues add up to a third: over-centralisation of power. Just as too many Indian businesses are dominated by one powerful owner, so Mr Srinivasan came to hold sway at the opaque juncture of cricket’s political and commercial interests.He is not accused of wrongdoing in the current scandal. Yet the structure he created managed to bring a distinctly Indian whiff of crony capitalism to a pastime once admired for its decorous probity.Faced with all this, Mr Guha thinks the IPL should now be scrapped, and begun again in a less boisterous form. Yet even if such drastic steps can be avoided, a genuinely independent inquiry is now clearly needed, both into recent events and the IPL’s governance more broadly.The game’s corporate supporters, including head sponsor PepsiCo, should be pushing for such a thorough clean-up. And Mr Srinivasan ought to be replaced permanently with an untarnished figure capable of winning back public trust.If this happens one of India’s highest profile business success stories has at least a sporting chance at rescuing its tattered reputation. If not, its dishonour will be deserved.James Crabtree is the Financial Times’ Mumbai Correspondentjames.crabtree@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
222;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Peltz raises stakes in PepsiCo and Mondelez;;Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, raised his stakes in PepsiCo and Mondelez during the first quarter as he met with management to discuss his ideas for the companies, according to regulatory filings on Wednesday.The stakebuilding has prompted speculation that the activist could push for radical action at the manufacturers of Oreo cookies and Fritos chips, including a merger of part or all of the two businesses.Trian Partners, the investment firm Mr Peltz cofounded with Edward Garden and Peter May, tripled its stake in PepsiCo during the first quarter to 12m shares – a stake worth $1bn but still a small fraction of the fizzy drink maker’s $130bn market capitalisation.Mr Peltz is now the sixth largest shareholder in Mondelez, after Trian doubled its holdings to 40.3m shares worth $1.27bn. The investor is known for taking large long-term positions in consumer goods and financial companies, then pressing for higher margins, mergers or spin-offs to push share prices higher.Speculation that Mr Peltz will call for PepsiCo to buy Mondelez has been met with scepticism from people close to the companies.Another scenario in which PepsiCo would spin-off its snacks business, including Fritos, and would sell it to Mondelez, could be more feasible, these people said.However hedge funds considering following in Mr Peltz’s footsteps said the path to a transaction is unclear, as it would leave PepsiCo as pure soft drinks manufacturer, trailing its main rival, Coca-Cola, and would reverse the strategy of diversification by chief executive Indra Nooyi.Trian has yet to comment in public on its plans. PepsiCo said last month that it has held meetings with the investor “to discuss and consider their ideas and initiatives as part of our ongoing evaluation of all opportunities to drive long term growth and shareholder value”. Mondelez declined to comment.Mr Peltz is highly familiar with the Mondelez business. In 2007, he took a position in Cadbury Schweppes, just before the company split. Cadbury was then taken over in 2010 by Kraft, which last year split itself into the snacks-focused Mondelez and the Kraft Foods grocery business.On Wednesday the activist firm Relation Investors also disclosed a stake in Mondelez worth $340m, making it the company’s 21st largest shareholder.
223;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-04-25T05:01:25Z;Watches and film: Tribeca deal is a bid for the creative high ground;IWC has become the festival’s official ‘time-partner’ in an effort to make an impact on the world via New York, writes Jim Shi;Just as timepieces have consistently played a role on the silver screen, so, too, have sponsorship and direct return on investment gone hand in hand. The reasoning behind the discreet arrival of watchmaker IWC as the Tribeca Film Festival’s official “time-partner”, goes beyond the surface of the dial.“Having a time partnership makes so much sense for filmmakers because you’re always on a deadline, keeping time and [trying to] make your days,” says Jane Rosenthal, the American film producer who, along with her husband, Craig Hatkoff, and Robert De Niro, co-founded the New York festival, now in its 12th incarnation in 11 years.The festival has always had timekeeping relationships. In 2007, Montblanc was a “signature sponsor” and, in 2010, Movado Group’s Ebel brand had a vested role as well. But IWC, through a three-year partnership, is the first brand to wear such a precisely defined partner hat.Oliver Chen, a luxury analyst and vice-president at Citigroup Global Research, believes that sponsorship such as this is derived from the pursuit of projecting a lifestyle image while delivering a message. “For IWC, it evokes a sense of creativity and independence, not to mention a differentiated brand experience,” he says.Watches, like fragrances, have to have a credible luxury brand DNA, which requires reinventing regularly, says Mr Chen. Sponsorship also helps justify premium prices. “You have to believe that the customer of the Tribeca Film Festival is a high-end customer who is part of the address-able market,” he says. “It’s arguably more special.”Georges Kern, IWC chief, agrees, characterising the relationship as symbiotic. “We’re not Coca-Cola, but what we bring to the table, besides money, are many things which are interesting – be it our events, our network of relationships or our brand name,” he says. “Associating our name with such an event is also beneficial to the festival beyond the sponsorship fee.”IWC’s involvement, much like that of ESPN, the US global television network, will also undoubtedly help attract the ever-influential 18-to-25 male demographic to the 12-day festival, attended by 380,000 people last year, at which 488 films were screened.While both parties declined to quantify the exact amount each has spent on the relationship – Ms Rosenthal characterised IWC’s sponsorship as ranking among the top five in dollar terms in a group that includes American Express, Conrad Hotels, Cadillac, Chanel, Oppenheimer Mutual Funds and Pepsi – Mr Kern says the handsome investment is part of IWC’s global strategy to infuse the brand with very strong local involvement that offers international appeal.“We consider this a global investment in the second biggest luxury market in the world,” says Mr Kern, who alluded to more US boutique openings in the coming years. “The investment is substantial, but we digest it. It’s not cheap, but being able to have contact on a local level will have an impact in this big, big town.”Mr Kern says that, while it may not be a mainstream event, it is well recognised. “It’s not the machinery you might have in Cannes, which is huge and lacks intimacy in a way,” he says. “Tribeca has character and is of human size. It has this artistic touch, which we love. We can reach many of our customers in a town that is twice the size of Switzerland.”The sponsorship alsocompletes – for now – IWC’s objective of penetrating its main markets via the arts: it sponsors both the Dubai and Beijing Film Festivals, and has a recognised presence at the Cannes Film Festival.“When you communicate, it can’t just be through advertising or stores,” says Mr Kern. “You have to be personal. We believe that luxury and art and luxury and film fit perfectly,” he says. “We have the world covered and we are quite happy with that.”The approach is not new. Chopard and the Weinstein Company have just entered into their second year as global film partners, encompassing the Golden Globes, Baftas, Oscars, and the Cannes and Venice film festivals.Subtlety of sponsorship is a familiar approach at IWC. As the engineering partner of Formula One Mercedes AMG Petronas, the watchmaker’s logo is nowhere to be found on the vehicles or the drivers’ uniforms. “Still, everyone knows we are part of the race,” says Mr Kern.In other words, it is an overall message to be massaged in over time – no doubt helped by one of the Portuguese Automatic timepieces that was auctioned at Antiquorum with the proceeds benefiting the Tribeca Film Institute, the first IWC timepiece created for a film festival.With only seven US boutiques, IWC’s outlets are dwarfed by those of, say, Rolex or Cartier, but such aligned sponsorship can drive more wholesale distribution in lieu of costly store openings.While minimal, there is risk with such partnerships – particularly when it comes to the impression analysis of the target customer. “Potential customers will decide what the IWC brand stands for,” says Mr Chen, who warns of volatility. “If the Tribeca Film Festival doesn’t resonate with IWC’s brand DNA, then there is something lost.”Mr Kern is adamant that the results of the sponsorship will be a success suggesting to a renewed contract. “All our partnerships do go beyond three years,” he admits. “The question is not whether or not we’ll get great exposure, but, rather, the amplitude of return.”A potential client might take two years to purchase an IWC watch, but seeing the brand’s involvement in Tribeca might be the signal that seals the deal.Ms Rosenthal says that any good partnership, particularly one that is in the honeymoon phase, grows by maintaining open channels of communication.“They tell stories with their timepieces and we tell stories with our films,” says Ms Rosenthal. “It’s an authentic, genuine fit. We like that.”
224;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Tim Davie confident he can grow BBC Worldwide;;On the evening in November when George Entwistle resigned as BBC director-general, Tim Davie was preparing to watch the James Bond film Skyfall at his local cinema.Having been appointed only a month earlier to the role of chief executive of BBC Worldwide, the broadcaster’s commercial arm, Mr Davie had barely arrived at the theatre when his mobile phone rang.The caller was Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, the broadcaster’s governing body. Lord Patten needed someone to regain control of the crisis engulfing the broadcaster over how it had handled allegations of abuse by its former presenter Jimmy Savile, and asked Mr Davie to step up to become acting director-general.Mr Davie describes the experience, which lasted almost five months and involved high-profile appearances on BBC’s Newsnight and before the culture, media and sport select committee as “intense and rewarding in pretty much equal measure”.“A time of corporate crisis is never a happy time for an organisation. It was a situation that you wouldn’t ask for,” he recalls.Having now formally taken over this month as head of Worldwide, Mr Davie’s new role could be almost as challenging.The former marketing manager for PepsiCo has inherited a more restricted commercial remit for Worldwide, which sells and commissions programming for global markets, to fit in more closely with the broadcaster's public purpose.The move coincided with controversy that it had over-reached its authority, illustrated by the recent sale of Lonely Planet. The BBC sold the travel guide publisher last month for £51.5m, representing a 60 per cent loss on the price it paid.The tighter remit will put certain commercial deals out of bounds. Some media commentators believe this will lead to a fall in revenues at Worldwide and, in turn, reduced payouts to the BBC. But Mr Davie is confident that he can continue to grow both profits and revenues, arguing that Worldwide has a “real opportunity for growth”.His predecessor John Smith, now chief operating officer at the Burberry fashion house, was credited with delivering strong financial performance in his eight years at the helm of Worldwide.Worldwide’s revenues topped £1bn last year, up from £657m in the financial year 2003-04, while profits rose 8 per cent on the year to £155m. Since 2004, the commercial arm has returned more than £1.3bn to the public service broadcaster, a substantial benefit to the UK taxpayer.Mr Davie will also have to negotiate Worldwide’s often delicate relationship with the independent sector. Some leading broadcasting figures such as David Elstein, former chief executive of Channel 5 and chair of think tank the Broadcasting Policy Group, have called for the division to be sold off.Apparently sensitive to the issue, Mr Davie insists Worldwide can be a “leader in showcasing” the UK’s “indie” sector around the globe.He says the BBC is “unique in the range and quality of content we offer” allowing it to capitalise on the proliferation of channels from pay and free-to-air TV through to video-on-demand and DVD sales.But he believes Worldwide must better exploit its content commercially. Having worked in the “tough commercial markets” where PepsiCo operates, Mr Davie says he is well equipped to do so. For example, he is keen that more of the BBC’s sizeable back catalogue should be made available online.Worldwide needs to continue to work on how it distributes BBC content globally. He says: “If you end up in a position where you are wedded to a traditional distribution model, your vulnerability has become exceptionally high.”There are also untapped merchandising and innovation opportunities around content, he says, pointing to a deal agreed in 2011 with Sega, the games developer. It runs visitor centres themed around BBC Earth, the global brand for the BBC’s natural history content.Calling on his brand management expertise, he wants to project a stronger and more cohesive BBC brand globally so that viewers and listeners in India and São Paulo get a more unified experience, albeit with “local relevance”.Success at Worldwide would put Mr Davie in a strong position to succeed Lord Hall, who took over as director-general earlier this month.Would he be interested in the position in the future?Having applied for the post in the past, the ambition of Mr Davie – a marathon runner who once ran the 48 miles from his home to work nonstop for charity – is barely disguised.“We’ll see,” he replies. “You never know where events will take you.”Age: 461991: graduates from Selwyn College, Cambridge2005: joins BBC from PepsiCo as director of marketing, communications and audiences2008: becomes head of audio and music at the BBCNovember 2012: appointed BBC acting director-generalApril 2013: takes over as chief executive of BBC Worldwide
225;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
226;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Snack demand and price rises lift PepsiCo;;Demand for snack foods and higher prices lifted PepsiCo’s revenues, beating expectations in the first quarter even as its profits were hit by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.Revenue at the maker of Pepsi sodas, Doritos snacks and Tropicana juices rose 1 per cent to $12.58bn, ahead of an expected $12.53bn. Pepsi is more than a year into a turnround effort that has seen the company reinvest in its biggest brands, including its namesake cola, Lays crisps and Quaker oatmeal.Indra Nooyi, chief executive, said the company was “squarely on track” to meet its goals. “We feel good about these results in what has been a competitive landscape and a volatile macroeconomic environment,” she said.PepsiCo shares closed up 3 per cent at $81.25 on Thursday.Sales growth was led by the Frito-Lay North America food business, which increased US market share as sales volume rose 4 per cent. PepsiCo cited demand for salty snacks, including higher-priced hummus and pita chips. The company also reported strong performance in emerging markets.Global snack sales were up 4 per cent. Beverage sales rose 1 per cent worldwide, as stronger international increases were offset by a 3 per cent decline in the Americas, where US appetite for sugary carbonated drinks has been waning.“The cola category continues to be a challenge” in Pepsi’s home market, Ms Nooyi said. The company has lost market share to Coca-Cola in the US and said pricing competition for fizzy drinks had been “aggressive” in the early part of the quarter.She also warned that while Pepsi has seen an uptick in demand for tea, juice, ready-to-drink coffee and sports drinks, its wide portfolio of drinks meant that expansion in one category risked sapping others.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo, said that while the results were “decent”, she “remain[ed] concerned about the health of the beverage business”.Net income fell 5 per cent to $1.08bn, or 69 cents a share, from $1.13bn, or 71 cents a share, a year ago.That included a 7 cents per share impact from Venezuela’s devaluation of the bolívar in February. Profit was also reduced by the impact of commodity hedges and restructuring charges. Excluding those effects, core profits were 77 cents a share, ahead of the 71 cents forecast by Wall Street.Pepsi reaffirmed its full-year outlook of 7 per cent earnings growth this year from 2012’s core earnings of $4.10 per share. It plans to save $900m this year as part of a broader programme of $3bn in cost cuts by 2014.But Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, warned analysts against raising their own forecasts for 2013. “The world remains a volatile place,” he said.Earlier this week, Coca-Cola announced a revamp of its US distribution model intended to help cut costs and improve margins. Pepsi has also said it is reviewing a restructure of its US drinks business but will not announce any changes before next year.
227;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-04-14T16:56:38Z;Activists hope to profit when cookie crumbles;;Activist investors are salivating at the chance to profit from the companies that make Oreo cookies and Fritos chips, with Nelson Peltz and Bill Ackman both taking stakes in Mondelez, and Mr Peltz joining Ralph Whitworth in targeting PepsiCo.Mr Peltz of Trian Partners has amassed his stakes in PepsiCo and Mondelez in recent months, according to people familiar with the situation. The size of his stakes is not yet known, but they are “large”, according to a person familiar with the situation.Mr Ackman disclosed his nearly 6m shares in Mondelez, worth about $182m, in a regulatory filing on Friday. He began building the stake in the Oreo cookie maker last year but only disclosed it last week.Mr Whitworth, who runs Relational Investors, bought into PepsiCo last year and owns about 7.6m shares worth $600m.The motives of all three men remain unclear. Speculation that Mr Peltz will push for PepsiCo to buy Mondelez has been met with scepticism by people close to the companies.Another scenario in which PepsiCo spun off its snacks business – which includes Fritos – and sold it to Mondelez, could be more feasible, these people said. People in Mr Whitworth’s camp have tacitly endorsed that idea.It remains to be seen whether any of the men will campaign for the companies to reduce costs, a common activists’ tactic.Shares in both PepsiCo and Mondelez are up more than 10 per cent each over the past three months.This is not Mr Peltz’s first time round with these companies. In 2007, he took a position in Cadbury Schweppes, just before the company split. Cadbury was bought in 2010 by Kraft, which last year split itself into the snacks-focused Mondelez and the Kraft Foods grocery business.Mondelez has struggled since the split, with net income falling 29 per cent year on year in the three months to September.Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and chief executive, has said she is bullish, pointing to Mondelez’s presence in fast-growing emerging markets, which account for about 45 per cent of sales. It has also suffered because 36 per cent of sales come from recessionary Europe.Mondelez said it had created significant value: “We remain focused on leveraging our advantaged category mix, leading market positions and strong geographic footprint to deliver top-tier financial performance and enhance value for all our shareholders.”PepsiCo, Mr Peltz and Mr Ackman declined to comment. Mr Peltz’s stakes in Mondelez and Pepsi were first reported by the Daily Telegraph.
228;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-04-14T12:05:30Z;Indian Premier League faces brand battle;;The sight of Australian cricketer Ricky Ponting flying through the air to take a dramatic one-handed catch brought a stadium of cheering fans to their feet in Mumbai last week, with tens of millions more tuning in outside to watch as the Indian Premier League returned for its sixth season.But while the IPL’s mix of star foreign players and Bollywood glitz draws sports aficionados and corporate sponsors alike to the world’s most lucrative cricket tournament, it has yet to solve a problem facing its teams – almost none of whom turn a profit.Indian cricket is a big money spinner, in theory at least. Since its 2008 launch the IPL, which involves a zippy three-hour version of the otherwise slow-moving sport, has won a series of large sponsorship packages, including a 10-year broadcasting deal with Sony, worth $1.6bn.Some doubts surfaced last season, when ratings declined and high-profile sponsors didn’t renew contracts. But matters now seem to have reverted to India’s cricket-crazed norm, with viewing figures bouncing back, and the IPL unveiling another Rs4bn ($74m) deal with beverage group Pepsi.All this income helped the tournament to build a brand worth $2.9bn last year, according to consultancy Brand Finance, while earning handy profits for its main backers, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, the sport’s governing body.Not so the teams. Reliable figures are hard to find, but most observers say leading franchises such as the Mumbai Indians, owned by billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani and for whom Mr Ponting wields his bat, are lossmaking.“I can’t imagine them being profitable,” says a senior executive at a rival team, speaking on condition of anonymity, an analysis that holds true for all but one or two of the tournaments nine participants.Rich players are part of the problem: the IPL has a salary cap, but many spend up to the $12.5m limit, while also finding crafty ways to pay extra to their most valuable stars.Broadcasting income is relatively static, while a combination of cost-conscious fans and rampant piracy limits the ability to sell expensive team-branded kit. Rickety Indian stadiums also make fancy corporate hospitality packages difficult.Add to this the franchise fees each team must pay the IPL every season, and finances look stretched. “The game has great glamour, but people now realise losses can be huge too,” says Avinash Kalia, a director at PwC, who has studied the game’s finances.This doesn’t seem to trouble every team, many of which are run as playthings for high-rolling Indian tycoons with extensive lossmaking experience.Vijay Mallya is one example: the owner of near-bankrupt Kingfisher Airlines also backs the IPL’s high-spending Bangalore franchise. Subrata Roy, head of troubled property conglomerate Sahara and owner of the Pune Warriors, is another.Nonetheless some are trying to up their game, either by cutting player costs, or experimenting with new money-making ventures.The Rajasthan Royals this year teamed up with an international travel agency, for instance, to try and to entice cricket-loving foreign visitors to its matches.Others such as Chennai and Kolkata, have launched fee-paying members’ clubs. “Each of the teams is doing their bit,” says Sundar Raman, the IPL’s chief operating officer.Behind these there lies a trickier problem, however, of how to build up a loyal urban fan-base willing to spend money throughout the year, when the tournament itself lasts for only eight weeks.“Indian cricket has always been a national sport, and loyalty has been with the national team. So to suddenly expect people to be big supporters of a team based on a city for such a short event is hard,” says Venky Mysore, the former head of MetLife in India, and now chief executive of the Kolkata Knight Riders.Kolkata is one of the IPL’s few profitable teams, helped along by its victory in last year’s tournament. But in the longer-term, Mr Mysore says, persuading more of India’s rising middle class to become loyal team supporters is the only way his team can enter the very top tier of global sporting brands.“Whatever Manchester United make on merchandise or licensing, it makes it because of their huge fan base. It is just going to take us a bit of time to do the same.”

230;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Walmart debt flies off shelves;;Walmart has raised debt at the lowest costs for a company in US debt markets this year, as rock-bottom interest rates continue to benefit global corporate borrowers.The world’s largest retailer sold $5bn in bonds, joining companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and PepsiCo that have tested new lows for corporate bond rates this year while US Treasury yields, the benchmark for this type of debt, remain near historical lows.Walmart sold $1bn in three-year debt with a coupon of 0.6 per cent and $1.25bn in five-year bonds at 1.125 per cent, the lowest interest rates for bonds of that maturity sold in the US this year, according to Standard & Poor’s LCD data. The company also sold an additional $2.75bn in 10 and 30-year securities.The deal was 2.2 times oversubscribed, according to people familiar with the sale, underscoring the strong demand for high-credit quality debt amid a dwindling supply of new securities. Walmart bonds were sold by Barclays, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley and were rated Aa2 by Moody’s, and AA by Standard & Poor’s.The new sale by Walmart “is an excellent opportunity to buy the bonds of the closest thing to a bulletproof retailing credit we know”, said Carol Levenson, director of research at Chicago-based Gimme Credit. “By virtue of its size, geographic diversification, strong free cash flow, and maniacal expense control, Walmart’s credit profile remains stellar.”After a slow start to the second quarter this week on Monday, sales of US high-grade corporate bonds have picked up as borrowers try to squeeze in deals ahead of the start of the US earnings season next week.The combined offers may help push total sales of new debt rated as investment grade to $20bn by Friday, and to as much as $80bn by the end of the month, according to estimates by RBS.Corporate borrowers are taking advantage of a decline in market volatility this week after a scramble over a bailout programme for Cyprus hit global markets at the end of March, analysts said.Demand for investment-grade bonds has remained strong at the start of 2013 even as total returns on the securities have dwindled and US equities rose to record highs. Year-to-date, investors have poured almost $23bn into mutual funds and exchange traded funds that buy investment grade debt. By comparison, funds buying junk bonds saw only $516m in purchases in the same period.
231;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-03-22T09:28:07Z;Sponsoring India’s IPL: how big a deal?;;"Twelve days, five hours, and however many minutes and seconds – the Indian Premier League’s official website is counting down until the start of the annual cricket tournament. As are the people of India.It’s a national obsession that multinationals have cottoned onto and despite the economic gloom, corporates are still spending big bucks on IPL sponsorship.PepsiCo – maker of drinks, snacks and cereals – agreed last November to shell out Rs4bn ($73.7m) to be the IPL’s title sponsor for five seasons. That’s double the amount that DLF, an Indian developer, which paid Rs2bn to be title sponsor for 2008 to 2012, the first five years of the championship.What does PepsiCo get for doubling the money? IPL’s television audiences have dwindled as the initial excitement around the event has settled. In April last year, MEC, a media planning and buying company, found that TV ratings fell 29 per cent between IPL 3 and IPL 4. The study found 16 per cent of viewers said their interest had fallen over the IPL’s first five seasons, and 12 per cent said that they would spend less time watching IPL in 2012 than previously. Doesn’t bode too well for IPL 6.So, why the increased spend? A PepsiCo spokesperson told beyondbrics: “No scale association with cricket is possible in India without a sizeable IPL presence, and therefore bidding for the Pepsi IPL was the perfect fit… We are confident that we will be able to derive tremendous value from Pepsi IPL, which will be multiple times our investment.”As a global fizzy drinks brand which also brings you Gatorade, PepsiCo has a lot to gain from association with a major sporting event to show its commitment to health issues – an issue increasingly in the spotlight, most recently demonstrated by the battle by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg to ban large servings of sugary drinks.Secondly, the hot and hectic Indian cricket season overlaps with a period of high consumption for cold drinks. The PepsiCo spokesperson said: “The timing of the tournament is ideal as it gives us a powerful platform to activate our brands at retail in ways that drive sales. In fact, nearly 50 per cent of the consumption happens in these months.”On top of that, the IPL taps into audiences through several channels, from television and mobile to internet, reaching a broad range of consumers. A spokesperson at Vodafone, another sponsor, told beyondbrics: “IPL has been and remains one of the biggest sporting platforms to reach out to our target audience. It is designed in a way to appeal to a wider spectrum of consumers.”With PepsiCo bagging the big branding opportunity, the Indian press has been filled with stories about upcoming “cola wars”. The Economic Times reckons PepsiCo could be spending up to Rs180m on top of its IPL deal to partner with individual teams. Iits longtime rival Coca-Cola won’t take this lying down. Last month, Coca-Cola hosted Cricket Coaching camps where cricketing star Kiran More coached university-level players, and nutrition and fitness tips were doled out. Once the tournament gets underway, a price war is expected.But while the cost of title sponsorship has doubled, the value of advertising slots during the IPL seems to have dropped over time. Multi Screen Media has the broadcasting rights for the matches; last year it was charging Rs450,000 for 10 seconds of advertising. Take up was low and this year the rate has been reduced to Rs400,000 for ten seconds. It seems to have worked. MSM has almost 25 per cent higher advertising volumes this year and Mona Jain, chief executive of Vivaki Exchange, told Business Standard: “MSM has already closed sponsorship deals of about Rs 542 crore this season. By our estimates, they have another Rs 300 crore to go. They have carefully priced their rates this year, which is helping them get sponsors early.”All eyes in the C-Suite may be on the corporate side of the IPL. But for the Indian public the big news isn’t about big name branding. We’re more worried that the Sri Lankan team will be kept out of Chennai for security reasons after the DMK pulled out of India’s ruling coalition this week. Or worse still, that JLo won’t feature in the opening ceremony.Related reading:

232;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-03-11T17:15:46Z;Tesco TV to quarry customer spending data;;Supermarket groups like Tesco are no strangers to price wars. Now the retail giant is bringing its financial muscle to online video.Last week, Tesco launched Clubcard TV, an online video service similar to Lovefilm or Netflix available for free to the supermarket group’s 16m loyalty card customers.The new platform, which offers access to films and TV shows, is in part a reaction to dwindling sales of DVDs as consumers move online.It is also a bid by Tesco to find new ways to make money from its rich database that tracks millions of its customers’ spending habits. As advertisers seek to get closer to their target customers and more accurately measure the success of campaigns, the data on shopping behaviour is putting big retailers in a strong position.Tesco is not disclosing how much it is investing in its new service. Its initial investment into licensing content for the service will be a small fraction of the sums spent by Lovefilm or Netflix. But over time the supermarket group plans to reinvest its advertising revenues back into the platform to give it a much wider array of films and TV shows.Clubcard TV’s attraction for brands is that it will give them targeted advertising opportunities based on actual purchases. So a nappy brand would not just be able to target households with young families, it could also ensure that its ads only reach those homes that buy a rival product.Tesco will also give its advertisers post-campaign reports, allowing brands to track how their advertising has translated into actual sales. Advertisers that have signed up for the launch include Kellogg’s, Colgate and Danone.The proposition for potential advertisers is a compelling one. The difficulty for Tesco, according to analysts, is achieving anywhere near the same scale with its video platform as it has in retail. As Benedict Evans, analyst at Enders Analysis, puts it, Tesco is aiming its service at “the people who’ve spent 15 years looking at ads for Sky TV and who’ve said ‘no’.”Yet the bigger trend is of retailers wising up to the power of their customer data. Amazon is also already personalising ads on its website using data collected on the shopping activities of its 188m active customers.The actual sales information held by online retailers separate them from internet companies like Google and Yahoo.“With Google it is very much about user intent,” says one digital advertising executive. “But with retailer data, advertisers will be able to target based on actual shopping behaviour. If someone’s already bought something, there’s no point in targeting them.”In the US, TiVo, the connected TV service, has teamed up with Dunnhumby, a London-based data analytics group that tracks shopping habits, to feed back the success of campaigns to advertisers.Tom Rogers, president and chief executive of TiVo, says companies like Procter & Gamble and Kraft have seen “real results” through targeting based on actual purchasing data.He says that, by using such shopping information, a company like Pepsi could target TV ads solely at “flip-flop” customers – those who interchange their purchases between Coke and Pepsi. They can then track the success of these campaigns by analysing subsequent changes in purchase behaviour.Later this year, BSkyB is launching ‘addressable’ advertising on its pay TV platform allowing brands to run tailored TV ads during live broadcasts. So a company like Ford could run different ads – for example, show family carriers only to family homes and top of the range models to households earning above a certain income.Sky also monitors a viewing panel of 500,000 homes giving granular data on viewing habits. This offers significant audience measurement potential for advertisers, particularly when tied in with actual sales data. This is where the huge audience of Amazon globally or of Tesco in the UK – where the supermarket chain accounts for 16 per cent of all retail sales – can come in.The detailed sales information of big retailers is making them hugely attractive both for brands. The challenge for these retailers is using and sharing this data without undermining consumer trust.
233;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-03-08T13:32:35Z;Blackstone to refinance London office block;;Blackstone has lined up Deutsche Bank to refinance an £800m London office campus after failing to find a buyer for the development, paving the way for what is likely to be one of the largest commercial property transactions of the year.The US private equity group is expected to confirm the deal on Friday, having been in discussions with a host of lenders, understood to include Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and will then focus on finding a buyer for the 1.5m sq ft site.Deutsche will provide £400m of senior debt secured against Chiswick Park, leaving Blackstone still needing to arrange the refinancing of £200m of mezzanine debt on the project. That process will be completed in the next few days, according to people familiar with the matter.The refinancing of the sprawling complex, whose tenants include Pepsi, Swarovski, QVC and Tullow Oil, has been closely followed by the property market as a sign of lending appetite among mainstream banks.The deal, which will extend the debt on Chiswick Park to 2019, is being viewed by Blackstone as part of “readying the site for a sale”, one person close to the matter said.The refinancing has been organised by Eastdil Secured, while CBRE have been mandated to find a buyer for the project.Blackstone first put the site up for sale late last year. It attracted interest from a number of sovereign wealth funds, including CIC, China’s state-backed fund.If the asking price is met, the sale of Chiswick Park would also be a fillip to Blackstone. The private equity group bought the property from a consortium of Aberdeen Asset Management, Schroders and Stanhope at the start of 2011 for £480m.Blackstone announced last month that it was starting construction of the final phase of Chiswick Park. The complex is 99 per cent leased, with annual rents being arranged at slightly more than £45 per sq ft.Overseas investor interest in the London office market has risen strongly in the past 18 months. The combination of stable yields and the kudos of owning property in the European financial centre have kept the prices buoyant in spite of the problems in the eurozone.Blackstone and its advisers declined to comment on the process.
234;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-02-22T19:21:53Z;Prokhorov sells out of gold;;"Mikhail Prokhorov is slimming down his business empire in a move that has Moscow gossips wondering if the Russian billionaire has finally decided to focus on politics.After selling his $3.6bn stake in Polyus Gold, Russia’s biggest gold miner, this week, Prokhorov is in talks to divest his electricity assets.Prokhorov’s Onexim Group said on Friday it had sold its entire 37.8 per cent stake in London-listed Polyus Gold for $3.62bn to a group of investors after the UK Takeover Panel gave the green light for the deal.Onexim said Lizarazu Ltd, an investment group associated with Zelimkhan Mutsoev, a shareholder in Uralkali, had bought 18.5 per cent of Polyus for $1.77bn . A further 19.3 per cent of Polyus was sold for $1.85bn to Gavril Yushvaev, a former shareholder in Wimm Bill Dann, the Russian dairy and juice producer that was bought by Pepsi Co in 2010.By buying the Polyus stakes separately, the businessmen avoided UK Takeover Panel rules that would have required a mandatory offer to buy out minority shareholders in the gold company.This is how Dmitry Razumov, Onexim chief executive, explained the decision to sell the Polyus stake. In the light of the offer “that was received and our view of the balance between the company’s achievements and its potential we made the decision that the time had come for Onexim Group to sell and realise its profit.”The statement has a political ring – on the surface sensible, but not terribly convincing.Onexim has not confirmed reports that it was negotiating to sell Quadra, its electricity and heat producing group, to a unit of Gazprom. However, industry sources said the talks that have been underway since late last year were drawing to a conclusion.Sources close to Quadra said Prokhorov, who ran in the Russian presidential election last year, was pulling away from business to devote his energy to politics.With a personal fortune of $13.2bn according to Forbes magazine, Prokhorov is not short of cash to run a political campaign. So if the tycoon really is selling up to focus on politics it’s presumably to avoid accusations of conflict of interest.Prokhorov’s other business interests include a 17 per cent stake in Rusal, the Russian metals group and various media holdings including Snob, a glossy magazine launched in 2010 that targets intellectual Russian liberals.Political analysts have often portrayed Prokhorov as a Kremlin stooge who will never take steps to challenge the strategic interests of the regime. Prokhorov came in third with 8 per cent of the vote in the presidential election last year that secured a third term for Vladimir
Putin. Since then he has formed Civic Platform, his own political party, and pledged to devote his time to politics.Rumours have been circulating that Prokhorov might seek to become mayor
of Moscow since the billionaire was spotted lunching with Yuri Luzhkov, former Moscow mayor, in a restaurant in the Russian capital last month.Moscow gossips say Prokhorov could hang on to his media interests and style himself as a Russian version of Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York and founder of the Bloomberg news agency.Related reading:

235;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;OFT will take the fizz out of Britvic merger;Bizarre ruling leaves the deal with AG Barr dead;“If this is industrial policy, I’m a Frenchman.” Gerald Corbett is seldom short of something to say, but it’s hard to disagree with his latest bon mot, as the Office of Fair Trading dispatched the merger between Britvic, where he is chairman, and AG Barr to the Competition Commission. Mr Corbett, the former chief executive of the former Railtrack, is used to blows from the authorities, but this one was as unexpected as it is bizarre.The Office of Fair Trading mulled the mixing of Irn-Bru and Pepsi for months and what had seemed like a routine wave-through will now turn into a thorough examination of Britain’s fizzy drinks industry. This will conclude with the bleedin’ obvious, that Coca-Cola dominates it, that Barr Britvic would be a distant second, and that not even Coke can dictate terms to the supermarkets.The decision defies common sense, but it is the leisurely pace of the regulators that does real damage. The Commission will take until the summer to rule, more than a year since the two sides began merger talks. The original terms will be hopelessly out of date by then. If Britvic (much the bigger partner) can avoid further Fruit Shoot own-goals, its instantly appointed new CEO will be reluctant to see the Barr boys take over the top slots.In short, this deal – as close to a genuine merger as it ever gets – is now dead. Both companies are perfectly capable of continuing on their own, but the efficiency savings are lost, and they walk forever in the shadow of Coca-Cola. Is this really the best outcome for UK plc?Prof Colin Mayer of the Saïd Business School thinks the corporation exists purely for the enrichment of its owners and needs to be brought under wider control. In Firm Commitment, published this week (OUP), he is whacking the greedy shareholders, especially those horrid short-term traders. In his view, corporations cannot exist purely for their enrichment, but “to make and do things that are of benefit to us all”.The prof has certainly caught the zeitgeist. Big companies make easy targets, whether they are abusing the food chain or abusing financial ignorance. He wants “trustees” to oversee their activities because “it is damaging to . . . pay large dividends when companies require money to invest”. This is a strange charge. Shareholders in banks, for example, can’t remember when they last had a dividend. Shares, generally, have been a road to genteel poverty over the past decade.He is on stronger ground criticising executives who are “paid astronomical salaries to deliver mediocre performance”. A CEO whose bonus is based on profits may veto investments that would damage them next year, however attractive the longer-term prospects. Prof Mayer’s solution is to give long-term shareholders more say.There is some evidence that family involvement does help performance, as at DMGT, AB Foods and BSkyB (although not at J Sainsbury). Family control aside, there’s the question of defining a long-term holder, and how much more say. Best of luck with that.Big companies are an inescapable part of our lives. Prof Mayer may prefer the John Lewis model or the BBC, but the BBC has its own tax base, while the founders of Google and Microsoft show no sign of giving the business to their employees. Until entrepreneurs start behaving like John Spedan Lewis, the corporation, greedy shareholders, overpaid executives and all, seems likely to dominate the capitalist economy.A nice twist to Vince Cable’s revived idea of giving us all shares in Royal Bank of Scotland: Richard Woolnough of M&G’s Bond Vigilantes suggests parcelling the shares into million-pound lots and offering them as prizes in a jumbo National Lottery. The mechanism is already there and it would create 13,000 new millionaires. Given our enthusiasm for gambling at silly odds, ticket sales would cover the government’s embarrassment at having to write off the investment.

The benchmark closed 0.1 per cent higher to 1,521.38, its highest mark since December 2007.The initial drop came as the US market took in data from the eurozone, which showed that the region’s economies shrank in the fourth quarter.The worries sapped momentum from stocks just as investors learnt of a fresh round of dealmaking on Wall Street.Heinz rose 19.9 per cent to $72.50 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity group 3G Capital said they would take the US food group private in a $28bn cash deal. The deal values shares in Heinz at a 20 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price, and shareholders are set to receive $72.50 a share. Class B-shares in Berkshire Hathaway climbed 1.3 per cent to $99.21.Constellation Brands jumped 37.2 per cent to $43.75 as the wine company said it would acquire a Mexican brewery and the US rights to the Corona and Modelo brands from Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s biggest beer maker by revenue, for $2.9bn.US Airways shares lost 4.6 per cent to $13.99 after the airline said it was set to merge with AMR Corporation , the parent company of American Airlines, in a deal with a combined equity value of $11bn.The other two major US benchmarks were mixed for the day. The Nasdaq Composite index crept 0.1 per cent higher to 3,198.66. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 13,973.39.While stocks have been relatively muted this week, some investors said the S&P 500, which is up 6.7 per cent for the year after six consecutive weekly gains, still has room to climb.“The [benchmark’s] advance may be in need of a rest, but not rest in peace, in our opinion,” said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ. “Despite ongoing political uncertainties and not too distant resistance levels, market multiples appear either fairly valued or modestly attractive to us.”Fresh US labour market data showed that the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment fell more than expected last week.Cisco lost 0.7 per cent to $21.00 after the computer networking equipment maker said sales in its China business declined 4 per cent in the three months to late January.General Motors lost 3.2 per cent to $27.75 even as the carmaker said losses from its European business deepened.PepsiCo gained 1.1 per cent to $72.28 as the food and beverage company said fourth-quarter net profits were above analysts’ forecasts.BlackBerry erased early losses and gained 7.8 per cent to $15.08 as the smartphone maker’s co-founder and former chief executive disclosed he had sold his remaining stake in the company.Whole Foods, the upscale grocery chain, fell 9.7 per cent to $87.49 after it said same-store sales had softened so far this quarter. Analysts at Credit Suisse said the company “verified recent fears of a slowdown in its robust momentum, as the recent consumer weakness has begun to impact its sales and earnings trends”.Merck rose 0.1 per cent to $41.19 as the healthcare company said it would pay $688m to settle two shareholder lawsuits.Shares in football club Manchester United lost 0.9 per cent to $18.54 as the company reported that sponsorship revenues continued to climb in its latest quarterly figures.
237;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-02-14T21:33:51Z;Food business drives PepsiCo profits;;PepsiCo, the US drinks and snacks company, reported a stronger than expected rise in fourth-quarter profits on Thursday thanks to strong sales in its food business.Net income at PepsiCo rose 19 per cent year on year to $1.66bn, or $1.06 a share, in spite of a slip in revenues, which declined 1 per cent to $19.9bn.The results were better than Wall Street analysts predicted and shares of PepsiCo rose 1.1 per cent to $72.28.“We’re encouraged by the progress we’re making and expect performance in the coming year to be consistent with our long-term targets,” Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, said in a statement.Revenue in PepsiCo’s US food business rose 3.5 per cent year on year, while its beverage business in the Americas was down 4 per cent. Revenues for food and drinks fell in Asia but increased in Europe.Sales of sparkling beverages in the US – an area of concern for investors in recent years – were down by about 1 per cent during the fourth quarter.Last year PepsiCo announced a “reset” of the company, unveiling an initiative to cut costs and ramp up marketing investment behind its top brands.Although the company has been working to raise the profile of brands such as its flagship Pepsi soda, it has been benefiting lately from its food business and healthier options, as sugary carbonated soft drinks become increasingly demonised by regulators in the US.“We continue to believe the company will have to show more concrete progress in the months ahead to sustain the stock’s recent momentum,” Barclays analysts said ahead of the report. “Meanwhile, 2013 commodity inflation should be considerably more moderate than the $1.5bn expected for 2012, which should set the stage for modest margin improvement this year.”This week Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest soft drinks company by revenues, reported a disappointing quarter because of weakness in Europe and China.
238;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-02-12T22:42:54Z;Coke buoyed by emerging market sales;;Demand from smaller emerging economies boosted Coca-Cola’s fourth-quarter profits, the company said on Tuesday – but flat sales in the US, and weakness in Europe and China, acted as a drag on performance.The world’s largest soft drink company by revenues continues to experience declining appetite for its sparkling beverages and has become increasingly reliant on teas, waters and sports beverages for growth.Muhtar Kent, Coke’s chief executive, said the company faced economic challenges around the world, pointing to the effects of austerity and unemployment in Europe and higher payroll taxes and petrol prices in the US.“Some of the issues surrounding the fiscal cliff weighed on us toward the end of last year,” Mr Kent told the Financial Times. “I am confident the US is going to come out of this, although I still think unemployment is going to be a major societal issue.”Coke has been struggling to drive sales of its sparkling beverages when soft drinks have come under increasing regulatory pressure US. Next month, New York City is expected to impose a ban on “supersized” sugary beverages and Coke has been working with beverage industry lobbyists to fend off soft drink taxes across the US.Ali Dibadj, beverage analyst at Bernstein Research, said weak revenue growth in some of Coke’s biggest markets, along with a greater focus on health and wellness, were a worrying trend for the company – and should make its executives rethink how they operated the business.“They are tiptoeing into realising this is a secular issue,” Mr Dibadj said. “I don’t think more advertising will solve the problem.”Sales volume in Europe fell 5 per cent during the fourth quarter, while US sales rose 1 per cent. Meanwhile, sales climbed 5 per cent in Latin America, 10 per cent in Africa and 2 per cent in Asia.Coke’s net income rose 13 per cent year-on-year to $1.86bn, or 41 cents a share. Net operating revenues were up 4 per cent to $11.45bn.The income results were stronger than Wall Street analysts had projected, but Coke shares fell 2.7 per cent to $37.56, as sales volume was weaker than anticipated.Rival PepsiCo will release its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.
239;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-02-08T20:54:47Z;[snap]: Venezuela devaluates currency;;"It’s finally happened. Venezuela’s government announced Friday that is devaluing the country’s currency.Officials said the fixed exchange rate is changing from 4.30 bolivars to the dollar to 6.30 bolivars to the dollar with immediate effect. It will also be scrapping the currency exchange system known as SITME through which Venezuelans could buy dollars for 5.3 bolivars.So who’s affected?Aside from locals – who just lost a considerable amount of their purchasing power in Venezuela’s import-dependent economy, there will also be some wailing and gnashing of teeth among foreign investors who have invested in the country’s local bolivar bonds.Global consumer goods company aren’t going to be too pleased eitherAs Louise Lucas wrote on beyondbrics back in October:Colgate-Palmolive, which gets about 5 per cent of total sales from Venezuela, is probably the most vulnerable consumer company to a devaluation.A devaluation of the bolivar of 30-50 per cent early next year would wipe out between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent of revenues at Avon and Colgate and trim earnings per share still more, according to Bernstein Research.McCormick, the spice maker and Heinz, best known in the UK for its baked beans both make more than 3 per cent of sales from the country, Bernstein estimates. This, it says, is “despite a 50 per cent devaluation and a continually difficult operating environment over the past few years”.Diageo is another company that has exposure to Venezuela. The world’s biggest distiller has been shipping more bottles of Scotch and other spirits to the country’s drinkers.Any one-off charges, such as the write-down of monetary assets, would hurt too. Avon and Colgate, according to Bernstein, hold more than 15 per cent of their total cash in Venezuela; Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo hold around 10 per cent. Pretty substantial cashpiles to have in a country where the rules tend to the quixotic.More to come on beyondbrics and ft.com"
240;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-02-04T06:31:06Z;Powerless Super Bowl disrupts advertisers;Brands turn to Twitter as outage halts play for half an hour;The Baltimore Ravens held off a resurgent San Francisco 49ers and survived a power outage to win American football’s most lucrative game, the 2013 Super Bowl.Advertisers paid up to $4m to appear in 30-second spots between plays but many of them had an eye to the digital world too, with about half of the ads using Twitter’s “hashtags” to stimulate online discussion after their broadcast.After a flurry of news about how she sang to a backup track during the US presidential inauguration, Beyonce showed up with an all-singing, all-dancing half-time show that also reunited her former group, Destiny’s Child, and was sponsored by Pepsi.CBS, which broadcast the game, remained on the air despite the half-hour power failure in the third quarter, which plunged the New Orleans Mercedes-Benz Superdome into darkness.The broadcaster did not cash in by running extra ads during the interruption, telling Advertising Age that its commitments to advertisers were “being honoured” despite what the industry magazine called “one of the oddest moments in Super Bowl history”.However, the blackout interrupted the plans of some marketers, including Coca-Cola’s two-part desert race ads, and altered the momentum of the game.The Ravens had been leading 28-6 until that point with a strong showing that included a touchdown run the full length of the field. Amid jokes on social media networks that Silicon Valley hackers had intervened on behalf of their home team, the 49ers staged a comeback once power was restored, but were unable to close the gap from the first half.Ravens coach John Harbaugh eventually held his team’s lead to win over his younger brother Jim, who coached the 49ers.A spokesman for the Superdome later apologised for the blackout while the sport’s organising body, the NFL, said it was investigating the cause. In a statement, energy provider Entergy said: “At all times, Entergy’s distribution and transmission feeders were serving the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.”Some fleet-footed brands, including Mercedes rival Audi and Oreo cookies, used Twitter to capitalise on the blackout, with witty takes on the interruption. “Sending some LEDs to the @MBUSA Superdome right now,” tweeted Audi.Oreo and Audi both had TV ads running during the game too, as more brands try to integrate their media campaigns.The TV ad line-up included ambitious spots from Budweiser, including the debut of its new Black Crown beer that tried to appeal to a more sophisticated audience, and Taco Bell, whose depiction of elderly residents escaping from a retirement home to have a wild night out has been building since December.As ever, some ads caused controversy, including web host GoDaddy’s “The Kiss”, accused of sexism as a swimwear model smooched a red-faced nerd, and Volkswagen’s “Get Happy” ad, criticised by some in social media of cultural insensitivity by having a white man parodying a broad Jamaican accent.
241;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-01-29T18:13:45Z;Prokhorov nears sale of Polyus $4bn stake;;Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov is close to selling his up to $4bn stake in UK-listed Polyus Gold, in a deal that would pave the way for a Russian gold mining champion but also raise questions about Polyus’s ownership structure.People familiar with the matter said Mr Prokhorov’s 38 per cent stake was to be sold to Zelimkhan Mutsoyev, a billionaire Duma deputy for Russia’s pro-Kremlin party, and Gavril Yushvayev, a former owner of Russian dairy group Wimm-Bill-Dann now owned by PepsiCo.However, the deal could receive scrutiny from the UK Takeover Panel should it determine that Mr Mutsoyev and Mr Yushvayev were entering the company as partners with each other, or with Suleiman Kerimov, another Russian oligarch whose investment vehicle Nafta controlled 40 per cent of Polyus.Nafta has previously stated it was ready to provide financial or other support for one of the bidders for Mr Prokhorov’s stake, and Mr Kerimov already has a working relationship with Mr Mutsoyev who is his co-shareholder in Russian fertiliser producer UralKali.Industry experts said the deal could pave the way for a long-awaited merger between Polyus and local rival Polymetal, a dream of Mr Kerimov who was able to create a national fertiliser champion out of UralKali and Silvinit in 2010.“[Mr Prokhorov] and Nafta were not seeing eye-to-eye on what to do with the company,” said one western banker in Moscow, noting that Mr Kerimov’s domestic ambitions had clashed with Mr Prokhorov’s plans to expand abroad.Furthering the chances of a Polyus-Polymetal merger are Mr Kerimov’s close links with Alexander Nesis, a billionaire shareholder in both Polymetal and UralKali.Indeed, Mr Kerimov himself held control over Polymetal, a company founded by Mr Nesis, from 2005 to 2008, before selling it back to Mr Nesis and partners.A merger of the two Russian gold miners would theoretically be good for both the companies, said Erik Danemar, a mining analyst at Deutsche Bank. Polyus has a number of upcoming projects in the pipeline, while Polymetal has cash on its balance sheet but is approaching the end of its current investment cycle.Polyus has a number of upcoming projects in the pipeline, while Polymetal is approaching the end of its current investment cycle.According to UK takeover rules, if a concert of shareholders acquired more than 30 per cent this should trigger a mandatory buyout offer for minorities.Once a backroom player among the oligarchs, the Kremlin-friendly Mr Kerimov has emerged out of the shadows in recent years as his relationships with the country’s biggest banks and tycoons fall under the spotlight.A native of Dagestan, the combustive Russian republic in the North Caucasus, Mr Kerimov owns a small stake in state lender VTB, in addition to his holdings in UralKali, Polyus and Anzhi Makhachkala, the Russian football team.Last week, Bloomberg reported that VTB would be helping to fund Mr Mutsoyev and Mr Yushvayev’s acquisition of the Polyus stake.
242;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2013-01-25T19:02:30Z;Coke: Out for the calorie count;A backlash against the group’s anti-obesity ads underscores the dilemma food and drink companies face;When Michael Bloomberg unveiled his plan to ban sales of big sugary drinks last spring, he was ready for a fight. New York’s billionaire mayor had been here before, stubbing out cigarettes in public places and forcing restaurants such as McDonald’s to display calorie counts on their menus. Big Soda was next.Last year New York embarked on an anti-soft drink marketing campaign, with shocking subway advertisements showing obese amputees alongside diagrams displaying growing drink sizes.“I just spent roughly $600m of my own money to try to stop the scourge of tobacco,” Mr Bloomberg scoffed when asked if he feared the well-funded industry’s onslaught. “I’m looking for another cause.”The $75bn industry has launched its response. This week beverage lobbyists took on New York health officials in court to block Mr Bloomberg’s ban on sales of supersized sugary beverages. Outside the courtroom, Coca-Cola, the world’s largest beverage company, was facing a growing backlash against a new advertising campaign intended to portray itself as a combatant in the war against obesity.Around the time of Mr Bloomberg’s proposal, executives from Coca-Cola gathered at their Atlanta headquarters to plan a counter-attack. Pressure over a ballooning obesity epidemic was intensifying and proposals to levy taxes on soft drinks were bubbling up across the US. Coke decided to respond head-on.This month Coke ran two-minute ads on national television. Against a background of slim people sipping Coke and healthy youngsters exercising, a narrator offers a simple summary of the obesity crisis: all calories are created equal. “If you eat and drink more calories than you burn off, then you’ll gain weight,” the ad says as a young woman jogs across the screen.The widely viewed ad quickly drew scorn. Hundreds of people berated Coke on YouTube, and public health advocates cried hypocrisy. Many wondered why Coke had not included any of the millions of obese Americans in the ad. “The idea that Coca-Cola is a force against obesity is ludicrous,” says Marion Nestle, a public health professor at New York University. “They sell liquid candy at a time when the last thing people need are calories with no nutrients attached.”Such a backlash is uncommon for Coke, a company whose marketing machine dreamt up slogans including “things go better with Coke” and “the real thing”. (Coke says it welcomes negative reactions in the spirit of fostering dialogue.) The criticism, however, demonstrates the perilous balancing act food and beverage companies face when they address obesity.“There’s a very important conversation going on about obesity and we want to be part of that,” says Stuart Kronauge, Coke’s head of sparkling beverages in North America.Losing a grip on the conversation would be especially costly at a time when soft-drink sales have declined steadily as consumers shift to teas, juices and water.The beverage industry has been investing to create tastier recipes with fewer calories and has diversified to produce healthier fare. But the experience of PepsiCo, Coke’s leading rival, proves that this can also be fraught with challenges. Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive, made a big push in the direction of healthier “good for you” food and drinks when she took the top job in 2006. The company invested in products such as oatmeal and dairy but was scolded by investors and Wall Street analysts for ignoring its colas. Last year Ms Nooyi ramped up advertising behind Pepsi.The food industry has largely focused on self-regulation in an effort to avoid attention from policy makers. McDonald’s began offering apples and milk in its “Happy Meals” for children and Burger King launched a “better for you” menu with salads, wraps and fruit smoothies. However, some companies are serving healthier food in the US while exporting more artery-clogging items – such as the hot dog stuffed-crust pizza that Pizza Hut sells in the UK – overseas.The beverage industry feels that the range of unhealthy options, as well as declining demand for soft drinks, are important reasons why it should not be singled out with regards to obesity. Susan Neely, president of the American Beverage Association, showed participants at an industry conference last month a chart with falling soft-drink sales and rising obesity rates as evidence that other junk foods, along with a lack of exercise, were to blame for expanding waistlines.However, with states facing budget shortfalls, she warned, the fight against soft-drink taxes was not going away. “We will continue to challenge, wherever there is an onerous tax or onerous regulation in the public domain, and we will be there and we will fight it.”So far beverage lobbyists have been successful at fending off taxes, most recently when a closely watched proposal in Richmond, California failed last November. But other states, including Nebraska, Hawaii and Massachusetts, are considering higher taxes on soft drinks and some cities have pondered following Mr Bloomberg’s lead of imposing portion control.Beverage companies are not the first to face this predicament and the industry has carefully studied the plight of “Big Tobacco”, which saw cigarettes go from symbols of glamour to public health pariahs over a span of four decades.Lori Dorfman, a public health expert at the University of California, Berkeley, says the new Coke commercial harks back to a move by US tobacco companies in 1954. Facing mounting criticism and evidence that cigarettes were linked to cancer, 14 tobacco executives published a “frank statement” in more than 400 US newspapers. The letter acknowledged new research had given publicity to a “theory” that cigarettes were linked to lung cancer, but warned that the experiments were inconclusive.“Statistics purporting to link cigarette smoking with the disease could apply with equal force to any one of many other aspects of modern life,” they wrote. “Indeed the validity of the statistics themselves is questioned by numerous scientists.”…Health advocates today contend that this echoes the logic of beverage companies claiming that all calories are the same. Dr Toni Yancey, a director at UCLA’s Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity, says that even calories from unhealthy foods such as pizza and hamburgers have more nutritional value than those in soft drinks because they are delivered along with useful nutrients such as protein and fibre. “The way the body metabolises a 200-calorie soda is not the same way it metabolises a 200-calorie yam,” Dr Yancey says.Drink makers decry the comparison with the tobacco industry, pointing to their zero-calorie beverages and the fact that cigarettes were never made healthier. In an interview with the Financial Times in 2011, Derek Yach, Pepsi’s former health policy director, made the case that taxation of tobacco worked because it could be applied to the entire product category, but that there was no evidence that consumers would not just switch to other high-calorie drinks if soft drinks were taxed.Different variations of taxation are already under way in Europe. France taxes sugar-sweetened beverages, Denmark taxes saturated fats and Hungary taxes hamburgers. David Cameron, UK prime minister, has also considered a “fat tax” to address Britain’s obesity problem.A 2012 report by the OECD acknowledged that taxes on soft drinks and junk food tended to hit poor people the hardest. However, it concluded that the poor would benefit disproportionately from the health gains resulting from such taxes – and that the revenues are useful for paying down deficits.“Revenues from taxes on unhealthy foods can be substantial,” the OECD says. “These offer invaluable opportunities either for attenuating any regressive impacts or for magnifying the public health effects of the taxes.”As food and drink companies wrestle with regulators and lawmakers over developing fair policies, the burden of obesity on the US economy is growing. The US Centers for Disease Control estimates that 35.7 per cent of American adults are obese, as defined by body mass index, accounting for $147bn in medical costs. That is expected to rise to $210bn in 2030, with at least 44 per cent of adults in every state suffering from obesity.In New York City alone, about $4bn is spent a year on healthcare treatments related to obesity. With such a steep cost, Mr Bloomberg appears unlikely to be dissuaded by opposition from small business groups or a slick advertising campaign from Coke.Making his case last summer, Mr Bloomberg signalled that he was more fearful of the scourge of soft drinks than of tobacco. “People’s lives will be shorter, their quality of life is going to be dramatically reduced and obesity is going to start killing more people in this country than smoking,” he says.

The new additions increase BofA’s total board members from 16 to 18, the company said.“The management team will benefit from the perspectives and experience of these new board members,” Brian Moynihan, BofA chief executive, said in a statement.Mr Donald owns his own private investment firm, AWD Group. Before working at Pepsi, Mr Nowell worked for RJR Nabisco, Pillsbury and Haagen-Daz.Bank of America has been expanding its board in recent months as it prepares for the retirement of several older members. In August, it named four new directors, including Sharon Allen, the former chairman of accounting giant Deloitte, and Linda Hudson, the ex-chairman of the US arm of BAE Systems.“The board welcomes the extensive expertise and judgment Arnold and Lionel bring,” said Charles Holliday, BofA chairman.

245;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Lawmakers demand data on energy drinks;Classification of drinks under scrutiny;US lawmakers stepped up their investigation into energy drinks on Thursday, demanding that companies making products such as Monster, AMP, Red Bull and Rockstar hand over internal documents that prove they are safe.The highly caffeinated drinks have been the subject of government scrutiny in recent months since the US Food and Drug Administration disclosed reports of several deaths associated with Monster and 5-hour Energy.The controversy has also called into question why energy drinks, which are usually sold next to regular beverages such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, are classified as nutritional supplements and face looser regulation.Senators Richard Blumenthal and Richard Durbin and Representative Ed Markey asked 14 energy drink companies to explain why they classify themselves as supplements and to provide information about the caffeine content of their drinks and any safety studies they have undertaken.“One of the major concerns surrounding energy drinks is the potential health risks to children who consume these products,” they wrote. “Furthermore, questions have been raised about the combination of high levels of caffeine with other stimulant ingredients.”Those fears were buttressed by a recent study by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that found emergency room visits linked to energy drinks jumped from 10,000 in 2007 to 20,000 in 2011.The FDA is studying the relationship between caffeine and other stimulants such as guarana and taurine that are in energy drinks. The health regulator said in November that it had not found studies showing those mixes of ingredients to be dangerous.
246;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;S&P 500 poised for new highs in 2013;;After finishing 2012 on a high note, investors believe US equities are bound to extend last year’s run.Progress made in US fiscal negotiations, easing eurozone fears and recent supportive economic data from China and other developing nations may help set the stage for higher corporate profits and stock gains, analysts say.“As we begin the new year, improved confidence is perhaps the result of strides made on many fronts,” says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Mr Paulsen is forecasting that the benchmark S&P 500 will rise to record levels in the year to come, after notching an impressive 13.4 per cent gain in 2012 in spite of recession fears and a jump in global market volatility.But while at the start of last year investors bet heavily on technology companies such as Apple, this time around most are favouring cyclical sectors such as basic materials and industrials.“The sectors that tend to benefit from economic growth will see the most benefit in the coming months,” says Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.The group was among the top performing on Monday, when Wall Street rallied as details of a deal to avoid the looming fiscal cliff started to emerge. New manufacturing data from China also supported bullish sentiment, helping companies such as Cliffs Natural Resources, the international coalminer, record large gains.Oliver Pursche, portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services, says fears of a US recession in 2013, which weighed on stocks in the last quarter, are misplaced.“Economic data both in the US and globally have been fairly robust recently but markets have not recognised these positive developments because all eyes were set on the fiscal cliff debate,” he says.Mr Pursche adds that he has taken some profits ahead of expected increases in capital gains and dividends taxes. He is now betting on stocks of companies with solid balance sheets and dividend policies, and expected revenue and earnings growth of 8 per cent or higher.“One of our favourite sectors is food and beverages,” he says. “We think the group is well positioned to meet those three goals and there’s been a lot of activity. We like companies like Pepsi and Yum Brands, but we are not just focusing on large-caps. There are some opportunities on smaller companies as well.”But not all analysts are as enthusiastic, pointing to potential weakness in consumer confidence and spending patterns, which could inhibit companies’ growth.Barry Knapp, chief US equities strategist at Barclays, says the consumer discretionary sector is particularly vulnerable as household income growth remains weak. Adding further pressure to that group of stocks, which is already reeling from a disappointing holiday selling period, is an expected rise in payroll taxes for many Americans.“That will mean people who are living from pay cheque to pay cheque will see their budgets shrink, putting some pressure on retailers,” Ms Warne adds.Mr Knapp says value retailers, in particular, may bear the brunt. That includes companies such as Macy’s, Sears, Kohl’s, JC Penney and Dillard’s, which saw large gains on Monday after recent weakness. Any relief from higher taxes may provide only a temporary boost to middle-class consumers’ spending habits, he says.Whatever happens in 2013, some investors are just hoping that the attention shifts away from policy makers and back on to the economic fundamentals of companies.J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade, says: “The market has been asking Washington for clarity on the rules but it has instead been held hostage on multiple occasions, adding to people’s worries about their businesses.”
247;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Group to ramp up support for energy drinks;;Beverage industry lobbyists are preparing to increase support for energy drinks, the highly caffeinated sodas that have been criticised in recent months amid allegations that they are linked to deaths.Susan Neely, chief executive of the American Beverage Association, said at a recent industry conference sponsored by Beverage Digest that criticism of energy drinks was a sign of the fast-growing category’s new prominence and a “hyper-vigilance” in the US about health.The ABA is looking to “ratchet up” its support of energy drinks next year, Ms Neely said, after years of focusing most of its efforts on fending off soda taxes across the US. “We are very aggressive,” Ms Neely said. “You have to kill legislation that is being introduced at the state and local level.”Energy drinks such as Monster and 5-Hour Energy have been implicated in several deaths that were reported to the US Food and Drug Administration in recent years. The health regulator revealed the reports last month.Shares of Monster Beverage have been hit amid fears over the reaction from consumers and worries that the industry will face stricter regulations.Monster has defended the safety of its products, dismissing accusations that its energy drinks put consumers at risk.According to a new report from Consumer Edge Research, 20 per cent of 1,500 consumers surveyed in recent weeks have stopped drinking Monster and 7 per cent of those consumers said they have turned to other beverages because of the recent reports.Monster’s drinks contain up to 10 times the amount of caffeine used in regular sodas made by companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. However, beverage lobbyists argue that the caffeine content is similar to that of coffee brewed in shops.“Are you going to start banning people from going to Starbucks or banning people from going to the coffee house next door, because there is more caffeine in those products?” Ms Neely said.In response to inquiries from lawmakers, the FDA has promised to investigate links between caffeine and other stimulants that are included in energy drinks. So far no safety risks have been found, the FDA said in November.Michael Taylor, the FDA’s deputy commissioner on foods, told the Financial Times that the regulator was “taking a very hard look” at the effects of mixing caffeine with other stimulants and that it was taking reports linking the products to deaths seriously.“We need to get to the bottom of the public health issue behind those reports,” Mr Taylor said.Energy drinks face looser regulations than traditional beverages because they classify themselves as supplements. Mr Taylor acknowledged that the distinction between beverages and liquid supplements is blurry and said the FDA would provide clear guidance on this in the next few months.
248;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Orange juice prices rise on US supply concerns;;Orange juice prices jumped to a three-month high as concerns about falling supplies pushed the New York market up more than 10 per cent over the past two days.The US government surprised investors by cutting its Florida orange crop estimates for the 2012-13 marketing season to 146m 90 pound boxes, down 5 per cent from its October forecast and slightly lower than a year before.The citrus industry of Florida is the world’s second largest, behind Brazil’s São Paulo state, and produces about 15 per cent of global orange supplies. The US orange juice sector is worth some $10bn, with prices of the commodity affecting farmers in Florida, global trading houses and companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.The US Department of Agriculture said that Navel orange varieties in Florida were forecast at 67m boxes, down 9 per cent from the October forecast and down 10 per cent from last season. It warned that the projected droppage, or the amount of fruit falling from the trees before ripening, was the highest since the 1969-1970 season while size is projected to be below average.Forecasts for Florida’s Valencia oranges, the slightly higher quality fruit, stood at 79m boxes, down 1 per cent from the October forecast but up 9 per cent from the 2011-2012 crop.Frozen orange juice prices on ICE Futures US exchange hit $1.3825 a pound, the highest level since September. The market has rallied more than 10 per cent over Monday and Tuesday, and was trading at $1.365 a pound, up 5 per cent from the day before.With the arrival of winter in the northern hemisphere, citrus experts and investors are now watching for freezing weather and potential damage to fruits. “Some of the long range forecasts call for below normal temperatures in Florida this winter, and this has created some buying by speculators in recent sessions,” said Jack Scoville at Price Futures Group in Chicago.In its crop report for November, the USDA said that some of the citrus growing areas in Florida had faced drought conditions. “Rainfall was very sparse across the citrus producing region for most of the month, ranging from around a half inch in some areas to none at all in others,” it said.The orange juice market is prone to volatility on reports of bad weather as well as disease and drug related news. Prices are still well below the record $2.2695 per pound set at the start of the year when US health authorities restricted imports of Brazilian juice due to the use of a banned fungicide.
249;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;GSK in EM: it’s not about the drugs;;"More signs that Big Pharma is determined to further expand its footprint in emerging markets, with GlaxoSmithKline on Monday inking two new deals worth more than £650m ($1bn) in India and Nigeria.The transactions – which will see the UK-based pharmaceuticals group increase its stake over two of its leading subsidiaries – are noteworthy. Whereas most of the industry’s past M&A efforts in EMs have been focused on securing new drugs and generics, GSK’s latest move is aimed at strengthening its presence in the consumer healthcare product space.Faced with withering pipelines and patent expiries, pharmaceutical groups have shifted their focus to EMs, where rising incomes are translating into higher drug spendings.But in India, where GSK said it would pay Rs52.2bn (£591m) to up its stake in its publicly-listed consumer healthcare subsidiary from 43.2 per cent to as much as 75 per cent, non-pharmaceutical products – led by Horlicks, a malt-based nutritional drink mix similar to Ovaltine – have also become serious money spinners.So how big is Horlicks in India? Pretty big.The brand, which sells 3.5bn cups a year in India, outsells both Pepsi and Coca-Cola in the country and accounts for ₤270m of the company’s ₤380m annual sales in India, according to David Redfern, GSK’s chief strategy officer.Its success helped boost GSK’s non-pharmaceutical product sales in India by 19 per cent last year, compared to the 1 per cent sales rise in the US and a 1 per cent drop in Europe in the nine months to the end of September 2011.The move to take majority control of the subsidiary would allow GSK to focus on the extension of Horlicks and its other existing “power brands” such as Lucozade, the sports drink, according to Redfern.As Zubair Ahmed, who heads the subsidiary told Bloomberg in an interview in January, this could take the form of extending the Horlicks brand to sell instant noodles, breakfast cereals and biscuits. There is also plans to introduce a ready-t0-drink versions of the powdered drink.It’s a similar story in Nigeria, where GSK said it would pay 15.4bn naira (£62m) to increase its stake in the local consumer healthcare subsidiary from 46.4 per cent to 80 per cent.In Nigeria, sales of its consumer health brands including Panadol, Sensodyne, Horlicks and Lucozade account for 70 per cent of turnover, with the remainder coming from vaccines and pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics such as Augmentin.Although they have lower margin, consumer products provide steady, low-risk revenue growth without patent expiration and requires lower development costs than pharmaceutical products. On the demand side, demand for infant nutrition product is booming as the battle over Pfizer’s baby food business earlier this year showed.In October, GSK reported a fall in earnings that was deeper than market expectations, driven by poor sales in Europe, a fall in drug prices and a shift to lower-cost generics. During the period, Glaxo’s consumer health-care unit recorded ₤3.9bn in sales, or 19 per cent of global revenue.With the market for consumer health products also on the rise in China and Latin America, don’t be surprised if GSK pulls off similar deals in those regions as well.Shares in GSK closed down 1.2 per cent to ₤13.30 in London.Related reading:

250;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
251;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-11-26T16:30:13Z;GSK to take greater control of subsidiaries;;GlaxoSmithKline signalled its growing appetite for consumer healthcare products in emerging markets with plans to spend more than ₤650m to strengthen control over two of its leading subsidiaries quoted on local stock markets.The UK-based pharmaceuticals group will pay Rs3,900 a share to increase its take from 43.2 per cent to 75 per cent in its pivotal Indian division, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, in a deal worth ₤591m and representing a 28 per cent premium to the unit’s closing share price last week.The move further increases its control over local sales of Horlicks, the malt-based nutritional drink mix launched more than a century ago and which has become one of India’s leading consumer brands, outstripping sales of Pepsi and Coca-Cola in the country.It will also pay ₤62m to increase its stake in GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria from 46.4 per cent to 80 per cent with a tender at N48 a share, again a 28 per cent premium to Friday’s price.The actions reflect GSK’s commitment to expanding over-the-counter product sales in developing countries, while operating in markets with very different regulatory requirements to the UK.In October, GSK reported a fall in earnings that was deeper than market expectations, driven by poor sales in Europe, a fall in drug prices and a shift to lower-cost generics.David Redfern, GSK’s chief strategy officer, said the company would not take full charge of the subsidiaries partly because there were no “squeeze out” rules governing the buyout of minorities in quoted companies in the two countries.Horlicks, which sells 3.5bn cups a year in India, accounts for ₤270m of the company’s ₤380m annual sales in the country, and GSK would focus on extensions of this and its other existing “power brands”, he said.There would be no significant operational or strategic shift as a result of the deals, and GSK has already fully accounted for the results and assets of the subsidiary, Mr Redfern said. But he added that the company was likely to expand the capacity of existing factories in India and boost distribution in the north and rural areas of the country.Mr Redfern said there were no plans for GSK to increase its stake in its prescription pharmaceuticals business in India, in which it controls a little over the majority of the shares.In Nigeria, sales of its consumer health brands including Panadol, Sensodyne, Horlicks and Lucozade account for 70 per cent of turnover, with the remainder coming from vaccines and pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics such as Augmentin.“You have to be patient in Africa but it’s more politically and economically stable than it’s ever been,” said Mr Redfern. “It comes from a slow foundation but is steadily growing. We are positive, particularly on the consumer side.”
252;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-11-22T08:11:51Z;Pepsi deal: IPL still has plenty of fizz;;"How goes the health of the world’s most lucrative cricket tournament? Bubbly, at least if Pepsi’s decision to spend $72m to become the Indian Premier League’s “title” sponsor for the next five years is any indication.The US-based soft-drink group beat telco Bharti Airtel for the rights, in a contest that raised around a third more than analysts expected. The deal also earns the league’s organisers roughly twice the amount paid by DLF, an Indian real estate group, for the rights at the league’s inception in 2008.The event will now be re-named as the Pepsi-IPL when its 6th season begins in April, while Pepsi claimed on Wednesday that the deal made it the largest financial supporter of cricket around the world.The move is also part of a more domestic battle, however, in which the group is trying to maintain its lead over Coca-Cola in India — a market unusual for the fact that neither brand is the nation’s best-selling fizzy drink, but where both use cricket sponsorship to tempt new customers.But it is the IPL itself that is arguably the biggest beneficiary, given that the deal suggests advertisers have not lost faith in an event whose shorter, three-hour format won huge television audiences in earlier seasons but where ratings began to decline last year.Concerns about flagging popularity have been compounded by a series of seemingly endless management troubles, beginning with the ousting of the league’s founding chairman, and continuing with the cancellation of various team franchises, the latest of which has rumbled on over recent months.All this cut the most widely quoted estimate of the league’s brand value to just $2.9bn this year, down from over $4bn two years ago, while raising worries that even the world’s most cricket-crazed nation may finally have reached saturation point.It is an argument backed up by the collective yawn that has greeted the tour of England’s cricket team here, the latest match of which begins in Mumbai on Friday. What ought to be a clash between two of the world’s greatest sides has been greeted by half-empty stadiums, largely because the teams are playing the more sedate five-day form of the game, which Indians find insufficiently exciting.Yet despite this, many experts feel that the enduring appeal of the game’s shorter format, in combination with the IPL’s maturing business model, means Pepsi’s investment is likely to pay off.“This is the first true test of the value of the league, and the market is saying clearly that the IPL is much more valuable than it was when it started five years ago,” says Praveen Chakravarty, a Mumbai-based investment banker who has advised various IPL franchises.“Cricket is really the only pastime that is universal, or at least national, in a country where even movies are heavily regional in nature,” he says. “I continue to be convinced that the league’s value will grow over time, especially as those who own the franchises figure out how best to run them as businesses, and not just for their own egos.”Related reading:

253;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;AG Barr and Britvic agree £1.4bn tie-up;;AG Barr and its bigger rival Britvic have agreed the terms of their £1.4bn tie-up, creating one of Europe’s biggest soft drinks companies and concluding years of plotting.Scotland’s AG Barr – maker of Irn-Bru, which outsells Coca-Cola in its home market – had long sought a combination with Britvic, which makes Robinsons fruit squash, according to people familiar with the companies.Its latest approach, billed as a merger but under which AG Barr’s chief executive will take the helm, came after a difficult summer for Britvic, which was hit by a costly recall of its Fruit Shoot drinks.Protracted negotiations prompted two extensions to deadlines under the takeover code, but the broad terms set out on Wednesday were in line with those originally disclosed in early September. The shareholder split of 63 per cent for Britvic and 37 per cent for AG Barr shareholders mirrors the market capitalisations of the two groups.The companies unveiled anticipated synergies of £35m rising to £40m from 2016, with £5m coming from revenue synergies. Cost savings from overheads, procurement and supply chain were described as conservative by Wayne Brown, analyst at Canaccord Genuity.The merged group, to be called Barr Britvic Soft Drinks, will have annual sales of more than £1.5bn and employ about 4,300 staff.Its legal headquarters will be at AG Barr’s head office in Cumbernauld, near Glasgow, while the operational headquarters will be in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, where Britvic is based.By selling each other’s brands through their respective distribution channels and geographical locations, the companies aim to boost net revenues at the merged group by £5m each year.“There are some very strong growth opportunities for the group to exploit once the merger is completed,” said Roger White, AG Barr’s chief executive.The two companies have strength in different geographical markets and use different distribution methods.Britvic has expanded into France and other European markets as well as the US in recent years, although the company suffered over the summer after it was hit by the Fruit Shoot recall and wet weather.The merger partners said that PepsiCo had agreed variations to the contractual terms of the US soft drink maker’s exclusive bottling and distribution agreements with Britvic in the UK. They added it had agreed not to exercise any rights to termination it may have as a consequence of the merger.Mr White will take the helm of the combined group while John Gibney, Britvic’s chief financial officer, will stay in that role at the larger operation. Gerald Corbett, Britvic’s chairman, will become chairman of the new group while AG Barr’s chairman, Ronald Hanna, becomes deputy chairman.Rothschild advised AG Barr on the deal, while Citigroup and Nomura acted as financial advisers to Britvic.
254;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;China offers a taste of R&D to come;;Fancy some purple sweet potato oatmeal or hot-and-sour-fish-soup-flavoured potato crisps? For multinational companies such as PepsiCo, which on Tuesday opened its largest research and development centre outside the US in Shanghai, this is the taste of R&D to come – ideas from China, for China (and eventually, the world).The need to give the Chinese what they want, and more quickly, is driving a wave of R&D centre openings on the mainland, including two in the past week in Shanghai, by Pepsi (owner of the Frito-Lay and Quaker brands) and BASF, the German chemicals company.For decades, the world’s companies have been tempted by the sheer size of China’s market, which many have serviced with products created elsewhere, and adapted for mainland sale. But increasingly, multinationals have been moving R&D closer to the target market, to get nearer not just to shoppers but also to the country’s pool of research talent.Multinationals including Pepsi and BASF have been conducting R&D in China for years already. But often such activities have been scattered.BASF had 10 R&D centres in Shanghai alone, before opening its new, €55m pan-Asian innovation centre and greater China headquarters in the city, where special incentives are available from the local government. In the past few years, hundreds of multinational companies have created innovation centres in China, which now has at least 1,600 R&D centres of various kinds.McKinsey, in a recent report on pharmaceutical R&D in China, says that multinational drug companies have invested more than $2bn in R&D in the country in the past five years. “Chinese R&D sites are opening or growing almost as quickly as European and US sites are closing or shrinking,” the report says.Pepsi’s $40m-$45m new facility includes kitchens where Pepsi chefs develop new flavours from traditional Chinese cuisine, laboratories where they taste-test them on consumers, and plants where prototypes are produced.Doing all that in China means products can hit the shelves in as little as two weeks, Pepsi says. This is the kind of speed that multinationals need in order to compete with nimble homegrown competitors.News and comment from emerging economies, headed by Brazil, Russia, India and ChinaIt is not just snacks and drinks, which are traditionally highly localised, that need to be tailored for the local market. BASF says it also needs to be closer to Asian requirements, and faster to market. “As our customers invest more in Asia, they ask us for solutions from Asia,” says Martin Brudermüller, vice-chairman of the BASF board of executive directors, at the opening of its Shanghai centre.One advantage that Chinese R&D centres no longer have, though, is cost. China is not the cheapest place to manufacture products, nor is it the cheapest place to invent them.“It’s not the advantage you might think,” says Bruce McKern, co-director of the Centre on China Innovation at the China Europe International Business School. “The big advantage is the availability of good people, though it’s another question whether you can keep them.”BASF agrees, insisting that though construction costs are lower in China, its decision to locate one-quarter of R&D staff in Asia by 2020 “is not a cost-containing exercise”.Steven Veldhoen of Booz & Co, which has studied innovation in China, says that while junior staff may be 25 to 30 per cent cheaper than in the US or Europe, middle managers cost as much, and senior managers can cost 20 to 25 per cent more, because they are in short supply and because domestic rivals are bidding their salaries up.Recruiting quality staff is not as hard as it used to be, most multinationals say. But keeping them is another story. According to one survey cited by McKinsey, out of about 100 MBAs working for multinationals in China, four-fifths did not plan to stay in their current jobs for more than two years.Innovating in China for the world, which is the eventual goal of such centres, will not happen overnight. Pepsi points to the “dragon boat” tray developed in China to hold Lays “Stax” potato chips. The tray will soon be introduced in the US. But the purple sweet potato oatmeal available in China may not overtake maple and brown sugar in the US in the near future.For the moment, Chinese R&D centres are busy enough just coming up with ideas for China.
255;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-10-31T05:30:03Z;Cola wars bubble up in SE Asia;;"Thailand’s cola market has turned aggressive as the three big industry players get all fizzed up about a fourth drink on the block. With an eye on the proposed dismantling of regional trade barriers by late 2015 under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community, the race is on to gain pole position in the country’s large and growing soft drinks market.The 35bn baht ($1.1bn) soft drink market in Thailand is one of few where global giant PepsiCo outsells world-leader and long-standing rival Coca-Cola. But a fast-growing local market and willingness of consumers to try new brands has ensured the success of a third company, Big Cola, which entered the fray in 2006. Market analysts at Oxford Business Group estimate that Big Cola now has a 15-20 per cent market share.But all three companies are keenly aware of the planned November 2 launch of a fourth brand of cola by local company Sermsuk called “est”.Sermsuk broke a 58-year partnership with PepsiCo this year as its bottler and distributer to launch its new brand and was swiftly snapped up by giant drinks-maker ThaiBev, the consumer giant behind Chang beer.To fill the void left by Sermsuk, PepsiCo has teamed up with global distributer DHL and announced an investment of $170m in a new factory 145km from Bangkok, which will start production as Sermsuk stops.To counter the launch of “est” and leapfrog PepsiCo, Coca-Cola plans to spend BT200m ($6.5m) on marketing in Thailand in the last quarter of 2012. It kicked off the campaign late last week by staging concerts outside a large shopping mall in central Bangkok and giving away 1m bottles – the largest sample giveaway in the company’s long history.Both Pepsi and Coca-Cola are preparing for the creation of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015.PepsiCo recently employed Surakiart Sathirathai, a former Thai foreign minister, as the new chairman of its Thai subsidiary to help smooth the way into the AEC era. Surakiart said last Thursday that PepsiCo planned to use Thailand as a springboard to other ASEAN countries and announced the company would invest BT18.4bn ($600m) in Thailand over the next three years.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola said it plans to invest about $300m over the same period in Vietnam, in addition to its aggressive marketing campaign in Thailand. Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said during a visit to Hanoi that the investment was an acknowledgement of Coca-Cola’s belief in the long-term potential of the market.Elsewhere, the battle is just beginning in Myanmar where a cola war has been raging since Coca-Cola re-entered the country in September after a 60-year hiatus.Coca-Cola is keen to establish credibility and to start building brand loyalty in Myanmar. In June, it announced a $3m charitable grant to a non-governmental organisation to support women’s economic empowerment and create jobs. Meanwhile, PepsiCo announced in August that it reached a deal with a local distributer in Myanmar. The company’s boss, Indra Nooyi, called Myanmar “a market with great potential”.Related reading:

256;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Calls mount for energy drinks regulation;;Featuring edgy advertisements with motorcycles, heavy metal and leather-clad women, energy drinks have been a rare source of growth at a time when the slumping soda industry has become a public enemy in the fight against obesity.Packed with exotic ingredients such as taurine, ginseng and guarana as well as copious amounts of caffeine intended to “pack a punch”, energy drinks became a $9bn market in the US last year, according to data from Beverage Digest. Sales volume grew by 16 per cent year on year, led by the likes of Monster, Red Bull and Rockstar.But recent claims that drinks made by Monster Energy could be responsible for five deaths have renewed concern about energy drinks in the US, raising calls for greater oversight.Investors are also getting wary, causing Monster’s share price to fall nearly 30 per cent in the past three months and deterring big beverage groups such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which were once considered potential suitors.Critics argue that energy drinks call themselves dietary supplements to avoid the same scrutiny that foods and beverages face from the US Food and Drug Administration. A 1994 law gave dietary supplements special status, exempting them from FDA approvals and rules requiring nutritional labelling information.“It’s shameless,” said Marion Nestle, a professor of public health and nutrition at New York University. “In order to evade caffeine level requirements, they are marketing it as a dietary supplement, meaning the contents are unregulated and the claims are unregulated.”Fear over dietary supplements bubbles up every few years, most notably in 2004 when the FDA was forced to pull diet pills containing ephedra from the market after the chemical was linked to strokes and heart attacks.Energy drinks have prompted similar concerns about the effects of mixing high quantities of caffeine with other stimulants, especially among children.“The absence of regulatory oversight has resulted in aggressive marketing of energy drinks, targeted primarily toward young males, for psychoactive, performance-enhancing and stimulant drug effects,” researchers from the Johns Hopkins University medical school wrote in a 2008 study.“There are increasing reports of caffeine intoxication from energy drinks, and it seems likely that problems with caffeine dependence and withdrawal will also increase.”In 2010, the FDA ruled that caffeine was an unsafe food additive in alcoholic beverages, effectively ending a category that was becoming a binge drinking staple. Public health advocates said that straight energy drinks should be next, noting a recent increase in emergency room visits that has paralleled their increasing sales.“Regulatory agencies should require specific labelling regarding caffeine content, with warnings about the risks associated with caffeine consumption in adolescents and in pregnant women as well as with explicit information about the potential risks,” Amelia Arria and Mary Claire O’Brien, wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association last year.Energy drinks sometimes contain as much as 10 times the amount of caffeine as a traditional soda and twice as much as coffee, according to the FDA. However, so far the regulator has said that it has not found sufficient evidence proving that energy drinks are dangerous.Europe has also wrestled with energy drink safety. The EU requires drinks with more than 150mg of caffeine a litre to be labelled as having “high caffeine content” and the British Soft Drinks Association has voluntary guidelines that recommend labelling energy drinks as not suitable for children or pregnant women.France had imposed a ban on Red Bull, the first energy drink to become mainstream, for 12 years before backing down in 2008 after European regulators said they found no evidence of danger. Denmark and Norway had similar policies, while parts of eastern Europe restricted sales to minors and Mexico imposes a 25 per cent tax.The FDA is investigating the relationship between caffeine and the other stimulants in energy drinks. In a letter sent last August to Richard Durbin, a US senator who has questioned their safety, the FDA said it was preparing new guidelines on how companies should differentiate between beverages and “liquid dietary supplements”. It also suggested that it would consider additional rules for food supplements.Monster insists that its products are safe and that it will fight the litigation it faces over the death of a teenage girl whose family blames its product.Meanwhile, the supplement industry maintains that their products are sufficiently regulated. Steve Mister, chief executive of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, argues that the FDA already has the authority to step in if it sees dangerous products being sold.“Supplements cannot be presented to consumers as if they are part of the diet,” said Mr Mister, whose group lobbies for the industry. “If energy drinks are being promoted like bottled water or a can of soda, than they should be treated and regulated as beverages.”Drinks such as Monster sit next to Coke and Pepsi in many grocery stores and although the word “supplement” is on the can, the calls for them to be regulated like other beverages are growing louder.“At the end of the day, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it’s a duck,” said Peter Pitts, a former FDA associate commissioner and president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest. “Their marketing crosses the line and needs to be addressed.”
257;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Monster continues to fall on health concerns;;Shares of Monster Beverage continued to sink yesterday as investors digested allegations that its super-caffeinated energy drinks were linked to five deaths.Its stock price dropped 10 per cent, following a decline of 14 per cent on Monday. Shares of Monster, the top selling US energy drink by volume, have declined by nearly 40 per cent in the past three months.“We underestimated the increased headline risk around regulatory and legal uncertainty in the near term,” Judy Hong, analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note. “We have little clarity on the path of the stock in the near term.”Monster, along with rivals such as Red Bull, have been considered acquisition targets by big beverage groups such as Coca-Cola, but analysts say the recent controversy could deter suitors.According to data from Beverage Digest, the sales volume of energy drinks grew 16 per cent year on year in 2011, while the volume of the overall soda sector fell 1 per cent.Monster’s shares began gyrating last April amid reports that Coca-Cola, the world’s largest beverage group by revenues, was in talks to acquire the company. However, Coke downplayed its interest and PepsiCo said last week it had no plans to buy an energy drink company.Pressure for greater regulation of energy drinks mounted on Monday when the Food and Drug Administration said five people may have died from consuming Monster Energy drinks. The company, which is facing a lawsuit from the family of a teenager who allegedly died from consuming two 24-ounce cans of Monster, denied that its products are unsafe.The FDA is taking a closer look at the safety of mixing high levels of caffeine with other stimulants used to make energy drinks such as Monster. Some lawmakers have called on energy drinks to be regulated as food rather than as nutritional supplements.New York’s attorney-general has launched a probe into the safety of Monster’s ingredients and marketing practices. Monster stood by the safety of its products, but it is not refraining from promoting the potency of its beverages.“We went down to the lab and cooked up a double shot of our killer energy brew,” the company says on its website. “Monster packs a vicious punch but has a smooth flavour you can really pound down.”
258;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-10-21T21:04:30Z;Growth in beer sales to Hispanics;;"Growth in sales of imported beers, especially popular with Hispanic and African-Americans, is surging ahead of mainstream ale – suggesting to brewers that some of those worst-hit by the downturn are now bouncing back.US beer sales slumped alongside the broader economy as stalwarts of the bars found themselves jobless and sitting in homes worth less than they paid for them.Minorities were hit especially hard. Many Hispanics worked in industries such as construction, blacks were hit by cutbacks in the public sector, and both groups were under-represented in professional jobs where there were fewer lay-offs.Unemployment rates generally are marginally better this year, but remain skewed at 14.2 per cent for blacks, 9.9 per cent for Hispanics and 7 per cent for whites, according to government data.But the brewers’ read suggests confidence – manifested in willingness to spend – is rapidly strengthening. Imports, half of which are sold to non-whites, show “the biggest trend reversal”, according to Dolf van den Brink, who heads up the US operations of Heineken, the number three brewer by sales.“No other segment is skewed so much to those most affected by the crisis in terms of unemployment,” he said. “As things get a bit better, those consumers are starting to spend again resulting in the huge trend in import beers.”Imports make up around one-tenth of the overall beer market, according to Nielsen, the global market research consultancy. Last year sales were broadly flat; so far this year, sales are up 6.5 per cent. Overall, beer sales dipped 1 per cent last year and are up about 2 per cent year to date.Other food and drink companies are also eyeing growth in these markets, with the likes of Kraft, General Mills and PepsiCo of the US increasingly targeting their advertising efforts at the US Hispanic population and tailoring recipes to cater to their tastes.Tony Vernon, Kraft’s new chief executive, told the Financial Times earlier this year that the US grocery company will increase its spending on Hispanic advertising by “double-digits” this year, after tripling its investment in 2011.Analysts say that Hispanics’ incomes are growing and that the group tends to spend a greater amount of their disposable income on food and groceries.“In many ways, Hispanics are the ideal staples consumer: they spend more time and money per trip to the grocery store than the national average, they bring more family members with them to shop, and they tend to be more brand loyal,” Robert Moskow, analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a recent report on the subject.For brewers – and the host of food and beverage manufacturers wooing these groups – the appeal lies beyond rising employment among today’s workers and their children."
259;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-10-18T22:10:22Z;Meet Nutresa: Colombia’s premier food manufacturer;;"Now that peace talks aimed at ending Colombia’s conflict are underway, beyondbrics travelled to the country’s boondocks, to an area where local peasants have been caught in crossfire for over fifty years.One of the many striking features found in these backwater lands – known for being the cradle of the Farc guerrilla insurgency – is how well Colombian food and beverage companies have been able to distribute their products despite the lack of road infrastructure. Alongside products from Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, one could find an abundance of processed food products from the country’s leading food manufacturer, Grupo Nutresa.“Because of the conflict we have to limit ourselves in certain areas,” Carlos Piedrahíta, the company’s chief executive, told beyondbrics. “But in almost every town in the mountainside, the coast, or the jungle, you’ll find a Jet candy bar, a Noel biscuit, or Colcafé coffee.”If Colombia has about 1080 municipalities, Nutresa – according to Piedrahíta – reaches 1000 thanks to brand loyalty and distribution networks.This shows in the market shares. The group’s six divisions – meats, biscuits, chocolates, coffee, ice cream and pastas – each hold a domestic market share of between 45 to 60 per cent in their categories.Nutresa’s policy is to have the same pricing across the country, meaning there is no surcharge based on transportation costs, even to a far-flung post. (The company compensates for this sometimes by shrinking the size of their products, offering smaller portions at reduced prices in certain regions.)The company reaches more than 250,000 sales points in the whole country through a sales force of more than 7.500 representatives, said Piedrahíta.Nutresa’s omnipresence is helped by having its own distribution channels. The company runs the primary transport of its goods – from production plants to warehouses centres – as well as the secondary transport of the goods – from warehouses to customers – using whatever means of transport that might be required.“Those include small trucks, four-by-four jeeps, three-wheel bikes for cargo, a river barges like the one that serves our customers along the Amazon affluents. In some extraordinary cases we have even used donkeys and, during the rainy season, canoes to reach far away flooded villages,” said Piedrahíta.That is something beyondbrics was able to see first hand. During the trip, this correspondent came across one humble village store owner loading up a few boxes of chocolates on top of a mule -alongside oranges, beer and white soap pastilles – to make the trip through narrow hillside trails to a long-forgotten outpost atop the lush, green mountains. “How else am I going to get there with the cargo?” the man said.Nutresa did not acquire its success overnight. Ten years ago, the company experienced more than one theft a day along its distribution line. “Over the years we’ve suffered guerrilla, paramilitaries, mafias, extortions, kidnappings of managers and salesmen, robbing and burning of delivery trucks,” Piedrahíta said, adding that their policy was never to pay any ransom, be it for the company’s chief or a delivery boy.Some of their drivers and sales representatives got around the security problem by travelling with security escorts. But customers also played a role, with some ringing the company to let them know when it’s not safe to enter an area.“We kept going,” said Piedrahíta, “and now with a peace that seems so close, more than ever.”Related reading:

260;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-10-17T20:47:56Z;Financial stocks drive Wall Street higher;;Bank of America shares fell on Wednesday as the US bank failed to hold on to early gains after it reported that third-quarter profits were severely diminished by the settlement of a shareholder lawsuit.The company disclosed last month that it would pay $2.4bn to settle allegations that it concealed information about the financial health of Merrill Lynch, the securities group that it purchased in 2008.For the three-month period, BofA reported a 94.5 per cent drop in net earnings to $340m compared with the same time a year ago.Shares in the company, which have risen about 70 per cent since the start of the year, closed 0.2 per cent lower to $9.44.Erik Oja, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said BofA’s results were bolstered by positive growth in the company’s loans business, mortgage banking and investment banking from the prior quarter.Gains from mortgage banking have emerged as a common thread across Wall Street’s biggest banks during this reporting season, with some of the country’s largest financial institutions seeing immediate results from additional stimulus measures taken by the Federal Reserve last month.Two banks that reported strong growth in their mortgage business already – Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase – gained 2.2 per cent to $34.47 and 1.1 per cent to $43.32, respectively.Overall, BofA underperformed the broader measure of financial sector stocks on the benchmark S&P 500 index, which rose 1.2 per cent.Regional US banks were among the biggest risers. M&T Bank gained 5.8 per cent to $103.07 as it reported results for the quarter that were better than expected.Shares in Hudson City Bancorp rose 5.8 per cent to $8.56. Bank of New York Mellon moved 5.5 per cent higher to $24.86.The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to 1,460.91 as Wall Street stocks managed to record their third consecutive day of gains.The benchmark US index has risen 2.3 per cent so far this week amid mixed results from companies reporting third-quarter results.Meanwhile, fresh housing data released on Wednesday showed that new home starts in September grew by their fastest pace in more than four years. The report added to optimism that the housing market was beginning to turn round in the US.Homebuilders on the S&P 500 recorded some of the day’s biggest gains. DR Horton rose 4.2 per cent to $21.54, Lennar Corp moved 2.2 per cent higher to $38.13 and PulteGroup gained 5.3 per cent to $17.44.Analysts weighed the impact of the data on the broader US stock market with some suggesting a housing recovery will help growth.Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, said: “The data reinforce the view that while housing is not going to be the driver of economic activity the way it was in the middle of the prior decade, neither will it be the anchor on activity that it has been in recent years.”PepsiCo shares dropped 0.3 per cent to $70.26 as the global beverage and snacks company said its third-quarter results were hampered by restructuring charges.The Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.1 per cent to 3,104.12. IBM shares declined 4.9 per cent to $200.63 as the information technology company said that its quarterly results were hurt by a stronger dollar.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker by revenues, provided a gloomy outlook for the technology industry as it reported its quarterly figures late on Tuesday. The company said it planned to slow production at its factories due to weaker demand from makers of personal computers. Its shares dropped 2.5 per cent to $21.79.“We felt this was the first quarter Intel acknowledged that tablets and phones are eating into PCs,” Romit Shah, analyst at Nomura, said. “This is a significant headwind to growth in our view.”The news seemed to reverberate across related sectors with Dell, a PC maker, falling 0.5 per cent to $9.85 and Nvidia, the chipmaker, losing 0.8 per cent to $13.06.Apple shares declined 0.8 per cent to $644.61 as investors speculated on the possibility that the company would introduce a mini version of its popular iPad tablet next week. Facebook moved 2.1 per cent higher to $19.88.The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved fractionally higher to 13,557.0 as shares in Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, saw a 2 per cent gain to $86.63.Shares in Knight Capital Group, the electronic trading and market making company, gained 2.3 per cent to $2.58.The company said it lost $461.1m from a technical error on August 1 that forced it to inadvertently buy billions of dollars worth of shares, up from earlier estimates of $440m.
261;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-10-17T16:20:46Z;PepsiCo hampered by restructuring charges;Quarterly profits fall 5% to $1.9bn;Persistent struggles in PepsiCo’s US beverage business hampered its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, raising questions about whether chief executive Indra Nooyi’s plan to revive the company is on track.Net revenues in PepsiCo’s US drinks unit were down 7 per cent, with sales of still and sparkling beverages both declining. Weakness in the domestic drinks business has been a sore spot with investors in recent years and Ms Nooyi launched an aggressive “reset” in February to make its core brands more competitive with rival Coca-Cola.Although analysts continue to question whether PepsiCo is investing enough in its drinks brands, Ms Nooyi said challenges were mainly due to problems with its Gatorade sports drinks and the fact that the company cut back on selling unprofitable juices.“We’ve always said we want to grow this beverage business profitably and this year was a big reinvestment year,” Ms Nooyi said on a conference call with analysts. “Going into next year we want to play this game in North American beverages very responsibly and make sure we’re generating profit growth.”Ms Nooyi also signalled that PepsiCo was on the cusp of a breakthrough in its sweetener technology that could provide a big boost to its cola brands by 2014.“They love bubbles, they love the caffeine, they love the cola taste, but [we’ll] address any barrier that might exist in the areas of sugar in the portfolio of artificial sweeteners,” Ms Nooyi said.PepsiCo’s results come as the soda industry is under growing pressure from US regulators who link their products to obesity. Two California cities are considering soda taxes next month and last week the American Beverage Association filed a lawsuit to prevent a ban on “supersized” soft drinks in New York City.Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s chief financial officer, said that he did not expect the ban to have an impact on the company’s bottom line and said the company was prepared to provide the required bottle sizes if other cities follow suit.Overall, net income at PepsiCo fell 5 per cent to $1.9bn, or $1.21 a share, as revenues also fell 5 per cent to $16.6bn. While the revenues fell short of Wall Street analysts’ estimates, the profits exceeded projections and PepsiCo’s shares rose slightly in midday trading.Sales volume in PepsiCo’s snacks business rose 6 per cent year-on-year, outpacing beverage sales, which rose 3 per cent.PepsiCo attributed the revenue decline to refranchising of its China and Mexico businesses. The company also faced high commodity costs and was hurt by the stronger US dollar.

Sales volume in the US and Europe was up 2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively.“The consumer there is slowing down plus competition is on the rise as all companies are trying to grow – this isn’t a great combination usually,” Ali Dibadj, beverage analyst at Bernstein Research, said. “In some ways, PepsiCo looks like they were geniuses in getting out of China when they did.”However, in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Kent said that Coke has no plans to to reallocate resources or pull back its planned China investments. Coke announced last year that it would invest $7bn in China from 2012 to 2017.“We’re sticking with the programme, if not doing even more,” Mr Kent said.Net income at Coke rose 4 per cent year-on-year to $2.3bn, or 50 cents a share, as revenues increased 1 per cent to $12.3bn. The profit increase exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts, while revenues fell short.Shares of Coke closed down 0.6 per cent to $37.90 in New York.In addition to China’s slowdown, Coke is facing an increasingly difficult regulatory environment in the US, where some cities are considering imposing soda taxes and where New York City recently decided to ban “supersized” soft drinks.The company is also battling shaky consumer confidence in Europe, where economies are facing stubbornly high unemployment and government austerity measures. In many European countries, consumers are purchasing Coke at grocery and convenience stores, rather than in restaurants.“What you’re seeing is go to Madrid, and look at the cafés there aren’t a lot of people drinking Cokes or coffees,” Gary Fayard, Coca-Cola’s chief financial officer said. “It’s a shift in consumer spending in Europe from immediate consumption to future consumption.”Coke’s rival PepsiCo reports its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.

264;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-10-15T16:45:51Z;Energy companies warn on green subsidies;;Millions of pounds of investment in wind farms and other power plants risk being delayed unless ministers extend the system of green subsidies by as much as three years, say leading energy companies.The warning from RWE Npower and SSE, two of the so-called Big Six energy companies, comes as ministers prepare to iron out long-running coalition differences over the shape of the UK’s energy system later this week.Senior ministers are to discuss reforms in an energy bill due before parliament next month that has triggered open disagreement between Liberal Democrat and Conservative MPs.The reforms will dictate the extent to which the UK will encourage the renewable power many Lib Dems favour, and the gas plants that George Osborne, the Tory chancellor, is eager to back.The coalition row has unnerved big wind turbine makers, such as Germany’s Siemens, Denmark’s Vestas and Spain’s Gamesa. They wrote to Ed Davey, the Lib Dem energy secretary, this month to say the coalition row had “caused us to reassess the level of political risk in the UK”.These groups and other prominent companies including Microsoft and PepsiCo back Mr Davey’s plans to include a 2030 target for the decarbonisation of the electricity sector in the energy bill.Such a target would probably rule out a big expansion of gas power, depending on how rigidly it was enforced. That means Mr Osborne may want some form of trade-off if he backs the 2030 target, say people familiar with the discussions.Proponents of carbon capture and storage technology funding, which is also to be discussed this week, hope they will not become victims of any horse-trading over the shape of the final energy reforms.This week’s meeting has triggered a flurry of lobbying, including a study commissioned by the E3G environmental think tank showing power sector costs could balloon by up to 98 per cent if ministers encourage more gas plants. This is because companies would have to build so many zero-carbon plants to stay inside carbon limits. Costs would rise 8 per cent at most beyond what was expected by 2030 if renewable energy continued to be steadily deployed, the study says.The energy bill proposes closing the main renewable energy subsidy system for large green power plants such as offshore wind farms to newcomers from 2017, replacing it with a form of financial support featuring long-term price contracts.The existing system, in place since 2002, requires electricity suppliers to get a certain portion of their power from renewable sources.The proposed incentives would guarantee minimum prices for low carbon electricity generators and would be open to nuclear plants as well as large wind farms.But there are still many uncertainties, including how many contracts the government will allow, who will underwrite them and how long it will take for the energy bill to become law.That is worrying big offshore wind investors such as RWE and SSE. In comments first made to Greenpeace’s Energy Desk blog, the companies said 2017 was too soon to phase out the existing system.“Extending the renewables obligation until 2020 would provide developers with a backstop option that enables continued investment and growth,” said an RWE Npower spokesman.SSE said: “If government wants to get renewable investment and green jobs moving again, signalling that the existing renewables obligation will run in parallel until any new system is up and running would be a minimum requirement.”
265;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-10-12T23:03:39Z;Drinks groups sue over NY ‘supersize’ ban;;The US beverage industry is taking the administration of Michael Bloomberg, New York mayor, to court over its decision to ban sales of “supersized” sugary drinks.Trade groups led by the American Beverage Association filed a lawsuit late on Friday in New York state court attempting to block the rule, which is set to be imposed next spring.Last month, New York’s board of health voted to approve a proposal made by Mr Bloomberg in May that would prohibit restaurants, theatres and stadiums from selling sugary drinks in portions bigger than 16fl oz (475ml).“This arbitrary ban creates an uneven playing field – seriously harming thousands of small businesses in the city, while leaving others exempt,” said Caroline Starke, for the group filing the lawsuit. “The ban is riddled with irrational exclusions, loopholes and random classifications that will seriously harm New York City businesses.”The lawsuit comes as the soda industry is locked in an increasingly contentious battle with regulators over labelling and taxation of their products. Industry groups are currently fighting soda tax proposals in two California cities and have successfully pushed back several other similar efforts.In an act of good will last week, the American Beverage Association said it would roll out new vending machines with calorie information in Chicago and San Antonio, Texas, with the intention of making them available across the US in the future.Friday’s lawsuit accused the Bloomberg administration of ruling by “executive fiat” in circumventing New York’s city council to impose the restrictions.“The city council knows how to legislate,” the lawsuit said. “It has considered legislation on obesity and nutrition and it has repeatedly rejected proposals to address those issues by targeting certain beverages.”The beverage association was joined by restaurant and theatre groups in the lawsuit.Opponents of the ban argue it will do harm to small businesses by curbing sales. Companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo fear that the ban harms the reputation of their products and that other cities will follow New York.Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for Mr Bloomberg, called the lawsuit baseless and suggested that the drinks industry would fail to stop the ban.“For 100 years, major public health decisions – the posting of calorie counts, the ban of transfats, the sanitation of the sewage system, the fluoridation of the water system and much more – have been left to a board of health professionals and it has benefited the health of New Yorkers,” he said. “The mayor’s plan to limit the size of sugary beverages – the leading contributor to the obesity epidemic– has spurred a long overdue national dialogue on obesity.”
266;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Companies warn Osborne on renewable power;;Some of the best known companies in the UK, including Microsoft, PepsiCo and Marks and Spencer, have warned George Osborne that mixed signals on green energy policy risk undermining investment in renewable power.More than 50 companies, investors and industry bodies have written to the chancellor ahead of his speech to the Conservative party conference today urging greater clarity on the coalition’s commitment to a lower-carbon economy.The companies, which also include EDF, the French energy group, and BT, the telecoms group, called on Mr Osborne to back a 2030 target for decarbonising the electricity sector, amid coalition tensions over the goal. “It is essential for government to provide investors with the long-term confidence they need to transform our electricity market and make investments capable of driving wider economic growth,” the letter said.The 2030 decarbonisation target is endorsed by Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, but Mr Osborne is wary. The chancellor has been calling for a significant role for natural gas in the UK energy mix until the 2030s and beyond.Without specifically naming Mr Osborne, the letter warns that the government’s commitment to green power is being “undermined by recent statements calling for unabated gas in the power sector beyond 2030”.Critics, including the government’s climate watchdog, have warned that heavy reliance on gas beyond 2030 would be incompatible with meeting legally binding emissions targets set under the 2008 climate change act.Separately, SSE, the UK power group, has told the Financial Times it also supports a 2030 carbon intensity target because it “could provide much-needed certainty for low-carbon investors, showing developers that the government is committed to decarbonisation in the long term”.The issue will come to a head when an energy bill is brought to parliament by Mr Davey later this year. The Commons energy committee, among others, says the 2030 target should be included in the legislation.The letter to Mr Osborne was co-ordinated by the Aldersgate Group of green-leaning businesses. Peter Young, Aldersgate chairman, said it was critical to put an end to any political uncertainty surrounding the UK’s energy future.“Both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties understand this huge growth opportunity and backed a 2030 carbon target for the power sector at their party conferences,” he said. “Now the Conservative party must step up to the mark and provide the full cross-party support which businesses have been calling for.”
267;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-09-13T21:30:53Z;New York approves supersize drinks ban;;New York City took its battle against obesity further on Thursday, moving forward with a ban on sales of “supersized” sugary drinks that many in the beverage industry have called misguided.The city’s board of health voted to approve a proposal announced in May by Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor. The decision, which was widely expected, means restaurants, theatres and stadiums will be unable to sell sugary drinks in portions bigger than 16 ounces (475ml).Diet sodas or drinks containing milk will be exempt, and restaurants can still offer free refills.Mr Bloomberg called the policy the “single biggest step any government has taken to curb obesity” on Thursday and said that the city would be a healthier place in six months when the rule takes effect.The policy has won the backing of weight loss companies such as Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig, but the soft drinks industry has hit out against the plan as an imposition on personal freedom. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are fearful that Mr Bloomberg’s plan will be adopted by other US cities, following the same path as New York’s regulations on menu labelling and smoking.“This is not the end,” said Eliot Hoff, spokesman for New Yorkers for Beverage Choices. “We are exploring legal options and all other avenues available to us.”New York’s restaurant and theatre associations have also come out against the rule, arguing that it will cut into their sales at a time when small businesses are under pressure.Mr Bloomberg has argued that those concerns are outweighed by the costs of obesity, which lead to the deaths of 6,000 city residents each year.People given beverages 50 per cent larger consume 20-33 per cent more,” he said. “Portion size drives consumption.”
268;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-09-11T22:47:27Z;Compton to step down as PepsiCo president;;PepsiCo said John Compton, who took over as the company’s president six months ago, was leaving the food and drinks group to become chief executive of Pilot Flying J Oil Corp, a privately held chain of truck stops.The move marks the third management shake-up in the last year for PepsiCo, which has been trying to improve its performance amid investor unrest about its struggling carbonated soft drinks business.Mr Compton, who was considered a potential successor to Indra Nooyi, chief executive, will be replaced by Zein Abdalla, head of the company’s European operations. Enderson Guimarães, president of PepsiCo’s nutrition group will replace Mr Abdalla.Mr Compton, 51 and a 30-year PepsiCo veteran, said the decision was largely based on his desire to lead a company based in his home state of Tennessee.“It isn’t often that the opportunity arises to run one of America’s largest private companies, and this new opportunity was a once in a lifetime chance to do so,” Mr Compton said.Mr Compton’s departure leaves Mr Abdalla and Brian Cornell, who was hired earlier this year to run PepsiCo Americas Foods, as Ms Nooyi’s most likely successors. Ms Nooyi has said she wants to run the company as long as the board of directors is happy with her performance.“It’s not a huge negative hit to the company but it was certainly a surprise,” Ali Dibadj, analyst a Bernstein Research said. “He was lined up as one of the top, if not the top, successor.”Shares of PepsiCo were flat at $71.58 in after-hours trading.

Une carafe d’Irn Bru, s’il vous plaît!” The opportunity to wean the French on to pop made in Scotland from girders is among the reasons advanced for the £1.4bn all-share merger of soft drinks groups AG Barr and Britvic. A better one is that Roger White, Barr’s chief executive, should inject some Cumbernauld iron into the soft southern soul of Britvic, a business languishing after a product recall and profits warning.In mergers, the chief executive of the larger constituent company usually keeps his job. But Paul Moody of Britvic will not benefit from that polite convention. A recall on safety grounds of bottles of Fruit Shoot, a kids’ drink, was not the first lapse under his stewardship. The mishandled launch of Robinson’s double concentrate last year hurt sales too.Shares in family-controlled Barr have risen 80 per cent over three years. Shares in Britvic, shunted between corporate owners until its 2005 float, have fallen 10 per cent. Many investors in the Hemel Hempstead-based business would like a slurp of what Barr shareholders have been drinking, however ferrous. It appears unlikely that a rival bid will bubble up from PepsiCo, whose fizz Britvic bottles in the UK.Opportunistic Barr may thus avoid paying the sort of control premium Xstrata investors want from Glencore. The 63 per cent of the merged group – let’s call it Scotvic – currently reserved for Britvic investors represents Britvic’s value relative to Barr before the product recall.It is a 7 per cent advance on Tuesday’s close. Judging from similar deals, cost synergies of some £30m a year may be available. There will be more to go for at a top line level, even if Parisian café society cannot be persuaded to glug Irn Bru instead of café creme.Bullet-proof BristolianHigh-stepping City fund managers would give their eye teeth to have raised client assets 7 per cent in the 12 months to July. That is the feat of financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown, which began as a humble spare room start-up in Bristol in 1981. It has morphed into a general factotum for private investors, offering execution, administration, bags of information but no advice. The robustness of the business model in a tough market is apparent in profits before tax 21 per cent higher at £153m.Hargreaves Lansdown must now adapt that model to survive. The West Country wealth specialist is likely to stop getting a slice of fund annual management charges from January 2014, following an industry-wide fees shake-up.The shares, down 40 per cent earlier this year, have bounced back to historic highs in expectation of a fix. But it is hard to predict how customers will react to paying explicit rather than implicit costs.Fortunately, co-founder and affable curmudgeon Peter Hargreaves will stick around to guide the change, even as wing man Stephen Lansdown steps down from the board. Mr Hargreaves owns one-third of the shares, which have quadrupled since their 2007 float and now bear a pricey 22 times forward earnings multiple.

270;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-09-05T10:09:40Z;AG Barr springs bid for Britvic;;AG Barr, maker of Scotland’s “other national drink”, Irn-Bru, has launched an audacious bid for Britvic, its bigger UK peer, which has seen its share price plummet after a tumultuous summer.Talks over the all-share deal, worth as much as £1.42bn based on last night’s closing share prices for the two groups, are at a preliminary stage.The two drinks companies are portraying the deal as a merger that would create one of the biggest soft drinks companies in Europe by revenues, and blend Robinsons squash with AG Barr’s Irn-Bru.A combination of the two drink makers, whose strengths are in different geographical markets and use different distribution methods, has long been discussed by analysts and bankers. AG Barr has now moved after a bitter summer for Britvic, marred by a costly recall of its Fruit Shoot children’s drinks and wet weather.AG Barr, by contrast, has increased turnover by an annual 10.8 per cent over the past five years, on a compound basis, and pre-tax profit by 12 per cent. Some 43 per cent of its sales are in Scotland, where it outsells Coca-Cola.Underlining the differing fortunes of the two beverage makers, the proposed line-up of executives for the putative combination makes no mention of Paul Moody, Britvic chief executive.Roger White, AG Barr chief executive, would take the helm of the combined group while John Gibney, Britvic’s chief financial officer, would stay in that role at the larger operation. Britvic’s chairman would become chairman and AG Barr’s chairman deputy chairman.Britvic investors would own 63 per cent of the merged group’s equity and AG Barr shareholders 37 per cent, roughly in line with respective market capitalisations.News of the deal pushed Britvic’s share price up 12 per cent on Wednesday, to close at 368.34p. Before that the shares traded at about 10 times next year’s earnings, almost half the level of AG Barr. The Scottish company also has minimal debt whereas Britvic is highly leveraged.Jamie Isenwater, at Deutsche Bank, said the terms made it look like “a pretty raw deal for Britvic shareholders”, pointing out that the figures being quoted valued the company’s equity at 1.7 times AG Barr’s, whereas Britvic’s operating profits and revenues are respectively 3.5 times and five times its rival’s.At least 40 per cent of Britvic’s revenues come from selling PepsiCo brands under licence, whereas AG Barr’s sales largely derive from its own brands.Although analysts said the talks could spur a counterbid from PepsiCo, the US giant has a director on the Britvic board and must have been aware of talks since they began.PepsiCo said it did not comment on M&A activity.Additional reporting Anousha Sakoui and Alan Rappeport
271;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-09-04T21:21:38Z;Weight-loss groups back NY big soda ban;;Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig have backed a controversial anti-obesity initiative by Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor, that would ban sales of “supersized” sweetened drinks in restaurants, cinemas and stadiums.The move by two of the biggest US weight-loss companies comes as the Bloomberg administration ramps up efforts to have the proposal passed by the city’s board of health next week. However, Mr Bloomberg’s initiative has also generated fierce opposition from Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and the American Beverage Association, a lobby group.David Burwick, president of Weight Watchers North America, said: “It is only with this kind of commitment and community-based support that major strides can be made against obesity.”“We hope that more mayors, health departments and businesses will follow New York City’s example to make the healthy choice the easy choice,” he added.Dana Fiser, chief executive of Jenny Craig, also expressed support for the plan.“Along with Mayor Bloomberg, we support all efforts that will help get America healthy,” Ms Fiser said. “We also teach our clients that the majority of sugary drinks are filled with empty calories and lack nutritional value.”Critics argue that targeting sugary drinks is unfair and that consumers still face no limits on the number of bottles of a drink that they can purchase. Mr Bloomberg’s policies forcing chain restaurants to label calories and banning indoor smoking have spread across the US and drinks companies are fearful that bans on big sodas could be next.Mr Bloomberg draws a direct link between sugary drinks and obesity, and argued on Tuesday that: “It’s time to face the facts: obesity is one of America’s most deadly problems, and sugary beverages are a leading cause of it”.After Mr Bloomberg unveiled the proposal in May, Coke hit out at the plan and said: “New Yorkers expect and deserve better than this. They can make their own choices about the beverages they purchase”. Meanwhile, Pepsi trucks in New York have been emblazoned with signs that read “Don’t let bureaucrats tell you what size beverage to buy”.“These diet companies often emphasise choice and options in their own plans, allowing their customers a wide variety of food and drink. We want the same thing,” said Eliot Hoff, spokesman for New Yorkers for Beverage Choices, a group that is fighting the rule. “Restrictions and bans will do nothing to address the very complex issue of obesity.”New York’s board of health is appointed by Mr Bloomberg and the initiative is expected to pass on September 13. If it does, the ban would be put in place next year.“The deck has been stacked against us from day one,” Mr Hoff said. “This is not passing with the support of New Yorkers and businesses are extremely concerned.”
272;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;NY probes makers of energy drinks;;"Makers of energy drinks including PepsiCo are being investigated by the New York authorities over whether they are making misleading statements about the healthiness of their products.New York state has issued subpoenas to three energy drinks makers requesting information on their marketing, internal communications and product ingredients, according to a person familiar with the investigation.The three companies are PepsiCo, which makes AMP Energy drinks; Monster Beverage; and Living Essentials, which makes the 5-Hour Energy Drink. But the investigation could widen to include others, the person said.The probe focuses on whether energy drinks are being presented as dietary supplements, similar to vitamin pills, and on the accuracy of statements about their caffeine content, which often gives consumers the kick they want.It has been launched by New York state’s attorney-general Eric Schneiderman, but it is at an early stage and there is no certainty that it will lead to any civil charges, which the state has the power to file.Energy drinks, which are often fizzy and sweetened with fruit flavours, are especially popular among young people. US beverage companies are using them to diversify their portfolios as tastes shift away from full-calorie soft drinks.New York state is examining whether manufacturers could be guilty of “misbranding” for labelling the drinks as dietary supplements when they should be considered as conventional beverages.The authorities are also investigating if drinks companies are disclosing the full caffeine content of their products, including the impact of added ingredients such as black tea extract and guarana berries.PepsiCo declined to comment and Living Essentials did not respond to a request for comment."
273;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Pioneers plan shake-up of TV advertising;;Bonin Bough is talking rapidly about the future of television as he pulls out his iPad to point to a handful of digital applications that he says are revolutionising the media.With GetGlue, Viggle and Miso, users can “check in” to the television shows they are watching. Showyou provides a one-stop-shop for users to discover the videos friends share. Klip lets users take their own videos and post them to friends.Mr Bough, the vice-president of global media and consumer engagement at Kraft Foods, says that such technologies are crucial for advertisers such as Kraft to reach consumers amid the proliferation of media and resulting audience fragmentation.“What we also see is that even the most traditional channels like TV are evolving as a function of the technologies around them,” he says.Mr Bough, 34, is on the cutting edge of a new generation of marketing executives expected to take over the advertising business. He honed his marketing skills on the Internet and worked as senior global director of digital and social media at PepsiCo before starting at Kraft earlier this year.Now, he is responsible for directing Kraft’s advertising budget. And he is trying to shake things up.“Our approach is to view media not just as a commodity but as an investment in the future of the company,” he says. “And we see an opportunity to continue to maximise that investment.”The shift comes amid a proliferation of data calling into question the effectiveness of traditional television adverts.New research from Simulmedia, a targeted television advertising company, shows that most national television advertising campaigns do not reach a large portion of the audiences they are aiming to target. Tivo, meanwhile, estimates that 65 per cent of Americans who have a Tivo digital video recorder skip broadcast prime time ads.Kraft still finds TV adverts important, but is deploying new techniques for buying commercials to keep pace with how viewers are changing their viewing habits. At the core of the strategy: working out new ways to connect with consumers using television adverts rather than simply buying 30-second television commercials.“Whether you’re buying TV ads or connecting with consumers on Twitter, what you take away from your media activity isn’t just impressions,” says Mr Bough. “It is also about connecting with our audiences and that can be valued as an asset.”For example, Kraft’s Miracle Whip mayonnaise brand worked with Viggle last year during a campaign tied to the Oscars awards show, where viewers saw special content. The company is also working on special integrations with networks for the upcoming autumn television season.Kraft, which spent an estimated $746m on advertising last year, ranked as the tenth largest network television advertiser in the US during the first quarter this year, according to WPP’s Kantar Media.Yet the broader advertising industry has been slow to adjust to how it buys television advertising campaigns. A large portion of television adverts still are directed to primetime broadcast programmes and are bought via broad packages that include adverts across the network during those primetime shows.This means that people who watch more primetime broadcast television see more of those adverts than people who watch television during other parts of the day and on other channels, according to Dave Morgan, chief executive of Simulmedia, a start-up that sells marketers the ability to buy targeted television adverts based on anonymous data about viewers.“Audience fragmentation has accelerated faster than the ad industry has evolved the way it buys, sells and packages TV ad campaigns,” says Mr Morgan.Indeed, television gives advertisers a channel to reach big audiences amid the fragmentation of media but marketers are gradually migrating their dollars to follow where viewers are spending their time and are exploring ways to devote more of their budgets to new media, such as online video and mobile video, says Lyle Schwartz, managing partner at GroupM, WPP’s media buying unit.At the same time, the proliferation of set-top box data are allowing marketers to better understand the performance of their advertising campaigns and be more responsive with their campaigns and buy more targeted adverts.”We don’t have to use a shotgun approach to reach consumers,” says Mr Schwartz. “It can be more like a scalpel.”
274;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-08-19T16:27:21Z;Food companies fight against GM proposal;;US food and agriculture companies are spending millions of dollars campaigning against a proposal that would force them to reveal their use of genetically modified ingredients.They claim that complying with the law would push up costs, which, they warned, would be passed on to customers.Companies including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, General Mills, Monsanto and DuPont have invested $25m to defeat California’s Proposition 37.Corn, soyabeans and canola are among the ingredients derived from genetically engineered seeds to make them more resistant to pests and extreme climates. Companies are fearful that they will no longer be able to market their products as “natural” and that if voters in California pass the law in November, other states will follow.“It will have a very negative impact and higher costs,” said Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the “No on 37” campaign opposing the law. “It’s based on fear not on fact.”The US has no federal law on labelling of genetically modified foods. European countries angered US companies a decade ago when they started imposing strict labelling requirements.Coke and Pepsi, the US beverage companies, which have combined to spend $1m to oppose the California law, declined to comment but are being represented by the Grocery Manufacturer’s Association, which opposes the proposal.“This poorly written measure will mandate that our companies provide misleading and confusing information to customers,” said Brian Kennedy, a GMA spokesman.The group argues that companies will have to either begin using organic ingredients or alter their packaging production for California. Either solution will add costs that will be passed on to consumers.Monsanto and DuPont, two of the world’s biggest manufacturers of genetically modified seeds, have been the biggest contributors to the campaign to defeat the proposal, donating $4.2m and $4m respectively.Monsanto refused to comment to the Financial Times beyond a blog post, in which the company argued that “consumers have broad food choices today, but could be denied these choices if Prop 37 prevails.“Proponents of the California labelling proposal are misleading people about the safety of food in the marketplace,” the blog states.“Beneath their right to know slogan is a deceptive marketing campaign aimed at stigmatising modern food production.”Meanwhile, DuPont would only say that it “complies with each country’s labelling requirements of biotech-derived products and believes in all cases the label should be verifiable, non-discriminatory and not misleading”.The US Food and Drug Administration and the American Medical Association have not found evidence showing that genetically engineered food products are harmful. However, supporters of the law argue that companies are being untruthful about what is in their products and that the long-term effects of genetic engineering of crops have not been studied.“The giant pesticide and food companies are afraid of the mothers and grandmothers who want the right to know what’s in our food,” said Stacy Malkan, of California Right to Know.
275;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-08-16T17:14:22Z;US steps up pressure on Uzbekistan;;"The US is stepping up pressure on Uzbekistan after a New York-listed telecommunications operator had its Uzbek licence suspended and five of its local managers were jailed.The US Commission on Security and Co-operation in Europe warned of “a deterioration in bilateral ties” and a “chilling effect on foreign investment” if the executives of MTS were not released from jail, and if an Uzbek investigation into the company’s subsidiary in the country was not handled with more transparency.A copy of the commission’s letter to President Islam Karimov was seen by the Financial Times as annual bilateral talks between the US and Uzbekistan began in Tashkent on Thursday. The US body, also known as the US Helsinki Commission, is headed by Christopher Smith, a Republican congressman, and Benjamin Cardin, a Democrat senator.The US relied on Uzbekistan’s Karshi-Khanabad air base during the invasion of Afghanistan, but relations were strained after Washington condemned Mr Karimov’s regime for the 2005 massacre of hundreds of Uzbek civilians in Andijan. The US was asked to abandon the air base a few months later.The current saga with MTS appears to echo problems faced by other western groups in the region, including London-listed Oxus Gold, Newmont Mining of the US and Wimm-Bill-Dann, the Russian dairy producer which is now part of PepsiCo.Coca-Cola, meanwhile, found itself the subject of a $100m arbitration lawsuit after it became entangled in the divorce between Gulnara Karimova, the president’s daughter, and Mansur Maqsudi, once the largest shareholder in Coca-Cola’s Tashkent bottling factory. The two parties settled the lawsuit confidentially.MTS’s difficulties began in June when Bekzod Akhmedov, head of MTS Uzbekistan, disappeared; his whereabouts are currently unknown. Shortly thereafter, Uzbek authorities accused MTS of owing the state over $900m in outstanding tax payments. MTS has denied any wrongdoing.The company’s Uzbek licence was cancelled indefinitely by a Tashkent court earlier this month after the telecoms regulator ordered the company to shut down its network the same day. On July 17 more than 9m Uzbeks – nearly a third of the country’s population – were left without mobile service, forcing them to queue for hours for a new SIM card from one of MTS’s competitors.Four Uzbek managers at MTS have been in jail since June. A fifth, who is of Russian nationality, was released earlier this month and given permission to fly back to Russia this week just as US-Uzbek bilateral talks were beginning.While MTS operates primarily in Russia and the CIS, more than a third of its 47 per cent free float is owned by US funds, with Lazard Asset Management and Blackrock being among the biggest shareholders. The company has a market capitalisation of $19.1bn.AFK Sistema, the Russian holding owned by the oligarch Vladimir Yevtushenkov, owns the remaining 53 per cent of MTS."
276;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
277;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Consumer companies – growing pain;Stock markets might be pleased but strong sales growth comes at a price;After recent profit warnings from Procter & Gamble and Danone, investors had much to fear from this week’s earnings reports from consumer goods companies. In the event, it has been smiles all around. Thursday’s first-half results prompted a 6 per cent share price increase at Unilever, while Colgate-Palmolive rose 4 per cent and Kimberly-Clark 3 per cent. The sales outlook is not as bad as many had anticipated. At Unilever, underlying revenue growth of 7 per cent beat forecasts as a strong emerging markets performance offset weakness elsewhere, especially in Europe.But events further down the income statement are more concerning. Consumer goods companies are keeping their revenues moving along at a decent clip, but they are having to work harder to get there. All three of them, along with PepsiCo on Wednesday, reported increases in marketing spend in the first half. Rising commodity prices, especially for oil, also pushed costs up. Unilever’s operating margin slipped by 100 basis points, while Colgate-Palmolive’s was down 30bp and PepsiCo was down 150bp. Only Kimberly-Clark bucked the trend with a 250bp improvement, which was down to lower fibre costs for its nappies and tissues.Across the board, the answer to the margin pressure has been to cut costs. Unilever spent €230m on restructuring in the first half. PepsiCo spent $80m in the second quarter and will spend another $315m over the rest of the year. But cost cutting can only go so far. Unless raw material prices ease, or the global economy recovers sufficiently to allow consumer goods companies to ease back on ad spending, margins will stay under pressure and that eye-catching, emerging markets-driven top line growth will start to look hollow.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
278;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;PepsiCo to focus on existing US brands;;PepsiCo said on Wednesday it will steer clear of acquisitions in the US, looking instead for small “tuck-ins” in emerging markets and investing in its existing brands domestically.“M&A is not a place where we’re looking to deploy capital right now,” Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s chief financial officer, said on a conference call. “Tuck-ins will be geared toward developing markets, not toward US beverages.”Mr Johnston’s remarks came as the US drinks and snacks company reported a steep drop in its second-quarter profits, hit by the stronger US dollar and restructuring charges. In spite of substantial reinvestment in its beverage brands, PepsiCo still struggled to revive sales in its carbonated soft drinks business.The fast-growing energy drinks category has been one area where sparkling beverage sales are surging. Although rival Coca-Cola has held talks with Monster Beverage to acquire the popular energy drink maker, PepsiCo will continue to use distribution arrangements to capitalise on demand for highly caffeinated sparkling beverages.Analysts said the company was wise to focus on its current “reset” plans, announced in February.“I don’t think any large acquisition should be undertaken by PepsiCo,” said Ali Dibadj, analyst at Bernstein Research. “They have too many large things to deal with right now and while they are dealing with them well, they don’t need any distractions.”In February, PepsiCo introduced an aggressive plan to rehabilitate its struggling US beverage business through additional investment in its flagship soda and other core brands. The company, which cut 8,700 jobs, is investing $500m-$600m in marketing and advertising this year.PepsiCo said on Wednesday it increased advertising spending in the US by 40 per cent during the second quarter from the same period a year ago.In spite of a steep drop in its second-quarter profits, analysts said that PepsiCo’s plans appeared to be on track. Much of the decline was attributed to refranchising charges and foreign exchange fluctuations.Net income at PepsiCo fell 21 per cent year-on-year to $1.49bn, or 94 cents a share, as net revenues declined by 2 per cent to $16.4bn. The results were slightly better than Wall Street analysts had expected and PepsiCo shares closed up 2.2 per cent to $70.30.Net revenue at PepsiCo Americas Beverages fell 5 per cent year-on-year and operating profit declined 15 per cent. Revenues in the US food business rose 4 per cent but operating profit declined.Last week rival Coca-Cola reported a rare decline in quarterly earnings, which were hampered by the strength of the dollar and weakness in Europe.
279;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Muslims turn to Scottish oats for Ramadan;;The small Scottish market town of Cupar in Fife is enjoying a boom in exports of porridge oats – thanks to fasting Muslims in the Middle East.UK food and drink producers, faced with cash-strapped consumers at home, are striving to find new overseas markets. Food and non-alcohol exports last year rose 11 per cent to £12.15bn, and global sales are a key plank of the industry’s targeted growth of 20 per cent by 2020.But while Scotland’s most famous export, whisky, continues to lead the way, seafood, biscuits and even pig meat are starting to carve out sales overseas.As are oats. PepsiCo of the US, manufacturer of Quaker Oats, now sends half its Scottish-grown grains overseas. Shipments from Scotland to the Middle East and north Africa jumped 25 per cent year on year.The region consumes more than 10,000 tonnes of these oats, used to bulk up stews and soups for the evening meal during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.“Shorbat Quaker”, or Quaker Soup, has become a popular starter on the Ramadan menu in the Gulf. The soup, which can be made with chicken or lamb, is often eaten after the first breaking of the fast at the Iftar meal. In other parts of the Middle East, lentil soup is typically the first course.“It’s the only thing I remember as a kid – I still remember it, in fact I saw it today,” says Reem, who lives in Dubai and is fasting this month.Since she was a child she has eaten the soup after breaking the fast with dates. Soft on the stomach, it provides the perfect way to ease fasting, she says. Others point to the slow-release energy offered by oats.During Ramadan, which began last week, families and friends across the Gulf gather to break the fast after the sun sets. There is also a tradition of charity during the festive period and families take to helping poorer communities by providing them with meals.In the weeks ahead of Ramadan and also during the holy month, food prices in the Gulf often rise due to heightened demand, even boosting inflation in the region. Regional governments have taken action to prevent such food price rises by keeping a watchful eye on retailers.Oats are not the only beneficiary of Ramadan. Vimto, the fruit cordial brand made by Nichols of the UK, also sees surging sales over the period. This year, Nichol’s Saudi partner Aujan Industries expects to trump last year’s sales of Vimto thanks to the hot weather. The purple soft drink containing juices, herbs and spices was originally developed as a health tonic in 1908 to take advantage of growing demand for soft drinks created by the growth of the temperance movement before the first world war.It has since become a popular feature of Ramadan in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries as a pick-me-up beverage once daytime fasting ends.Quaker Oats sent to the Arab world look rather different from those consumed in the UK, where they are more commonly eaten at breakfast – often with a spoonful of syrup or sugar.In the Middle East, oats come in tins that have a shelf life of up to three years, and provide protection in more extreme climates and conditions.

As part of this organisation’s unstinting commitment to the games we are now applying strict Olympic governance conditions to the production of this article.For a start, all Olympic marketing rules will be vigorously applied and we will not let any free-riders or parasites hijack this column for their own purposes and to the detriment of our sponsors. As is well understood there can be no mention in this article of any products or businesses that have not paid through the nose to be here. Our sponsors have paid good money for the prominence they expect in this column and so as I sip my mouthwateringly refreshing Coke and type away on a computer purchased with my Visa card I am resolved not to let them down.Security staff are on high alert for guerrilla marketing campaigns that might undermine the spirit of this article. There was, for example, an attempt in the paragraph above to sneak in a reference to Pepsi but the word was caught by one of the 10,000 burly production editors hired to keep the word Pepsi out of this column. We have reassured our sponsors that the word Pepsi will not appear in this newspaper for the duration of the games and severe penalties await those who flout the rules.A series of specially created draconian laws has been enacted to protect the integrity of events and the person responsible for attempting to sneak in the reference is now under lock and key at the Olympic police station, where he is likely to be charged under the new criminal offence of mentioning the word Pepsi in a built-up Olympic area within the hours of August. Anyone caught doing so will have their hair dyed blond to be made to look like Julian Assange, and handed over to the Americans. We have promised our sponsors that this will be a festival of fun and freedom and we will not let anyone ruin it by speaking out of turn. Watch and learn Beijing; this is how things work in a free country. We are prepared to act ruthlessly. Extremism in defence of sponsors is no vice. Our security staff stand ready to frisk everyone attempting to read this article and sniffer dogs are on hand to detect any traces of MasterCard.We have faced criticism about some of our choices of sponsors. You will know of the concern that the presence of McDonald’s and Coke are hardly conducive to promoting healthy lifestyles. Well, we too have faced a similar backlash over the decision to site a large Spearmint Rhino lap dancing club in the middle of the newsroom, with people questioning how this sits with our commitment to gender equality even if it is popular with some of our City readers. We would like to stress that we remain absolutely unwavering in that commitment and that we have extracted a promise from Spearmint Rhino that at the end of each dance, every customer will be given a booklet on 50 great women, entitled You Don’t Have to be Hot to be Great, with biographies of Marie Curie, Margaret Thatcher, Abigail Adams, Amelia Earhart and Kim Kardashian.That said, readers should understand that this is a huge logistical exercise and we know there have been problems. The private outsourcing company hired to produce a number of the paragraphs has let us down badly, informing me only last night that they had not been able to recruit enough words to fill the available space. Several of their phrases did not show up for duty as expected, having been caught in severe traffic delays on the M4. As a result we are mobilising 3,000 troops currently on standby to deliver sentences at short notice. So fall in, you horrible shower.As part of the extensive security concerns we have stationed surface-to-air delete buttons around the author’s desk to prevent purple prose from flying into the middle section of this article and attacking the Banx cartoon. Some local residents have objected to the presence of these weapons on their roofs but we have assured them that it is part of the inclusivity agenda that is a core mission of this organisation.Sadly, some recommendations of the Notebook Delivery Authority are still to be implemented. The editor is still resisting my insistence on priority coffee lanes for me and my mates at the staff canteen. We know it was not universally popular but it is designed to ensure a smooth running of this Notebook and its omission is to be regretted. I only hope it doesn’t detract too much from your enjoyment of this article.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"

The inquest was adjourned because Mr Rausing was in hospital being treated for alcohol withdrawal, and not fit to answer questions.Late on Tuesday, however, Mr Rausing was charged with preventing the “lawful and decent burial of Eva Rausing’s body”. He is to appear at West London Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday.The coroner is still awaiting the results of post mortem tests on Ms Rausing’s body and, in the interim, her death is being described as “unexplained”.Mr Kemeny said Mrs Rausing, who had tried to overcome drug addiction for years, had “saved thousands of lives – tragically not her own”, through her work with drug prevention and treatment charities.Before her marriage, Mrs Rausing had worked as an assistant for John Aspinal, the casino millionaire, zookeeper and former friend of Lord Lucan, the missing peer.Mrs Rausing’s duties “included buying exotic fruit for his large collection of gorillas”, said Mr Kemeny.Her family said they hoped their tribute, which detailed the various drug prevention and treatment charities Mrs Rausing had contributed to, would “draw attention to the tragedy of drug addiction”, adding: “This is a stark reminder that the illness of addiction knows no social class or gender.”In due course, they would launch a charitable foundation in her memory.Mr Rausing’s father, also called Hans, became famous for his association with the Tetra Pak carton company and is one of the richest men in Britain with a fortune estimated at £4.3bn. Hans Kristian and his two sisters, Lisbet and Sigrid, stand to inherit this fortune.
282;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-07-11T02:00:29Z;Guest post: PepsiCo’s 30 years in China – chips and chopsticks;;"By Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCoMore than 30 years ago, PepsiCo was one of the first American companies to enter China. My first visit here as a PepsiCo executive came in the mid-1990s, shortly after PepsiCo Foods introduced Lay’s potato chips to the Chinese market. One image that I will never forget, shortly after the launch, is the sight of dozens of people on city streets eating those chips—using chopsticks.Just two decades later, Lay’s is the best-selling potato chip across China, in dozens of unique flavors: from “Numb and Spicy Hot Pot” and “Hot and Sour Fish Soup” to my local favorite, “Cucumber”.It’s a tribute to globalization that nearly 40 per cent of all Chinese have now tried Lay’s potato chips. It’s a testament to the unlimited growth potential here that 60 per cent of the population – more than 800m people – have yet to experience them. It’s one of the many reasons why China is central to the long-term growth strategy of companies like PepsiCo.I’m in China to open a new foods manufacturing plant in Wuhan - our sixth in China – that enables us to further expand our operations into central and western China. This follows our recent success in beverages (a new alliance with food and beverage giant, Tingyi, makes PepsiCo part of the largest liquid refreshment beverage network across China , with more than 70 manufacturing plants).The Wuhan plant will create about 1,000 local jobs and is part of a $3.5bn investment program in China from 2008 to 2013.What have we learned about consumers in China the past 30 years? Three things.First, for Chinese consumers it’s all about choice. In the US, there are a few snacks aisles. In China, there are more like 10 – with everything from chips to ducks’ tongues to pigs’ feet. Consumers buy them all, for the same reason meals in China have up to 15 dishes, served family style: they want variety. It creates incredible growth opportunities for companies with deep and diverse food and beverage portfolios.Second, local tastes are king. Global brands do well here, if you can tailor products to local tastes. Our Quaker brand is succeeding in China because we’ve combined oats and rice to create a delicious version of congee, a popular local breakfast porridge. And it’s why we are preparing a new R&D center, scheduled to open here this fall, to drive innovation with local flavors across China and Asia.Third, how you do business in China is as important as what you do. Corporations are expected to build their businesses in a way that also helps China grow, while meeting the needs of China’s people. We’re supporting China’s 12th Five-Year Plan through continuous investments across our operations in China, advancing rural and regional development and implementing measures to protect the environment. The new plant in Wuhan is expected to use 30 per cent less water and 20 per cent less energy than our China foods facilities did in 2006, which will preserve scarce resources while improving our business performance. In China, as in every country, what is good for business can and should be good for the world.Indra Nooyi is chairman and chief executive of PepsiCoRelated reading:

283;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-07-10T19:48:35Z;Tetra Pak heir’s wife found dead;;Hans Kristian Rausing, son of the Swedish billionaire who made his fortune developing the Tetra Pak company, is thought to have been questioned by police in London after his wife Eva was found dead in their Knightsbridge home.Scotland Yard said a 49-year-old man – understood to be Mr Rausing – had been arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs on Monday but would not confirm his identity. He is said to be receiving medical attention.When officers went to his house in Cadogan Place, they found a body, confirmed by police on Tuesday night as his 48-year-old wife Eva.American by birth, Mrs Rausing was the daughter of former Pepsi executive Tom Kemeny. In a statement, her parents said they were “devastated” by the death of their daughter, whom they described as “a devoted wife for 20 years and mother of four much loved and wonderful children”. “She bravely fought her health issues for many years,” the statement read.Mrs Rausing’s husband is the son of the former Tetra Pak co-owner, also called Hans, who helped shape the business that became famous for revolutionising the packaging of everyday groceries.While the senior Mr Rausing divested himself of his 50 per cent stake in the Tetra Laval group, which includes Tetra Pak, in 1995, he is still estimated to be worth £4.3bn by the Sunday Times rich list, and is number 12 in this year’s ranking of Britain’s wealthiest people. Recently, he has made investments in environmentally friendly packaging businesses.Mr Rausing senior and his wife Marit said they were “deeply shocked and saddened” to hear of their daughter-in-law’s death.Mrs Rausing has previously faced charges in relation to a 2008 drugs offence.“Following a subsequent search that afternoon of an address in Cadogan Place SW1, a body was found,” the Metropolitan Police said. A postmortem at Westminster Mortuary did not establish a formal cause of death, and police are awaiting the results of tests. Officers say the death is being treated as “unexplained”.Mr Rausing will inherit his father’s fortune along with his sisters, Lisbet, an academic, and Sigrid, a publisher and owner of the literary magazine Granta.Eva and Hans Kristian were involved with the charity Mentor, which aims to prevent children from becoming involved in drugs.On Tuesday night, Tetra Laval said: “Hans Kristian Rausing is the son of Hans Rausing, who together with his immediate family divested its interest in Tetra Pak, and the Tetra Laval group, in 1995. Hence, the reference to our company in this context is factually wrong and as this tragic event has no connection to Tetra Pak it would be fully inappropriate for us to comment.”

PepsiCo is rolling out more snacks and drinks. Unilever has tripled its business in 11 years.Turkey may neighbour Greece, but it might as well be on a different planet. The economy is growing, shoppers are shopping and purveyors of consumer goods are falling over themselves to expand in the self-styled gateway between Asia and Europe.“All our global clients have Turkey in their top 10 investment markets,” says Philip Norminton, who runs data provider Nielsen’s Turkish operation.Mehmet Tutuncu, president of food and beverages at Űlker, says: “We are growing because Turkey is growing.” The Turkish snacks and confectionery group lifted sales by 10 per cent last year and expects to grow 10-15 per cent this year.PepsiCo, the US snacks and beverages company that counts Turkey as a top 10 market, concurs. Its sales grew by double digits last year.“A lot of people are entering the middle classes,” says Eugene Willemsen, who runs Pepsi’s south-eastern European region.Much of this is predicated on a consumption-oriented economy. Consumption makes up 70 per cent of output in an economy that last year grew 8.5 per cent, the second-fastest in the world after China.It is one of Turkey’s quintessential sights – the neighbourhood shop and its roadside display of fresh produce, lovingly arranged and even polished, writes Daniel Dombey in Istanbui.It is also a big factor confronting international consumer groups operating in Turkey, a market that dazzles by comparison with the eurozone and elsewhere.Cem Karakas, chief financial officer at Yildiz Holding, a private Turkish group involved in food production, retail and wholesale, says bakkals, as the corner stores are known, have advantages that more organised commerce is hard pushed to match. Their resilience shapes the consumer sector as a whole, he says.Executives from other groups agree. Bakkals account for at least 40 per cent of Turkish consumer goods retail sales, meaning supermarkets do not have the same bargaining power over producers as elsewhere.Consumer goods companies’ logistics and distribution arms have to take account of thousands of small shops stretched across the country.Some of the same factors that favour bakkals have made small discount stores one of the fastest growing parts of the retail sector, one of the reasons Yildiz Holding has bought Cok, one of Turkey’s three biggest discount chains.Mr Karakas lists bakkals’ competitive advantages – their special care with arranging fruit and vegetables is a factor, even though the roadside displays are exposed to traffic fumes. Bakkals are also open almost 24 hours a day.The cramped nature of Turkish city life also benefits them. Sometimes supermarket-sized lots are rare and car ownership is low. Many people cannot jump into the car for a shopping run.Finally, there is an attribute that organised commerce would be particularly hard pushed to replicate: building on their local know-how, bakkals often sell on credit.Turkey may be modernising fast – but, in the food retail business at least, tradition dies hard.The 75m population is young and growing richer. Bulls take further solace from a healthy banking system, strengthened after its own financial crisis in 2001.“Probably Turkey is one of the few markets that has not been negatively impacted by the global crisis,” says Galip Yorgancioglu, chief executive of Mey Içki. The maker of local liquor raki was bought by Diageo for £1.3bn last year.Nonetheless, there are cavils. Immunity to the direct impact from the eurozone financial crisis is counterbalanced by the fact some 40 per cent of exports go to Europe. Loans are growing quickly, although from a low base, raising a red flag for some economists.There are already signs of a slowdown in the first months of this year. Measured in volume terms, sales of fast-moving consumer goods dipped 1.3 per cent in the year to April versus the year-ago period, according to data collated by Nielsen.Non-alcoholic drinks dipped 1.5 per cent; dairy 2.7 per cent and tobacco 2.5 per cent. However, measured by value, all grew, boosted in part by inflation and taxes.The latter is another risk, as Diageo discovered when the alcohol industry was hit by bigger tax bills after it acquired Mey Içki.Mr Yorgancioglu is sanguine. People drank less after the taxes came in last October, he says, but “when consumers got used to the new prices, they came back to their previous frequency levels”.Another risk is currency devaluation, which raises the price of imported goods. The Turkish lira tumbled against the dollar and euro last year, before recovering. The resultant inflation puts pressure on discretionary spending.Turkish consumers’ habits differ widely from other parts of the world – both emerging and developed – too. Barely a fifth of the female population is in paid work, and there is less interest in ready meals and the private label beloved by other parts of Europe.Izzet Karaca, who heads Unilever’s Turkey operations, divides the market into villages and big cities. “In the villages people are still looking for international goods, whereas in the bigger cities people are looking for more sophistication; for example they will want to have special desserts from eastern Turkey,” he says.He stresses Unilever’s production of ice cream versions of classic Turkish desserts and highlights the success of café chains with a local flavour, such as Simit Saray, which sells Turkish-style bagels.The manufacturers also have to contend with a very different retail structure which makes distribution tougher – having to deal with thousands of small local stores – but has the advantage of giving them more pricing power than they have in more concentrated retail markets like the UK, says Mr Normington.The bigger fear is if that growth evaporates suddenly as it has elsewhere in the world and that Turkish consumption – like debt-fuelled shopping frenzies everywhere from the US to Korea – implodes.Many analysts discount this risk, although the country remains vulnerable to external shocks because of its large current account deficit.“We do not have a bubble,” says Burak Tansan, managing director of Boston Consulting Group in Istanbul.His colleague Deran Taskiram, principal for consumers at BCG, adds that far from being spendthrifts, Turkish consumers are frugal.“Unlike in the Bric countries where frugality comes later because when you have money you spend, spend, spend . . . in terms of trading down, Turkey is much closer to the US and Europe than China.”That may comfort economists but may be rather less good news for those seeking to sell more snacks and soaps into the country."
285;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-06-27T12:27:43Z;Coke in India: Thums Up?;;"It is India’s most popular cola, commanding over 40 per cent of a market estimated at $700m. It’s bigger than Coke or Pepsi but, odds are, you’ve never heard of it.It’s called Thums Up (the missing “b” is not a typo) and Coca-Cola’s announcement on Tuesday that it would invest an additional $3bn in India over the coming eight years should mean Indians will see even more of it. But Coke has had a complicated relationship with Thums Up since it bought it in 1993.Thums Up was launched in 1977, the same year Coke and Pepsi pulled out of India after the government introduced new foreign ownership rules that would have forced them to sell 60 per cent of their businesses to local partners.Parle Agro, a Mumbai-based consumer goods company, promptly launched a Coke-alternative – though with “an orange base and more fizz”, according to one of the company’s owners, Ramesh Chauhan – along with Sprite-alternative Citra and some other soft drinks.Thums Up was a hit. It thrived in the 1980s, topping the cola market. When Coke returned to India in 1993 following deregulation, it promptly bought out Chauhan’s soft drink portfolio for $60m and effectively, according to analysts, tried to snuff the brand out – an allegation Coke denies.“Coke bought it from the Chauhans and then it did its very best to kill the brand – it didn’t buy it because it believed in it, it bought it so there was one less competitor,” said Arvind Singhal of Technopak, one of India’s leading retail consultancies.It didn’t work. Thums Up remained popular, especially in rural India. Coke’s drink occupies a lowly third place among India’s colas, selling fewer than half the bottles Thums Up does.Which should, theoretically, be fine – either way, the Coca-Cola Company makes money.But retail analysts have seen sinister motives behind some of Coke’s recent actions, including its decision in February to reduce the price of 200ml returnable glass bottles of Coke to Rs8 from Rs10, while Thums Up remained priced at Rs10. The Economic Times headline read: “Will Coke’s 200ml pack price cut cannibalise Thums Up?”In May, the Economic Times reported that the company had told its bottling and trade partners to “push Coke ahead of other brands in its portfolio”.Coke told the newspaper: “Our 2020 vision outlines our portfolio priorities as creating the world’s most valuable portfolio of beverages and winning with trademark Coca-Cola. In India, as across the world, we have outlined our focus on growing the Coca-Cola franchise.”A spokesman told beyondbrics that Thums Up “is growing at a healthy rate and is a key asset in our portfolio. We invest behind all our brands including Thums Up to ensure that we continue to enhance brand preference and brand love.”Coke says its flagship price cut is aimed at Pepsi, not Thums Up. And in 2010, it produced what may then have been the most expensive Indian ad ever… for Thums Up.So there may be hope for Thums Up’s many fans (including this one) that their favourite pop has a future – especially as it’s getting harder and harder to find a Thums Up in more upmarket urban establishments.Even if Coke decides to commit the entirety of their massive investment behind their flagship, Thums Up will probably still be okay – as Singhal said: “This is the brand with nine lives. You can try to kill it whichever way but somehow it always shows resilience.”Related reading:

286;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-06-26T18:18:06Z;Coke’s $3bn to add fizz to India presence;;Coca-Cola is escalating the beverage wars in India, announcing a $3bn investment intended to help it overtake PepsiCo in one of the few countries where it trails its rival.Coke, the world’s largest drinks company by revenues, said it would spread the investment over the next eight years.The move marks the acceleration of Coke’s commitment to India, superseding last year’s plan to invest $2bn over five years. That is as much as Coke invested in the country between 1993 and 2011.Muhtar Kent, Coke’s chief executive, said: “Our ongoing investment in India is focused on delivering innovation, partnerships and a portfolio that enhances the consumer experience, ensures product affordability and builds brand loyalty to deliver long-term growth.”Soft drinks companies have been ramping up their spending in emerging markets as consumption of carbonated beverages in the US has been rapidly declining.In 2011, Coke said it would invest $4bn in China over three years and, this month, it became one of the first western companies to plan to invest in Myanmar.Coke and PepsiCo are in a close race for dominance in the carbonated soft drink market in India, with Coke accounting for 56 per cent of sales compared with Pepsi’s 40 per cent, according to Beverage Digest data.However, the market share of Pepsi’s flagship brand is almost double that of Coke in the country, according to Euromonitor, the data provider.In 2008, Pepsi announced a three-year $500m investment in India.Consumer companies have been optimistic about India because of its large, and young, population as well as its rapid economic growth.However, analysts at Bernstein Research said recently that profit margins were shrinking in the country due to a combination of local companies stepping up efforts to protect their turf and the expense of distribution outside of cities.Coke has a checkered history in India, having abandoned the market in 1977 after the ­government demanded that the company work with an Indian partner and share its secret ­formula.The US group re­entered India in 1993, by which time Pepsi had gained an advantage, having launched three years earlier in a joint venture with two local companies.Health worries and environmental concerns have also been an obstacle. In 2005, Coke was criticised in India for having high levels of pesticides in its products and for contributing to water scarcity.“Coca-Cola has now achieved a net zero balance with regard to groundwater usage in India,” Coke said. “It is well integrated with local Indian communities and is a valued contributor to economic and social growth.”
287;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-06-21T21:02:19Z;US stocks fall amid broad sell-off;;US equity markets on Thursday suffered their largest one-day drop since the start of the month as investors prepared for the downgrade of major US banks with sentiment also hurt by worries over the global economy.The S&P financials index dropped 2.3 per cent in regular trading and then after the closing bell Moody’s lowered the credit ratings on 15 major global investment banks’.In after-hours trading, shares in Morgan Stanley rose 3.4 per cent as the cut was less severe than expected and that offset a drop of 1.7 per cent to $13.96 in regular trading.Shares in JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs also moved higher in after-hours trade after they had their ratings cut. Negative outlooks on the bank’s ratings remained in place.Earlier during regular trading, shares in Bank of America dropped 3.9 per cent to $7.82, JPMorgan Chase fell 2.6 per cent to $35.51 and Citigroup lost 3.6 per cent to $28.83. Goldman Sachs dropped 2.7 per cent to $93.90.That weighed on the broad market, but energy, material and technology stocks led losses, with commodity-based stocks hit hard by fears of slowing global economy.The S&P 500 lost 2.2 per cent to 1,325.51 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.9 per cent to 12,573.57 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.4 per cent to 2,859.09. The CBOE’s Vix index, dubbed the “fear gauge”, rose more than 16 per cent to 20.06.Quincy Krosby, financial markets strategist at Prudential, said: “The combination of economic data that was weaker than expected, continued worries over eurozone sovereign debt crisis and disappointment from the Fed’s monetary policy decision was a lethal combination and triggered a broad sell-off.“At these levels markets are moving to what most analysts think of as being oversold,” she added.Among a host of stocks that experienced sharp price declines, Bed Bath & Beyond shares tumbled after the housewares chain announced a slowdown in same-store sales for the second quarter and forecast profits that were well below market expectations.The dramatic 17 per cent fall to $61.17 came after the company’s share price hit a record high on Tuesday.Gary Baxter, analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note: “One of the reasons behind the weaker guidance was costs associated with the acquisition of Cost Plus, numbers we are quite sure investors did not have in their models. Near term, we do not expect the stock to outperform. That said, we believe investors are overreacting to the costs of the acquisitions and underestimating the benefits.”Investors who were expecting more aggressive stimulus from the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday were mildly disappointed after the central bank decided to extend Operation Twist for another six months but left the door open for further easing if the economy deteriorates.That was followed by the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey index dropping unexpectedly and data showed that initial jobless claims had not fallen as much as hoped.Disappointing economic news from China and Germany also weighed on stocks before the opening bell. Worries about slowing demand in China and Europe triggered selling of materials and energy stocks, which are strongly correlated to commodities, especially crude oil.ExxonMobil fell 3.4 per cent to $82.11 and ConocoPhillips fell 2.5 per cent to $52.07, but the biggest loser among S&P energy stocks was EOG Resources, an independent oil and gas group, which fell 6.9 per cent to $86.48.Meanwhile, disappointing US existing home sales figures put downward pressure on builders and home improvement stores. Pulte fell 4 per cent to $9.14 and DR Horton fell 2.7 per cent to $16.29.Among tech stocks, Apple fell 1.4 per cent to $577.67 while Google and Oracle lost 2.4 per cent to $565.21 and 2.4 per cent to $27.81, respectively.Shares in Red Hat, the largest seller of the open-source Linux operating system, slumped 6.2 per cent to $53 as deferred revenue missed some analysts’ forecasts.Ebay edged higher in early trade after the online auction sales group announced plans to build a new data centre that would draw power from renewable energy fuel cells instead of the electric grid. But the company’s shares soon fell in line with the rest of the tech sector, closing 2.6 per cent to $41.83.Philip Morris International’s fell 3.3 per cent to $85.60 after the world’s largest tobacco company by revenues warned that the strengthening US dollar would drag on its earnings this year. The group’s profit warning comes on the heels of similar warnings from Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo on Wednesday.ConAgra was a rare bright spot, up 2.7 per cent to $25.26, after adjusted quarterly profit narrowly beat Wall Street estimates.
288;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-06-21T12:35:04Z;Philip Morris warns on strong US dollar;;Philip Morris International, the world’s largest tobacco company by revenues, said on Thursday that the strengthening US dollar will be a drag on its earnings this year.The US company that sells tobacco products overseas warned that foreign exchange fluctuations could cut 25 cents off its earnings per share in 2012, reducing the top end of its forecast from $5.30 to $5.20 a share. Excluding the impact of currencies PMI expects its profits to rise by 10-12 per cent from a year ago.PMI’s profit warning came a day after Procter & Gamble reduced its earnings outlook and PepsiCo said that foreign exchange would be a bigger drag on its performance than it anticipated.In spite of currency concerns, PMI said it was making progress on other fronts.Louis Camilleri, chief executive, said in an investor presentation on Thursday that the company has been successful at fending off excessive excise taxes in most countries and had made substantial progress with “modified risk tobacco products” which are expected to support sales as more people quit smoking.“We are on the eve of what we all believe could be a paradigm shift for our industry and for PMI,” Mr Camilleri said.However, PMI warned that plain packaging legislation that the Australian government is trying to impose, and that other countries are considering, represents a risk.“We are witnessing more frequent calls for measures that are not only arbitrary and alarming, but that stand little or no chance of achieving the benefits that their proponents claim,” Mr Camilleri said.
289;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-06-18T18:37:19Z;PepsiCo targets north-east Brazil;;PepsiCo’s foods division is looking to double its revenue in the next three to four years in Brazil in spite of a recent slowdown in Latin America’s largest economy.PepsiCo’s plan reflects the belief of many local groups and multinationals that the longer term structural source of economic growth in Brazil, the rise of its lower-middle class, especially in the traditionally poorer northeast, is intact.“We have been doubling our business in [the richer south of] Brazil every five years and in the northeast every three years,” said Olivier Weber, PepsiCo’s president of South America, Caribbean and Central America foods.Economists characterise Brazil’s economy as two-speed, with headline growth stalling amid a slowdown in manufacturing and investment but consumption remaining relatively solid.Record low unemployment and pay rises this year have ensured that consumers, while less exuberant than in the past, are continuing to spend, particularly in the country’s booming northeastern states, which feature a high proportion of so-called C-class lower-middle-income earners.Itáu BBA, an investment bank, defined the group as people who earn between R$291 (US$141) per month and R$1,250.“Retailers and consumer goods companies that better understand the minds and hearts of these consumers … will hold an important structural advantage in the Brazilian consumer space,” the bank said in a recent report.Mr Weber said PepsiCo’s foods division, which sells brands ranging from Ruffles and Doritos chips to Toddynho, a popular chocolate drink, had doubled its business in the country between 2002 and 2006 and again between 2006 and 2010. It hoped to achieve the same again by 2015 or 2016.This would mean increasing sales from about $2.5bn now to $4bn-$5bn. Brazil is the fifth largest market in the world for PepsiCo foods and accounts for half of its Latin American sales.He did not say how much the company planned to invest. But he pointed to its acquisition last year of biscuit maker Grupo Mabel, reported to have cost R$800m, which gave PepsiCo access to the world`s second-largest market for crackers in terms of volume of goods sold.The company was investing in manufacturing plants nearer to its markets in the northeast and centre-west to cater more for differing dietary habits between the various regions of Brazil and to reduce logistics costs.Mr Weber said the potential of the market was shown by the still low per capita consumption of savoury snacks in Brazil – about 1.2 kilos per person a year, versus 8 in the US and 3.6 kilos in Mexico.
290;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-06-17T18:35:11Z;Calls for corporate disclosure of social impact;;“What gets measured gets managed,” said Peter Drucker, the business guru, and it is even more true when the measurements are reported to regulators and investors.That is the thinking behind the pressure from some investors, governments and campaign groups for companies to improve their reporting of their environmental and social impact. By disclosing their results in areas such as water and energy use, waste and workplace safety, businesses will be encouraged to improve their performance.For investors such as Aviva, which has been a leader in urging greater transparency on these issues, those factors are vital information because they can have material consequences for companies’ financial results.That argument is clearly gaining ground. Governments and stock exchanges around the world are coming out in support of “sustainability reporting”, as it is known, driving the most significant changes to corporate disclosure since the move towards international accounting rules a decade ago.It could have a far-reaching effect on corporate strategy and investor behaviour, particularly in environmentally sensitive industries such as energy and food.Mark Fulton of Deutsche Bank asset management, which has been seeking to highlight the importance of environmental issues for investors, says: “If a company doesn’t rate well on these issues, it could be forced to do something about them. The question for companies is not just the cost of doing the reporting: it’s that it could mean a change of strategy. That’s where it gets serious.”Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, for example, have been increasing their disclosure about water use, and making it more of an issue in their sourcing and investment decisions.At this week’s Rio+20 summit, where there will inevitably be a large number of well-meaning but nebulous aspirations, an international commitment to push companies towards reporting more environmental and social data could be one of the most concrete outcomes.Even if governments fail to agree such a commitment, companies, investors and stock exchanges are using Rio to announce further moves to increase the disclosure and use of environmental and social information.The Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative, a UN-backed group, is on Monday holding a conference in Rio with exchanges including Nasdaq OMX from the US, Bovespa from Brazil, and the Istanbul stock exchange, at which some of them are expected to talk about requiring more disclosure of sustainability information from companies as part of their listing standards.Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a US-based coalition of investors and environmental groups, says increased demands for environmental and social data from exchanges would be “an important step in the right direction”.She adds: “Voluntary reporting is great, and sustainability reporting is growing fast. But some disclosures ought to be mandatory, such as information about climate change. That is a material risk to businesses.”The model for campaigners on this issue is the Johannesburg exchange, which since 2010 has required every listed company to publish what is known as an integrated report, including environmental and social data alongside their financial results.Other exchanges vary as to how far they want to follow that example. Bovespa has introduced the “report or explain” model advocated by Aviva, under which companies have to either publish environmental and social data or say why those issues are not material to their business. The Singapore stock exchange has published recommended guidelines for sustainability reporting, and suggested that they could become mandatory.US exchanges and companies have generally not moved as far in this direction. NYSE Euronext is not sending anyone to Rio and Nasdaq talks about being in learning mode.Practices vary widely among US companies. Some, including Southwest Airlines and United Technologies, the manufacturing group, produce full integrated reports but the US also has large international companies that do no sustainability reporting.Overall, the state of integrated reporting today is where financial reporting was before the Great Depression and the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, according to Bob Eccles of the Harvard Business School. It lacks the whole infrastructure of standards, audit and supervision that now exists for financial data.As a result, says Prof Eccles – who is the chairman of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a new body set up to fill in those details for US corporations – even if there is a commitment by governments to require increased sustainability reporting, it would not have much immediate impact. There will still be a great deal of work to do to set out exactly what that would mean for companies.Meanwhile, many investors still do not make use of the environmental and social information that they are given.Even so, Ernst Ligteringen of the Global Reporting Initiative, a non-profit organisation that draws up sustainability reporting guidelines, believes progress towards increased disclosure is inevitable.“It’s only a matter of time. It may not be this year, but in five years I believe it will be virtually everywhere.”
291;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-06-12T04:02:05Z;Rest of us have to pay for supersized drinks;;From Mr Fred E. Hahn.Sir, In your editorial “Bloomberg’s ban” against New York City’s ban on large sweetened drinks, you write that “drinking supersized cups of Pepsi affects only the purchaser”. But that is simply untrue. Go to where those monster drinks are sold. You will find comparatively few of the economically blessed. It’s there where the less financially fortunate fill themselves and their children as they go on their collective way to life-long medical problems, for which the rest of us will have to pay. Numerous studies have shown that limiting the amount in these drinks does not tend to lead to additional buying, but to being satisfied with the smaller, healthier portion. When our children were growing up, Pepsi-type drinks were not permitted in our home. Milk and hot chocolate made with real milk did just fine. They still do.Fred E. Hahn, San Diego, CA, US
292;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-06-08T18:15:52Z;Fatty food clampdown is hard to swallow;;"Winnie-the-Pooh: [tries to climb out the front door but is stuck] Oh, oh, help and bother! I’m stuck.Rabbit: Oh, dear. Oh, gracious. Oh. Well, it all comes from eating too much.– Winnie the Pooh and the Honey TreeFood and drink manufacturers are, like Winnie-the-Pooh, in a tight spot. Ten days ago Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor, announced a ban on the sale of “supersized” sugary drinks in restaurants, cinemas and stadiums. And this week – prodded by Michelle Obama, the US first lady – Walt Disney, the media giant behind the film versions of A.A. Milne’s Pooh stories, said it would ban junk food ads on its children’s TV programmes and websites by 2015.These measures, coming on top of taxes on unhealthy foods in places such as Denmark, Hungary and France, hurt. For this is an industry that relies on marketing (which swallows up about $1 in every $10 of revenue) to sell products that no one needs and which, in excess, can lead to obesity.Disney can risk ad sales without upsetting investorsThe big fear for food producers is that legislation, taxation and regulatory clampdowns such as those that engulfed the tobacco industry will come to plague them – despite their protestation that food, unlike cigarettes, does not kill.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the two biggest beverage makers, both flagged a potential dent to earnings from legislative changes long before Mr Bloomberg hatched his plans. In its most recent annual report, Coca-Cola topped a list of more than 30 risk factors” for its profitability with concerns about obesity, related negative publicity and the possibility of new legislation. “Obesity and other health concerns may reduce demand for some of our products,” it said.“In no way can we [the industry] be complacent,” says Fiona Dawson, managing director at Mars Chocolate UK. She argues that “progressive” companies, such as Mars, are staving off legislation by keeping ahead of the curve – reducing fat, sugar and salt, and curbing advertising to children.Some believe the health lobby will receive an extra boost from cash-strapped governments, pointing to the introduction last year of Denmark’s “fat tax”, which charges DKr16 ($2.70) per kilogramme of saturated fat in a product. “The nature of budget deficits worldwide is going to lead to more creative taxation under the guise of health,” says Martin Deboo, a food and drink analyst at Investec, the UK brokerage.Companies are responding with a range of strategies, from working with government, to self-regulation, to lobbying to stave off legislation.Mars ditched all advertising to under-12s globally in 2007; Nestlé, the world’s biggest food company by sales, stopped advertising to children under six last September and limited the products it advertises to those below 12.But not all their peers followed suit, which makes Disney’s ban a big blow to the industry.“It was a pretty significant thing,” Margaret Hamburg, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, told the Financial Times. “[Disney] were …coming up against some components of the food and beverage industry in deciding that they weren’t going to allow certain products to be advertised because of their public health impact.”Despite Disney’s move, restrictions on advertising unhealthy food are tighter in Europe than in the US, where one-third of American adults are obese, the highest percentage of any nation in the world.Advertising restrictions were introduced in the UK in 2006, when the media regulator Ofcom announced a ban on ads for foods high in fat, sugar and salt around children’s viewing times.European companies have also led the way in working with government to set policy. For example, in the industry group working under the UK government’s Public Health Responsibility Deal, set up in 2011, business interests have as many representatives as government and civil society combined.Elsewhere, companies have worked to reformulate their products, eliminating as much sugar, salt and calories as they can while trying not to compromise taste: no one, as Ms Dawson points out, will buy a treat that does not taste good.Heinz discovered as much last year when it reduced the salt in its HP sauce, a favourite British accompaniment to eggs, bacon and sausage. As the mass-market Daily Mail newspaper trumpeted: “HP sauce’s recipe secretly changed after 116 years by American owners of the Great British Condiment.”Changing recipes is not only risky; it also takes time and gobbles up cash. Mars, for example, has reduced saturated fats in its Mars bars and Snickers by 15 per cent. “But that took us five years and millions of pounds in research and development spending,” says Ms Dawson.For some companies, the easier response is to follow the path set by their tobacco peers and head to emerging markets, where regulators are often more relaxed about the health implications of their products.Carbonated drinks are already growing faster, admittedly from a lower base, in emerging markets than in the developed world. Latin America overtook North America in sales by volume in 2008, says Euromonitor, the data agency.Although increasing their market share in emerging markets is the holy grail for many food companies, some caution against exaggerating the effects of regulation on sales in the developed world.“Imperial Tobacco doubled its profits in the UK in the last 20 years despite the tidal wave of regulation,” says Mr Deboo of the UK’s biggest cigarette maker. And, of course, Pooh eventually got out of his tight spot too – with a little help from his friends."
293;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:44+0000;Bloomberg’s ban;New York mayor’s cause is good but he oversteps the line;If there is one thing on which most Americans agree it is that the nation has become too fat. And the problem is getting worse: child obesity is on the rise. Which is why we generally applaud Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor, for his ceaseless efforts to promote public health.Yet Mr Bloomberg’s recent decision to ban the sale of sweetened drinks in portions bigger than 16 ounces (475ml) goes too far. There is a thick line dividing healthy from unhealthy. But the line between soft paternalism and coercion is a thin one. Mr Bloomberg has overstepped it.Until this point, the mayor has largely been on the right track. Banning smoking in restaurants and bars – and then extending that to any public buildings – makes sense. Second-hand smoke is harmful to others. In contrast, drinking supersized cups of Pepsi affects only the purchaser.In the case of transfats, Mr Bloomberg purged a deeply unhealthy ingredient that was invisible to restaurant customers. Again, the distinction is clear: purchasers of 16oz fizzy drinks know what they are buying. Likewise, the mayor has required chain restaurants to post calorie counts against menu items. This also falls on the right side of the line. Information does not restrict freedom.The latest measure thus fails on philosophical grounds. It also fails the pragmatic test. First, it would be easy to beat. There is nothing to stop the consumer from buying several drinks at the same time. Second, it does not raise revenue. Instead of ordering a crude prohibition on size, Mr Bloomberg should have imposed an excise tax.As New York’s smokers will attest, making something dearer forces users to think twice about how much they want to buy. Nor need the outcome be regressive. A soda tax would raise revenues that could be used to promote healthy activities, such as more physical education in schools, cheaper vegetables for food-stamp users, or better urban facilities for cycling.While Mr Bloomberg’s latest prescription goes too far, his diagnosis is right. America’s obesity epidemic needs to be tackled at many levels. But to get anywhere it must include the federal dimension. Washington maintains a corn subsidy that all but guarantees shops will be filled with fructose-heavy products. Anything Mr Bloomberg can do to expose that would be a real service. The US has a payout system that benefits a few Midwestern farmers at the expense of everyone else. Here is something really worth banning.
294;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-06-05T22:47:09Z;Oracle agrees to buy Collective Intellect;;"Oracle stepped up its push into the corporate social media app market by agreeing to acquire Collective Intellect, a leading cloud-based social intelligence technology provider, for an undisclosed sum.The deal also highlights the race to acquire social media and cloud-based technology among the leading enterprise software companies including Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com.Collective Intellect’s semantic and text mining technology allows companies and other organisations to monitor, understand and respond to consumers’ conversations on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.“Creating meaningful content based on a clear understanding of consumers’ conversations is the way brands will create stronger customer relationships,” said Don Springer, founder and chief strategy officer of the seven-year-old company whose customers include CBS, Barclaycard, Hasbro, Nestlé Purina, Walmart, Siemens and Pepsi.Just two weeks ago Oracle paid a reported $300m to buy Vitrue, a social marketing platform provider that has become one of the most popular solutions for big companies trying to win Facebook fans and push out marketing messages to consumers. Then on Monday Salesforce announced plans to buy Buddy Media for $689m.As Zach Hofer-Shall of Forrester noted in a blog posted on Tuesday, the Oracle/Collective Intellect deal comes a year after Salesforce.com purchased Radian6 and now gives both customer relationship management groups “the components they need to piece together something powerful. With social CRM in sight, this social technology arms race is the start of something very big to come,” he said.The flurry of recent mergers and acquisitions activity reflects the growing importance of both social media and cloud-based services to the corporate customers of the leading enterprise software companies such as Oracle and SAP, which has also made a string of recent acquisitions.“Why the acquisition streak?” asked Mr Hofer-Shall. “Because social start-ups hold the innovation that big tech companies need. As the thousands of social start-ups can attest, building social tools can be easy, but building successful social technologies is very, very difficult.“As my colleague Melissa Parrish pointed out in her Salesforce.com/Buddy Media post: ‘These acquisitions are not about adding immediate significant revenue. They’re about adding technology offerings.’ As always, Melissa is absolutely right. None of these acquisitions pick up wildly profitable companies; they pick up unique technologies that will help the tech giants meet future market demands.”The rapid growth over the past few years of social networking services such as Facebook and Twitter has presented companies with both new marketing opportunities and challenges for keeping pace with their customers, many of whom now use social media to comment on, recommend and sometimes criticise companies and their products and services.Oracle said it planned to integrate Collective Intellect and Vitrue’s technology with its own social data management and analytics capabilities to create “the most advanced and comprehensive social relationship platform”.“Gaining intelligence from consumer conversations across social media, and knowing customers’ intentions and interests helps organisations create better products and deliver better service,” said Thomas Kurian, executive vice-president of Oracle Development, explaining the deal.Integrating Collective Intellect and Vitrue with Oracle’s existing software-as-a-service, or SaaS, products will “enable marketing organisations to create more targeted marketing campaigns; help customer service teams respond quickly to customer feedback on social media; generate targeted leads and opportunities for sales teams; and strengthen how companies build more effective brands using the internet and social media”, Oracle claimed."

Yum, which operates KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, is continuing its push to be the dominant foreign restaurant chain in China while trying to revive a struggling business in the US. In spite of its international aspirations, Yum maintains a rich sense of its history.Unlike many corporate campuses, which sequester themselves in suburban fortresses, Yum is housed in a sprawling colonial-style complex that resembles – and is referred to as – the “White House”.Inside the main entrance sits a museum, where a talking mechanical replica of Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC whose face is immortalised in its logo, introduces guests to the company.The walls and ceilings in the 59-year-old’s office are decorated with framed photographs of him with hundreds of employees he has rewarded for exemplary work. Winners are given rubber chickens or cheesehead hats or smiling teeth with feet, along with some cash.“I use my office to symbolise what our business is all about, which is building people capability,” he says. “Our formula for success is you build up people capability, you do that first. Then you satisfy more customers. Then you make more money.”Yum was spun off from PepsiCo in 1997, when Mr Novak was running KFC and Pizza Hut in the US. He passed on an opportunity to run Frito-Lay, PepsiCo’s snack business, so that he could continue developing his restaurant expertise. Four years later he was named Yum’s chief executive.Mr Novak now teaches leadership training programmes and recently authored a book, Taking People With You, but his early days did not foretell his fast ascent to the top of one of the best known US corporations.Born in Texas, Mr Novak lived in23 US states by the time he reached seventh grade. His father was a government surveyor and his family had to relocate frequently, living in trailer parks and changing schools. He studied journalism at the University of Missouri and worked in advertising for a decade before taking a marketing job at Pizza Hut in 1986.“I think it helped me read situations well, understand people, learn how to get to know people quickly,” Mr Novak says of his frequent moves as a child. “I think it’s been great in business, particularly international business, where you have to go in the countries and understand how people think, and listen to what makes them tick.”●Born: Texas

●Family: Married for 37 years with one daughterYum has excelled at understanding what makes China tick. Mr Novak recalls that in 1997, the year of his first trip to the country, parents would take their children to KFC for birthdays or celebrations but did not have enough money to buy food for themselves. “And now, the biggest thing that I see and the biggest difference when I go to China is that the kids are buying the food themselves,” he says. “The consuming population is growing so rapidly that the business is exploding because of it.”During a visit to a KFC on that first trip, a Chinese woman came up to Mr Novak and, assuming he worked for the company, implored him in Mandarin to “build more”.And he has.Yum had 612 restaurants in China in 2001. By last year it had more than 4,000 in 800 cities. The company built its own distribution system and has been a pioneer by expanding into remote parts of the country and drawing customers with a combination of American flair and local flavours. Yum’s strategy of adapting menus with regionalised options that go as far as offering different spice levels according to the province is often regarded as a case study in how to succeed in emerging markets. The company is now trying to export that model of success in India, localising the menus with sinus-searing spices.China is one of the few markets in the world where McDonald’s is not the dominant western fast-food brand. However, the hamburger chain’s promise to push deeper into the country represents a challenge that Yum cannot ignore. “We’ve been creating the category,” Mr Novak says. “What we’re focused on in China is not staving off McDonald’s, but it’s just doing a better job of responding to what our customers are telling us we need to do to become even more relevant.”In spite of Yum’s success overseas, the US has been a sore spot in recent years. When he discusses leadership, Mr Novak says one of his favourite tools is the “hotshot” question, where he asks someone to imagine what a hotshot successor would do with their job.So what would Mr Novak’s hotshot successor do differently? “I feel we could get even more urgency and bigger thinking in our company,” Mr Novak says after a pause.He goes on to explain that McDonald’s has done a better job of “leveraging its asset base”, by launching into breakfast, beverages and being open all night.“I had my entire team around the world go out into McDonald’s, and we called it McDonald’s Immersion Day,” Mr Novak says. “We looked at what they were doing and we said: ‘How can we do something that’s similar with our brands?’ ”Studying the best practice of other is something Mr Novak values highly. Once a year, for example, he heads to Omaha, Nebraska and treats Warren Buffett to lunch at KFC to pick his brain on business. He was introduced to the “Oracle” by Doug Ivestor, former chief executive of Coke, who agreed on one condition: Mr Buffett would not talk about Yum’s stock.“He says make sure you talk about the good, the bad and the ugly,” Mr Novak says. “The more transparent you can be about not only the opportunities you have but the issues you have, the more credibility you’re going to get.”In spite of its recent success, Yum faces tough challenges, from high commodity costs to health advocates who say its fast food is causing obesity and diabetes.Mr Novak bluntly offers no apologies, saying that fried chicken, pizza and tacos can be part of a balanced diet. Still, the company has been offering more salads, reducing sodium levels and adding grilled chicken items, such as the sandwich Mr Novak sometimes eats for lunch.“You can’t be something that you’re not,” he says, explaining that Yum, which aims to be the defining company that feeds the world, is constantly trying to improve its food quality. “We’re actually providing a great service to the world."
296;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:44+0000;New York moves to ban ‘supersized’ sodas;;An anti-obesity initiative launched by Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor, to ban the sale of “supersized” sweetened drinks in restaurants, cinemas and stadiums has attracted fierce criticism from the US beverage industry but won praise from public health experts, who are urging others to adopt the model.Mr Bloomberg’s plan would stop food service establishments selling sugary drinks in portions bigger than 16 ounces (475ml). Diet sodas or drinks containing milk would be exempt, and restaurants could still offer free refills.New York’s department of health said large portion sizes were contributing to the widening obesity epidemic, pointing to data that show more than half of adult New Yorkers are overweight or obese. The administration said people were consuming bigger soda portions with more “empty” calories but not feeling fuller or less thirsty.However, Stefan Friedman, spokesman for the New York City Beverage Association, said: “The city is not going to address the obesity issue by attacking soda because soda is not driving the obesity rates.”Mr Bloomberg’s success at driving public health initiatives – including banning indoor smoking and enforcing calorie labelling at restaurants – has prompted accusations of nanny statism. Yet his administration’s policies have been applauded by public health officials and emulated around the world – a fact not lost on the drinks industry.Speaking at the All Things D conference on Thursday, Mr Bloomberg – who said he has no further political aspirations after his term ends – defended the ban and said obesity deaths would soon outpace smoking deaths in New York.“Obesity is becoming the biggest public health issue in the country,” he said. “We’re not taking away your right to buy soda – you’re free to say you want to buy two 16-ounce cups.”Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drink maker by revenues, said in a statement: “New Yorkers expect and deserve better than this. They can make their own choices about the beverages they purchase.”PepsiCo, the food and beverage group, had no comment on the Bloomberg proposal. However, in an interview last month Derek Yach, PepsiCo’s head of global health policy, acknowledged the beverage industry should do more to market moderation. “I actually think there are more innovative ways we could help people on the beverage side,” Mr Yach said. “Sometimes it will mean limiting the actual portion size of a can.”The latest proposal came after the beverage industry successfully beat an earlier attempt by Mr Bloomberg to implement a tax on soda.Public health experts praised the latest plan and said the ban could be replicated elsewhere.“This addresses the single most important issue in development of obesity, which is overconsumption of calories,” said Marion Nestle, a public health and nutrition professor at New York University. “I do think it will become a model, if they can get away with it.”Obesity has become an increasing concern globally. The World Health Organisation estimates that 500m, or 12 per cent of the world’s population, is obese.In January the city embarked on an anti-soda marketing campaign, with subway ads showing obese people with amputations next to diagrams displaying growing soda sizes.The American Beverage Association argues that drinks groups are unfairly targeted, claiming that carbonated soft drink consumption has been falling while obesity is on the rise. Meanwhile, the lobbying group contends that candy and pizza companies should face the same level of scrutiny.Mr Bloomberg’s proposal will be submitted to the New York City board of health, which will vote on the amendment after a three-month comment period.
297;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-05-28T21:52:23Z;Multinationals pulled into Mexican drug war?;;News that authorities have detained several people suspected of carrying out fire-bomb attacks on a Mexican subsidiary of PepsiCo will doubtless come as a relief to the company and to the wider community of international investors in Mexico.But it won’t do much to answer the concern swirling through Mexican business circles: does the attack mark a worrying change in Mexico’s drugs war?It’s a valid question. For the past five and a half years, Mexicans have watched in fear as well-armed drug cartels have waged a campaign of terror complete with decapitations and massacres. But while the cartels have moved out into other crime areas, including extorting small family-run businesses, they have left larger multinational companies largely alone.Against that backdrop, experts say that the attack on Sabritas, a popular snacks producer and a subsidiary of PepsiCo, is the most significant on a multinational since the government’s crackdown on orgnised crime began. Altogether, five premises were burnt down, including more than 40 delivery vehicles.Authorities have not said much beyond that they are investigating. But a couple of rumours, both unsubstantiated, have been doing the rounds in Mexico. One is that the attacks were part of an attempt by organised crime to extort the company. Another is that they were in reprisal for the alleged use by public prosecutors of Sabritas vans in undercover operations – an extremely unlikely possibility in the eyes of most experts.Until more information about the attacks comes out, it would probably be a mistake to think that multinationals are now a target for Mexico’s drug gangs. The people arrested are believed to be members of the Knights Templar, a psuedo-religious criminal organisation - small in size and geographically localised compared with its competitors.Worrying though they are, their actions are not typical of most of the country’s criminal structures and should therefore be seen – at least for now – as together representing an isolated case.
298;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-05-27T04:00:52Z;Donors hit by lower returns;A US report links large political donations and poor performance;Companies that make political donations produce worse investment returns than their non-donating peers, with the reduction in shareholder value “far outstripping” the value of the donations, research into the US market has found.The findings come at a sensitive time in the US, with a Supreme Court ruling in 2010 having opened the door for companies to spend unlimited amounts on campaign advertisements.So far this year a series of motions proposed by shareholders to bar political donations or to make gifts or political lobbying more transparent have been defeated at companies such as Boeing, IBM, PepsiCo, 3M and Bank of America.However, average support for proposals on political contributions rose to 32.5 per cent in 2011 from 30.4 per cent a year earlier, according to ISS, a proxy voting adviser, and 55 of the 100 largest US companies now disclose direct political spending, according to the Center for Political Accountability.The research* by academics from the universities of Minnesota and Kansas, based on 1,381 companies that made donations between 1991 and 2004, found that each $10,000 of donations typically reduced annual excess returns by 7.4 basis points the following year.Even companies that donated to the winners of presidential or congressional elections failed to reap any benefit. “Donating to either winners or losers is associated with worse returns than not donating at all,” the authors concluded.They argued that a willingness to make political donations was often a sign of poor corporate governance, which in turn drove the underperformance.Political donations are “more a symptom than the root cause [of underperformance]. If a company spends $30,000 on donations then the shareholders are down $30,000, but it’s more than that,” said Felix Meschke, one of the authors.“We don’t find any evidence that donations are good for shareholders. Is there a benefit for the CEO personally? That is very difficult to nail down,” added Mr Meschke, who said 40 chief executives, or their relatives, became US ambassadors during the period of the study.“It can be about personal connections, the revolving door. CEOs etc become government employees.”Corporate governance advocates called for greater transparency around the issue. “I think there are situations, particularly in a heavily regulated industry, where spending on political issues can be useful and can be in shareholders’ interests,” said Linda Scott, managing director of Governance For Owners. “But it is very important to have full disclosure and transparency to make sure that [donations] are for business-related purposes and not for their favourite candidate.”George Dallas, director of corporate governance at F&C Investments and chairman of the International Corporate Governance Network’s business ethics committee, said: “Political lobbying and involvement in the public policy debate is often a very good idea but where money gets involved I think you have to be more careful.“One of our concerns is when there is not a clear business objective behind it. It’s a waste of resources and what does it signal about the degree to which the board is able to keep adequate control or oversight of the executive team?”* Corporate political contributions: investment or agency?

299;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;April showers and costs dampen Britvic;;Selling soft drinks to the cash-strapped consumers of the UK, Ireland and France is not an attractive proposition as the eurozone lurches into potential disarray.Britvic, the company behind Robinsons squash and domestic bottler for PepsiCo, has neither the ballast of emerging markets nor deluxe whiskies that are enabling its bigger alcoholic peers to ride out the storm.Add in April’s prolific showers and a time lag between price increases and higher input costs, and the first half was not pretty. Some of this will reverse out in the second half, when price rises should offset input inflation.Optimists may even reckon the current bout of sunshine will be prolonged, and that, combined with the Jubilee and Olympics, we will all swill down more soft drinks.But even allowing for the April slide in the share price, Britvic has outperformed the broader market year to date. Its discount to international peers, at about 40 per cent on price/earnings multiples according to Panmure Gordon, is well deserved given the state of the local consumer.
300;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T05:21:43+0000;Categories: The best and worst performers;The Luxury and Fast Food sectors lead the way, with Insurance bringing up the rear in a year of contrasting fortunes for brands, writes Andrew Baxter;The BrandZ ranking goes beyond the top 100 to cover 13 different categories or sectors. In some of these categories, virtually all the brands get into the top 100. However, in others, such as apparel, very few do, so these category tables ensure that important areas of the global economy are not ignored just because individual brand values tend to be lower.With top 20s in each of the three mega-categories – technology, financial institutions and retail, and a top 15 for personal care, this means that 165 brands are covered.And how their performance varied during 2011 – with luxury and fast food both up 15 per cent to top the pile and Insurance, down 16 per cent, getting the wooden spoon. Half the categories have gone up and half have gone down. This is not too dissimilar from what was seen in 2008.Here we look at the categories one by one, with comments from Peter Walshe (PW), Millward Brown’s global BrandZ director, Nick Cooper (NC), managing director for Europe at Millward Brown Optimor, and Cristiana Pearson (CP), a director at MBO.……………………………………………………………..Luxury (up 15 per cent)CP: It is just safer at present for consumers to buy expensive products that are actually a long-term investment, as opposed to just buying lots of mid-priced items. The category is being driven by fast-growing economies as well, which has helped a lot. PW: Strong brand contribution and momentum across the sectorBrand snippetsHermèsPW: Hermès had an absolute stunning year, helped by an unsolicited takeover request from LVMH, which pushed up its share price massively. So it’s actually gone up most places, 39, and it is the second-biggest riser (in entire Top 100) in percentage terms. The brand has gained financially, certainly, but actually fundamentally, too.RolexPW: Rolex keeps having a record year every year in terms of sales.CP: It’s very highly in Luxury but I think also in its niche, which is obviously watches, it really is considered a status symbol.PradaCP: Prada skyrocketed because they’ve gone public. This means we now have a much more accurate way of identifying them.BurberryPW: Burberry is a good example of a company taking more control of its brand. It is a very interesting story as they continue to innovate very clearly online with their fashion shows and with enabling people to buy the brand, almost to democratise that brand more to a wider and newer audience. But increasingly they are taking huge care about how they come across, the way in which their online presence is felt and seen, changing it rapidly. They do a huge amount of work to make sure that that happens consistently and, at the same time, right the way across the world.Fast Food (up 15 per cent)CP: It’s that value proposition with healthier food and many options, which we saw back in the last recession.Brand snippetsMcDonald’sNC: Even though brands that are “bad for you” come up as not trusted highly by consumers, I suppose we shouldn’t say McDonald’s is bad for you because they’ve changed quite a lot, but you’ve got McDonald’s and Marlboro, which traditionally would be seen as bad for you, and they’re still not only in the overall top 10, they’re also rising. And consumers will make their own decisions about that.StarbucksPW: The Starbucks brand made a big recovery last year. They “freed the mermaid” from inside the logo, and have also been making a real thing about sustainable sourcing, which again is a point of differentiation. So it’s a brand that slightly wears its heart on its sleeve in a way that’s seen to be very positive from the consumer’s point of view. So this is a brand which has really gone back to recovering confidence in itself. And the other thing, of course, it physically has shut down unprofitable outlets and opened new ones in more profitable places, so it has the actual business basics right at the same time as the brand, so it’s really a very good story, with a bright future.CP: Starbucks also really started investing in staff training again and making sure that the customer experience is what it used to be because they went off of that for a while.Tim HortonCP: Tim Horton is another brand taking more control, they have got back some of their operations and have been focusing on their brands.Domino's PizzaMuch smaller brand, has seen brand value grow following refreshing candour about quality of products, which it has worked hard to improve following consumer surveys.Burger KingNot included in the ranking as the company has gone private and financial data are not available.Apparel (up 13 per cent)CP: Here you have two trends. First, the “fast-fashion” brands, like Zara, doing very well, and the second is taking control of your brands by moving away from the licensing model. We see Hugo Boss doing that. Calvin Klein has been doing the same, which is why it’s in the top 10 for the first time.Brand snippetsZaraCP: Zara doesn’t advertise. Instead they do is they have huge flagship shops, really nice shops, in the most expensive streets of the main cities.UniqloCP: Uniqlo has taken the same approach. In Japan it actually doesn’t have a very good brand image but outside it does, and the company hopes to have most of its revenues from outside Japan in the next four years. It has expanded hugely in China [which is] going to become the biggest Asian market very soon, and there’s some caché in China for Japanese brands.Ralph LaurenRalph Lauren had one of the biggest rises in brand value in the entire ranking, fuelled by growth in Asia.Oil & Gas (up 8 per cent)CP: Just the amount of oil discoveries and the booming demand for commodities around the world has led to huge margins. Most of them are growing except for Petrobras, which is due to the fall in the Brazilian stock market, and BP, still coming back from all its woes of a few years ago.PW: And ExxonMobil and Shell are benefiting from that. In one way, the brand differentiation between the brands is remarkably low. If you look at the personality of those three brands and BP, they’re so similar. PetroChina and Sinopec are twins, you just can’t tell the difference between them. And Petrobras is very similar to that as well, and that’s reflected in the brand contribution. So there’s an opportunity here to improve and increase the distinctness via their brands. And, arguably, as it’s getting harder to gain and retain the confidence of governments and administrators, brand is really one of the elements that could differentiate even more and therefore give a company a financial edge. But they’re still valuable corporations because they’re just so massive.Technology (up 2 per cent)This sector is covered in Ups and Downs: Facebook shines as Nokia fades awaySoft drinks (up 1 per cent)CP: The winners here are Gatorade and Red Bull, so it’s the non-carbonated soft drinks. If you look at Pepsi, for example, and a lot of these big companies, they’re trying to move at least 30 to 50 per cent of their food and beverages to healthier options, like juices, energy drinks and sport drinks especially. So the category as a whole has managed a slight increase. However, the overall market for carbonated soft drinks went down about 1 per cent in 2011.Brand snippetsGatoradePW: Gatorade’s rise in brand value is being driven by global expansion and increased availability of the brand generally, and what’s interesting is it also produces relevant flavours locally. So it’s a good example of a global brand acting locally. It’s also gone through an exercise of clarifying its portfolio, as it were, between pre-exercise drinks, during exercise drinks and post-exercise drinks, so you as a user have lots of reasons and excuses to swig your Gatorade. But also what’s been very good is the low-calorie option, so that’s tied in with health issues along with the exercise. On top of that, it is classified as what we call a rebel brand, it’s got a very distinct personality, and that’s helped it again stand out in that market.Red BullPW: Red Bull also is a bit of a rebel-type brand, but in slightly different ways. The brand is much more adventurous and rebellious, whereas Gatorade is more cheeky and fun.Financial Institutions (flat)This category is covered in Battered banks slide down the rankingsBeer (down 1 per cent)Brand snippetsBud Light and BudweiserCP: The fight between Bud Light and Budweiser continues, they keep switching places all the time, but with the US being their biggest market, there is a focus on lower calories and fighting obesity. This is the main reason Bud Light is doing better than Budweiser.BrahmaPW: Brahma is very interesting because consumers love it, it’s got a really trusted and approachable personality. It’s quite famous for its advertising in Latin America. And it’s also rated as incredibly good value by consumers. So as a result it’s the fifth highest in brand contribution. It’s a brand with a really attractive personality and it is a party-fun brand – attractive personalities are fun and stand out and you want to be with them at parties.There is more on beer brands in Bud changes image to take world stagePersonal Care (down 5 per cent)PW: Overall it’s down a little bit but there are some quite nice strong, quite old brands here, such as Colgate.Brand snippetsCliniqueClinique, the strongest performer in the category, is doing well in Asia.NaturaCP: Natura is a victim of the Brazilian stockmarket correction and currency depreciation, but the brand’s still very, very strong.AvonAvon’s share price was down 40 per cent, there were corporate governance issues, also very dependent on Latin America, so currency factors have played a part in its sharp fall in brand value. Subject of hostile bid from Coty, a big US perfume brand.Retail (down 5 per cent)CP: Retail is struggling a little bit, not surprisingly, against online competitors mainly, but there’s also this question about the balance between online and bricks and mortar.PW: And you just see the more established, bigger retailer with big infrastructures generally suffering across all those channels.NC: Margins are looking shaky, and also there’s an ongoing question about the prospects for consumer spending, both in developed and fast-growing markets. In developed markets there’s a bit of a lid on consumer spending, and even in emerging markets the picture is not clear.CP: There’s also the demographic story here in that so many more people, young people, are living alone nowadays and they just do more local, more frequent shopping, and it’s not the whole family concept where they drive out to these massive hypermarkets.PW: So when we look at the Retail sector, you’ll see the big grocers really are suffering, such as Tesco, Carrefour and Auchan. Walmart, although it’s below the category averages, hasn’t done quite as badly as some of the others. But we shouldn’t underestimate the toughness of the market.Brand snippetsCarrefourNC: Carrefour has had particular problems of its own – it has suffered from its over-reliance on hypermarkets in France, Spain, Italy and Belgium as its customers have increasingly turned to online sites for their non-food shopping – but there’s also this big, big retail fall out.CP: The demographic change has been affecting it. Additionally, their cheapest food prices are about 8.8 to 9 per cent more expensive than those of competitors, so they’re not even offering the best value.Ikea, Home DepotCP: Home improvement brands are going up as housing markets recover.Cars (down 7 per cent)CP: Another mixed bag. Some of the brands are doing quite well, others are still recovering from their recent past woes in the car industry.PW: What we’re indicating here is a story of value driven at two ends. At the lower price end, Hyundai has done very, very well this year, along with some of its competitors, which don’t make the rankings. This is partly because they’ve made their brands much more respectable and resilient, underpinned by actual and good perceptions of their engineering, again with the aid of technology. And then, of course, you’ve got brands like Audi, which are doing particularly well at the more luxury end. BMW, Mercedes-Benz, again are doing remarkably well because they are also seen as fantastic investment, fantastic value. And that’s reflected in quality brands as well, like VW. Meanwhile, Japanese brands have suffered as a result of the huge disruption caused by the earthquake and tsunami in March.Communication Providers (down 7 per cent)CP: This category is down for the first time in a while. Most of the brands are from fast-growing markets. Movistar suffered not only because of its presence in fast-growing markets, but also from its exposure to Spain.Brand snippetsVerizonCP: The only brand that really stands out is Verizon, which had a stellar year. Vodafone has a stake in them, and this was the first year that Verizon paid out a massive dividend to them, which just attests to the fact that it had a very, very good year. They are still benefitting from being the first ones on the market with the iPhone in the US.OrangeNC: O2 came out with the iPhone first. They had market leadership in the UK and have been very successful. Part of the reason for the decline in brand value is that it’s been a difficult year or so for a lot of mobile phone and phone companies because, in some ways, it’s not where the action is at the moment and they’re struggling to find a new raison d'être.MovistarCP: It’s a very good brand, but it’s going through a period of transitioning as a result of the rebranding of everything from Telefónica. It’s very difficult to rebrand your [fixed line] business when it’s associated with a monopoly, and give it the same name as an innovative mobile brand. It might cause a bit of confusion in the market for a little while.Insurance (down 16 per cent)PW: This is financial, it’s been the most horrific year for disasters, which has affected the companies’ financial performance. Brand actually plays a relatively lower part in Insurance, but could play a stronger part, and arguably should do, in order to keep that consumer and business dollar flowing into particular brands. Increasingly, it’s getting easier for consumers to switch and to buy on price.NC: Yes, without doubt the role of brand is increasing in that sector and I think the companies themselves recognise that brand is increasingly important. But it’s just been a ghastly year, and a costly one for the sector.Brand snippetsAllianzPW: Brands like Allianz are beginning to strengthen their brand hugely, beginning to take control more of their brand and align their brand and their images, but it’s a very, very slow process.Ping AnPW: Ping An has got quite a unique personality in China and is an entrepreneurial leader, along with quite distinctive advertising. So relatively it’s doing pretty well.GeicoPW: Geico is slightly down in brand value, so has performed relatively well for the sector. It is really focused on the car and property markets in the resurgent US market, and the brand has a character that it uses in its advertising, very consumer friendly.
301;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-05-22T00:04:57Z;Olympics: Sponsorship keeps rivals out;Overt marketing and ‘splash’ advertising give way to more subtle promotions;"Olympism is a philosophy of life based on the joy of effort, good examples, social responsibility and ethical principles. It is an attractive idea that big brands are keen to be identified with.“Olympic sponsor brands start with a huge advantage,” says Peter Walshe, Global BrandZ director at Millward Brown. “Sponsorship acts both as a flag waver for the brand in some very important areas, as well as a defence against some key competitors.”Five top 100 brands, Coca-Cola, GE, McDonald’s, Panasonic, Samsung and Visa, are members of the International Olympic Committee’s The Olympic Partner (TOP) programme. Meanwhile the London 2012 Olympic Partners include Top 100 Adidas, BMW and BP, and Cisco is an official supporter.BrandZ compared the TOP sponsors with their closest competitors. These were Coca Cola with Pepsi, GE with Siemens, McDonald’s with KFC, Samsung with Sony and Visa with MasterCard. They scored 118 on leadership, against 105 for their competitors, 113 on brand desire (104) and 108 for corporate reputation (101).“They are powerful brands that are leaders in their field,” says Mr Walshe, “There is no evidence that they are stronger and more powerful simply because of the Olympics. The bigger, more successful brands tend to be the sponsors.”It is no coincidence sports sponsorship is dominated by large global brands as multinational companies need to extend the reach of their products.“Global sporting and other events are ideal platforms for businesses to move from national to global brand identities and become familiar around the world,” says Terry Tyrrell, worldwide chairman for The Brand Union, a global branding agency within the WPP Group. “These platforms are good value when you compare them with standalone global corporate advertising campaigns. If a big organisation is not building its reputation on a global basis, it will be ‘gobbled up’ by 2030.”However, he warns clients to be wary of associating themselves with sports tarnished by bribery, corruption, match-fixing and bad behaviour. This is why aligning with the Olympic philosophy is a great opportunity.The BrandZ research shows that discontinuing TOP sponsorship would give competitors an opportunity to replace them. “There can be almost as much value in stopping someone else doing it as in you doing it yourself,” says Mr Walshe.He adds: “Being in possession of a great property, and the leadership stance that confers on you, gives you powerful support.”While Beijing was an opportunity for brands to establish themselves in a growing market, London is a mature market and is a popular tourist destination.Heather Hancock, lead 2012 partner at Deloitte, a London 2012 Official Supporter, she believes Olympic sponsorship has reached a turning point.“Big, heavy overt marketing-style brand activity and ‘splash’ advertising is
giving way to more subtle values-led activity,” she says. She cites the example of BP, oil and gas and also sustainability and carbon offset partner, positioning itself to being a new generation energy company rather than just linked to fossil fuels.Steve Martin, chief executive of M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment, a communications agency, says sponsors are linking culture and the “look and feel” of London. “Creatively, London is a rich territory,” he says. “It is globally renowned with a unique personality that travels very well, and brands can attach themselves to that.”An example is Coca Cola’s “Anywhere in the World” 2012 song and its Beatbox interactive musical pavilion in the Olympic park. “We aim to bring teenagers closer to the Olympic Games, and to sport in general, by harnessing their passion for music and drawing inspiration from London’s musical heritage,” says the company.One problem for the TOP sponsors is that they have to commit several games ahead, without knowing which cities and national markets they will be supporting. Matt Rogan, managing director of Two Circles, a sports business consultancy, and a board director at the European Sponsorship Association, says “second world”’ nations are increasingly interested in hosting such events and the Olympic movement is aspiring to drive long-term societal benefit.This may be very worthy, but Mr Rogan can see a possible tension with sponsors who want to be in first world nations or at least in very fast-growing emerging markets.“We should not underestimate the reach and power of sport to engage with large audiences, both consumer and business,” adds Mr Walshe. “If you can link your brand positively, without interrupting the audience’s enjoyment, and actually be seen as helping to deliver it, then the credit that comes to you as a brand is absolutely enormous. You are getting to people with something that is highly enjoyable and engaging, rousing those emotions like few other things can do.”"
302;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-05-18T17:14:28Z;PepsiCo chief faces activist pressure;;Indra Nooyi’s “Power of One” strategy is under pressure again.After months of insisting that PepsiCo, the US drinks and snacks group, would move forward as a single business, questions about that approach resurfaced this week when Ralph Whitworth, an activist investor, bought a $600m stake in the company.Well known as a corporate agitator, Mr Whitworth is encouraging Ms Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, to break the company up.The emergence of an activist investor– even one with a relatively small 0.6 per cent of the company’s shares – comes at an difficult time for PepsiCo. Ms Nooyi has dismissed a growing chorus of questions about her succession plans and has been looking to move beyond the notion that she is the “nutrition CEO” who took her eye off the company’s core brands.Earlier this year PepsiCo announced an aggressive restructuring plan, more closely integrating the marketing of the drinks and snacks brands and investing more in advertising.But Mr Whitworth, the head of Relational Investors, is pushing PepsiCo to shed the struggling US beverage business and focus on selling snacks and drinks in other parts of the world.Since Kraft, the US food group, announced last year that it would split into a US grocery business and a global snacks company, analysts and investors have been wondering if PepsiCo should follow a similar path.“Like many investors, we have been dissatisfied with ‘power-of-one’ initiatives and believe PepsiCo is more valuable in its parts,” Caroline Levy, consumer analyst at CSLA, said.Although PepsiCo is looking for ways to improve margins in its North America beverage business, people familiar with the company’s thinking said that Relational’s recent accumulation of shares has not changed the strategy that PepsiCo laid out in February.Then Ms Nooyi unveiled a plan to revive underperforming brands and address concerns about the US beverage business, which has seen sales and market share of its flagship sparkling products flatten amid a resurgent Coca-Cola.“If the underperformance cannot be addressed operationally then we will seek structural solutions to improve return or reduce our exposure,” Ms Nooyi said at the time.The company acknowledges that if its new investments are not getting results within a year to 18 months, it will look to joint ventures, re-franchising of bottlers or even disposals.PepsiCo recently bought its bottlers to gain more control of its distribution system, but some analysts have suggested the capital investment has not been worth the trouble.Last month Anthony Bucalo, drinks analyst Banco Santander, said that Anheuser-Busch InBev might be a logical bidder for PepsiCo’s Americas Beverage business.Such a move, he said, would give the beer company more scale and access to Latin America while alleviating Ms Nooyi of the “structural hassle” that the US beverage business has become.While such alternatives remain on the table, Ms Nooyi has maintained that a full split – separating snacks and drinks – would be too costly and would weaken the influence that a unified PepsiCo has with big retailers.Even if activists circle, Ms Nooyi appears ready to stake her tenure on the benefits of scale, clinging to the idea that if customers will wash down their Doritos with a Pepsi, the profits will follow.
303;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-05-16T22:53:06Z;Activist investor aims to add zest to Pepsi;;In the world of activist investors there are gadflies, agitators, raiders and nudgers.The challenge for Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, is that she now faces Ralph Whitworth, the establishment face of shareholder activism.Relational Investors, run by Mr Whitworth, disclosed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it had acquired nearly 9m Pepsi shares.The stake represents about 0.6 per cent of the company, which has a market capitalisation of more than $100bn, but the move was enough to prompt a 2 per cent rise in the share price.The San Diego-based investor is understood to think that Pepsi, a share price underperformer, would benefit by shedding its domestic beverage arm.Under Ms Nooyi the company has built a world-class snack operation but shareholders have grown restless with attempts to focus on nutrition while fizzy drinks have seemed neglected, just as arch rival Coca-Cola has reorganised.So Pepsi watchers welcomed the arrival of an investor prepared to spend years working on what he calls his “projects”.“Ralph’s style is to do deep due diligence on a company’s operations and financials and then meet regularly with management to drive operational and sometimes structural improvement,” said Caroline Levy, Pepsi analyst for CLSA.Mr Whitworth founded Relational in 1996 with David Batchelder, a fellow acolyte of Texas oilman T Boone Pickens.He also comes with an institutional pedigree, having spent eight years as head of the United Shareholders Association, a Washington group that lobbied for shareholder rights.The $200m of cash with which Mr Whitworth and Mr Batchelder started Relational came from Calpers, the California public pension fund and the country’s largest.Since then they have undertaken about 100 different projects and secured some high-profile scalps. Most famous was that of Bob Nardelli in 2006, the controversial chief executive of Home Depot, then a struggling $80bn retailer.In December 2005 Relational disclosed a small stake in the company and announced ideas for big changes.By February Mr Nardelli was gone, an unwanted business was on the block and Mr Batchelder was on the board.But Mr Whitworth has also shown he has the patience for a long fight. He became chairman of Waste Management in 1999 as the company recovered from an accounting crisis and allegations of insider trading by executives, overseeing a turnround until he stepped down in 2004.He joined the board of Hewlett-Packard last year as the struggling computer maker tried to shore up investor support after strategic shifts, reversals and a revolving door on the chief executive’s office.There he helped put a stop to plans to spin out the PC business. His involvement with the company, says a person familiar with his thinking, is likely to be the work of several years.At PepsiCo he began engaging with the company in December. Executives at Pepsi might note the changes at industrial products maker ITT and L-3 Communications, both of which announced spin-offs last year following prodding from the patient but insistent Mr Whitworth.
304;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-05-16T15:14:56Z;Multinationals act to mitigate euro risk;;Multinationals have been sweeping euros out of their accounts daily to limit their risk in the event of an overnight devaluation of the currency.While most companies reckon the chances of a euro collapse are slim – and very few are prepared to go public on their covert treasury operations – chief financial officers say they are acting prudently to mitigate any risk.PepsiCo, the US beverages and snacks company, and Reckitt Benckiser, which makes household and personal care products, are among those clearing out euros on a more regular basis.Both report in non-euro currencies. While almost all multinationals have euro-denominated costs, such as salaries for example, these are usually dwarfed by income.Reporting first-quarter results last month, PepsiCo, said it was being cautious with how it manages risk overseas. Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s chief financial officer, said the company has a structure to convert foreign currencies into dollars as quickly as possible to mitigate risk.“We try to get the money into the lowest risk facilities in banks,” Mr Johnston said.Speaking to the Financial Times after this year’s strategic announcement in February, Reckitt Benckiser sounded a similar note. “We are sucking cash out more frequently, on a daily basis,” said Rakesh Kapoor, chief executive. “We were taking cash out frequently enough, but now that is increasing.”Diageo, the world’s biggest distiller by revenue, has said it is performing daily sweeps but insists it is business as normal – apart from tightening up on credit to third parties and counterparts in the affected markets.“As a company you sweep cash every night,” said Paul Walsh, chief executive, also speaking after results in February. “That’s what we do for efficiency.”Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company, is among those taking similar precautions, according to analysts.One US-based multinational company said it has removed its operating cash from banks in Greece, Italy, Spain and even France and has been reinvesting those funds in US Treasury securities.Another UK-based company said it has been sweeping out euros every day since last year, arguing it is only prudent to do so.
305;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Activist investor makes move on PepsiCo;;An activist investor has taken a $600m stake in PepsiCo in hopes that the US snacks and drinks company will seriously consider splitting off its struggling domestic beverage business.Relational Investors, which is run by Ralph Whitworth, disclosed in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it has acquired nearly 9m PepsiCo shares. The stake represents about 0.6 per cent of the company, which has a market capitalisation of more than $100bn.According to people familiar with Relational’s thinking, Mr Whitworth thinks that PepsiCo has underperformed in recent years and that the company should consider spinning off the US beverage business in the next year. Mr Whitworth is encouraged by the company’s recently announced efforts to revive the business but thinks that the strategy will take too long to generate results, these people said.In February, PepsiCo announced that it was cutting 8,700 jobs and investing up to $600m in its biggest brands in response to restlessness from investors that the company’s stock price has been stagnant. Much of the displeasure has been focused on the US beverage business, particularly carbonated soft drinks, as the company’s flagship brand has lost market share to Coca-Cola.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, has fended off suggestions from analysts that the company would be better off following in the footsteps of Kraft, which last year said it was splitting its US grocery business from its international snacks business. Ms Nooyi has said a split would be too costly for PepsiCo and that such a move would diminish the benefits of the scale it gets from its fast-growing snacks business.However, Ms Nooyi said in February that the company would have 18 to 24 months to determine if its new strategy was working and that other “structural” alternatives remain possible at that point.Relational manages about $6bn and has taken stakes and pushed for changes in companies such as Home Depot, Genzyme and ITT.Jeff Dahncke, a PepsiCo spokesman, said that the company had held meetings with Relational. “Our senior management meets regularly with investors, and Relational is a respected institution,” he said.Shares of PepsiCo rose 1 per cent to $67.85 on Tuesday.
306;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Drinks groups fight back over obesity;;The lobbying group that represents beverage companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo is hitting back at advertising campaigns linking its products to obesity with the launch of its own campaign arguing that the industry has been giving customers healthier options.The American Beverage Association is making a national advertising push on television, websites and public transport with its “Delivering Choices” campaign. The ads are intended to combat anti-obesity campaigns that states, cities and health advocates have been promoting and which link fizzy drinks to obesity.“The notion that there is a direct correlation between soda consumption and obesity doesn’t measure up to where the numbers are,” said Karen Hanretty, vice-president of public affairs at the ABA. “If consumption is down and obesity is up, it’s hard to find that intersection.”Ms Hanretty argues that sales of carbonated soft drinks are falling in the US, making the sparkling, sugary beverages an unfair target of critics. Drinks groups say that they have cut calories from their products and offer consumers smaller portions and clearer labels.The ABA campaign comes after several states and cities earlier this year produced ads with graphic imagery of obese people who had lost limbs as a result of diabetes next to two “supersized” cups of cola.According to beverage industry executives, cities are targeting their companies to help fill budget deficits. They contend that if people exercised more, they could drink more soda without worrying about excess calories making them fat.
307;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-05-07T13:18:52Z;Companies cut costs by shedding pounds;;Companies have found a new way to cut costs: by literally slimming down their workforces.In the past six months employers as diverse as the New York Stock Exchange and UK retailer John Lewis have signed up US-based Weight Watchers to help staff shed some pounds – leading to healthier workers and cheaper health insurance premiums.American Express, the financial services multinational, now has more than a fifth of its 27,000-strong US workforce enrolled on the Weight Watchers programme, whose points system encourages more moderate eating and rewards exercise.So great is fervour among American Express employees, who are being offered free Weight Watchers membership this year, that the New York headquarters hosts three meetings a week.“Absolutely there are savings on healthcare,” says Anita Shaughnessy, vice-president of US healthcare and wellness – herself 24lbs lighter than she was before she started the programme in January.“But these take longer to experience. Right away, though, we see benefits on productivity. There are fewer sick days because of fewer joint problems, back problems and other related problems.”At NYSE Euronext, Ed Hutner, senior vice-president of human resources, agrees. “Our people benefit – and so does our business,” he said when signing up in January.Obesity and its related diseases, including diabetes and heart disease, are causing problems – and bloated medical bills – for governments and companies across the globe.Obesity is also costing large employers in the form of rising healthcare premiums. “In the US over the past 10 years healthcare premiums for large employers have been increasing 8 per cent a year,” says David Kirchhoff, president and chief executive of Weight Watchers.“If you can find a way to hold the line by improving the wellness of the population then, over time, the savings are substantial.”US companies are leading the charge, but the UK and Germany are no slouches either. British health spa operator Champneys recently launched “corporate wellbeing packages” costing companies as much as £1,995 per employee.“I think it’s going to happen over time in Europe,” says Mr Kirchhoff. “It’s a more immediate opportunity in the US because large employers are self-insured and pay healthcare costs directly, as opposed to have an insurance company bear the risks.”PepsiCo has drawn fire from union groups in New York recently over a $50 monthly charge levied on workers who smoke or are overweight. Employees are exempt from paying the fee if they sign up to smoking cessation or weight loss programmes.
308;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-04-30T22:03:22Z;Pepsi calls for ceasefire in cola wars;;PepsiCo wants to bring an end to the cola wars. As it embarks on a strategic push to revive its fortunes, the US food and snacks company aims to be judged on its overall beverage portfolio, rather than only its battle against Coca-Cola.Indra Nooyi, chief executive, has asked analysts to address PepsiCo’s share of the “total liquid refreshment” market, rather focusing narrowly on its share of carbonated soft drinks, which has been declining along with the entire category.“Let’s build the brand very differently in this new world,” Ms Nooyi said in an interview. It was time to stop tweaking its rival Coke in advertisements and focus on elevating PepsiCo’s brands. “We’re in the process of doing that.”Criticism from investors about the company’s sluggish performance in recent years stung it into announcing a restructuring plan in February to cut costs and reinvest hundreds of millions of dollars in its core brands.On Monday it launched its first global advertising campaign for its flagship cola.The multi-platform “live for now” theme is intended to reinvigorate the flagging sparkling drink by reclaiming its place as an exciting brand at the centre of popular culture.PepsiCo is partnering with Twitter to sponsor concerts and teaming up with pop stars such as Nicki Minaj.“Our brand’s DNA is about being at the front of pop culture,” said Simon Lowden, chief marketing officer of beverages. “We’ll be talking about us and our brand as opposed to anyone else.”PepsiCo has also started integrating its snacks and beverage marketing strategy for the first time. It is using footballer Lionel Messi, who was recently featured promoting Pepsi Max in a 40-country advertising campaign for the Lays snacks unit.Last week, PepsiCo reported a decline in first-quarter profits. Most analysts said it was too soon to judge the company’s “reset”, but some of the changes appear to be taking shape.Its shares have fallen 4.3 per cent in the past year, against a slight rise in the S&P 500 index.Ali Dibadj, a Bernstein Research analyst who has been among the most critical of PepsiCo’s strategy, said: “We were pleased to see the company’s new strategy seemingly on course.”PepsiCo has not revealed how the extra $500m-$600m marketing investment will be divided among its 12 “megabrands”, but a disproportionate amount is expected to be directed at the cola and the US beverage business.“This is one of the world’s most iconic pop culture brands and the name on the door,” said Brad Jakeman, president of global enjoyment brands.It would take time to revive the soft drink, he added. “This is not a race – it’s not the big bang theory.”Wall Street, meanwhile, has been itching for faster results to boost PepsiCo’s share price, and some analysts wonder whether the snacks business, which has been a growth engine, could be facing competitive headwinds.“PepsiCo’s ‘grow core and add more’ strategy in snacks has not been as effective,” said Judy Hong, analyst at Goldman Sachs, in a recent note to clients. “We see risk that Frito-Lay North America’s momentum stalls if PepsiCo does not address this issue soon.”Other analysts continue to push for a break-up, in the footsteps of Kraft’s move to split its US grocery business from its global snacks unit last year.Anthony Bucalo at Banco Santander suggested last week that Anheuser-Busch InBev might be a bidder for PepsiCo’s Americas Beverage business, which includes its leading drinks brands, to increase its scale in the US and to achieve deeper soft-drink and beer integration in Latin America.“Divesting PepsiCo Americas Beverage would allow the company to focus on its dominant food and beverage businesses and alleviate the structural hassle of managing a North America beverage business which has required an extraordinary amount of money and management attention to fix,” Mr Bucalo said.“We believe PepsiCo’s frustrated investors might welcome the change.”Ms Nooyi has rejected that idea for now, maintaining that it will take up to two years for the latest strategy work. Also the costs of a separation would be too high.“Performing while we’re transforming has been a tremendous hallmark of the company,” Ms Nooyi said. “We have a diversified portfolio that works and I think that’s what we need to focus on.”
309;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-04-29T16:04:18Z;Management excuses;Pleadings could be an indication of bigger problems;The one thing service sector firms and manufacturers make equally well is an excuse. It must be taught at business school. Last week, as during every results season, excuses were produced in abundance. But which ones, if any, should investors forgive managers for? And which, on the other hand, are warnings that a company is facing bigger problems than executives care to admit?Consider the slowdown in Europe, one of the most popular excuses for poor results at present. On Friday, as examples, Ford announced that it had lost $149m in the region over the first quarter while Procter & Gamble blamed a “contracting” European market for lower hair care volumes. Also last week, Deutsche Bank and Barclays said a lack of confidence close to home was denting revenues. Which of these excuses is fair?To some extent the answer depends on how radical investors expect companies to be. The European car market has suffered chronic overcapacity for decades, masked by a credit boom. Should Ford have sold out years ago? Perhaps it still should. Meanwhile, did P&G invest enough in its European brands? PepsiCo’s results were perfectly fine in Europe during the first quarter thank you very much, in part due to a 5 percentage point increase in net prices.Nor should banks be allowed to moan much. To be sure, net interest margins are being hurt by ultra-loose monetary policy. But the same policy is keeping many of the banks’ retail and business clients afloat. What is more, with pay chewing up as much as 50 per cent of revenues, much of the prospect for banks’ return on equity is in their own hands.Rising input costs is the other common excuse these days. Surely companies cannot be blamed for the commodity cycle? Or China? But then you never hear managers admitting that strong demand from emerging countries was a bit of luck, do you? No – they planned for that.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
310;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-04-27T14:40:17Z;Letter from Lex: Pharmachines;Drugs and machines mix, but the results are far from disastrous;Drugs and machines do not usually mix well, but the results in the pharma and TMT sectors this week were far from disastrous. Apple continued to defy every known logic of gadgetry, even the price-killing effects of Moore’s Law. Asian companies are racing to catch up. LG Electronics turned in a solid first quarter performance after recording losses in 2011. China’s ZTE, the world’s fourth biggest mobile phone maker, announced ambitions to become number three by 2015. And chipmakers TSMC and Hynix moved in opposite directions with the former planning record investment this year. In the telecoms sector, meanwhile, Vodafone made a low-ball offer to put C&W Worldwide out of its misery. In India, regulators proposed a nonsensical plan to auction reclaimed 2G spectrum. And in the US, wireless carriers struggled to squeeze a profit out of the ultra-competitive market.The pharma sector yielded two relatively large deals. Nestlé paid a hefty $12bn for Pfizer’s infant nutrition business to gain emerging market share, and Watson agreed a €4.5bn takeover of Actavis to create one of the world’s largest generic drugs group. AstraZeneca is not faring so well, however. The chief executive of the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker was forced to step down early amid investor unhappiness at its declining growth prospects.Elsewhere Walmart saw $12bn wiped off its market value after allegations that it paid $24m in bribes for Mexican building permits. Meanwhile other US household names such as Pepsi, Kellogg, Colgate-Palmolive and ExxonMobil are benefiting from their powerful brands, global diversification and commitment to dividends.In the financial services sector, Italy introduced a law forbidding bank and insurance company directors from also holding board seats at rival companies as the government attempted to unravel the web of cross-shareholdings that have bogged down the system. Other European banks recorded mixed first-quarter results with Barclays’ and Deutsche Bank’s investment banking units doing better than their rivals at Credit Suisse. But as they are squeezed ever-tighter by new EU rules, some bankers could be driven to mix drugs and machines in a very unhealthy fashion.John Casey, Lex Publisher
311;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;PepsiCo muted by higher food costs;;PepsiCo executives on Thursday asked investors to show patience as they wait for its recently announced restructuring programme to take effect.“We really watching for the steady improvement in the business as the year goes on and make sure we do it the right way,” Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, told analysts. ”Not try to jerk the business around by pushing for volume in one quarter.”The comments came as PepsiCo, the US drinks and snacks company, reported a dip in first-quarter earnings, as rising sales were blunted by increased commodity costs and restructuring charges.Net income at PepsiCo slipped 1 per cent year-on-year to $1.1bn, or 71 cents a share, while net revenues were up 4 per cent year-on-year to $12.4bn. The results exceeded estimates by Wall Street analysts, but PepsiCo’s shares closed 0.45 per cent lower at $66.37.Ms Nooyi said pricing and packaging initiatives helped offset $300m in commodity cost inflation.The results were the first since PepsiCo unveiled a strategic “reset” in February, intended to cut costs and direct more marketing muscle to revive the US beverage business and other core brands. The company said that it had increased media spending in the US by 25 per cent year-on-year.The impact of the changes was not yet clear in the first three months of the year. PepsiCo posted increased sales volume in Europe and Asia and its US snacks business, but said that volume and operating profits declined in the US beverage business and carbonated soft drinks volume fell 2 percentage points.“While we don’t think that most sceptics will be convinced yet, numbers are slightly better than expected on both the top and bottom lines,” said John Faucher, beverage analyst at JPMorgan.The carbonated soft drinks category has been declining in recent years and PepsiCo has been trying to balance how to sustain its core cola brands while investing in faster-growing products.Ms Nooyi made the case that the company should be judged on its total “liquid refreshment beverage” portfolio, rather than looking narrowly at how its colas are performing. However, she expressed optimism that the new reduced-calorie Pepsi Next is already luring people back to colas.In spite of the focus on PepsiCo’s US business, the company had a strong quarter in Europe, Asia and Latin America, where food revenues were up 11 per cent.However, the company is being cautious with how it manages risk overseas. Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s chief financial officer, said that the company has a structure set up to convert foreign currencies into dollars as quickly as possible to mitigate risk.“We try to get the money into the lowest risk facilities in banks,” Mr Johnston said.
312;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-04-26T19:25:30Z;US earnings;PepsiCo, ExxonMobil, Dow Chemical, Colgate-Palmolive and Kellogg are more than just household names;They no longer grab the headlines like the Apples and Facebooks and Googles do. But there is something reassuring about the grand old companies of Wall Street cranking out results quarter after quarter. On Thursday, PepsiCo, ExxonMobil, Dow Chemical, Colgate-Palmolive and Kellogg all reported. A mixed bag to be sure. But they share more than just being household names.One thing that binds these companies together – as well as distinguishing them from the latest upstarts – is an obvious commitment to dividends. Exxon upped its distribution by 7 per cent against 2011 and Dow said it would lift its dividend 28 per cent in the second quarter. Even struggling Kellogg gave shareholders 3 cents more than last year. Colgate’s payout ratio is 10 percentage points higher than it was a decade ago. Theory says dividends do not matter. But the total return of each stock has either matched or trounced the S&P 500 index over the past 10 years.The second trait at least three of them display this quarter is an ability to leverage strong brands to raise prices. PepsiCo, Colgate and Kellogg are all suffering from rising input costs. But 3.5 per cent higher prices at Colgate, for example, helped organic sales growth jump by the most in seven quarters. PepsiCo managed to push through an even bigger increase in prices. Brands are sometimes intangible mysteries. These companies, however, show how powerful they can be.A final similarity is also worth pondering. All five companies are global and diversified. This seems like a good thing when Latin America compensates weakness in Europe, say, or when low gas prices make up for higher oil prices. But in general there has not been a concomitant increase in margins or return on equity compared with 20 years ago. Quite the opposite in many cases. It is hard being old too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
313;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-04-13T22:35:56Z;Companies leave legislative lobby group;;"Some of the biggest US food and beverage companies, including Coca-Cola, Kraft and McDonald's, have withdrawn from the American Legislative Exchange Council in protest over the conservative group's promotion of controversial laws.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also announced that it would stop funding of the group, although it will continue with its current $350,000 grant for an education project. ""We have decided that we will not make another grant to (Alec)"" said Chris Williams of the Gates Foundation in a blog post on the organisation's website.The companies are seeking to protect their reputations after Alec, a group that brings together state legislators and corporate representatives to discuss policy matters and draft model bills, supported polemic legislation such as Florida's ""Stand your ground law"" that allows people who feel threatened to shoot rather than retreat.The law is at the centre of the Trayvon Martin case in which a neighbourhood watch volunteer shot dead an unarmed teenager but was not arrested or charged until after an extended public outcry.Alec has also drafted and introduced other controversial bills such as voter identification requirements and the 2010 law in Arizona that set a crackdown on suspected illegal immigrants.Other companies announcing their withdrawals from Alec this week include Mars, PepsiCo and Wendy’s, along with Intuit, the financial and tax software company, and Arizona Public Service, the state's largest electric utility.Coca-Cola said that its membership in Alec “was focused on efforts to oppose discriminatory food and beverage taxes, not on issues that have no direct bearing on our business”. Other departing members issued similar statements.The shooting incident is causing companies to more closely examine the costs and benefits of their affiliations with organisations that take positions deemed to be controversial by consumer segments.The risk of reputational damage is high for publicly exposed companies in sectors such as fast-food and consumer goods, as these companies can make easy targets for consumer group-driven boycott campaigns via the viral world of social media.“Damage control is much more difficult than it used to be,” said Jerome Williams, an expert on consumer marketing at Rutgers University. “Once something hits social media and the genie is out of the bottle, it takes on a life of its own.”A heightened risk exists for food and beverage companies that have invested heavily in expanding their market share among ethnic minorities.Companies should be very concerned about alienating and causing a backlash among the consumers that they have worked hard to acquire, Mr Williams said.“Companies must realise the fact that identifying with a controversial group such as Alec could jeopardise their footholds with minority communities,” he said. “They must realise that they can be held guilty by association and must be more proactive and discerning about who they affiliate themselves with.”Alec’s mission is to “advance Jeffersonian principles” such as free market policies that promote innovation and job growth, and many of the departing companies originally joined the organisation because of its positions on taxation and economic matters.But divergences have arisen as Alec backed legislation strayed from the economic realm into more controversial social issues, debates that companies typically abstain from publicly.Kaitlyn Buss, an Alec spokeswoman, said that an “army of extreme leftwing special interest activists up in arms” had tried to paint the group as a front group for the conservative Koch brothers. The billionaire industrialists have funded several conservative organisations to advance their ideas, notably Americans for Prosperity, a group behind the conservative Tea Party movement.Alec’s “principles of free-market enterprise and limited government have never been more important than they are today”, Ms Buss said."
314;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-04-09T19:43:50Z;A bit of selfishness is all to the social good;Nobody should be surprised – or particularly worried – if alliances are founded on self-interest;The caricature of global capitalism puts sandalled do-gooders and corporate suits at opposite ends of the spectrum. Historically, the corporate social responsibility department was walled off from the boardroom, except when the CSR manager came to ask which cause the chairman deigned to support this year, or the chief executive was coaxed out to a community awards ceremony for some awkward back-slapping with his favourite charity-workers.This is changing, thank goodness, as relationships evolve between companies and enterprises structured along business lines that put social benefit above profit.According to Pamela Hartigan, director of the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, not one corporate representative attended the first Skoll World Forum, nine years ago. At the recent 2012 event, not only were there dozens of companies on the delegate list, many had executives up on the podium, explaining the advantages and challenges of working together with social enterprises.Some mutual suspicion persists. The likes of PepsiCo, Unilever and Novartis were perhaps too polite to voice during the conference any qualms about working closely with not-for-profit organisations. But other delegates had no such compunction about describing the concerns that still run in the other direction. “A lot of what Rio Tinto does to West Australia is criminal,” said lecturer Bronwyn Lewis, who works with the mining company on a child literacy campaign, “but there’s a few people in Rio Tinto who actually make a difference, and some of them are quite high up.”These days many social enterprises are not just supping with the devil, they are shopping for the ingredients and cooking the meal together.I agree with Ms Hartigan that this represents progress. Social entrepreneurs can benefit from alliances with big business – and vice versa. In fact, what I find bracing about ventures between established companies and social enterprises is that their partners are less starry-eyed than the parties to many ill-fated corporate alliances. As I have written before, the success and durability of corporate partnerships often stand in inverse proportion to the rosiness of their initial publicity: see, for example, Suzuki’s unilateral termination of its partnership with Volkswagen, or BP’s unconsummated alliance last year with Rosneft.Behind the aura of social purpose, the word most frequently used by Skoll delegates to describe the nature of their relationship with big corporate partners was “pragmatic”. It starts with the right choice of partner, according to Rupert Howes, chief executive of the Marine Stewardship Council. It has linked with McDonald’s to promote sustainable sourcing of ingredients for the fast food chain’s ubiquitous “Filets-O-Fish”. Social enterprises have got to “cut the herd” of potential corporate allies, he told the forum, “and work with the leaders that will draw the others up”.Gene Falk of mothers2mothers, which has partnered with Hewlett-Packard to digitise and analyse data from its HIV/AIDS education programme in Africa, was blunter still. Not-for-profit organisations have to “think what the corporate partner needs out of this [alliance] and go into it with eyes open”, he said.Nobody should be surprised – or particularly worried – if alliances are founded on self-interest. Keith Kenny of McDonald’s Europe sounded almost sheepish to admit that some of the motives for the company’s MSC partnership were “perhaps a little bit selfish”. By ensuring sustainability of sourcing from its fisheries, McDonald’s also ensures the stability and longevity of the suppliers themselves. Well, good for them – and good for the MSC.Frankly, if more companies acknowledged the selfish reasons for getting together with business partners, their alliances would probably last longer. Likewise, the virtues of a good social partnership – transparency, communication, trust, patience – are precisely the qualities any joint venture should have, whether its objective is drilling in the Arctic or mentoring HIV-positive mothers in Africa.There is a need to educate more companies about how to work in a self-reinforcing partnership with social enterprises. But the lessons big businesses can learn about how to run their hard-nosed profit-making alliances with other corporate partners are just as valuable.andrew.hill@ft.comAndrew Hill blogs at www.ft.com/businessblog
315;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;SodaStream seeks cosmetics partner;;SodaStream is exploring a tie-up with a cosmetics partner to take its soda siphons, which graced many a Mad Men-style cocktail party in the 1960s, into Japanese bathrooms.The move into skincare comes as Nasdaq-listed SodaStream, whose past owners have included Cadbury Schweppes, seeks to carve out a bigger share of the $260bn at-home fizzy drink market now dominated by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo of the US.Using a business model similar to that of Nespresso, the coffee capsule system made by Nestlé of Switzerland, SodaStream makes repeat sales of carbon-dioxide cartridges and flavourings.SodaStream discovered a predilection among Japanese women to wash their faces in sparkling water while it was ramping up its overseas drive.“It’s a classic story of stumbling over a consumer insight unintentionally,” said Daniel Birnbaum, chief executive. “That could bring life to a different product line that could be sold through cosmetic chains.”Mr Birnbaum joined the company in 2006 when it was acquired by Fortissimo, an Israeli private equity firm, which paid a total of $14m.At the time SodaStream was on the brink of bankruptcy and making annual sales of $100m. It listed on Nasdaq at the end of 2010 and now boasts a market capitalisation of about $610m and is targeting a 28 per cent lift in sales year on year from $289m in 2011.“We want to take share from Coca-Cola,” said Mr Birnbaum. He added that the system is more environmentally friendly than buying cans or bottles, and is now taking it into some of the US beverage giant’s biggest per-capita markets, including Mexico.Analysts reckon this may prove overly ambitious. “They might be able to establish a niche business, but I don’t see them taking a lot of purchases from the grocery store,” said Richard Haffner, head of global beverages research at Euromonitor, the data consultancy.He said it could carve a niche business on the back of its greater range of flavours, functional additives and flexibility in tailoring the amount of carbonation.Like its bigger rival PepsiCo, SodaStream is also pushing its healthier credentials. Flavours with no calories or sweeteners are available, as are ingredients such as ginseng and antioxidants.The message is not winning everyone over, however. Mr Birnbaum says the company is fighting for “share of kitchen counter space”, an area being battled over by Nespresso and a host of kitchen gadgets.Mr Haffner noted that Nespresso was able to capitalise on existing habits, as there had been expensive espresso makers used in homes before. “I don’t see SodaStream going mainstream in the same way as Nespresso and its competitors have,” he said.While its latest fourth-quarter numbers trumped expectations, with revenues up 32 per cent year on year to €66.1m, sales of soda maker units disappointed by growing a more muted 7.7 per cent to 767,000, prompting shares to plunge on the day of the announcement.Investors have had a rollercoaster ride, with the shares doubling and halving in a matter of months. Mr Birnbaum attributes this to high levels of day trading and relatively high levels of retail investor and hedge fund activity. “Simply put, the market is ‘gambling’ on SodaStream,” he said.
316;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-03-23T19:50:10Z;Orange juice prices fall on sunnier outlook;;Orange juice prices fell to a three-month low as speculative investors unravelled their positions and bullish factors which had pushed prices higher earlier in the year faded.Frozen orange juice prices on ICE Futures US exchange hit an all-time high of $2.2695 a pound in January on supply worries caused by concern over a possible US ban on Brazilian imports after the discovery of fungicide traces. Concerns about a fall in supplies were exacerbated after a damaging citrus disease was found in Texas, the third-largest US orange producer after Florida and California.However, analysts said worries about a fall in supply had faded amid favourable weather in the US citrus growing regions, while supplies from Brazil seemed to be reaching the American markets.Judy Ganes-Chase, a soft commodities consultant, said investors, who had held bullish positions amid the sharp price increase at the start of the year, were liquidating their holdings. “Speculators don’t have any reason to be long at the moment,” she said.The price spike following the fungicide tests from Brazilian imports had put orange juice trading, a niche area in commodities trading, under the spotlight. Large beverage makers such as PepsiCo, which owns the Tropicana brand, and Coca-Cola, owner of Minute Maid, watch the prices closely but notional turnover in the market has dwindled to about $75m a day as US consumption of orange juice has fallen over the past decade.While the US food authorities continued to test orange juice imports for the fungicide carbendazim, Ms Ganes-Chase said Brazil was shifting its shipments to not-from-concentrate juice from frozen concentrated orange juice, so diluting the levels of any fungicide.Brazilian orange juice accounts for about half of America’s imports. The Latin American country provides nearly 12 per cent of US consumption.On the weather, Florida Citrus Mutual, the state’s leading growers’ association, said conditions were favourable, albeit a little dry. “We could use a little bit more water,” said Andrew Meadows of the organisation. With worries about frost now behind the growers, analysts said there were very few weather concerns until the hurricane season later this year.On Friday, benchmark May frozen concentrated orange juice was at $1.6750 a pound in early afternoon New York trading, down 10 per cent on the week and 26 per cent from the record high in January.While the US Agriculture Department’s monthly supply and demand report released earlier in March showed that crop forecasts were almost unchanged, Brazilian inventory data showed a sharp rise in stocks. Conab, the state agricultural forecaster, said total inventories at the end of the current crop, on June 30, would be about 535,000 tonnes, up from 214,000 a year earlier.
317;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-03-20T21:26:34Z;US soft drink consumption at 16-year low;Coca-Cola and PepsiCo face dilemma;Carbonated soft drink consumption in the US last year fell to its lowest level since 1996, the latest industry figures showed on Tuesday, highlighting the predicament Coca-Cola and PepsiCo face as they invest in their flagship cola brands.According to data from Beverage Digest, total carbonated soft drink volumes fell by 1 per cent year-on-year in 2011 to 9.2bn cases, declining twice as fast as they did in 2010.Volumes have declined every year since 2005, as consumers shift increasingly to bottled water, juices and teas. Carbonated soft drink volumes grew by about 3 per cent per year through the 1990s, before slowing at the turn of the century and slipping six years ago.The figures show Coke holding its place as the cola leader, followed by Diet Coke and Pepsi, which continued to lose market share and volume. Pepsi relinquished its second place status in 2010, when it fell behind Diet Coke for the first time, and failed to make up ground last year.Carbonated soft drinks have struggled due to growing health fears over obesity and diabetes in the US. States and cities have been pushing for carbonated soft drink taxes and imposing rules to eliminate soft drinks from schools.Meanwhile, public health groups have been promoting scientific research linking Coke and Pepsi to cancer. Although the companies deny any such risks associated with their products, the threat of warning labels caused them to make changes to their ingredients.In spite of the negative publicity, soft drinks companies increased prices by about 3 per cent last year as they sought to cover high commodity costs.“Higher prices almost certainly contribute to 2011’s deceleration as lower-income consumers continued to struggle,” according to Beverage Marketing Corp, a research group.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are clinging to their core cola brands, and both announced plans last month to cut costs and reinvest in marketing and advertising. PepsiCo is battling the perception that it neglected its namesake brand and is looking to link up the marketing of its fast-growing snacks products and its slower growing US beverages.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, said at an industry conference last month that the company was looking beyond carbonated soft drinks (CSD) to the broader liquid refreshment beverage (LRB) category.“If you go back to the early 90s, PepsiCo articulated an exclusive strategy to be a total beverage company,” she said.” CSDs were always a smaller portion of our total portfolio than our key competitors, so our game has been to play the total LRB space and that’s what we’re going to keep doing.”Shares of PepsiCo rose 0.85 per cent to $65.28 on Tuesday. Coca-Cola shares closed up 0.27 per cent to $70.59.
318;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-03-18T20:06:17Z;Wall St braced for hit to soaring markets;;US corporations’ quarterly earnings are set to register their first decline in more than two years, in what will be a challenge to the stock market’s stellar start to 2012.The S&P 500 last week rose above 1,400– a level not seen since June 2008. It has gained more than 11 per cent this year.That run has coincided with solid earnings reports for the last quarter of 2011. But rising commodity prices, notably oil, are compressing profit margins for many companies, including Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo and Carnival Corporation.In turn, Wall Street analysts are turning increasingly bearish, with analysts forecasting S&P 500 first-quarter earnings will come in 0.5 per cent lower than the first quarter of 2011, the first fall since the third quarter of 2009.That sets the stage for a volatile period for stocks when the earnings season begins next month. “A messy earnings season is likely to grab investor attention and could weigh on stocks,” said Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.Expectations for earnings have been steadily scaled back this year, as the mood among companies has worsened. Profit warnings have outpaced positive guidance by three to one, while more companies than usual have offered no guidance at all.PepsiCo forecast a “high single-digits decline” in first-quarter earnings on a recent conference call with analysts, blaming commodity price inflation. Cruise ship operator Carnival said its fuel bill for the quarter would be $137m higher than in the same period last year.Companies have also warned about a slowdown in emerging market growth, and the impact of a strong dollar on margins.Analysts tracked by data research company FactSet are expecting S&P 500 companies to report $225.8bn in first-quarter earnings, down $1bn.Revenue is expected to grow 3.5 per cent but margins to fall for the first time in two years.The bearish turn comes just as analysts globally turn positive on corporate prospects: the first week of March saw earnings upgrades outpace downgrades for the first time in almost a year, according to Citigroup.Investors are divided as to how a poor earnings season would affect US stocks.“The current rally is all about confidence and the retreat of headline eurozone risk,” said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at Wells Capital.“The market still hasn’t priced in record-breaking earnings from last year, so a blip in growth should not matter.But Mr Knapp said: “If earnings do disappoint, investors are unlikely to take comfort in past performance.”
319;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-03-16T17:26:11Z;UK food brand owners offload old favourites;;"A bumper spread of British foods is on the block, heralding a shake-up in the ownership of some of the country’s oldest brands.Indebted Premier Foods is selling Sarson’s Vinegar, which douses nine out of every 10 portions of the country’s chips, and Hartley’s Jams, which traces its roots back to 1871.Also on the block are two private equity-owned businesses – United Biscuits’ Twiglets, which predate suburban 1970s cocktail parties by half a century, and R&R Ice Cream’s Fab lollies, now owned by Oaktree. The lollies are as old – and, to some, as loved – as Gerry Anderson’s 1960s Thunderbirds puppets on which they were based.Nostalgic middle-aged Brits are not the only fans of such venerable brands. Investors see the attractions spreading as far afield as Dubai and Saigon. “1871 might sound dusty and old-fashioned, but they see authenticity and history,” says Andrew Harrison, director at The Brand Cellar.That, the sellers hope, applies to many of the names now up for sale. Blackstone and PAI Partners, which have sought to sell United Biscuits before, are now splitting the company in two and selling off the smaller savoury snacks business. Alongside Twiglets, it includes Hula Hoops and Mini Cheddars.Premier Foods, which has been obliged to sell assets to pay down debt, has already parted with Fray Bentos canned pies, which were a staple of post-second world war dining tablesBankers also see continued appetite in the UK. “Clearly there is a place in the market for some of these brands,” says one. “The real issue is, what is their value?”United Biscuits’ owners Blackstone and PAI Partners are selling off its savoury snacks division, including Twiglets, for about £500m. Bankers say it is most likely to be flipped back to private equity, but potential trade buyers include Europe’s Intersnack and PepsiCo.Fab lollies: R&R Ice Cream, once part of Nestlé and now owned by Oaktree, is seen as too big a bite for trade buyers at $1bn.Hartleys Jams: Trade buyers may have more appetite for Premier Foods’ brand Hartleys, expected to be valued at £150m-£170m. First round bids are due in next month. Duerr’s, a family jam maker founded in the 1880s, has an eye on Hartley’s, although it has yet to decide on a bid. “As the biggest independent jam producer in the UK, we are investigating opportunities related to the sale of Hartley’s,” said Mark Duerr, fifth generation and managing director.Premier Foods’ vinegar and pickles business is valued at about £25m-£30m. Potential buyers include Scotland-based Baxters Food Group, which bought Fray Bentos from Premier; Princes, owned by Japan’s Mitsubishi; and Symington’s, which has been on an acquisitive spree in recent years, according to bankers.Value is complicated by two factors: stagnant markets and, in some cases, years of under-investment, meaning that whoever picks them up will have to spend far more than just the price tag.That makes it harder to generate returns, although some in the industry point to Sugar Puffs, a breakfast cereal once owned by PepsiCo, as evidence that it is possible.“Sugar Puffs was languishing and then the new owners took over and reintroduced the Honey Monster. Once the Honey Monster was back up and grinning again, the brand just took off,” says Derek Wilson, president at jam-maker Andros UK.Sugar Puffs were such a success that the owners – a group of food industry veterans bankrolled by private money – were able to bank fat profits when they sold it on last year.Steven Esom, partner at Langholm Capital, a private equity house that specialises in buying and rejuvenating brands, points to Marmite as a classic example of a brand that has moved with the times, appearing as a flavouring in all manner of snacks and benefiting from new, “squeezy” packaging.“Just five or six years ago it was not doing very much, just sitting there in the black and yellow-topped jar. But now it’s a trendy product again.”Some in the industry have sought to this strategy a step further by splitting off the brand from manufacturing. This is not dissimilar to US beverage giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which own the brand and recipe but rely on other companies to bottle and distribute their drinks.It is also the model followed by The Brand Cellar, which buys and spices up brands without legacy manufacturing assets, then licenses them on, in many cases taking them to the Middle East and Asia.“The structural weakness of the brand manufacturing model is that you bring in old factories and people on the production line with pensions. You may want the brands, but if there is too much fixed asset along with it, it makes it more difficult to get a return on investment,” says Mr Harrison, global brands director at The Brand Cellar.The current sellers are keen to divest the physical assets along with the brands, meaning buyers are more likely to come from private equity or trade.Bankers also point to possible interest from overseas buyers. However, United Biscuits’ experience with Bright Foods, the Chinese food conglomerate with which it had abortive exclusive talks in 2010, has highlighted the difficulty of such deals.But if Mr Harrison has his way, Twiglets and Sarson’s pickled onions could yet end up on Chinese banqueting tables. “Resonance and history of a lot of UK brands may still be surprisingly powerful in other parts of the world . . . the latent loyalty in British brands is there,” he says."
320;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-03-12T22:54:26Z;PepsiCo paves way for Nooyi successor;;PepsiCo, the US snacks and drinks company, unveiled its second management reshuffle in the past six months on Monday, signalling that it is accelerating plans to prepare a successor for chief executive Indra Nooyi.PepsiCo appointed John Compton, head of PepsiCo Americas Foods, to president of the company and replaced him with Brian Cornell, who until recently was head of Walmart’s Sam’s Club unit. In assuming the newly created position, Mr Compton, a 28-year veteran of the company, will be responsible for PepsiCo’s global beverages, snacks and nutrition categories, along with global strategy, operations and marketing.Ms Nooyi described the changes as an “essential step in PepsiCo’s journey to continue to deliver sustainable growth”.Analysts said that the breadth of Mr Compton’s new responsibilities signalled that he is the heir apparent to Ms Nooyi, who has faced increasing criticism in the past year as PepsiCo’s stock price has stagnated relative to Coca-Cola’s, and its carbonated beverage business has struggled. Ms Nooyi, who said last month that she loves her job and will stay as long as the board wants her, has been spoken of as a possible candidate to lead the World Bank.Several analysts said that Mr Compton’s promotion was foreshadowed last month at the Consumer Analysts Group of New York conference, when he handled most of the company’s presentation and answered the majority of questions.“Perhaps PepsiCo was more explicitly positioning Mr Compton as the leading CEO-successor candidate behind current CEO Indra Nooyi, who was comparably subdued,” Ali Dibadj, analyst a Bernstein Research, said at the time.Mr Dibadj said that investors should feel more comfortable that PepsiCo has finally developed a succession plan and is establishing a “broader bench” of executive talent. However, he said that making changes to the snacks business, which has been the company’s strength recently, could be risky. Last September, the company reshuffled the leadership of the beverage unit.However, people familiar with PepsiCo’s succession plans say that the company currently sees Mr Cornell and Zein Abdalla, chief executive of PepsiCo Europe, as equally strong possibilities to succeed Ms Nooyi.At Walmart Mr Cornell got sales at the warehouse club he headed growing much faster than at the company’s trademark Supercenters in the US. The move represents a homecoming for Mr Cornell, who previously was president of Tropicana, president of PepsiCo beverages for Europe and Africa, and president of PepsiCo North America food service before leaving in 2004.“We believe his experience at both the consumer packaged goods and retailer levels will be put to great use in his new role,” said Tom Mullarkey, analyst at Morningstar.At its strategic review in February, PepsiCo announced a big boost in marketing spending intended to revive its US beverage business and globalise its advertising campaigns.Analysts said that the timing of Ms Nooyi’s eventual departure depends on the success of the new strategy, which she billed at the time as a once-in-a-decade “reset”.“It makes sense that PepsiCo appears to be setting up for a relatively seamless transition in top management while the company is still in a period of transition,” said Bonnie Herzog, beverage analyst at Wells Fargo.PepsiCo shares closed up 1.25 per cent to $63.94 on Monday.
321;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-03-09T19:04:11Z;Cola colouring changed over cancer fears;;Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the world’s largest makers of carbonated soft drinks, are changing the ingredients in their flagship sparkling beverages to avoid new state warnings that would link their colas with cancer.Health advocacy groups have been questioning the safety of the “caramel” colouring that the soda makers use to give their drinks a brown hue. The companies said on Friday that they would ask their caramel suppliers to change how they manufacture the ingredient to reduce levels of 4-Methylimidazole, or 4-MEI, a chemical compound within the substance.The move comes as California was set to add Coke and Pepsi to its Proposition 65 list of substances that cause cancer, which would have forced the companies to put warning labels on their products.Earlier this week, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group, released studies of the leading soft drinks, finding high levels of the chemical, which has been linked to cancerous lung tumours in mice.The group called on the US Food and Drug Administration to ban caramel colourings that contain the chemical, arguing that the colouring was purely cosmetic and that Coke and Pepsi are “needlessly exposing millions of Americans to a chemical that causes cancer”.Although the companies deny any risks associated with their products, the threat of warning labels caused them to make the rare change.“While we believe that there is no public health risk that justifies any such change, we did ask our caramel suppliers to take this step so that our products would not be subject to the requirement of a scientifically unfounded warning,” said Ben Sheidler, a Coke spokesman. “It is important to note that while we have asked our caramel suppliers to modify their manufacturing processes, those modifications do not change our product.”PepsiCo said its caramel suppliers have already made the change in California and that they would be expanding use of the process across the US.“There is no scientific evidence that 4-MEI in foods and beverages is a threat to human health,” said Gina Anderson, a PepsiCo spokeswoman. “The FDA and other regulatory agencies, including the European Food Safety Authority and Health Canada, consider caramel colouring safe for use in foods and beverages.”The American Beverage Association, a lobbying group, dismissed questions about the safety of caramel colouring as a scare tactic.Caramel colouring is widely used in food and beverage products and growing concerns could eventually lead to more widespread changes.Nestlé, the world’s biggest food company by sales, is continuing to use caramel colouring, which may include trace levels of 4-MEI.The company, which earlier this month trumpeted the removal of artificial colours, flavours and preservatives from the 79 confectionery products it sells in the UK, said global regulators in the US and Europe consider caramel colouring to be safe.As an example, it cited the European Food Safety Authority’s conclusion that the presence of 4-MEI in caramel colouring is not a health concern.The company said it was closely monitoring the scientific literature on the topic, as well as the advice of public health authorities. “Presently there is no evidence to support the removal of caramel food colouring from our products,” it said.The FDA is reviewing the Center for Science in the Public Interest’s petition and working with manufacturers to determine if the current limits on the caramel carcinogen provide ample protection for consumers.“It is important to note, a consumer would have to consume well over a thousand cans of soda a day to reach the doses administered in the studies that have shown links to cancer in rodents,” said Douglas Karas, an FDA spokesman.
322;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-03-07T02:02:20Z;‘Ownership’: Is it about selling or service?;There is a wide variety of corporate responses, explains Ajay Makan;There is still a great deal of uncertainty within the corporate world about what social media are for, and this is reflected in the lack of consensus about which department should take responsibility.A recent PR Week survey found just 4 per cent of US companies have a separate social media team, while IT departments are almost as likely to manage budgets as are PR teams. While nearly all large companies engage with social media in some way, the variety of responses is huge.“The whole question of who ‘owns’ social media within companies is problematic,” says Jim Tobin, president of Ignite, a social media agency based in North Carolina. “It touches on everything from customer service to marketing, and companies need to integrate it across everything they do.”Many businesses have turned to agencies to develop a comprehensive approach. In a relatively new medium, agencies are often thought to have a cutting edge in designing and executing social media strategies. But the trade-off is that agencies can never be as embedded in the culture and message of a company as employees.Some see a model of the future emerging in a Chicago skyscraper. There, in the offices of Gatorade, the sports drink brand, five in-house marketing and communication specialists sit in front of a battery of screens programmed to track online mentions of the brand, and to respond.The idea is to marry in-house staff’s knowledge of the brand with the best of technology. A media agency is represented in Gatorade’s social media “command centre”, but the effort is led by, and directed towards, the company’s own staff.“The room has glass doors to remind everyone in the company of the fact that social media are always on and affect everything they do,” says Joshua Karpf, director of digital and social media for PepsiCo, which owns Gatorade.PepsiCo set up a “centre of excellence” in 2008, and holds meetings among executives to share best social media practice, such as Gatorade’s command centre, among brands.But such a high level of resource commitment is unusual. In one of the few academic studies of social media activity, the centre for marketing research at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, found that in 2011, take-up among Fortune 500 companies levelled off, while there was retrenchment among fast-growing, privately owned US companies.“The shine has worn off social media,” says Dr Nora Ganim Barnes, the centre director. “If companies cannot find a metric to show social media are generating a return on investment, they may no longer feel obliged to throw resources at, say, Facebook and Twitter, in the way they did when they were new.”But measuring results leads back to the thorny question of ownership, and whether a social media strategy is primarily about keeping existing customers happy, brand management, or sales and marketing.For all Mr Tobin’s talk of breaking down silos and integrating approaches, his agency’s approach is narrowly focused on communications.His company staffs Twitter feeds and Facebook pages round-the-clock to push the messages of client companies, but complaints about a product are given a surprisingly old-fashioned response: a 1-800 number or email address to contact the client company’s customer services.Ignite is a marketing-focused agency, so clients know they are paying for a focused service, but it is noticeable that there are few, if any, social media agencies focused on customer service strategies.Even in a set-up such as Gatorade’s command centre, there are limits to integration. Communications and marketing teams are still king. Customer services specialists may be given access to PepsiCo’s social media applications to respond to specific complaints or queries, but they do not shape strategy.One exception to the bias towards marketing is the hotel industry. Hyatt offers a Twitter-based concierge service that has 20,000 followers, and answers questions from guests or prospective guests at any of the company’s hotels.Starwood Hotels, which operates brands such as Sheraton, blazed a trail in corporate social media a decade ago by creating the “lurker,” an online persona that trawled websites for customer complaints and sought to address them directly.Whatever the focus of a social media strategy, analysts say companies will need to change the way they manage campaigns.Dallas Lawrence, chief global digital media strategist at the Burson-Marsteller agency, says: “Conventional media campaigns involved intense work during the commissioning period, but once they were launched, clients could step back.“Social media work is constant and ongoing, and so it needs more attention.”
323;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-03-06T16:46:32Z;Shanghai lights up for Oreo centenary;;Kraft celebrated the 100th birthday of its Oreo biscuit in Shanghai on Tuesday by turning the waterfront into a vast Oreo advertisement, painting the landmark Oriental Pearl Tower Oreo blue, plastering skyscrapers with multi-storey neon Oreo adverts and staging fireworks over the Huangpu river.It was a celebration of one of history’s most successful global brands – and of how that brand has reinvented itself in China, where Oreo is the mainland’s best-selling biscuit.The way Kraft has transformed this most quintessentially American cookie is a model for how successful multinational brands are approaching the China market, retail analysts say.For what passes for an Oreo in China these days often bears only a glancing resemblance to the black and white sandwich biscuit first sold in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1912. Since then, Kraft has sold 452bn Oreos, global revenues for the brand last year topped $2bn and the cookie has a Facebook community of 23m.But in a bid to please Chinese taste buds, Kraft has made an Oreo with Chinese characteristics.Some changes are subtle. The original Oreo is less sweet on the Chinese mainland than in the US. Other changes are nothing short of revolutionary, at least for Oreo aficionados.Some Oreos in China are shaped like a straw, or like a wafer, and even the traditional round ones come in flavours such as green tea ice cream, grape-peach, mango-orange and raspberry-strawberry. Kraft says some of these flavours, developed first in China, have since become hits globally. Kraft calls it “reverse innovation”.Even the “birthday cake” Oreo introduced to celebrate the cookie’s centenary is specially engineered to taste like a Chinese birthday cake – not an American one, says Kraft Foods China president, Shawn Warren.Oreo, introduced into China in 1996, largely languished until Kraft made changes in distribution and advertising to boost sales – and created new flavours and tastes suited to the local market.“Any foreign company that comes to China and says, ‘there’s 1.5bn people here, goody goody, and I only need 1 per cent of that … (is) going to get into trouble. You have to understand how the consumer operates at a really detailed level,” says Lorna Davis, head of global biscuits for Kraft and former head of Kraft Foods in China.She says non-traditional Oreo shapes – long and thin, or rectangular wafers – are only a small percentage of the China market, with the bulk still taken by round Oreos. But introducing new flavoured fillings for the round biscuit was crucial to boosting its success, along with new Oreo adverts that “struck a chord with one-child families”, she says, creating an emotional attachment to the brand, in a country where big displays of emotion are rare.Kraft is not alone in turning local adaptations into profit in China. Torsten Stocker, partner in the China practice of Monitor Group, points out that PepsiCo’s Lays potato chips come in flavours including cucumber and blueberry in China.Mary Bergstrom, author of the upcoming book All Eyes East: Lessons from the Front Lines of Marketing to China’s Youth, says potato chips are viewed as a “hot” food in China – where foods are classed traditionally as “hot” or “cold”, irrespective of actual temperature. So Lays added cooling flavours like cucumber to counteract that.Yum! Brands’ KFC has become the market leader in fast food in China by selling foods such as rice gruel with preserved, or “thousand-year-old” egg along with their chicken buckets. Coca-Cola developed its popular Minute Maid “Pulpy” juice drink first to appeal to Chinese tastes, but it has since gone on to become a $1bn global brand.Starbucks and Häagen-Dazs have reinvented their entire business model in China, retail analysts say, eschewing the takeaway or home consumption model they use in the West to become dine-in venues in China.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen in Shanghai
324;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-03-04T19:12:53Z;US food groups tailor recipes to Hispanics;;Food companies are increasingly targeting Hispanics as a local “emerging market” as they look for new ways to increase sales in the sluggish US.Products such as spicy “Tapatio” flavoured crisps, “Dulce de Leche” Cheerios and Manzanita Sol, a sparkling apple drink, are meant to lure Hispanic customers with familiar flavours. Meanwhile, analysts say these products, which are usually tested in regional markets, are becoming more mainstream in the general market and expanding the range of American palates.Executives at groups such as Kraft, General Mills and PepsiCo said during a recent industry conference that they were stepping up their efforts to reach Hispanics with tailored products and additional advertising investment. Companies are seeking to bring their experience driving fast revenue growth overseas to the US.Tony Vernon, who will take over as chief executive at Kraft, told the Financial Times that the US grocery company will increase its spending on Hispanic advertising by “double-digits” this year, after tripling its investment in 2011. He says Kraft launched seven new Latino campaigns last year and that most of the advertising budget for Kool-Aid was directed at Hispanics.“They are the largest group that we should be targeting,” Mr Vernon says, referring to the growing Hispanic population.Ken Powell, chief executive of General Mills, the US cereal company, says that Hispanics are especially valuable because of their greater propensity for cooking and eating at home.He projects that 40 per cent of US households will be “multicultural” by 2020, making Hispanics an important target.“We’re introducing these consumers to our brands and they are rewarding us with very strong growth,” Mr Powell says.Hispanics are the fastest growing demographic group in the US, accounting for 16 per cent of the population, according to the 2010 US census. The Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies says the top 500 US advertisers increased spending targeted at Hispanics by 14 per cent to $4.3bn in 2010, the most recent year that data were available.Consumer and food companies were among the biggest spenders, increasing their overall Hispanic advertising to $707m. Restaurants and fast-food chains also increased their targeting of Hispanics, raising their spending 30 per cent to $301m.Credit Suisse recently found that Hispanic consumers represent an especially rich vein because their household food spending is projected to rise by 5.7 per cent during the next decade, compared with just 2.5 per cent for non-Hispanic households.“This demographic group is a marketer’s dream because Hispanic per capita income is growing, the consumers tend to be very brand loyal and they are very engaged shoppers,” says Robert Moskow, analyst at Credit Suisse.Companies such as Coca-Cola, General Mills and Kellogg, which have been dedicating the most significant resources to Hispanic marketing, have reaped the biggest benefits. Credit Suisse finds that Hispanic marketing “leaders” have outperformed “laggards” by 270 basis points in terms of organic US sales growth in the last three years.Many of those laggards are now trying to make up lost ground. PepsiCo, which spent 1 per cent of its advertising budget on Hispanic marketing in 2010, hired a new cultural branding specialist and doubled its spending on Hispanic programmes last year.“We’re putting a huge amount of resources and attention into the actual marketplace,” says Javier Farfan, PepsiCo’s director of cultural branding. “You have to start investing to speak to the community, and with the right products in place.”PepsiCo chose Sofia Vergara, the Colombian actress, as the new face of Diet Pepsi and featured her in a Super Bowl commercial. It has also recently been sponsoring programming on Univision, a top Latino television station, and has launched Spanish soccer-themed ads.According to Mr Moskow, companies need to be careful because as Hispanics become wealthier and more bicultural, their consumption habits change.“The profile of the Hispanic consumer will evolve,” he says. “The companies that are just starting to do the work to understand the consumers are going to have the toughest time adjusting to their evolving tastes.”Additional reporting by David Gelles
325;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-03-01T18:07:19Z;Global advertising;Ad market gets a boost from large multinationals and the quadrennial effect;Spring has sprung. Well, so says the advertising industry – and it might even be right. On Thursday, WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell delivered upbeat forecasts, reporting that group budgets for 2012 show a 4 per cent growth in like-for-like revenues and gross margins. This tallies with soundings from ZenithOptimedia, a media services unit of rival Publicis. It has predicted a 4.7 per cent boost to spending on advertising this year (up from 3.5 per cent in 2011) including a 2 per cent improvement in recession-hit western Europe.Even in the UK, there is a whiff of thawing budgets: marketing spending by companies was revised up for two successive quarters in the second half of 2011, according to trade association data.Spring madness? Perhaps not. Part of the 2012 optimism stems from the quadrennial effect. Like leap years, the summer Olympics, European football championship, US presidential election and other polls roll around on a regular ad-boosting basis. Add in the Japanese bounce, post-Fukushima, and ZenithOptimedia reckons these factors combined will bolster ad spend by $7bn, a third of the year-on-year improvement.But a second, more fundamental trend may also be at work. Large multinationals, still wary of financial markets and acquisitions, seem to be investing some additional funds into pushing brands in fast-growing markets and bolstering shares in more turgid ones. Since the start of 2012, this trend has been confirmed by executives at the likes of Kellogg, Unilever, PepsiCo and Colgate-Palmolive – although counterparts at Procter & Gamble and L’Oréal have been more cautious.But investors should be careful. Ad agency shares have enjoyed a strong run over the past six months, and 2013 will be shorn of the “special events” effect.That said, there may be selective opportunities: WPP, for example, could probably justify a 13 times forward multiple, in line with peers, compared with the current 11.5. And spring, while unpredictable, does eventually lead on to summer.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
326;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-02-29T20:59:44Z;Nasdaq and the markets;What we make of this latest burst of prosperity depends how it is measured;Technical analysts, market psychologists, and other practitioners of the financial black arts are having a busy winter. One supposedly significant milestone after another falls: Dow hits 13,000, the Nasdaq’s 2007 high, Apple’s $500bn valuation. But there is a non-voodoo message here too – we’ve simply had a serious rally.A little reflection would not hurt. What we make of this latest burst of prosperity depends heavily on how it is measured, and it pays to avoid complexity. So take a highly liquid and transparent group of companies from a range of industries: the 50 biggest US companies by market capitalisation. The members of this sample have added $1.2tn in market cap since many indices bottomed on October 3 last year, a 23 per cent gain, according to Capital IQ. The gains have been very evenly spread. Yes, Apple is a large contributor, but strike it out and the remaining 49 are still up 22 per cent. Only one of these 50 companies has not notched up gains during the rally: Amazon, burdened with both a dizzying valuation and declining margins. And the best performers of the 50 are diverse. The likes of Citigroup, Comcast, Occidental Petroleum, Walt Disney and Home Depot have risen by more than 40 per cent. If one sector stands out, it is the banks – the six in the sample grew their market caps more, in aggregate ($167bn) than Apple did ($150bn).The underperformers have more in common. They are mostly defensive stocks. Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, AT&T, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Bristol-Myers Squibb all had single-digit percentage gains. They would have lagged even if their performances were adjusted to include their considerable dividends. If holders of these sedate names are feeling regret, it will probably be replaced by a sense of relief if the winter of our market content is made unglorious summer.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
327;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-02-28T20:42:22Z;US to keep grip on helm of World Bank;;"As went the International Monetary Fund last year, so the World Bank seems to be going now.First, the organisation’s head resigns, then emerging market governments proclaim the need for an open, merit-based process to appoint a successor. Finally, the traditional monopolists of the position – the US at the World Bank; Europe at the IMF – get who they want anyway.Last June, Christine Lagarde, then French finance minister, was appointed IMF managing director, defeating with some ease a challenge from Agustin Carstens, the Mexican central bank governor.Robert Zoellick, in effect appointed World Bank president by George W. Bush’s administration, announced his resignation two weeks ago. Despite statements since from China and Brazil that it is time to break Washington’s monopoly, conversations with current and former White House officials, World Bank policymakers and potential candidates for the post suggest that since then, the US administration has deterred any credible non-US candidate from preparing a bid.Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, said recently that Washington would propose a candidate in the coming weeks, and John Kerry, Senate foreign relations committee chairman, argued in a recent article in the Washington Times newspaper that the job should go to an American.“In a US election year, and given the need to do nothing to upset Congress by appearing weak internationally, the strong feeling around the bank is that the White House will absolutely insist on getting its way,” said a senior bank policymaker.Uri Dadush, former World Bank economic policy director and now at the Carnegie Endowment think-tank in Washington, said: “If you are, say, India, do you really want an open battle with a US candidate?“India wants the US’s help as a geopolitical counterweight to China more than it wants the World Bank presidency.”One potential candidate from an emerging market country – frequently mentioned in the media and by expert observers as a potential bank president – told the Financial Times that the US administration’s determination to promote an American was putting off contenders from even applying. This person, an experienced policymaker, said the view was shared by some other putative candidates they had spoken to.Among possible US candidates, Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state who says she intends to step down at the end of President Barack Obama’s first term, would almost certainly be given the job if she wanted it. But she has continued to insist she is not interested – protestations which, having initially met with scepticism inside the bank, are increasingly being accepted at face value.As with Ms Lagarde’s appointment, bank policymakers say that the US proposing a female candidate – who would be the first woman to lead the institution – could help neutralise the charge that the appointment process was “business as usual”. Although administration officials have been cagey about likely contenders, candidates that have been discussed include Susan Rice, US ambassador to the UN, Lael Brainard, top international economics official at the Treasury, and Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo. Laura d’Andrea Tyson, who was White House chief economic adviser to former president Bill Clinton, is also a possible contender.Press reports suggest that Larry Summers, former chief economic adviser to Mr Obama and World Bank chief economist between 1991 and 1993, is interested in the job. But while Mr Obama remains close to Mr Summers, his appointment would probably arouse opposition among some of the bank’s other shareholder countries.When Mr Summers was chief economist, he signed a memo arguing that developing countries were “under-polluted” – which its author said was intended to be ironic – and later encountered widespread criticism following remarks he made while president of Harvard University about the dearth of women in science and engineering academia.Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, is the only prominent person to declare his interest in the job. Mr Sachs is known for his advocacy for more development aid and his Millennium Villages development project in Africa.Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of the fund manager Pimco and a former IMF official, has also been suggested. Another potential candidate is Mr Kerry, but he is more likely to become secretary of state if Mr Obama wins re-election. Mr Geithner, who is due to leave the Treasury after November’s elections, is not interested in the job.Ms Rice declined to comment. Ms d’Andrea Tyson, Mr Summers and Mr El-Erian had not responded to queries at the time of writing. The US Treasury declined to comment on potential candidates. Pepsi­Co had no comment, but a spokesperson noted that Ms Nooyi said recently she wanted to keep running the company as long as the board wanted her to.Mr Dadush said: “For the World Bank presidency to change nationalities, either US power has to decline significantly or we would need a clear signal from the Americans that it is time for a change. Neither of those is currently the case”.Additional reporting by Richard McGregor and Geoff Dyer in Washington and Alan Rappeport in New York"
328;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-02-14T16:45:06Z;Russian romance: PepsiCo & porridge;;"According to Russian folklore, no romance can survive unless loving couples are happy cooking porridge together.PepsiCo, appears to have taken the message to heart. One year after completing the purchase of Wimm-Bill-Dann, a Russian dairy and fruit juice producer, the US group is expanding into Russia’s hot cereals market and has chosen Valentine’s Day to announce the move.PepsiCo took over WBD last year in a deal valued at $5.4bn – one of the biggest ever foreign investments in Russia outside the oil sector. The acquisition established the US group as the biggest food and beverage business in Russia and a leader in the country’s flourishing dairy market.In a sign of confidence in the Russian food market, PepsiCo is now expanding into the porridge business. Launching its first new production line in Russia since buying WBD, the US group will make Quaker Oats at a factory outside Moscow for distribution across the CIS. Quaker Oats will be sold in Russia under the “Chuda” (Miracle) brand associated with WBD’s popular yogurts and milky puddings, says Maria Kagan, PepsiCo spokeswoman.“It’s like a marriage of convenience. Pepsi has the recipe. Russia has the brand. And off we go,” she says, rather unromantically.PepsiCo has been making porridge since 2001 when it bought Quaker Oats for $13.2bn in its biggest ever acquisition. Quaker Oats is central to the US group’s strategy to build a $30bn nutrition business and focus more heavily on healthy foods.PepsiCo has a long history in Russia where its trademark fizzy beverage Pepsi-Cola became the first Western branded consumer product to be made in the country in 1974. More recently PepsiCo has faced fierce competition from Coca-Cola in Russia’s fast growing soft drinks market.When it comes to porridge PepsiCo will not enjoy the advantage of being first foreign mover in Russia. Nestlé, the world’s biggest food company, has been producing instant oat cereals in a joint venture with Russia’s Bystroff group for more than three years.Porridge, whether made with oats, rice or semolina, is a popular breakfast dish in Russia, served with copious amounts of melted butter or dollops of sour cream. Quaker Oats is seen as more puritanical fare in the west but is easier to prepare than old-fashioned Russian varieties requiring only the addition of hot water.Instant porridge is catching on fast in Russia where the market is said to be worth more than $200m a year. The sticky pans and laborious early morning stirring that have for centuries tested Russian relationships may soon be relegated to the past.Related reading:

329;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-02-12T16:52:34Z;Doubts over PepsiCo’s strategic shake-up;;For Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, satisfying Wall Street’s appetite for quick profits while attempting to feed the world healthier food has been a difficult balance.Last week, the US food and drinks group said that it would shed 8,700 jobs worldwide as it revealed a strategic “reset” that will see it invest more than half a billion dollars in marketing its core products – soft drinks and salty snacks – this year.The plan to go back to basics and refocus on the products that have been PepsiCo’s growth engine was widely anticipated, but it left some analysts wondering whether Ms Nooyi had gone far enough to revive the company’s fortunes.Investors initially expressed disappointment that the cost of the move and job cuts would mean slimmer profits this year. A weaker earnings outlook sliced nearly 4 per cent off the company’s share price on Thursday.PepsiCo executives acknowledged some stumbles, but point to new infrastructure in emerging markets, the rehabilitation of the Gatorade brand and expected breakthroughs on sweeteners as reasons to be optimistic. But shareholders, frustrated by a loss of market share to Coca-Cola in North America and a flat stock price relative to its biggest beverage rival, have been calling on PepsiCo to make changes.Wall Street analysts welcomed the decision to spend $500m-$600m on 12 “megabrands” with a focus on North American beverages. However, after a series of setbacks during the past few years, some doubted the company’s ability to execute its strategy.According to analysts at Bernstein Research, PepsiCo’s goal of raising advertising spending to 6 per cent of its sales by 2015 is a smaller portion of sales than the company spent a decade ago. Although Bernstein advocates additional investment, they warn that PepsiCo will be spending much more just to match its historical growth rates.PepsiCo’s move came as rival Coca-Cola announced its own cost-cutting and advertising initiative last week.“The application of time and money is not in a vacuum, particularly considering Coke’s business momentum and just announced productivity plan,” says Michael Branca, analyst at Barclays Capital.Junk food is still selling, so the company has to go in this regrettable directionOthers point out that PepsiCo’s renewed focus on products that are linked to obesity and diabetes risks undoing some of the goodwill gained over the past few years when the company promised to make health and wellness a priority. Health advocates bemoan the new strategy, calling it a retreat from Ms Nooyi’s vision of promoting more nourishing food.“The quarterly pressure of profits makes companies have to respond to short-term gain,” says Kelly Brownell, director of Yale’s Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity. “Junk food is still selling, so the company has to go in this regrettable direction.”Marion Nestlé, a professor of nutrition and public health at New York University, calls PepsiCo’s move to reinvest in its core brands a “crass commercial decision” and says that greater emphasis on less healthy foods would hurt the company in the long run. “They have to grow, and that forces them to reassess any social values they may have,” Ms Nestlé says.But Ms Nooyi insists that she is not giving up on nutrition, emphasising that the company cares both about food that is fun and good for customers. “This is an ‘and’ game, not an ‘or’ game,” she says.PepsiCo is not alone in grappling with growing demand for food that not only tastes good but is healthy. Groups such as Danone, McDonald’s and Walmart have moved to provide healthier offerings, while some of their rivals have chosen to focus narrowly on the products that made them popular, regardless of nutrition.A report funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation last year suggested that PepsiCo might have had the right idea all along, finding that products with fewer calories, dairy and whole grains were driving sales at food companies. The study found that such products accounted for 70 per cent of sales growth at the top 15 food and drinks groups between 2007 and 2011.As PepsiCo forges ahead, some investors remain bullish. Don Yacktman, president of Yacktman Asset Management and a PepsiCo shareholder, says that the company remains a good investment in the long term, although its share price could still suffer as it battles commodity costs and an onslaught from Coke.“On a 10-year horizon it’s still a great business,” Mr Yacktman says, adding that PepsiCo is more diversified than Coke and has more room to grow internationally. “We’ll see how the execution goes, but the basic thing is still there.”
330;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-02-09T23:22:39Z;Pepsi to cut 8,700 jobs worldwide;;PepsiCo, the US drinks and snacks company, said on Thursday it would shed 8,700 jobs worldwide to cut costs as it ramps up investment in its core cola and crisps brands that investors claimed have been neglected in favour of its healthier products.Indra Nooyi, chief executive, said the moves represented a once-in-a-decade “major reset” for the business. After more than a year of tough criticism that she was too focused on “good for you” products such as juice and oatmeal, Ms Nooyi expressed a firm commitment to brands such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Doritos.“Any time you make a mistake, it’s a mea culpa, the buck stops with me,” Ms Nooyi said, acknowledging that personnel changes could have been made earlier and that the company could have reaped more benefits from the acquisition of its bottlers.The job cuts represent about 3 per cent of PepsiCo’s global workforce and are part of an effort to reduce costs by $1.5bn in the next three years. The long awaited announcement came as the company reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and said it would invest $500m-$600m in marketing and advertising this year, with a special focus on the flat US beverage business that has been losing market share to Coca-Cola.Ms Nooyi said that after a six-month internal analysis of the company, she rejected the idea of splitting it into separate snacks and drinks businesses, which some analysts have advocated.PepsiCo described the investment as a “back to the basics” approach, though Ms Nooyi said that if the North America beverage business did not show improvement after 18 months, “structural” changes, such as divestments or joint ventures, were possible.The new investment, along with charges related to the lay-offs, are expected to cut earnings this year by about 5 per cent. That decline, along with the realisation that there is no quick fix for PepsiCo, disappointed investors and the company’s shares closed down 3.7 per cent to $64.27.Bonnie Herzog, beverage analyst at Wells Fargo, said the announcement signalled that PepsiCo’s turnround would be a long-term process and that the initial hit to earnings was steeper than expected.“The key question is if what they laid out is enough,” said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer at WP Stewart. “Coke is not going to stand still, they have thrown ad dollars at the market before with mixed results.”Some of PepsiCo’s current problems were evident it its fourth-quarter results. Net income rose 3 per cent year on year to $1.4bn, or 89 cents a share, with revenues up 11 per cent to $20.1bn, with strong showings in Europe, Asia and in the Frito-Lay North America business.Yet revenues in the North America beverage business fell 1 per cent due to continued declines in carbonated soft drinks.Meanwhile, Ms Nooyi, who took over at PepsiCo in 2006, offered little insight on succession planning but said she hoped to keep her job and see the changes through.“My hope, my goal, my desire is to keep running the company for as long as I am creating value and as long as my board of directors wants to keep me.”
331;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-02-09T21:57:41Z;Muted share price reaction to foreclosure deal;;US bank stocks saw a mixed reaction, as US regulators announced a deal that could be worth up to $39.5bn to resolve allegations that the largest US mortgage lenders improperly foreclosed on homes.The five biggest lenders will take a $25bn hit on mortgage principal writedowns and interest payments but the majority will come out of existing reserves.This is just a shuffling of losses. There will be almost no impact on bank balance sheets this quarter,” said Richard Staite, US bank analyst at Atlantic Equities. Bank of America, which has $30bn in loan loss provision and an additional $8bn in litigation reserves according to Atlantic Equities research, climbed 0.6 per cent to $8.18, its highest level since August.But JPMorgan fell 1.2 per cent to $37.86, despite announcing that it will not require new reserves to cover its share of the settlement. Citigroup was off 1.7 per cent to $33.66 and Wells Fargo fell 0.2 per cent to $30.58.Exposure to legal risk stemming from the housing crisis has weighed heavily on bank share prices.But Tom Burnell at Wells Fargo cautioned that the banks remain open to litigation on mortgage origination and securitisation practices, as well criminal prosecutions by federal and state governments and claims brought by individual homeowners.News that leaders of the main Greek parties had reached a deal on spending cuts broke just before markets opened in New York, but US stocks barely flickered in response.“The market has seen such a big move up, that to break out again we need to see a significant catalyst, which the Greek deal is not,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.The S&P 500 closed up 0.15 per cent to 1,351.95 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.1 per cent to 12,890.46.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,927.23, as Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, set an all-time high of $496., before falling back to $493.17, still up 3.5 per cent on the day.Reports suggested the company may launch a new iPad model in March, while Canaccord Genuity analysts said Apple shares could climb as high as $665 after its retail checks showed “strong sales trends for the iPhone 4S at all three US carriers and overall strong iPhone sales in international markets”.The S&P 500 is just 12 points short of its post-financial crisis closing high of 1,363 hit last April with Apple at the centre of that recovery.Technology stocks now account for 20 per cent of the benchmark US index’s market capitalisation, an increase of more than 10 per cent since April. The weighting of financials remains a full percentage point lower than last April. Payment processing companies have been one of the few bright spots for financials and Visa climbed 3.8 per cent to $112.42 yesterday, after reporting strong results that suggested new regulations on card payments were not weighing on the company.Visa’s shares are now up 60 per cent since the start of 2011, while those of MasterCard have climbed 77 per cent over the same period.But Donald Fanetti at Citigroup warned that credit card companies are likely to see a seasonal uptick in delinquencies when they publish data on parts of their portfolio next week, which could weigh on the stocks.Shares in PepsiCo fell 3.7 per cent to $64.27, after the company said it would cut 8,700 jobs and said “structural” changes, such as divestitures or joint ventures, would be considered if the North America beverage business does not show improvement in the next 18 months.Shares in Groupon fell 13.7 per cent to $21.75, after the discount coupon website declared a loss in its first quarterly earnings report as a public company.That eradicated gains made in the first two days of February, when Facebook’s IPO filing triggered a rally in social media stocks. It may also have generated profit for short-sellers, who had borrowed and sold more than two-thirds of available Groupon shares ahead of earnings.TripAdvisor fell 14.6 per cent to $28.29, after the online travel-recommendation service missed analyst estimates with its first earnings report since being spun off from Expedia.Lorillard, a cigarette maker, climbed 9.7 per cent to $124.37, after it lifted its dividend 25 cents to $1.55 in strong results. That helped rival Philip Morris climb 2.8 per cent to $80.06.Akamai Technologies surged 10.5 per cent to $38.06. The network server provider reported quarterly sales and profit that topped analyst estimates.Shares in Diamond Foods fell 37 per cent to $23.13 after the company ousted its chief executive and said it would restate its accounts after a probe. That put at risk Diamond’s planned purchase of the Pringles brand from Procter & Gamble, although shares in P&G were up 0.6 per cent to $64.04.Hospital operators sold off as a note from Gary Taylor at Citigroup said inpatient admissions in January fell 1.75 per cent compared to the same month in 2011.Tenet Healthcare fell 4.8 per cent to $5.58 and HCA was off 4 per cent to $27.80.
332;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-02-09T16:59:05Z;Tate & Lyle expects sweet performance;;Tate & Lyle said it was on track to deliver robust full-year operating profits driven by its much stronger-than-expected midyear results, despite slower growth in the three months to December 31.The maker of bulk ingredients such as high-fructose corn syrup also said in a third-quarter update that negotiations for the 2012 calendar year sweetener contracts in North America were “substantially complete”. The outcome of the talks which set prices for customers including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo was a modest price increase that would help the company recover commodity cost inflation and lift corn sugar unit margins, Tate & Lyle said.“The commentary in the IMS today suggests that pricing was up several percentage points above 10 per cent, recapturing higher corn costs,” said Alicia Forry, analyst at Collins Stewart. “We could even see upgrades to consensus [forecasts] for F13 if corn prices do not deviate.”In its speciality foods business, the company said volumes for sucralose, the sweetener in Splenda, grew at slower rate, while results from its smaller food system division disappointed.“Food systems didn’t see the volume growth that we would have liked. I don’t think we’ve executed well and there are a number of fixes in place,” said Javed Ahmed, chief executive.The company reported net debt of £410m at the end of the quarter and expected the year-end figure to be closer to £500m, with a working capital outflow of between £100m and £150m.“While we recognise the wider uncertainties in the global economy, we remain on track to deliver a good performance for the full financial year,” the company said.Shares in the FTSE 100 company closed down 3.2 per cent to 672.50
333;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Coke enjoys uptick in US;;Consumer trends are improving in the US, with increased travel and more dining out, according to the chief executive of Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drink company.Muhtar Kent said on Tuesday that he saw less “confusion” among US consumers compared with a year ago, and that a sense of rising optimism was evident in the company’s results.“We’re seeing early positive elements in terms of consumer sentiment, more travel and eating out,” said Mr Kent. “There’s some indication of a less troubled consumer.”The US economy has shown signs of life recently, notably in terms of job creation. Mr Kent, who has been critical of US corporate tax policy, said that the company’s home market still benefits from favourable demographics and flexible labour laws.US sales of carbonated soft drinks have struggled recently and Coke has been no exception. Sales of sparkling beverages in the US were flat during the fourth quarter, while still beverages were up 3 per cent, creating an uptick in overall sales volume in North America.Coke said that it expects the impact from commodity costs this year to be about half what they were in 2011, but that it will continue to raise prices. The company increased prices on carbonated soft drinks by 4 per cent in North America last year.Ali Dibadj, beverage analyst at Bernstein Research, said that Coke is relying on stability in the US as it weathers volatility in Europe and signs that growth in emerging markets could be starting to slow.“He’s never been more emphatic and pointed about the health of pricing in the North American market,” Mr Dibadj said, referring to Mr Kent.Coke also said it was launching a “productivity” cost-cutting programme that it expects to save up to $650m by 2015. The company plans to use those funds to offset commodity costs and to reinvest in marketing.The announcement comes ahead of PepsiCo’s earnings on Thursday, when analysts expect Coke’s rival to unveil its own cost-cutting plans as part of an effort to reinvest in its struggling North American carbonated soft drink business. Analysts suggested that Coke may have to increase spending even more this year to maintain its market share lead over PepsiCo.On Tuesday, Coke said its fourth-quarter profits fell 71 per cent from the prior year to $1.65bn, while operating revenues rose 5 per cent to $11bn. This year’s results were diminished by additional earnings booked last year from the company’s acquisition of its bottlers, but were stronger than Wall Street analysts expected.Sales in Asia and emerging markets were robust. Sales volume was up 13 per cent year-on-year in China during the final three months of last year and 15 per cent in India.Shares in Coke closed up 0.76 per cent to $68.55.
334;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-02-07T19:47:48Z;Coca-Cola: it’s the real thing;Its shares will not make you rich but they are unlikely to make anyone poor;People are willing to pay more for Coca-Cola – the drink and the stock. It is pointless to argue that it makes no sense to pay up for brand-name soda. People do, and that’s what matters. But share prices are something else. Coke shares trade at 17 times forward earnings, a hefty premium to the market. The demanding valuation may be why shares only ticked 1 per cent or so higher when Coke reported solid fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday.Coke’s valuation cannot be justified by looking at its growth profile in isolation. It targets a low to mid single-digit expansion. But the company has characteristics that make the share price look reasonable. While growth is not rapid, it is impressively consistent and the company’s profits are spread evenly around the world. In 2011, Europe, Latin America and North America each contributed about a quarter of profits, with developing markets in Asia and Africa making up the rest. Volumes and profits grew in every region – even Europe – and the company raised prices in most regions. Combine this with a universal brand and you have a company that looks more enduring than most nations.Is there another consumer staples company with a comparable profile? PepsiCo’s profits are much more concentrated in the Americas. The biggest of the global beer companies, AB InBev and SABMiller, do a bit better at emulating Coke’s global reach but they lack single global brands and their European and North American operations are struggling mightily to grow. The closest comparison is probably McDonald’s, but even that company has more of its profits concentrated in Europe and North America than Coke does.Coke shares may be unlikely to make anyone rich from here but they are even more unlikely to make anyone poor.

335;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-02-03T16:50:47Z;Taste for Horlicks lures UK brands to India;;"In a decrepit grocery store in Mahmudabad, a small city in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, one product stands out on its cluttered shelves: cans and cans of Horlicks.A. Khan, the owner of the roadside shop, says the traditional British drink manufactured locally with malted barley and buffalo milk is a bestseller. “Kids love it and mothers prefer it to more sugary drinks,” he says.The success in India of Horlicks, which is owned by the UK-based pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, is not limited to the small northern city.Horlicks, first introduced to India by returning Indian soldiers who had fought with the British Army in the first world war, enjoys blockbuster sales across the country, overtaking popular drinks such as cola from Coca-Cola and Pepsi in terms of sales, and is second only to Bisleri, India’s best-selling water brand.Horlicks’ success played a key role in boosting GSK’s non-pharmaceutical products sales in India by 19 per cent last year, compared to the 1 per cent sales rise in the US and a 1 per cent drop in Europe in the nine months to the end of September 2011.However, the soothing beverage is just one of many products once manufactured in England, Scotland and Wales that have become de facto Indian consumer goods thanks to their overwhelming success in Asia’s third-largest economy.Besides GSK’s Horlicks, the shelves of India’s predominantly small, family-owned shops are filled with UK brands.Cadbury’s chocolate bars, Unilever’s Lifebuoy soap, Reckitt Benckiser’s Dettol disinfectant, ITC’s Gold Flake cigarettes and Woodward’s Gripe Water are ubiquitous.The success of these brands and the groups that make them – many of which have since listed in India – have spurred newer UK consumer groups to make a push into the fast-growing economy.United Biscuits, maker of the quintessentially British brand McVitie’s digestive biscuits, set up its first plant in India in 2009. The company is now looking to build a strong distribution network to reap the same results as its more established competitors.However, Neelesh Hundekari, head of lifestyle practice at consultancy AT Kearney, says that replicating the success of Horlicks and Cadbury, which is now controlled by Kraft of the US, will be a tough task.“It’s not easy to build a trusted brand in India,” says Mr Hundekari. “You need to understand Indian tastes, as we are a very diverse country. It also takes time to build a distribution network as India’s retail market is fragmented. To succeed in the long term you need to be very patient.”The UK brands are thriving in India predominantly because they have an established long-term presence in south Asia, with local manufacturing facilities and localisation of their products. For example, Horlicks offers specific flavours, such as cardamom, and additional vitamins for the Indian market.Unilever attributes the longevity of its Lifebuoy soap, which it says is used in 140m households in India and boasts an 18 per cent market share, to a combination of its social mission, distinctive pink colour and marketing.The soap was born out of the Public Health Act in late 19th-century Britain. Many of the challenges at that time – booming population, migration from rural to urban areas, swaths of slums with poor sanitation – can be found in today’s India, creating “huge health problems which frankly could be solved by the humble bar of soap”, says Keith Weed, chief marketing and communications officer at Unilever in the UK.The strength of these older brands has led many Indian consumers to consider them more as Indian rather than “Made in Britain” products.“Many of these brands have been in India for decades, in some instances even before independence [in 1947],” says Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak, an Indian retail consultancy.“The success of these companies is that they have become Indian to your average consumer here …and their products are also tailored for a domestic buyer,” he adds.A bar of Cadbury chocolate or Lifebuoy soap can be found in as many as 50,000 of India’s 600,000-plus villages, inhabited by the majority of the country’s 1.2bn population, as well as Mumbai’s crowded Dharavi slum, one of Asia’s largest.“All companies have established strong distribution networks and their reach goes way beyond the big or mid-tier cities; they have gone deep into rural areas …[and have] done things the hard way but it’s rewarded them,” Mr Singhal says.“To crack the Indian market takes time; if you are in a rush you are bound to fail,” he adds."
336;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-02-01T14:47:23Z;Power shift means hard times for food industry;;"British supermarket shelves say it all. With an estimated nine out of 10 Easter eggs already on special offer, food producers are in for another tough year.The European food and drink sector, renowned for its defensive qualities, outperformed the market during the economic and financial turmoil of last year. But that trend is now reversing as clouds gather over the outlook for the industry – and investors’ appetite for riskier sectors perks up.“It’s going to be a difficult year,” says Martin Deboo, analyst at Investec. “There’s relentless pressure on the top line . . . and the commodity environment is not as benign as some think.”The broad fall in commodity prices, down 11 per cent from the February peak as measured by the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s food price index, does not drop directly on to manufacturers’ bottom lines. Few pay spot prices, instead using contracts, forward buying and hedges to reduce volatility.Early indications from US food producers point to inflation remaining a “substantial headwind” this fiscal year, says Andrew Lazar, at Barclays Capital. Companies with non-calendar years are mostly anticipating inflation in high single to low double digits – or, in the case of coffee buyer SJM, “low 20 per cent range”.Shoppers in the developed world, meanwhile, remain as straitened as ever. Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket by sales, has warned on profits and other grocers have issued disappointing numbers. That points to further pressure on suppliers.Burton’s Biscuits, which supplies one-tenth of the UK market, is working on the assumption it will be asked for more discounts this year and even more in 2013. “They will be more demanding than ever on price. Anyone who thinks otherwise is frankly naive,” says Ben Clarke, chief executive.Charlie Mills, analyst at Credit Suisse, points to the split of retailers’ sales: 30 per cent gross margin and 70 per cent paid to manufacturers. “They are always going to be on the case of manufacturers as much as they can,” he says.Nor is the gloom limited to the UK. Several manufacturers reported a dent in Australian sales, where highly competitive supermarkets swept “everyone except the absolute number one brand” off the shelves, says one manufacturing executive.The US is set to have almost as much Easter chocolate on promotion as the UK, assuming similar rates to the past two years, says SymphonyIRI Group, the market researcher.As that suggests, the US balance of power over pricing is falling away from manufacturers. Modest input deflation “would challenge the industry’s ability to hold on to pricing, particularly in the event that the consumer environment remains weak”, says Mr Lazar at Barclays Capital.Americans face an additional problem from their currency. The stronger US dollar could shave top-line growth at the likes of Kraft, PepsiCo, Heinz and Sara Lee by 2-3 per cent, Bernstein Research estimates.With a few exceptions – led by Coca-Cola – Americans also suffer from less exposure to still-buoyant emerging markets than their European rivals, which now derive 40-50 per cent of sales from the developing world.In their domestic markets, US and European groups are beset by problems, including overcapacity in certain areas, debt-burdened balance sheets and competition. With consumers carting smaller baskets to the tills, bankers see it as survival of the fittest among producers.The year’s first casualty of consolidation – although, given the generous premium paid, shareholders may view it more as a lucky exit – was Robert Wiseman Dairies. The supplier of one-third of Britain’s fresh milk – an industry that struggles to break even – is being bought out by Müller, the German dairy group, for £279.5m.Bankers speculate that other (literally) bread and butter industries might also be driven into consolidation. Bread, like liquid milk, is a huge and expensive logistical business with squeezed margins; against that, regulators would be unwilling to see the competitive landscape shrink.These domestic businesses offer a microcosm of the bigger dilemma: how to sell more or higher value goods to consumers bent on spending less. “Top-line growth will increasingly have to be driven almost entirely by volume growth,” says Alan Erskine, analyst at UBS.Michael Steib, analyst at Morgan Stanley, illustrates the point with Unilever, which kicks off the sector’s reporting season on Thursday. Input inflation gobbled up 5.5 percentage points of 2011 sales at the company, manufacturer of Flora margarine and Knorr stock cubes.Since sticker prices are still up year on year and the benefits of recent cost-saving efforts continue to roll in, European companies will see fatter gross margins, Mr Steib predicts.However, he sees this being funnelled into stimulating sales growth through promotions “driven by volume pressures from poorer consumers and hard-pressed retailers”.Even if the food industry does get its cake in the form of modest input deflation, it is likely to be the retailers who eat it."
337;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Russia: Wagon Wheels’ British flavour;;"Wagon Wheels, the Great (big) British biscuits, are to roll back into Russia after an earlier attempt crashed during the country’s 1998 sovereign default.Burton’s Foods, which makes them, will be selling Wagon Wheels the way it did in the 1990s, marketing them on the “British-ness” of their taste, look and packaging. But would the company actually do better to make the flavour a bit more Russian?The track record is mixed. Some foreign food companies have succeeded in Russia by sticking closely to their original formula, as Burton’s Foods clearly intends to do.Starbucks, for instance, offers the same vanilla frappuccinos and caramel macchiatos that they do everywhere else, and in tall, venti and grande – a strategy that appears to have served it well. The company entered Russia only in 2007 and then only through a Kuwaiti franchisee but it has gone from having just 2 locations to 28. Seven new coffee shops have opened in the past month alone.On the other hand, some companies have gone a long way to adapting to local tastes. Take for instance Lay’s, the Pepsico crisp brand, which entered Russia exactly 20 years ago and has experimented with crisps flavoured with everything from caviar to mushrooms and sour cream.As Yuri Ovchinnikov, operations development and change manager at PepsiCo Russia who was working at Lay’s at the time, tells beyondbrics, the crisp maker’s original task at the start of the 1990s was to distinguish the American crisps from their Soviet cousins, called colloquially “no-name crisps” and known for their “very brown” colour and “oily and too salty” taste.Yet in the following years the company ultimately turned to a local relevance campaign, doing taste tests across the local market and coming up with flavours familiar to Russian palates.To get the best taste for “mushrooms and sour cream”, the company invited Moscow chefs to prepare the best mushroom and fried potato dishes, with the best chef winning a Lay’s contract to develop the crisps’ flavour.The company went on to launch other favourites like red caviar and pickled cucumber which continue to be sold today. Crab-flavoured crisps were originally launched as a special offer in Siberia and the Far East but after flying off the shelves during the first three months the company decided to roll them out across Russia. The flavour is now the the third best-selling in Lay’s Russia portfolio and has been exported to Thailand.So do multinational food groups need to go local? Should they follow Lay’s or Starbucks?Matt Lasov, director of research at Frontier Strategy Group who has worked with clients on adapting their products for different markets, says the best tactic is usually a hybrid approach: maintaining most aspects of the products that made it successful to begin with but experimenting with local flavours there.He gives the example of Pizza Hut in Pakistan which has adopted roughly 30 per cent of its products to local tastes and culture. The restaurant chain offers Hara Chicken and Spicy Prawn pizzas and has marketed Pizza Hut as a more upscale chain than it is perceived in America.Lasov says that striking a balance between assimilation and not changing at all is key. Speaking of the Russian market, he says: “If you go in [as a foreign company] and try to compete with purely Russian products you will fail because local companies, at least at the beginning, will be able to do it better and cheaper.“But if you go in with your product without any localisation you’ll fail again.”Related reading:

338;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Tesco steps back on carbon footprint labelling;;"Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket and an early champion of the green revolution, is to ditch its plan to emblazon all its products with a carbon footprint label because the message is too complicated.The move is a blow to the “carbon labelling” movement, a relatively recent campaign designed to encourage consumers to buy products with a low environmental impact.In 2007, Sir Terry Leahy, chief executive at the time, promised “a revolution in green consumption” and pledged to put the labels on 50,000 own-brand products.The company will now phase out the label, co-developed with the Carbon Trust, after using it on just 500 products. It is considering alternatives to replace it.In comments that caught the industry unawares, Helen Fleming, climate change director, told The Grocer magazine that Tesco was phasing out the labels because they took several months’ work to calculate and take-up among other retailers was slow.“We expected that other retailers would move quickly to do it as well, giving it critical mass, but that hasn’t happened,” she said.The supermarket group added: “While no final decision has yet been made, customers have told us that they find the labelling difficult to understand and so we are currently considering a range of options as to how we communicate what is often a complex message in a way that is easily understood.”Tesco is one of several high-profile companies to have made eye-catching green pledges in 2007, a year of global economic optimism. These are being challenged in more straitened times.David Metcalfe, chief executive of Verdantix, an analyst firm that advises companies on environmental and energy strategies, said: “What we are seeing is the end of all the hopeful climate change strategies that were highlighted in 2007, when everyone had a lot of money,” said.“I wouldn’t criticise Tesco for stopping this because no retailer anywhere in the world has found this a successful way of engaging consumers.”PepsiCo, the US-based snacks and beverages group that pioneered carbon footprint labelling on Walkers crisps in 2007, is also concerned about the low take-up but said on Monday it would continue to use its logo.“Although we have not seen the take-up we’d have liked across industry, we still support carbon labelling as a way of helping consumers and business to understand and reduce their carbon emissions,” said Martyn Seal, European director for sustainability at PepsiCo.The Carbon Trust, a UK-based consultancy that developed the carbon footprint logo together with companies including Tesco, said it was “disappointed” at the retailer’s move. But it was confident that “existing label customers and new customers will see the value of an internationally recognised carbon label backed by expert independent certification”.More than 100 companies have adopted the carbon label in 22 countries, the trust said. The annual sales value of goods carrying the label was £3bn.Other groups to have adopted the carbon footprint label include Dyson, the independent electrical goods company; Kingsmill, the bread-maker; and Morphy Richards, which makes household appliances.Tesco says it remains committed to “ambitious and stretching” targets of zero emissions by 2020.These targets take into account the carbon footprint of customers and the supply chain, which in many cases takes in farming and hefty transportation and so can be particularly intensive."

She joined the school in 1983, the first woman to receive tenure at the school and served as Yale SOM’s first female dean from 2008 to 2011.Before joining Yale SOM, Prof Oster studied for a PhD in economics at Harvard University. She specialises in competitive strategy, microeconomic theory, industrial organisation and the economics of regulation and has published two books: Modern Competitive Analysis and Strategic Management for Nonprofit Organizations.Prof Oster was recently awarded the Carolyn Shaw Bell Award by the American Economics Association’s Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. The annual award is given to a woman in the field of economics for work done in research, teaching and mentoring to improve the position of women in the profession.1. What do you enjoy most about your job?Academics offers great variety and choice. I love the fact that I can follow my own research interests rather than producing work ordered by someone else. I enjoy teaching economics and believe strongly in the ability of the field to improve management practice. I love exchanging ideas with students and colleagues and perhaps most of all love the constant growth that the academic environment allows.2. How do you deal with pressure?Like many people, I find that exercise helps reduce pressure. Ageing has also helped. I completely agree with the social science surveys that find that life gets much less stressful over the age of 50.3. Who are your business heroes?I have come to admire a number of my former students who have left the Yale School of Management and accomplished a great deal in the world of business and non-profits. Indra Nooyi, the current chief executive of PepsiCo, is a powerful leader of that organisation, bringing new ideals about managing with principles to the corporate world. Sandra Urie, another former student, runs Cambridge Associates, a major player in the world of non-profit investing. Linda Mason founded Bright Horizons, a large child care company and is now active on the board of Mercy Corps, a relief and development organisation run by Yale graduate Neal Keny-Guyer.Each of these people have combined their intelligence and education with strong leadership skills and principles and made a difference to society. For someone like me, a long-time teacher of MBA students, seeing these accomplishments makes all of the class preparation and mentoring worthwhile.4. What academic achievement are you most proud of?I was recently awarded the Carolyn Shaw Bell Award. As a lifelong feminist and a strong believer in the power of economics to improve society, this award meant a great deal to me.5. What is your biggest lesson learnt?Some years ago, a student who came to Yale from overseas remarked that he understood all of my equations but he didn’t get the jokes. And, he said, he sensed that the jokes were important. Of course, he was right. In economics teaching, few will remember our equations but a joke or a story whose punch line illustrates an economic principle lasts a lifetime.6. What is the last book you read?I have just finished Robert Trivers’ new book The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life. Trivers is a giant in the field of evolutionary biology. I also recently read and enjoyed a new novel, The Imperfectionists by Tom Rachman.7. What is your favourite business book?I very much admire Barry Nalebuff’s book Co-Opetition, a book which changed the language of strategy work.8. What would you do if you were dean for the day?I was a dean for three years and as anyone who has been a dean knows, most of what actually gets accomplished comes with the help of the faculty and takes a good deal of time. Universities are noted for their inertia. I spent much of my time connecting different parts of our community; connecting faculty to students, students and faculty to alumni; and our faculty and students to those in other parts of Yale University.9. How do you deal with male-dominated environments?I have a thick skin, a direct manner and a sense of humour. I have found all three very helpful.10. What is your plan B?I began graduate school in 1970. At that point, the opportunities for women were more limited, particularly in the business world, than they are now. Were I to have graduated more recently, I think that working in a consulting company or financial institution might have been quite attractive. As I discovered in my deanship, I enjoy active problem solving and complex management.Compiled by Charlotte Clarke"

341;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-01-22T17:11:47Z;Business urged to fill in for government;;Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, the consumer goods maker, is urging business to step into the breach left by inward-looking governments and “failed” institutions.The inability to secure agreement on issues inside and outside the European Union and under the auspices of bodies from the European Commission to the World Trade Organisation confirm “business has a role to play”.“We are not being served as businesses by having significant problems now and in the future by a lack of social cohesion,” Mr Polman told the Financial Times before the World Economic Forum in Davos. “We cannot just delegate to government and let them deal with it.”Mr Polman, whose company sells some 450m products a day, backs a unified Europe but insists that it needs to become more competitive to avoid risking a Japanese-style spiral into recession and stagnation.That means redirecting benefits from older to younger generations and removing red tape, such as the need to register trademarks in every European country, which results in costs three to five times as high as the US or Japan.As part of the rebalancing of benefits to the young, he proposes apprenticeship schemes, incentives to employers who take on younger adults and even keeping children at school longer.“Ten years of belt tightening is what Europe needs. But also getting mechanisms in place for long-term growth which also means investing in R&D [research and development], which has come down in the UK, and education,” he said.Unilever, which makes goods ranging from Persil soap powder to Flora margarine, is itself employing more apprentices. The company doubled its number of graduate places, internships, placements and apprenticeships in the UK to 102 last year, or 1.5 per cent of its UK workforce. Mr Polman said if the UK’s top 100 companies hired the equivalent of 1 per cent of their existing workforce, the ranks of young unemployed would be reduced by 80,000.Yet his own company has discovered how hard it can be to wean older generations off their retirement and healthcare benefits: its UK workers are this week out on a rolling strike in protest against its decision to close its final salary pension scheme.That move has prompted unions to complain that “Unilever’s customers, shareholders and other stakeholders could be forgiven for thinking that the company cares less for its employees and its corporate reputation than it does for one of its brands of soap powder or deodorant.”The role for business contrasts with Mr Polman’s gloomy prognosis of government.“The world has become interdependent yet governments are shrinking and becoming more nationalistic,” he argued.Mr Polman will be promoting sustainability at Davos, or “decoupling growth from the environment”.The company has stuck its own colours to the mast, supporting 1m smallholders, who in turn ensure Unilever’s security of supply, and targeting another 500,000 by 2020. They are also setting pledges on sustainably sourced raw materials.Other multinationals, including Nestlé and PepsiCo are taking similar steps and will in turn, Mr Polman hopes, prompt politicians to take up the baton.“This says: ‘While you guys are debating or looking to your own policies we are more concerned about the long-term effects on planet earth’, so we move forward and hope that gives encouragement to politicians to move a little bit faster.”But he also advised governments to look beyond regional woes, noting that in 25 years more than 85 per cent of the population would be living outside Europe and the US.“If Europe does not organise itself more efficiently then it’s going to be even more left behind,” he said.
342;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Food groups angry at obesity campaign;Link to disease and amputation in marketing drive deemed excessive;Graphic marketing campaigns intended to frighten people about obesity are drawing fire from US beverage and restaurant groups that argue health officials have gone too far by linking their products to disease and amputation.In New York, the largest city in the US, almost 23 per cent of adults are obese. Seeking to combat the problem, the city’s health department has launched a $500,000 campaign encouraging New Yorkers to eat and drink less.“It is normal for people to be unhealthily overweight in this country,” said Thomas Farley, New York health commissioner. “Humans weren’t always like that.”In one of the ads, which appear in subways, a boy with an amputated leg is pictured behind a diagram displaying the growing size of soda portions. Mr Farley said New York hospitals perform thousands of obesity-related amputations each year.“These drinks are important contributors to the obesity problem,” Mr Farley said. “The health consequences are severe. The simplest message is to switch out these sugary drinks and switch to another.”Similar campaigns have been launched in cities such as Chicago and Seattle and in states such as Georgia and Hawaii.The American Beverage Association, which represents companies including PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, said the campaigns were “stomach-turning” and “misleading propaganda”.“It’s absurd to say that drinking a soda will cause these really extreme health conditions,” said Chris Gindlesperger of the ABA. “Our companies are out there providing real help for consumers with more low- and no-calorie beverages.”Mr Gindlesperger argued that states and cities would be better off using the stimulus money that is funding the campaigns to build parks and bike paths.Joy Dubost, director of nutrition and healthy living at the National Restaurant Association, expressed support for the goal the ads are trying to accomplish but said member companies have been trying to provide more healthy offerings and calorie information.Even some obesity groups have said the campaigns have gone too far.Last year, the Obesity Action Coalition criticised the Georgia Children’s Health Alliance for its campaign to combat obesity and diabetes among children. The group said the ads “promote the negative stigma, weight bias and bullying often associated with obesity and childhood obesity”. Most of the people it surveyed, it said, found them hurtful and offensive.Drug companies have also been pushing the limits lately to market medicines for diseases such as diabetes, which is closely linked with obesity.Last week, Paula Deen, the chef, acknowledged she had type 2 diabetes as Novo Nordisk, the drug manufacturer, hired her to be its new spokesman.Health advocates said someone cooking fried foods with plenty of butter is not a good image for a company trying to treat people who require healthy diets.“The campaign is quite shocking,” said Marion Nestlé, a public health and nutrition professor at New York University. “She’s part of the problem, not part of the solution.”Ms Nestlé acknowledged that all the attention surrounding obesity could be making a difference.The US Centers for Disease Control released a study last week showing that obesity rates in the US have levelled off in the past 12 years after decades of climbing steadily. However, the rates remain high, with more than a third of adults and almost 17 per cent of children obese.The broader problem was the increasing “ubiquity of food”, said Mr Farley. “Food is everywhere you turn,” he said. “It’s in pharmacies, in hardware stores.”New CDC data were no cause for celebration, he added. “Although there has been some encouraging data on obesity, it is still an epidemic. It’s plateauing at an extraordinarily high level.”
343;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-01-20T18:49:23Z;Orange juice prices squeezed higher;;The price of orange juice rose by its maximum daily limit on Friday after a destructive citrus disease was found in Texas earlier this week for the first time.The Texas Department of Agriculture and other US authorities confirmed midweek the first detection in the southern state of citrus “greening”, a destructive bacterial disease transmitted by an insect called the citrus psyllid. Texas is the third-largest orange producer in the US, after Florida and California.Investors in orange juice futures have had a volatile ride over the past few weeks due to the discovery of traces of fungicide carbendazim – which is banned in the US – in orange juice imported from Brazil. The fungicide is commonly used in Brazil, which supplies the US with about 15 per cent of the orange juice consumed each year. Weather concerns also played a role on price volatility.“It has been a stream of bullish news for the orange juice market,” said Keith Flury, analyst at Rabobank.On Friday, orange juice futures rose by the daily limit of 10 cents, or 5 per cent, to $2.1065 a pound on the ICE Futures US exchange at midday in New York. The price of the commodity is up 25 per cent this year, having hit a 34-year high of $2.1275 a pound earlier this month.The price volatility has brought renewed attention to the commodity, regarded as a niche market due to its notional turnover of about $75m a day. The orange juice price is watched by beverage groups including PepsiCo, which owns the Tropicana brand, and Coca-Cola, which sells Minute Maid and Simply juices.The supply concerns come as orange juice stocks left from the previous season are sharply lower than normal, leaving the market without a cushion if supply fails to meet expectations. Inventories at the end of September 2011 totalled 290,000 tonnes, down 28 per cent from the previous year, according to the US department of agriculture.“With the low stocks, everything gets amplified,” added Mr Flury.Greening has caused serious economic damage to citrus industries in Florida – where it was found for the first time in the US in 1998 – as well as Africa, Asia and South America. It causes growth deficiencies, tree decline and causes the fruit to drop off before ripening.Todd Staples, agriculture commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, said in a statement they were “implementing emergency precautions to mitigate the spread”.Meanwhile, the US Food and Drug Administration has been holding imported orange juice at point of entry into the US for testing for carbendazim since January 4. The FDA on Friday said 19 of the 45 import samples were negative of the fungicide, while the remaining 26 samples were awaiting analysis.
344;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-01-16T18:15:23Z;US groups feel the pinch of dollar strength;;US companies are beginning to feel the pinch of steady gains in the dollar as currency losses show up in fourth-quarter earnings and guidance reports, threatening a strong start to 2012 on Wall Street.Most major currencies fell against the haven asset of the dollar in 2011 and the declines have continued this year. That could be bad news for S&P 500 companies as diverse as McDonald’s and General Electric, which derived the majority of their 2010 revenue from foreign sales.As the debt crisis in Europe worsened, global investors favoured the perceived safety of the US dollar. The euro slid about 14 per cent after hitting a high in May and last week touched 16-month low below $1.27.Europe accounts for about 14 per cent of all overseas sales for S&P 500 companies, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. “If the dollar continues to gather strength, it will start hurting the profitability of US companies,” said Michael Mullaney, who manages $9.5bn at Fiduciary Trust. “While a stronger dollar may reward investors in the short term, ultimately earnings may have to be adjusted.”Adjustments have already started. As fourth-quarter earnings season gets under way, Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at Sanford Bernstein, is forecasting S&P 500 earnings per share of $23.50 – 50 cents short of the consensus.“We don’t believe recent dollar strength and weaker growth in international markets has been fully reflected in analyst estimates,” Mr Zlotnikov said.He says that if the dollar remains at its present levels, it would wipe more than 4 per cent off international revenues for S&P groups in each of the first three quarters of 2012.In Brazil and India – where local currencies fell 12 per cent and 13.6 per cent respectively against the US currency in the six months ending on Friday – dollar revenues may fall more than 10 per cent this year.Dollar strength is a particular problem for retailers and consumer discretionary companies, which sell products around the world in local currencies.Coca-Cola’s shares have seen a negative correlation of 0.93 with the strength of the dollar in the past three years, according to Kaumil Gajrawala, analyst at UBS. Last week, he removed his “buy” recommendation on the company and cut his 2012 earnings forecast by 4.2 per cent to $4.09. Coca-Cola shares are down 4.3 per cent this year to $66.99.Mr Gajrawala also cut forecasts for PepsiCo while Ali Dibadj at Sanford Bernstein sees currency costs taking 2.2 per cent out of fourth-quarter earnings at Avon Products and 3.7 per cent at Colgate-Palmolive. PepsiCo is down 3 per cent to $64.40 while Avon is up 0.3 per cent to $17.52 in the year to date.But the strong dollar is not just an issue for retailers. Technology stocks are the most dependent on non-US revenue in the S&P 500, with foreign sales accounting for 56 per cent of the sector’s revenue in 2010 compared to 45 per cent for the whole index.Tech supply chains tend to be priced in dollars, giving some protection to component producers such as semiconductor manufacturers. But that makes end-product manufacturers even more vulnerable.“Corporate IT budgets are fixed, so if the strong dollar erodes the purchasing power of foreign companies, they may simply purchase less product,” said Ashok Kumar, tech analyst at Rodman and Renshaw, who added that the dollar could reduce earnings at Hewlett-Packard and Dell by up to 10 per cent if it does not fall in 2012.Apple, however, may be an exception. “If the dollar stays strong, I would favour consumer-facing companies and strong brands,” says Mr Kumar. “Unlike corporate budgets, consumer bud- gets are not set in stone.”As the earnings season gets under way, are hedge funds shorting companies that are most exposed to foreign sales? Probably not, said Mr Zlotnikov. “An analyst has no way of knowing what currency hedges are in place until the company reveals results. I can assume that hedges will net out across sectors or indices but a company analyst or stock picker cannot.”The negative impact on foreign sales has to be weighed against the benefit of a strong dollar to importers or to US companies with large cost bases abroad, analysts said. Alcoa booked $51m in fourth-quarter income from lower local currency-denominated costs compared with the third quarter. Without that, its $239m loss for the quarter would have looked worse. Alcoa is trading at $9.80, up 13 per cent in the past two weeks.“Alcoa has significant upstream facilities in Australia, Canada and Brazil, and dollar strength has had a meaningful impact on its spending,” said Tony Rizzuto, at Dahlman Rose.Another set of analysts dismiss currency movements as the accounting equivalent of “white noise”. Last week Chevron issued a fourth-quarter profit warning, with foreign currency gains that contributed $450m to third-quarter earnings expected to be negative in fourth-quarter figures. Chevron shares are off 0.3 per cent this year to $106.09.“For analysts, these are phantom numbers,” said Fadel Gheit, an oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer. “Companies like Chevron are required by law to recognise the dollar value of their foreign assets every quarter but those assets are illiquid: Chevron is not going to sell its Australian refineries but fluctuations in their value can have an outsize effect on accounts.”For those paying attention to the dollar, the threat is to individual company earnings rather than the momentum of the S&P 500, which is enjoying a strong start to the year.A strong dollar “will not devastate the index”, said Howard Silverblatt, at S&P Capital IQ. “But when it comes to stocks, we work on pennies. They do matter.”
345;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Mouse in can claim riles PepsiCo;;A legal battle between PepsiCo and an Illinois man who claims to have found a mouse inside a can of Mountain Dew has led to a fresh round of health concerns about the sparkling green beverage.The dispute started in 2008 when Ronald Ball filed a complaint claiming that he had found a rodent in the can of one of PepsiCo’s most popular soft drink brands. Mr Ball then became violently ill and vomited before pouring the can’s contents into a cup and then sending it PepsiCo, according to the complaint.PepsiCo, which maintains that the allegations have no merit, appears to have made matters worse with its response.The company hired Lawrence McGill, a veterinary pathologist, to examine the mouse and determine if it could have really snuck into the Mountain Dew can during the bottling process. Mr McGill found that the mouse was born after the soda was already bottled and that if it had been submerged in the Dew for the 74 days between its bottling and its opening, the beverage’s acidity would have turned the mouse into jelly.“If a mouse is submerged in a fluid with the acidity of Mountain Dew, after four to seven days in the fluid, the mouse will have no calcium in its bones and bony structures, the mouse’s abdominal structure will rupture and its cranial cavity (head) is also likely to rupture,” according to Mr McGill’s affidavit.PepsiCo’s response went viral this week, when the company was supposed to file a new answer to the latest version of the complaint.Health bloggers and drinkers of Mountain Dew expressed concern that the highly caffeinated soft drink has the power to turn a mouse into mush. Men’s Fitness, the health magazine, called the case “yet another reason to think twice when you’re craving a can of sugary, neon green Mountain Dew” and asked, “Imagine what on earth it would do to your insides?”Mountain Dew, which is popular among people who play video games because its caffeine content keeps them alert, has drawn criticism in the past for being unhealthy.In 2009, dentists in Kentucky said that addiction to Mountain Dew was leading to rotten teeth among children and labelled the predicament “Mountain Dew mouth”. Last month, a report in Environmental Health News found that the level of brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, in Mountain Dew gave the drink flame retardant properties.However, PepsiCo insists the product is safe. “We stand behind the quality and safety of our products,” said Andrea Foote, a spokeswoman. “Mountain Dew, which is one of our most popular soft drinks, has been safely enjoyed by consumers for generations. The pH level in Mountain Dew is safe, and similar to a variety of other safe food and beverage products.”According to the complaint, Mr Ball is seeking $75,000 in damages for the “permanent pain and mental anguish” he suffered from the incident.
346;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-01-12T15:47:13Z;Web chat: Raquel Castaño;;Welcome to the Financial Times live web chat with Raquel Castaño who features in our Ten Questions Q&A.Prof Castaño, director of the master in marketing programme and the research chair: Glocalization: Understanding the Latin American Consumer at Egade Business School, Tecnológico de Monterrey, México, will answer your questions on Thursday 12th January, between 15.00-16.00 GMT.Post your questions to ask@ft.com and they will be answered on the day on this page.——————————————————————————What made you choose to study and teach at Egade?Raquel: Thanks for the question! While I was working in the industry, I was also a part time professor at Tecnologico de Monterrey which is the holding institution of Egade Business School and I was given the opportunity to start an MBA. While I was a student of the Egade MBA programme, I worked as a brand and group manager for GAMESA, a leading Mexican consumer product company, now part of Pepsico Group. I valued the way I could apply concepts and theories from the courses to develop solutions for the specific marketing challenges I confronted daily at work - a really hands on approach with the guidance of outstanding faculty.Based on that experience, I decided to move on and specialise by pursuing a master in marketing programme also at Egade. I did so because I found that it covers the wide breadth of topics that fall under the marketing discipline and that were part of my everyday activities. Later, I became a full time professor for the marketing programmes at the institution and eventually decided to study for a PhD. The institution supported my decision and helped me join Tulane´s doctoral marketing programme.How would you define the Latin American consumer?Raquel: Great question. I would say that to define Latin American consumers we need first to recognise that the region is not one single entity that can be defined as a whole, but rather an amalgam of differences and similarities. Some similarities can be related to socio-cultural and demographic factors that need to be taken into consideration when developing marketing strategies in the region. I will refer to several examples:a) The new middle class segments. These segments of consumers are becoming increasingly strong economic forces in Latin America. There is an opportunity to market low-cost options of products and services and at the same time, high-quality products that satisfy their needs adequately. A recent article published in Harvard Business Review by Eyring, Johnson and Nair refers to targeting this middle class. These authors state that this group of consumers is characterised by unmet needs or needs that are being met poorly by existing low-end goods and they cannot afford even the cheapest of the high end options. Upgrading solutions and making them affordable and accessible are key factors for these important consumer segments.b) Customer preference and loyalty to local brands is a major challenge when entering the Latin America market. Again, developing ways to understand and better suit people´s needs are key factors to succeed in these consumer markets.c) Increasing consumer concern on sustainability. Companies are recognising that social and environmental concerns should be part of the company´s core values and strategies for long-term profitability in this region. However, consumers need to understand the practical and tangible benefits associated with these options.In sum, understanding Latin American consumers represent an exciting opportunity for global companies to apply their market understanding and their global market leadership by demonstrating flexibility and willingness to adapt their strategy.What advice would you give to someone interested in becoming a marketing research manager / brand manager?Raquel: Marketing research managers and brand managers must have solid analytical skills - when obtaining and analysing market information you must look beyond the numbers to discover insights and identify opportunities. There is no best research method as it depends on the research objective.However, in my experience a combination of research methods can often prove very useful. For example, I am currently doing consumer behavior research with a colleague at the University of Southern California using FMRI (brain imaging analysis) as well as using traditional research methods.Brand managers have the challenge of creating meaning and value for consumers and leveraging brands to improve long term financial performance. They should understand social media as it has changed the way consumers obtain information about products and services. Marketing managers should be trained to anticipate the future and approach problems in a holistic way, with the best new resources at hand and the skills to take advantage of them.
347;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-01-10T19:31:29Z;Orange juice at 34-year high on fungicide fears;;The price of orange juice futures contracts hit a 34-year high on Tuesday after the main US food safety regulator said it would block imports containing a fungicide commonly used in Brazil, the leading producer of the citrus fruit.The Food and Drug Administration’s announcement sent traders scrambling to prepare for the possibility of lower inventories in the middle of the US winter, when the New York futures market is most at risk of a harsh freeze in Florida’s orange groves.Frozen concentrated orange juice for January delivery rose 9.7 per cent to $2.1275 a pound on the ICE Futures US exchange, the highest since November 1977 and a record nominal closing price. It has risen 25.9 per cent so far this year. The more heavily traded March and May futures gained by the exchange limit of 20 cents.The rise brought renewed attention to the tiny orange juice market, which, along with pork bellies, briefly entered public consciousness in the 1983 film Trading Places but is today an obscure corner of the futures world, with a notional daily turnover of just $75m.The contract has languished as consumers turned to other drinks. US consumption of orange juice has fallen by nearly a quarter in the past decade, according to the US Department of Agriculture.PepsiCo, which owns the Tropicana brand, and Coca-Cola, which sells Minute Maid and Simply juices, account for 62 per cent of the orange juice sold at US supermarkets, according to Bernstein Research.The futures market price rise could drive retail prices of orange juice higher, said Judith Ganes Chase, a soft commodities consultant, but she added that the market reaction was overdone.Futures began rallying last week as traders puzzled over the impact of the season’s first freeze in Florida, but the damage to crops was minimal.On Monday, the FDA said an unnamed juice company had detected low levels of carbendazim, a fungicide banned in US oranges, in its own and competitors’ juice. The fungicide was also found in concentrate from Brazil, the source of about 60 per cent of the world’s orange juice.“FDA is also sampling import shipments of orange juice and will deny entry to shipments that test positive for carbendazim,” the FDA said. The test results were below levels that raise safety concerns.“They could ban [all] imports from Brazil. That would take the whole Brazilian crop out of the market. It could be huge,” said Avery Putter, a broker with Pine Point Commodities on the ICE floor.In response to the sudden price moves, the exchange cancelled a scheduled 27 per cent reduction in the margin deposit needed to trade orange juice and instead almost doubled it.Christian Lohbauer, head of the Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Exporters, said it was still unclear whether the US would accept Brazilian orange juice that is currently in the process of being imported. He added that the most likely outcome was that Brazilian producers would have to change the type of fungicide they use for the US orange juice market. “I doubt they will change their minds, so they will ask us to stop using it.”He said it was unlikely the US would simply ban Brazilian orange juice imports: “After all, the US needs our juice.”Coca-Cola would not confirm or deny whether it had reported traces of carbendazim to the FDA. The company sources most of its juice oranges from Florida but some come from Brazil, the Atlanta-based company said.“We are gathering facts so that we can understand the situation, and clearly that includes testing,” it said. “But as the FDA has said, Brazilian orange juice is safe. This is an issue that impacts many in the industry.”When reached for a comment, a Tropicana spokesperson said: “Tropicana juice is safe and nutritious, and we’re proud to offer high-quality, great-tasting products. As one of the world’s most trusted consumer brands, we take this matter seriously and will follow the FDA’s guidance.”
348;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2012-01-06T23:27:42Z;Coke and Nestlé end parts of iced tea venture;;Coca-Cola and Nestlé, two of the world’s largest consumer goods companies, ended their joint venture to sell iced tea in the US and Asia on Friday, as Coke announced plans to launch a rival tea brand.The decision marks a significant scaling back of their long-running Beverage Partners Worldwide joint venture, although they will continue working together in Europe and Canada and Coke will maintain a licence agreement for Nestea in Taiwan and Hong Kong.“Both partners believe a concentrated focus on Europe and Canada will accelerate the growth and bolster the market presence of BPW where the joint venture is most effective,” the companies said in a statement.The ready-to-drink still beverage market has been growing quickly in the US, but Nestea has struggled to compete with Lipton, a tea brand controlled by PepsiCo. John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, said that Nestlé had become unhappy with Nestea’s weak performance with Coke, and that Coke was seeking stronger tea brands to boost sales.According to Beverage Digest data, 247m cases of Lipton were sold in the US in 2010, compared with just 74m cases of Nestea. In 2000, Nestea sales volume in the US was greater than 100m cases.The BPW joint venture operates in more than 60 countries and is expected to be phased out in most places by the end of 2012. BPW was started in 2001 after the companies had operated together for 10 years in a venture called Coca-Cola and Nestlé Refreshments.In a letter to Coke employees and bottlers, Brian Wynne, head of still beverages, said Coke will launch a new line of its Fuze tea products and will continue to focus on its Honest Tea and Gold Peak brands.“The majority of growth in the refreshment space is coming from brands that offer dual tea and juice drink products, and new Fuze tea and juice drinks are perfectly positioned to address this consumer trend,” Mr Wynne said.Non-carbonated beverages have been an important source of growth for Coke, as demand for sparkling beverages has slowed in the US.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo, noted last month that liquid tea was picking up the slack for the company, with sales up nearly 9 per cent year on year, driven by 25.5 per cent growth for Gold Peak.Stephen Powers, analyst at Bernstein Research, said: “Narrowing the scope of its Nestea JV over time theoretically frees Coke up to independently pursue other tea initiatives in much of the world, whether organically or through M&A.” Industry bankers have said that Coke has expressed interest in acquiring brands such as Arizona Iced Tea, a leader in the category, and Hansen Natural.In the near term, Mr Powers noted, phasing out the Nestlé partnership could be a hurdle as the Coke looks to replace Nestea with Fuze products.Additional reporting by Louise Lucas in London
349;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-12-29T19:26:24Z;Alibaba hires lobbyist amid Yahoo bid talk;;Alibaba Group has hired Duberstein Group, the Washington lobbying company, in the latest sign that the Chinese internet group is considering a bid for the whole of Yahoo, if talks to buy back the US rival’s Asian assets fall through.Japan’s Softbank, which has a 30 per cent stake in Alibaba and jointly owns Yahoo Japan, is also named in a US congressional filing made by Duberstein earlier this month.Alibaba and Softbank, Yahoo’s partners in Asia, offered in October to buy back the US company’s 40 per cent in Alibaba and 35 per cent in Yahoo Japan. The troubled internet company’s investments in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan are considered to be by far its most valuable assets, accounting for the bulk of the company’s $20bn valuation.Recent discussions have centred on Yahoo retaining 15 per cent of Alibaba to keep a stake in any future gains in China, while selling its remaining holdings.However, Jack Ma, Alibaba’s founder, has repeatedly made it clear that he is interested in buying the whole of the US company. Under a 2005 agreement with Yahoo, he has a right of first refusal on any Yahoo acquisition.Hiring a US lobbying firm could help Alibaba soften any potential political opposition to a Chinese company buying a US internet asset. Chinese technology companies, such as Huawei, the telecoms equipment maker, have had attempts to buy US companies blocked in the past.US officials are likely to be concerned by the fact that Chinese internet companies co-operate with China’s strict online censorship regime. Google moved its internet search operations out of China in 2010 following disagreements over censorship.The Duberstein Group is headed by Kenneth Duberstein, who was White House chief of staff under Ronald Reagan. The company also acts for Goldman Sachs, BP America and PepsiCo.This is the first time that Alibaba has registered to lobby the US government. Under US law, lobbying firms are required to make public disclosure within 45 days of certain events, such as making contact with public officials. The registration is effective from December 1, but lobbying work is likely to have begun earlier in the autumn.Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, a New York-based law firm that specialises in mergers and acquisitions, was listed as an intermediary for Alibaba. It has been involved in deals for clients such as AT&T, Kraft and JPMorgan Chase.Alibaba declined to comment. Duberstein could not be immediately reached for comment.Shares in Alibaba, which have lost more than 40 per cent of their value over the past year, were largely unchanged at HK$8.03 on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Yahoo shares rose 1.7 per cent to $16.05 in early trading on Nasdaq.

351;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-12-14T05:01:59Z;Sponsors strike fresh deals with revived NBA;;The end of the National Basketball Association labour dispute has triggered a wave of sponsorship deals that highlights the role corporations play in supporting athletic leagues, and the blurring lines between sports and advertising.On Wednesday, the NBA will announce that its official wireless sponsor is set to become Sprint, replacing its multiyear deal with T-Mobile USA, the Deutsche Telekom unit whose takeover by AT&T is mired in regulatory review.The NBA earlier in the week signed long-term sponsorship deals with Anheuser-Busch InBev’s flagship Budweiser brand, PepsiCo’s sports drink maker Gatorade, and clothing manufacturer Under Armor. Those companies will have their logos emblazoned across NBA arenas and on television broadcasts of games, and will sponsor other special events and products.“Sports sponsorships allow brands to cut through the clutter,” said Patrick Walsh, professor of sports marketing at the Indiana University at Bloomington. “If the brand is placed within the event, you can’t fast-forward through it, you can’t ignore it.”Such deals come at a steep cost. Sprint is reported to be paying the NBA $45m for a four year-deal, one of the largest basketball sponsorships yet, according to Sports Business Journal. Including media commitments and other contractual requirements, the value of the agreement approaches $250m.None of the official deal terms were released but Mark Tatum, head of global marketing partnerships for the NBA, said sponsorships represented a “significant portion” of the NBA’s annual $4bn in revenues. “Our fan is a very attractive consumer to these companies,” said Mr Tatum. “It allows them to differentiate themselves in very competitive industries.”The NBA resolved its protracted labour dispute last month. A shortened season will begin on Christmas day.Sprint also recently renewed its deal to serve as chief sponsor for Nascar, the largest auto racing league in the US. “We see the Nascar demographic as the proverbial big tent, attracting all American consumers,” said Steve Gaffney, vice-president of corporate marketing for Sprint. “There might be some predisposed notion about what the Nascar demographic is, but we’ve found them to be very good customers.”Steve Phelps, Nascar chief marketing officer, said sponsorships provided an important revenue stream to the racing league and that part of the league’s emphasis on its “next generation fan” was new partnerships with digital sponsors such as Sprint, which has designed a smartphone application where users can follow racers. Sprint will also make an NBA app available to its customers.Individual athletes are also more visible pitchmen for big brands today, with basketball and football stars helping to sell everything from insurance to underwear. “You’re going to continue to see athletes endorse products,” said Mr Walsh. “If they’re using a company’s products, consumers assume it must be good.”But in the aftermath of Tiger Woods’ public meltdown, brands are becoming more selective in who they choose as ambassadors. “Corporations are being much more careful with the athletes they choose to endorse products,” said Mr Walsh. “They don’t want to see the negative association transferred back to their products.”
352;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-12-13T18:53:58Z;PepsiCo to return focus to ‘indulgent’ brands;;PepsiCo, the US drinks and snacks company, has signalled that it will renew its focus on its core “indulgent” brands. The move marks a shift in strategy after mounting criticism from investors that it had invested too much in less profitable health products.“We cannot forget about what I call the indulgent core businesses,” said Albert Carey, chief executive of PepsiCo Americas Beverages. “If you’re going to do the healthy, you have to do the core, because we still have a very strong business in the core.”Mr Carey, who until September was head of PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay North America business, pointed to research showing that about 10 per cent of US consumers avoid unhealthy snacks at all times, while about 25 per cent are “conflicted” and try to eat healthy but sometimes indulge, and 65 per cent care mostly about taste and convenience. He said that in the beverage industry the numbers are similar, with about half of consumers primarily wanting taste and convenience.“You can’t just try to promote and develop healthy brands alone,” Mr Carey, speaking at a Beverage Digest conference this week, said. “You have to also get behind the indulgent brands.”Mr Carey pointed to Frito-Lay “bar food” products such as taco flavoured Doritos and hot wing flavoured Ruffles, which have been flying off shelves at retailers, as evidence that the company cannot lose focus on its “fun for you” products.Investors have urged PepsiCo to refocus on its core brands after it lowered its earnings outlook earlier this year and its namesake cola brand fell behind Diet Coke. The company is expected to announce a multiyear plan to revitalise the business early next year and analysts from Bernstein Research estimate that PepsiCo could invest as much as $400m to support its beverage brands in North America in 2012.Mr Carey said he was optimistic that the core carbonated soft drinks brands would show improvement next year and said that developing those brands would be his top priority.Bill Pecoriello, chief executive of Consumer Edge Research, said that Pepsi lost market share because of a lack of investment and marketing and that the “magnitude and effectiveness” of its new investment will determine if the company regains the confidence of Wall Street.Other analysts said they were pleased with the tone of Mr Carey’s remarks about carbonated soft drinks and expressed hope that the sentiment was shared by Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive.“I am absolutely proud of selling [carbonated soft drinks],” Mr Carey said. “I don’t think we should demonise these products.”
353;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-12-05T15:39:53Z;Kraft names new leaders after split;;Kraft, the US food and snacks group, said on Monday that Irene Rosenfeld, its chief executive, would stay on to lead the global snacks business that will be formed when the company splits later next year.The announcement comes four months after Kraft surprised investors with news that it would divide the $48bn business, creating a global snacks company and a North American grocery company.The future of Ms Rosenfeld, who took over at Kraft in 2006, was in question after the split because it is unusual for a chief executive of a parent company to remain at the helm of a smaller business after a spin-off. The global snacks business had about $31bn in revenues last year while the grocery unit, which will be called Kraft, generated about $17bn.“Irene was the obvious choice to lead the global snacks company,” Mark Ketchum, lead director of Kraft’s board, said. “As a result of her bold vision, courage to transform Kraft Foods’ portfolio and investment in core brands and high-growth developing markets, we are now able to launch two formidable world-class companies.”Ms Rosenfeld’s counterpart at the grocery business will be Tony Vernon, who has led Kraft’s North American business since joining the company in 2009 after two decades at Johnson & Johnson.Kraft also said that John Cahill, a partner at Ripplewood Holdings, a private equity firm, would join next month as executive chairman to help with the transition. Mr Cahill, who will eventually become a non-executive chairman of the grocery business, worked with Ms Rosenfeld at PepsiCo and was chief executive of Pepsi Bottling Group after its spin-off in 1999.Analysts said that the leadership of the new companies signals that both could be acquisitive after the split is complete.Alexia Howard, of Bernstein Research, said Mr Vernon had been pushing Kraft to be “edgier” and more entrepreneurial and that as a standalone company the grocery business will have more opportunity to seek bolt-on acquisitions of small, fast-growing regional brands.Meanwhile, she said Ms Rosenfeld, who aggressively pursued the acquisition of Cadbury, could have her sights on PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay, which she led from 2004 to 2006.“There are some mechanisms where the global snacking business could get together with Frito-Lay,” Ms Howard said. “If Kraft gets more than expected from the Cadbury combination, it could repeat that with the salty snacks business that Frito Lay has.”Some investors have been pushing for PepsiCo to follow the Kraft model and separate its beverage and snacks businesses, but so far Indra Nooyi, its chief executive, has downplayed the idea.Kraft said that its existing leadership team would remain in place until the split is finalised at the end of 2012. Shares of Kraft were flat in midday trading in New York.
354;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;Tata can take a long view on succession;It would be wrong to slate Mistry’s appointment for not being revolutionary;The pun proved irresistible. “Mystery Ends, Mistry Begins”, ran the headline in India’s Economic Times on the appointment last week of Cyrus Mistry to succeed Ratan Tata at the head of the eponymous tea-to-steel holding company. If the succession was a mystery, it looked to have a pretty feeble final twist.When, in August 2010, Tata Sons said it would set up a special committee to nominate a replacement for the founder’s great-grandson, it stirred up enormous speculation. Global consultancies that make money advising on governance shake-ups opined that a governance shake-up was overdue at India’s “promoter companies”, which often exercise dynastic control over a network of businesses. Professional managers ventured that only professional managers could press home the advantage India’s family-dominated businesses had over state-owned Chinese rivals.Ratan Tata himself made clear his successor would not have to be a relative, a Parsee (the minority community from which all Tata heads have come), or even an Indian. Prominent expatriate executives such as PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi and Citigroup’s Vikram Pandit were mentioned as possible replacements. Carlos Ghosn was cited as an outsider who had bridged a similar cultural gap to run Japan’s Nissan.After this excitement, Mr Mistry’s appointment was deflating. A Parsee and a scion of Tata’s largest individual shareholder, he joined Tata Sons’ board in 2006. He was trusted sufficiently that he sat – Dick Cheney-style – on the selection committee, until the other members turned their searchlights inward. He is not a Tata – but his sister is married to Ratan’s half-brother. Virtually the only radical elements are his Irish citizenship (his reclusive father is married to an Irishwoman) and his age: at 43, he could hold the chairmanship from December 2012 – the official handover date – for three decades.So, hardly a revolution. But on reflection, I don’t think that is what 140-year-old Tata Sons, or even India, really needed.Tata is big, complex and international. At a stroke last week, Mr Mistry became the most important Indian that most of its non-Indian employees (from Tetley Tea to the old Corus steel plants) had never heard of. He will face management challenges, no doubt. But leadership experts counsel against the appointment of outsiders, unless the company they join is underperforming. Thanks to Ratan Tata’s untangling of internal fiefs over the past 20 years, the Tata empire is doing well.The structure is still idiosyncratic. Tata’s chairman exercises moral suasion, mainly through minority stakes, over 100 Tata companies, run by professional managers and independent boards. As Ajay Bhalla of Cass Business School puts it, he has to be a good steward, rather than a hands-on manager, “and stewardship is implemented through connection with various stakeholders”. One elder statesman of Indian business told me last week: “Cyrus is a good choice, since he is youngish, will have a long innings, is a known quantity, is highly respected and is admired by Tata Sons’ directors.” In other words, he has enough inside knowledge to build on the group’s legacy.Don’t underestimate the importance of that long view. When Tata bought Jaguar Land Rover in 2008, pundits claimed it had overpaid for the high-end carmaker. But if you work on a 30-year timescale, your assumption of what constitutes good value changes. According to Lord Bhattacharyya, a member of the Tata succession panel, Mr Mistry will help Tata “evolve in a manner that’s not destructive. It’s easy to get some short-term gains and kudos, but he has to maintain the long-term aspects and culture of the company”.His appointment will not send the hoped-for jolt through Indian corporate governance. The succession process has ended roughly where it started: in Bombay House, Tata’s Mumbai headquarters. Some stick-in-the-muds at the apex of corporate India could take the outcome as an invitation not to look far when choosing their successors.But before slating it as retrograde, compare the successful evolution of Tata with near-disasters at western companies, wrecked by overpaid professional managers fixated on short-term value. The real mystery is that so few non-Indian companies have sought to borrow from the virtues of Tata’s long-termist model, not the other way round.andrew.hill@ft.com
355;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-25T17:32:49Z;Tata Group’s new Mistry man;;“Who is Cyrus Mistry?”This was the question on people’s minds in India on Wednesday when Tata Group announced that the 43-year-old son of a reclusive billionaire had been picked to succeed Ratan Tata, the revered chairman of the salt-to-steel conglomerate.Mr Mistry, son of Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry, Tata Group’s largest individual shareholder with an 18.4 per cent stake, was not expected to become the new Ratan Tata.The low-profile executive, who was born in Mumbai but has Irish citizenship, has had only limited global expertise running the family’s construction-to-water purifiers group Shapoorji Pallonji.Since he took the place of his octogenarian father at Tata’s holding company six years ago, he has won the respect of the group’s elders, insiders say. But the fact that he was on the five-member committee set up 15 months ago to select Mr Tata’s successor clearly suggested that he was not a potential contender at that time.Indra Nooyi, the Indian-born chief executive of PepsiCo, Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of Renault-Nissan, and Arun Sarin, the former head of Vodafone, were just a few names from a long list of illustrious executives touted by Indian pundits as the ideal candidates to take over Mr Tata’s powerful role.However, many Indian industrialists following the high-profile succession saga had thought that in the end family ties would prevail at a traditional company such as the Tata Group, and Noel Tata would step in to fill his half-brother’s shoes.The industrialists were right – family-ties did prevail – they simply got the wrong family member. Mr Mistry’s sister is married to Noel Tata.Deepak Parekh, whose HDFC Bank has often lent the Mistry family funds and has known them personally for more than 25 years, describes Mr Mistry as a man with his head firmly on his shoulders who is very hands on. “I saw him grow … He’s a problem solver … very clever,” he says.“Cyrus is familiar with the company’s global strategy and over the course of the next year Ratan will have enough time to groom him for the big job,” adds Mr Parekh. “More importantly, you need to keep in mind that he is the biggest shareholder so it’s fair for him to be in charge.”Others close to Mr Mistry describe the 43-year-old executive as low key but stressed his educational qualifications and ability to operate comfortably in Indian and western environments. He is also described as “meticulous” and “workaholic” by people close to the Mistrys.The fact that he also comes from Mumbai’s tightly-knit Parsee community and the Tata family – like Mr Tata and the previous Tata Group chairmen – makes him a safe pair of hands.Whether he will be able to make the jump from running a big Indian company to commandeering a 140-year-old global conglomerate, which controls 100 companies around the world and whose 450,000 employees generate worldwide revenues of $83bn a year, is a question that may not be answered for some time to come.In the meantime, over the course of the next year during which Ratan Tata will groom his young protégé, Indians should at least be able to answer the question: “Who is Cyrus Mistry?”
356;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-24T21:41:01Z;Tata succession hands over daunting task;;Taking over Tata Group, India’s most established global company, would be a daunting task for even the most seasoned executive – including PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi or Citigroup’s Vikram Pandit, both of whom were rumoured as potential successors to Ratan Tata, 73, the patriarch of corporate India.The 140-year-old company controls a diversified portfolio of 100 companies operating in nearly as many countries, with overall revenues of $83bn, of which nearly 60 per cent are generated abroad.So Tata insiders and analysts are understandably concerned whether Cyrus Mistry, 43, the little known son of a reclusive billionaire, has the experience necessary to eventually step into the shoes of Mr Tata, whom he will shadow for the next year.Mr Mistry will have to learn to manage a company with more than 450,000 employees worldwide compared to the just 23,000 of his own family owned group.“The difficulty to manage a company of the scale and complexity of the Tata Group will be an enormous challenge for somebody with fairly limited experience,” says Agit Rangnekar, dean of the Indian School of Business.For the past 15 years, Mr Mistry has been operating in the shadow of his octogenarian father – Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry, Tata Group’s largest individual shareholder with an 18.4 per cent stake – and remains fairly unknown outside, and even inside, India.“Cyrus is a smart executive but his family business is predominantly based in India, it won’t be easy to manage a group that has a presence in so many countries,” adds Mr Rangnekar.Yet when Mr Tata took over as chairman in 1991, aged 53, he also initially received a lukewarm reception from some of the company’s elders.He then spent much of his time reorganising the group by bringing all the Tata subsidiaries under one umbrella, with the goal of creating a homogenous culture throughout the conglomerate.Since Tata embarked on a process of internationalisation through a series of high-profile acquisitions – including Tetley Tea, Corus Steel and Jaguar and Land Rover cars – the challenge to manage a globally unified company has increased, analysts say.“Cyrus might find it more difficult than Ratan to keep the control of the entire group, as some executives might see his lack of experience as an opportunity to recreate their own fiefdom,” says Mr Rangnekar.“Having said that, there are many positives for Cyrus: one being that he controls the biggest share in Tata Sons (holding)– that counts [for] a lot in a traditional Indian company …plus, he has been in the group for six years, [and] therefore knows how it works,” he adds.Another problem Mr Mistry will have to address is the subtle rift between Tata’s Indian employees and its international ones, says a person who has worked in various units of the group.“It’s vital to integrate the domestic team with the international one,” they said. “At the moment people in Mumbai see their European colleagues as rivals.”For Tata’s Indian employees – more than half of the entire workforce – the decision to pick Mr Mistry over an outsider will be comforting, said a former group executive.But for those stationed abroad it will certainly be disappointing as they had hoped to see the group become more international, says a foreign executive who used to work for the Tata Group.Although the Tata Group is by far one of India’s most professionally managed conglomerates, it is still run in a fairly conservative manner, resembling a traditional family owned business.“The group tends to adhere to traditional Indian values that can often be at odds with a multinational approach to business,” said a person familiar to the Tatas.“Cyrus has a tough job and the fact he is low key will give him one advantage: expectations will be lower, which means he can impress everyone later.”
357;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-23T23:41:37Z;Comeback king who restored a company’s lustre;Isdell pulls no punches when describing colleagues;"Inside Coca-Cola: A CEO’s life story of building the world’s most popular brandBy Neville Isdell with David BeasleySt Martin’s Press, $25.99Twice in his career of more than 30 years at Coca-Cola, Neville Isdell was offered positions at PepsiCo, the arch-rival soft drinks company and perennial number two in the cola wars. For some, the rivalry was al­ways a marketing myth, but for Isdell, who eventually rose to become Coke’s chief executive, loyalty to the red team runs deep. “I have a belief system that when the Good Lord created the world, he created Coke number one and Pepsi number two,” Isdell writes in Inside Coca-Cola. The first approach was in the 1980s, when he was in charge of reviving Coke’s bus­iness in the Philippines. Then Pepsi tried to rec­ruit him to help fix its South Africa operation – but, Isdell writes, he could not be tempted to sell something he did not believe in. His book, written with David Beasley, an Atlanta-based writer, is a tale of climbing the ladder to lead one of the world’s most recognised brands, by way of fascinating stints in Africa, Asia, Europe and Atlanta, Georgia – Coke’s headquarters. Beyond the biographical details, however, it is also a case study in management, detailing Coke’s recent history as seen by one of its most successful CEOs. Isdell’s experience dispels any notion that a career at one company is limited. For anyone seeking a short history of Coke, a lesson in juggling family and a job, or a look at how to turn round a stumbling giant of a company, the book is necessary reading. Irish-born Isdell joined the company in 1966 in Zambia, after graduating from the University of Cape Town. A job in Johannesburg was soon followed by a global career. In 2001, Isdell retired as head of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, aged 58. But azaleas in Atlanta and a home in Barbados were not sufficiently diverting to keep him away. By then, Coca-Cola was struggling. Its earnings and stock price were dep­ressed and it was reeling from what Isdell describes as a culture of arrogance. By 2002, Coke employees and board members started lobbying quietly for Isdell’s return in the top role, as investors grew frustrated with Doug Daft, the incumbent. He resigned after 18 months and in 2004, Isdell was finally at the helm.Isdell’s story of his tenure at the top details how a CEO can restore order at a tumultuous time. When he took over, the company was facing an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly “channel stuffing” – shipping excessive concentrate to bottlers in Jap­an; it was accused of hiring death squads to scare union organisers in Colombia; and European regulators were threatening an antitrust probe.He also had to smooth relations with McDonald’s, the company’s biggest client for fountain cola, and, he explains, to marginalise his own company’s president, Steve Heyer, who had offended the chain by trying to play favourites with Subway. Throughout the book, Isdell pulls no punches when describing colleagues or rivals who failed to live up to his standards. Of Heyer, Isdell writes: “Clearly, I agreed he did not have the right skills to be president. I wanted to ease him out quietly”. He travelled the world to study Coke’s operations, re­moved incompetent executives and invested heavily in marketing. Coke, Isdell had determined, had been resting on its laurels.He dubs his most significant leadership accomplishment “The manifesto for growth”. He refocused the company with five principles: people, portfolio, partners, planet and profit. With the company’s top 150 executives backing its new core values, morale at Coke began to lift.In 2009, there was a more or less seamless handover of power to Muht­ar Kent, Coke’s current CEO, who has navigated the company through the worst recession since the Great Depression. For Isdell, Kent’s success illustrates the view that the company is always bigger than any individual.“I do not have a legacy unless my successor is successful,” he writes."
358;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Surprise choice to head conglomerate;;Fifteen months after Tata Group, the Indian salt-to-steel conglomerate, set up a special committee to handpick the successor of its revered chairman Ratan Tata, the patriarch of corporate India, the final decision has caught many by surprise.Cyrus Mistry, the man selected on Wednesday to lead India’s most global company, is a reclusive billionaire known to the country’s business elite, but an enigma to the majority of international executives he will have to meet around the world when he becomes head of the Mumbai-based group in December 2012.Indira Nooyi, the Indian-born chief executive of PepsiCo, Carlos Ghosn, the chairman of Renault-Nissan, and Arun Sarin, the former head of Vodafone, were just a few names from a long list of illustrious professionals touted by Indian pundits as the ideal candidates to take over Mr Tata’s role.Most Indian industrialists following the high-profile succession saga had decided that at the end family ties would prevail and Noel Tata would step in to fill his half-brother’s shoes.But nobody expected that a 43-year-old with fairly limited international experience would eventually win the race to lead a group that generates about 60 per cent of its $83bn plus revenues outside its domestic market.MK Venu, editor of the Financial Express, an Indian business newspaper, said the appointment of Mr Mistry was a “big surprise” given that the multinational group was considering making a high-profile outside appointment.Rashesh Shah, chief executive of Edelweiss, one of India’s largest brokerage firms, concurred. “I must say that few people expected Mistry to become the next chairman of Tata Sons, it comes a bit out of the blue…but then again his family is the largest shareholder in Tata so there is some rationale.”The chairman-elect of Tata was managing director of his family’s Mumbai-based real estate and construction business until the announcement of his appointment on Wednesday.Although he is the son of Tata’s largest individual shareholder, who has an 18.4 per cent stake and has long deputised for his octogenarian father Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry, he is not a high-profile figure within the conglomerate.Some business leaders, though, applauded Mr Mistry’s appointment. Deepak Parekh, a prominent business figure, praised the special committee for making “a bold move in selecting a young man who can lead the group for a long time, giving it stability.“I’ve known his family for more than 25 years, I’ve seen Cyrus grow, and I can tell you he is qualified for the job and is a guy with his head on his shoulders,” said Mr Parekh, the chairman of HDFC, one of India’s largest lenders.“Cyrus is familiar with the company’s global strategy and over the course of the next year Ratan will have enough time to groom him for the big job,” added Mr Parekh.Others close to Mr Mistry describe the 43-year old executive as low key but stress his educational qualifications and ability to operate comfortably in Indian and western environments.Mr Mistry is a graduate in civil engineering from London’s Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine. He also studied for an MSc at London Business School.He has strong connections with the UK, where the Tata Group is today the largest manufacturing employer. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Civil Engineers and sits on the board of Imperial College’s India Foundation.Another family friend described him as a “sensible, understated” executive, who had the key advantage of being from a Parsi background, helping him fit in culturally with Mr Tata and his predecessors at the Tata Group, also Parsis.“[Cyrus] is very low key and not one of those industrialists who is making a flash. He’s unbelievably under-stated but he’s well-educated,” he said.By selecting Mr Mistry, the two century-old group has also given a clear endorsement in favour of generational change in a country whose business class is dominated by gerontocratic leadership.“Choosing someone in their early 40s is appropriate,” said a person familiar with Mr Mistry. “All the eligible Tata senior managers are in their 60s and are close to retirement. [The generational leap] will be taken well by the market.”Mr Mistry joined the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the family owned construction group, in 1991 as a director. After the acquisition of construction group AFCONS, he became the group’s chairman in 2003.Mr Mistry was appointed to the board of Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group, five years ago. He holds several non-executive board positions across the group, and has shown a strong interest in Tata’s entertainment interests.
359;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-23T16:46:11Z;India welcomes Mistry man;;"India’s English-language news channels broke into regularly scheduled programming and news websites splashed it as their top story: India’s most famous family-owned company had finally named a successor to 74-year-old chairman Ratan Tata, one of the country’s most respected industrialists.The decision to appoint Cyrus Mistry, the 43-year-old son of construction billionaire Shapoorji Mistry, who is the largest single shareholder in the Tata grouping, came as a surprise to many.The younger Mistry is hardly an outsider, given that his father holds 18 per cent of Tata Sons, the core company. But in the 15 months since Tata announced he would retire in December 2012, after almost 20 years at the helm of the company his great-grandfather founded in the mid-19th century, Mistry’s name was barely mentioned in public.Instead, names like PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, Renault Nissan’s Carlos Ghosn, Citigroup’s Vikram Pandit, and Google’s Nikesh Arora were thrown around as possible successors while Tata’s half-brother, Noel, the managing director of Tata International, was seen as the frontrunner for the job.But while the appointment of the relatively unknown Mistry – who is a director of Tata Sons, and a member of the 5-member board appointed to choose a successor – took many by surprise, the news was greeted positively.Journalists and businessmen went out of their way to praise the relative youth of Mistry – who stands in stark contrast to the septuagenarian leaders of many Indian corporations (and political parties) – and the fact that his family was the company’s largest shareholder.“This is a beneficial move for Tata Sons because Cyrus is a much younger person and he has been closely associated with Tata Sons for the last five years and he’s extremely capable,” former Tata Sons chairman JJ Irani told NDTV news channel.“I really believe it’s great to have a young person with an open mind there,” DN Mukherjea, editor of Fortune India magazine, told CNBC.In a statement, Tata also endorsed the move by saying that Mistry “is a good and far-sighted choice”.“I have been impressed with the quality and caliber of his participation, his astute observations and his humility,” he said.Mistry, who will serve as deputy chairman for the next year under Tata, said he felt “deeply honoured” by the appointment.“I am aware that an enormous responsibility, with a great legacy, has been entrusted to me. I look forward to Mr Tata’s guidance in the year ahead in meeting the expectations of the Group,” said Mistry, who was educated at London’s Imperial College and at the London Business School.The 140-year-old group has 98 operating companies, including India’s biggest vehicle maker, its largest IT outsourcing company and the world’s seventh-largest steelmaker.AM Naik , chairman of Larsen & Tourbo, continued the theme of praising Mistry’s youth and shareholder status on Bloomberg UTV.“Being young of course helps because the Tata Group will get lots of stability,” he said. As a member of the family that is the biggest shareholder, “I think he will have everything going for him to be charged up and motivated and …to take Tata Sons to still greater heights.”“I am surprised, yes, but at the end of the day it is non-controversial,” he added.For their part, the vernacular television channels by-and-large avoided breaking into programming beyond a ticker across the bottom of the screen. Instead of businessmen on the line to comment on the succession, coverage of the regular business of India – a tragic train fire, the proposed division of Uttar Pradesh, an interview with a firebrand regional politician, a cricket match – went on as scheduled.Related reading:

360;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-22T19:36:28Z;Star stock pickers struggle to beat index;;To say that 2011 has severely tested the world’s most high profile of investors is no exaggeration. The likes of Fidelity’s Anthony Bolton, Pimco’s Bill Gross and hedge fund manager John Paulson have all delivered below par performances this year.But it has been a truly horrible year for more traditional investors who delve into the details of company balance sheets and try to buy stocks that offer compelling value.Last week, for example, Bill Miller of Legg Mason, one of the leading fund managers of his generation, called time on his management of the flagship Capital Management Value Trust after a dismal performance in recent years.While Mr Miller was a stockpicking star for 15 years, he has struggled since 2006 as movements in shares prices have become increasingly correlated with one another, a trend that has been dubbed “risk on, risk off” since the financial crisis.“It’s just a much more difficult period, I’m assuming, for all active managers,” he says. “Growth has done better than value, but risk on, risk off has been the name of the game for the last two years”.Another well known “value” investor, Bruce Berkowitz, has seen his Fairholme Fund suffer a drop of 32 per cent so far this year. Tilson Focus, the mutual fund run by hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson, is down 23 per cent so far this year, a performance that still puts it in the top quartile for its category, according to Morningstar.For US equity investors, it is clear that the underlying investment environment has changed. While many stocks look cheap on various valuation models, these bargains have loitered like unsold toys on shop shelves after Christmas. Notable examples include Microsoft, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble.This is reflected in the performance of the S&P value index, which has dropped 9.5 per cent since the start of January. By contrast, the S&P growth index has fallen 1.8 per cent.Janet Brown, president of DAL, an investment company, argues that individual stockpicking ability is less important than investment fashion. “Fund performance tends to be down to whether the strategy is in sync with the market environment, rather than the brilliance of the manager,” she says.Indeed, for much of this year, stocks have generally moved together, with investors either buying or selling the asset class. These tidal movements have frustrated ardent stock pickers.“When stocks are moving in lock step, investors might as well put their money in an S&P500 tracker and cash out when they think the market is going to turn,” says Oliver Pursche, a stockpicking fund manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services.In such an environment, however, some stocks have outperformed. “Stock picking is not dead, it’s just become a lot more difficult,” says Nicholas Colas, director of research at Convergex.The 25 best-performing stocks in the S&P 500, excluding four companies that have been bought out in mergers and acquisitions, are up an average 36.2 per cent this year, according to data from Convergex. The list includes Lorillard, the cigarette manufacturer, a high dividend paying stock that has climbed 32 per cent this year.Channing Smith, a mutual fund manager at Capital Advisors, still uses the old-fashioned stockpickers’ tools to select companies, looking for rising operating margins and revenues and signs that the company is gaining market share. But the macroeconomic environment has complicated that analysis.“If it wasn’t for the situation in Europe we’d be very happy investing in US equities, but the potential for the eurozone’s problems to morph into a credit crisis holds us back,” he says.Stockpickers also face a challenge in retaining the faith of investors in their funds. A Standard & Poor’s study in August found that two-thirds of actively managed large-cap equity funds have underperformed the S&P 500 over the past three years. Many equity investors have instead embraced exchange traded funds, which offer immediate exposure to an index or basket of equities at low cost.Fund managers’ greatest fear is a rerun of the 1930s and 1940s. Stock picking only returned at the end of that period, when investors had stopped paying attention to equities altogether. That point has not arrived yet, but it may be looming. While company specifics accounted for 50 per cent of performance in the median S&P 500 stock over the past 20 years, that figure dropped to a low of 30 per cent this summer, says Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.“Macro factors will matter just as much for stock prices in the next six months as they have in the last few,” he says. Active fund managers are likely to remain on guard, lest their stockpicking efforts are blindsided by macro-driven markets.“It’s a nice cafeteria you have out there in the market,” says Mr Miller, who insists “there is no dearth of cheap stocks.” The moment when that value will be recognised is far harder to identify.
361;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-21T00:00:36Z;Push to help women find the keys to the C-suite;;"Enrolling on an MBA programme, particularly at an elite school, is for some the equivalent of taking an elevator to the executive suite. While the majority of Fortune 500 company chief executives do not hold MBAs, a significant 35 per cent do.If you want to see more women in the boardroom, you could do worse than ensure that higher proportions study for an MBA, one argument goes.Cagla Bekbolet, of Egon Zehnder International, the executive search firm, says: “I don’t think I’ve ever been asked whether a candidate has an MBA or not.” However, that does not mean the MBA is not an asset on the resumé.“It gives me confidence in a candidate’s intellectual curiosity and rigour,” she says. While there are more men than women on board shortlists she adds, there does not appear to be any gender difference proportionately in those with MBAs.The MBA remains a “badge of eligibility for top roles”, says Moira Benigson of London-based executive search firm MBS Group. She is handling an assignment to recruit a European chief executive for a US group, run by a woman with a Stanford MBA who is “incredibly disappointed by the level of what she calls ‘the smarts’. Now we’ve had to realign the brief, so that they have to have an MBA from a great school,” she says.How do you get more women on to corporate boards? This is a question that divides both sexes, writes Adam Palin.While men appear largely sceptical about the introduction of a legally binding quota aimed at increasing the number of females in boardrooms, women view the suggestion more favourably, according to a recent Financial Times survey.A poll of more than 700 European business school alumni – 475 men and 242 women – working in Europe, was conducted by the Financial Times in October.The survey revealed that almost half (47 per cent) of women believe the European Union should introduce legislative quotas.Only 19 per cent of men however agreed, with approximately half (49 per cent) describing the potential impact to businesses as negative.Further reading and poll resultsThe number of women chief executives of Fortune 500 groups will, assuming no unforeseen changes, hit a record 18 in January. Of those who lead the US’s largest groups – seven Fortune 100 companies are run by women – five have MBAs: Meg Whitman, president and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard (Harvard); Lynn Elsenhans, chairman, CEO and president of Sunoco, (Harvard); Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and CEO of Kraft Foods (Cornell); Indra Nooyi, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo (Yale); and Ellen Kullman, chair and CEO of DuPont (Kellogg).When, earlier this year, London Business School set a diversity target for its MBA programme, it did so in the belief that diversity in the boardroom starts at business school. “We are committed to seeing more women in business and when we looked at ways of achieving that, we thought ensuring our own MBA student intake was 30 per cent female could be one way of doing it,” says Diane Morgan, associate dean of degree programmes. Female participation in the school’s MBA had stalled at about 28 per cent. By setting a target, extending application deadlines and focusing on countries such as Russia and Japan, where the number of female applicants had been historically low, that has risen to 31.4 per cent this year.However, the proportion of women enrolling on MBA courses globally is still under a third and has remained at this level for the past eight years.Ms Benigson says: “MBAs have the edge. It’s not just the teaching but also to do with your peer group – it gives you incredible access if you’ve been to a top school. It’s a very, very good club to join. It is still very male-dominated, but that is changing.”The Financial Times’ ranking of top 50 women in business includes 12 MBA alumni (24 per cent), clearly below the average for Fortune 500 chief executives. Of these, six are from US universities, four from Indian business schools and two from European schools. The majority (52 per cent) of women in the elite ranking have postgraduate qualifications.These data reveal that some nationalities are more MBA-focused than others. Top US and Indian female chief executives are far more likely to have an MBA than their European or non-Indian Asian counterparts. Almost all Indian chief executives in the ranking, whether or not now located in India, hold MBAs.I felt MBAs were for people who didn’t really know what they wanted to doThe list includes six women who started and built up the enterprises they lead. They are all in Asia and none has an MBA. Like some of the Fortune 500 high-tech entrepreneurs – Oracle’s Lawrence Ellison, Michael Dell, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, visionary college dropouts all – they tend not to have studied for advanced business degrees. That may change with the growing focus on entrepreneurship in business schools.Some women chief executives completed masters and doctorates in disciplines other than management. For example, Ursula Burns, chief executive of Xerox, decided against an MBA in favour of a masters in mechanical engineering.“I joined Xerox as an engineer in a research lab and I was ambitious to be a very good engineer, hands-on, analytical, running experiments. I didn’t know about corporate structures and treasurers and CEOs, but I did know about chief engineers.”Women who qualified as accountants or lawyers do not generally have MBAs: others got into a fast-paced career and never looked back. Maggie Wilderotter, chief executive of Frontier Communications, is one. “I felt MBAs were for people who didn’t really know what they wanted to do, or felt they didn’t have opportunity where they were and they needed this to boost them to the next level.”But women chief executives who did invest in an MBA place high value on the experience. “Not only did it give me very good foundation skills in all disciplines of business …it also taught me how to solve problems,” says Nancy McKinstry, CEO of Wolters Kluwer. “To this day I take a very analytical approach.”"
362;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-18T16:23:11Z;Green shift grows, deal or no deal;;"When it comes to the world’s great annual migrations, the UN climate talks lack the spectacle of the hajj or the splendour of the African wildebeest.But there should be no shortage of drama when thousands of people from nearly 200 countries flock to Durban, South Africa, at the end of this month for the latest UN climate summit.Yet again, negotiators are expected to botch what has long been seen as the most crucial test of these gatherings: producing a global pact that legally obliges countries to stop pumping out so much carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas blamed for global warming.The world has done this before, when the 1997 Kyoto protocol was adopted in the Japanese city of the same name. But that treaty only committed countries to cut their carbon emissions until the end of next year. Since Kyoto came into force in 2005, successive UN summits have tried – and failed – to come up with a second compliance period, most infamously at the heavily hyped 2009 Copenhagen conference.But something curious is happening this year.Despite the glacial pace of the UN talks, it is more and more evident that many of the world’s biggest countries and companies are pressing on regardless. From China to California, from Ford to PepsiCo, there has been a striking surge in emissions-cutting activity.“We have never seen anything like this before,” says Adam Matthews, secretary-general of Globe International, an association of legislators that monitors climate laws in 17 major economies. “There is an unprecedented number of countries enacting or developing comprehensive climate change legislation, especially in major emerging economies.”These range from China’s latest five-year plan, which for the first time includes plans for emissions trading and carbon intensity reduction targets, to Indonesia’s two-year moratorium on new permits to clear primary forests.In the corporate world, too, “there has been a profound shift”, says Nick Robins, the head of HSBC’s climate change group. Businesses are increasingly moving beyond green PR puffery to change the way they make their goods, and even the products themselves, as they realise the financial benefits of lowering carbon emissions, he says.One example is DuPont, the US chemicals group, which reported this year that its energy efficiency programmes had helped it to save more than $6bn since 1990. Another is Shell, the European oil company, which has kicked off a multibillion-dollar Brazilian biofuels joint venture that will be one of the world’s biggest ethanol companies.In the past week, the French PPR Group, which includes luxury brands such as Gucci and Yves St Laurent, announced it was bringing in an “environmental profit and loss” accounting system that would measure the environmental impact of its operations. Over the past fortnight Australia has passed laws for a carbon tax and Ford has begun European production of the smallest petrol engine it has ever made, the one-litre EcoBoost, whose emissions nearly rival those of some Toyota Prius models. And in the past month California formally adopted an emissions trading scheme; BP announced a $750m deal for more wind turbines in an aggressive expansion of its US wind farm projects; and HSBC and some of Europe’s best-known banks drew up standards that prohibit the financing of dirty coal-fired power plants.Even the rivalry between Pepsi and Coke has taken a green turn, with each trying to trump the other’s lightweight plastic bottles made from plant-based materials.“What has happened over the past year and a half is that the world has almost stood on its head,” says Sir David King, who helped forge some of the world’s most advanced climate policies as the UK’s former chief scientist and who now runs Oxford university’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. To him, the flurry of climate action around the world shows the increasing irrelevance of trying to get a second phase of the Kyoto pact agreed, a course he says has “got us very, very little distance down the road so far”.But others argue there is a link between the voluntary, “bottom-up” changes at Ford or in California and the international efforts to impose “top-down” global treaty rules. They point to the agreement countries made at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit to tell the UN how they would voluntarily cut their respective emissions.The US – which never ratified Kyoto and is the world’s second biggest carbon emitter after China – says it will lower its emissions by 17 per cent against 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 per cent by 2050. China has pledged to cut its carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product by at least 40 per cent by 2020 from 2005 levels.“Had Copenhagen not taken place, I doubt if you’d have seen that number,” says Sir Nicholas Stern, who has worked in China since 1988 and authored the eponymous 2006 UK review on the economics of climate change.He discussed Beijing’s five-year plan with officials as it was being developed and believes it was influenced by the commitments China made after the Copenhagen summit. “So I react quite strongly against the idea that we tried top-down and it failed, so now it’s bottom-up,” he says. “That is actually to miss the point of the way in which these things reinforce each other.”So far, nearly 90 countries have registered carbon cutting plans with the UN. But even if they all live up to their promises, the UN says the pledges so far amount to only about 60 per cent of what is needed to limit global temperature increases to 2ºC, the level scientists say would allow a reasonable chance of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.Meanwhile, as the International Energy Agency confirmed this month, energy related global carbon emissions have continued to rise relentlessly, bouncing back from a dip during the recession to jump by 5.3 per cent to a record 30.4 gigatons in 2010.For all the activity by governments and companies, this is what really matters, says Professor Bill McGuire, a British volcanologist who specialises in the geological consequences of climate change. “However impressive the figures are for various renewable energy sources and electric cars and so on, this is not making any impression on overall emission levels,” he says.“If they can go up 5 per cent in a recession, then what hope is there?”"
363;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-18T00:31:06Z;Legg’s Miller says ‘success equals survival’;Value Trust manager claims longevity as he steps down;After almost 30 years running what became the flagship mutual fund for Legg Mason, Bill Miller could at the very least claim longevity as he discussed his retirement on Thursday.“This is a brutal business, success equals survival. If you have survived, you will have succeeded,” he said, recalling advice from an older colleague as he began a career as an investor three decades ago.The former military intelligence officer, who started a doctorate in philosophy before being drawn to finance, has also received many other plaudits.In 1999, he was voted fund manager of the decade by analysts at research group Morningstar, a remarkable achievement for a value investor when markets were dominated by the search for the next fast-growing dotcom.Yet the last five years have been harsh, bringing an abrupt end to a 15-year run during which Mr Miller’s Legg Mason Value Trust consistently beat the S&P 500. Since 2006, the fund has placed dead last out of the more than 800 funds in its category, according to Lipper, a research group.So in April next year he will hand the torch to his co-manager, Sam Peters. “We’re having the second period of underperformance in 30 years. The last was back in the late 1980s when I took over from my partner, and now it’s a good time for Sam and his team,” says the 61-year-old Mr Miller.Much of the poor performance, however, Mr Miller puts down to fundamental changes in the structure of the market since 2005. “The huge rise of exchange-traded funds, which allowed people to buy baskets of things which caused correlations to rise, and of course the rise in algorithmic trading.”The rising tendency of stocks to move in concert with each other since 2005 has made life very difficult for all active managers, particularly as markets become driven by fears for the success or failure of government policy. “Most of the people who invest in the same way we do are having poor results as well,” he said.Meanwhile, investors do not tolerate losses. From $21.5bn of assets in 2007, the fund now manages less than $3bn. “It’s very clear that clients and the general public and pension plans and whoever are much more short term than they used to be,” he said.Still, Mr Miller, who will continue to manage a smaller fund for Legg Mason, remains upbeat for US equity markets and his value investing approach.“That strategy has to work at some point again because the math is the math and companies can’t trade at huge discounts to what they’re worth for a long time. But it can go on for longer than is comfortable,” he said“The markets have largely discounted almost all of the European Union’s problems,” he added, arguing that while Europe faces recession, the US economy is accelerating.“There is no dearth of cheap stocks,” he said pointing out that “you can buy Pepsi at the same price it was in 2005.”“If Europe completely blows up, and there is monetary chaos until local currencies can be re-established, well how bad is that for Pepsi?” said Mr Miller.“I’m sure the stock will go down, but fundamentally Pepsi’s business is not going to change that much. Philip Morris International’s business? People are still going to smoke cigarettes.”
364;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;The Olympian task of securing London;Robert Shrimsley ponders the reasons behind Britain’s decision to increase the number of guards at the games;"It seems we’ve been guilty of being a little too British about security for the London Olympics. Understatement is a wonderful thing in many ways, but when you have to double the estimate for the size of the security contingent that will be required, then the principle has probably been taken too far.All understatement is gone now, however. The initial estimate of 10,000 guards has now risen to 15,000-20,000 with the army on standby to fill in any gaps. The UK defence secretary has even said ground-to-air missiles are available if needed.Some of us are, frankly, suspicious. Is this really about securing the games or is there perhaps another agenda? Londoners are already preparing for the gridlock that will befall the capital; the roads closed off or narrowed so that Sepp Blatter and Jacques Rogge can be sped from their five-star hotels to the venues without delay or any unnecessary interaction with the host country’s citizens. We are ready for the new criminal offences that accompany an Olympic Games, such as obstructing athletes or drinking Pepsi within a five-mile radius of the stadium. Could it be the organisers fear not enough citizens will be inconvenienced and are acting to raise disruption to Olympian levels? One can imagine the BBC news report:“Thousands of extra security staff are being drafted in to ensure that ordinary Londoners cannot get to work during the 2012 Olympics. Requests for extra funds to block off a number of popular routes are coming in and a sweep of the main arteries through London revealed a number of shocking ‘weak spots’ that might be utilised by office workers intent on ruining the spirit of the Olympics by getting to their desks on time. GCHQ, Britain’s covert intelligence centre, has also uncovered a plot by some Londoners to cycle to the office. Troops will now be deployed at important junctions to push sticks into the spokes of their wheels if they attempt to enter the city.There are also rumours that some senior executives plan to bust the blockade by arranging helicopters to fly them to work. Olympic organisers would not comment on how they would tackle this threat but noted that the defence secretary has promised that surface-to-air missiles are available if needed.”US securityThe renewed focus on security may be partly due to American pressure. The US has denied some of the more lurid reports of plans to fly in hundreds of its own security guards but it is clearly taking a big interest in arrangements. Manufactured press outrage over US heavy-handedness has been seen before. Ahead of President George W. Bush’s state visit in 2003 the British press lambasted the US for daring to be unsatisfied with domestic security arrangements. On the day the visit began, however, a journalist revealed he had been working as a footman at Buckingham Palace for some weeks, having bypassed all security checks and secured the job using false references. Complaints about American concerns dried up forthwith.Statesman-like talkEarlier this month Nicolas Sarkozy and Barack Obama were caught bitching about the Israeli leader, Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu. Mr Sarkozy said he “couldn’t stand” Bibi any more because “he is a liar”. Mr Obama added: “You’re fed up with him; I have to deal with him every day.” As to Silvio Belusconi’s recent comments about Angela Merkel – they were frankly unprintable.One assumed world leaders spent their time at important summits discussing weighty world affairs; now we know differently. They are enjoying bar-room banter, rounding on those who aren’t there. We assume they are drawing up plans to prevent economic collapse. In fact, they’ve gone into a plenary session on Cristina Fernández’s dress sense.Had we been able to hear more of the Sarkozy/Obama exchange, the two would doubtless have moved on to a typical evening’s dissection of their fellow leader. “And have you seen how he walks; I mean like, who does he think he is?” “I know and have you seen his wife?” On it would have gone: “The other day he was, like, talking to me about West Bank settlements and stuff and I was, like, yeah, whatever, talk to the hand.”Outside the door commentators await strategies to save the the euro; inside they are knocking back WKD vodka sitting there and criticising other leaders. No wonder the G20 nations want a seat at the table."
365;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-16T03:52:31Z;China: workers protest for love of Pepsi;;"Gone are the days when Chinese workers would automatically choose a foreign company over a Chinese one: college graduates increasingly prefer private Chinese companies or even state-owned enterprises over working for foreigners.But it seems that calculation may not apply when the Chinese company in question is actually Taiwanese.Pepsi announced recently that it was selling its bottling business in China to Tingyi, the Taiwan beverage giant – and Pepsi workers in various Chinese cities have reportedly responded with protests and mass calls for sick leave over the past few days.Communicating their grievances through Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, workers at the Pepsi bottling facilities in the Chinese cities of Chongqing, Fuzhou and Chengdu have complained they were not consulted before the deal was agreed – mentioning pointedly that it has not yet been approved by the Beijing regulators.The exact nature of their grievances, and the extent of work stoppages, are hard to ascertain since Pepsi in China is not returning phone calls. A group calling itself the Worker Rights group at the Pepsi plant in Fuzhou said 1,100 of 1,300 workers at the plant there had taken sick leave on Tuesday.China’s Economic Observer newspaper said the Chongqing plant was closed on Monday as workers demanded unspecified compensation for the deal.Several workers said on Weibo that they were proud to work for Pepsi, and not ready for a new employer – and some hinted strongly that a new Taiwanese employer would be particularly unwelcome. Others appeared worried about more mundane issues like whether they would lose their jobs.Workers said the protest would continue on Wednesday. Pepsi, for its part, said only that it is “highly committed to protecting the interests and benefits of our employees”.Demonstrations in favour of foreign brands in China are hardly an everyday matter, and this one may have more to do with Taiwan-bashing than anything else. But Pepsi can take comfort from the fact that at least some Chinese workers still like working for western multinationals.Related reading:

Many analysts were alarmed by the level of unsold inventory held at the quarter’s end, a concern that Jeff Black at Citigroup played down.“The stance to the end of the fourth quarter with inventory better aligned with sales reinforces our view that Urban’s margin trough is confined to the second half of 2011,” Mr Black wrote to clients.Office equipment store Staples fell 3.6 per cent to $14.81 on anaemic sales growth of just 0.5 per cent compared with the same quarter last year.

The stake is relatively small in relation to PepsiCo’s market capitalisation of more than $100bn but could signal growing shareholder demand to boost the stock’s value.Shares of PepsiCo, which rose 2.2 per cent to $64.18 in midday trading on Tuesday, are little changed since the start of the year. Investors have called on management to refocus on the company’s carbonated soft drinks business. The company said earlier this month that it would reveal the outcome of a strategic review early next year.Last month, PepsiCo executives resisted calls for the company to follow Kraft’s move last summer and split the company into separate snacks and drinks businesses.“I firmly believe that PepsiCo’s value is maximised as one company,” Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive, told analysts in October. “It was created as an integrated snack and beverage business and its success is tied to this combination.”Mr Peltz, who holds 17.3m Kraft shares, renewed his interest in that company last June when he took a $420m stake nearly a year after selling off his shares. Less than two months later, Kraft announced its plans to split into a US grocery business and a global snacks company.

369;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-15T12:47:04Z;Risk rewarded;Why taking risks has helped women power their way into boardrooms around the world, writes Andrew Hill;"Risk and uncertainty are familiar companions for chief executives: both offer opportunities for the brave; both can bring about the downfall of the overcautious or the unwary.The changes in this year’s ranking of the Financial Times’ top 50 women in world business illustrate the stark contrast between these two outcomes. The boldness of Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive of Kraft Foods, has won her promotion to the top position in the 2011 ranking. She displaces Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, who was judged the leading female chief executive in 2009 and 2010 and this year takes the number three spot.Yet the jury’s choice is itself a bet that Rosenfeld’s recent radical strategy will pay off. She has carried out a series of big acquisitions, and in August she proposed splitting the US food group in two. Her plan was not universally welcomed by investors. Some members of our panel also believed it was too soon to reward her with promotion. But, as one pointed out: “If the jury’s not out, chief executives aren’t doing enough”, adding that Rosenfeld was “taking hard decisions; she’s doing stuff.”At the other end of the scale, the ejection of Carol Ann Bartz as boss of Yahoo underlined the risk of not doing enough. Having got halfway through the internet group’s complex turnround, Bartz was dismissed in September – on the eve of the FT panel’s deliberations. She went out in spectacular fashion, emailing staff to tell them she had been “fired over the phone” and later branding her fellow directors “doofuses”. Her abrupt exit is a reminder to all chief executives that their stewardship will be cut short if they fail to grasp opportunities.This was a year in which regulators and legislators stepped up attempts to level the playing field for women executives. In the UK, for example, Lord Davies concluded a review into gender balance in executive suites of big British companies by setting targets for women on boards that, if unfulfilled, could lead to mandatory quotas. It is therefore appropriate that the highest new entry in this year’s ranking is Alison Cooper, chief executive of UK-based Imperial Tobacco.But in spite of the recent appointment of female chief executives at IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Campbell Soup Company (after the cut-off date for this ranking), progress is slow. Advocates point out that the real measure of success will not be the number of women parachuted into boardrooms, but the number who make it into senior executive roles.The FT ranking recognises ultimate executive power. Many of the top female chief executives remain concentrated in North America and, once again, the ranking is unable to plant a flag in Latin America (though not for lack of trying). But China and India still account for 20 per cent of the women featured.These top chief executives – who still make up a minority of the world’s corporate leaders – know they cannot eradicate risk and uncertainty in their roles. But the FT’s Women at the Top initiative is happy to celebrate their success in exploiting the opportunities presented by a period of unprecedented turbulence – and to encourage other talented female executives to aspire to do the same.Andrew Hill is an associate editor of the Financial Times"

She has been effectively at the helm of the group’s strategy since 2001;Company: PepsicoLast year’s position: 1Age: 56Nationality: IndianSector: Food and beveragesLocation: USIt all started with just $500 – and a scholarship to Yale. With an MBA from the Indian Institute of Management in Kolkata, Indra Nooyi’s early experience was in India with Mettur Beardsell, a textile company, and Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare and consumer products group, before she crossed the Atlantic with just a few hundred dollars and a place at university.Now Nooyi has been chief executive of PepsiCo, the US drinks and snacks group, for five years. She has been effectively at the helm of the group’s strategy since 2001, when she was appointed president and chief financial officer.At Yale she took a masters in public and private management before developing her career first at the Boston Consulting Group, followed by senior roles in strategy and planning at Motorola, the US electronics group, and Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish turbine maker, before she joined PepsiCo in 1994.Nooyi has paid tribute to the influence of her grandfather. Last year she told the FT he would say to her: “Don’t ever think you’ve arrived, and remember that what you don’t know is so much more than what you do.”She spearheaded the company’s forays into healthier foods, including the acquisition of Tropicana, the juice brand, in 1998, and its merger with Quaker Oats in 2000. She has also been instrumental in reducing the salt and fat content in Lay’s, the group’s leading crisp brand (Walkers in the UK).Nooyi is taking the lead on sustainable growth. Besides investing in “good for you” brands, PepsiCo is also trying to curb its energy use.
371;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Coke in $2bn push to boost India share;;Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drinks company by revenues, said on Monday that it would invest $2bn in India over the next five years, as it looks to deepen its presence in fast-growing emerging markets amid slowing US demand for carbonated beverages.Coke’s India investment matches what the company has spent there in the past 18 years and the funds will be used to develop manufacturing and distribution capacity and on consumer marketing.“The opportunity in the packaged beverage segment is immense, and our efforts in India are focused on being the beverage of choice all day, every day,” said Ahmet Bozer, head of Coke’s Eurasia and Africa group.“If we continue to do the right things each day and at all times, it would not surprise me if India becomes one of the top five markets for the company globally by the end of this decade.”Coke employs 25,000 workers in India and has been engaged in a tough battle for market share there with rival PepsiCo since re-entering the market in 1993.Both companies have been stepping up efforts in emerging markets as concerns about obesity in the US have softened demand for carbonated soft drinks.The new commitment to India marks a big shift from the contentious relationship between the company and the country in the 1970s. Coke abandoned the Indian market in 1977 after the government demanded that the company partner with an Indian company and share its secret formula.Coke and Pepsi have also faced challenges in India more recently. In 2005, the companies launched campaigns to convince Indian consumers that their products were safe, after several states enacted partial bans on the beverages because of fears that they contained pesticides.Coke accounts for 56 per cent of India’s carbonated soft drinks market, while Pepsi has 40 per cent, according to data from Beverage Digest.In 2008, Pepsi announced a $500m investment in India and said it wanted to triple its revenues from the country within five years.In India, Coke’s top-selling brands are Thums Up, Sprite and Maaza, a popular juice drink. Growing demand for Maaza has created a mango shortage in India and the company is working with low-tech farmers to teach them new mango-growing techniques. Monday’s announcement followed Coke’s decision in August to invest $4bn in China during the next three years.That was added to a $3bn investment it announced in 2009.
372;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-14T15:54:15Z;Brussels backs Stevia sweetener;;A sweetener billed as an advance against the obesity and diabetes epidemics is poised to appear on European shelves following approval this weekend by the European Commission.Steviol glycosides or stevia, which comes from a basil-like shrub native to Paraguay, is already available in the US and France and is now used in 6m US households. The long-awaited European approval comes nearly three years after the product won acceptance in the US.Coca-Cola which, like fellow beverages maker PepsiCo already uses stevia in some drinks, said the greenlight paved the way for it to deliver more beverages with fewer calories.Dominique Reiniche, Coca-Cola Europe president, described the move as “another important milestone” as it expands its portfolio of drinks. It comes nearly three decades after the companies brought in its first zero-calorie beverage. Today, nearly one-third of the group’s total brands are low and no calorie.Truvia, the Stevia-branded manufacturer owned by Cargill, has signed up with European sugar groups – including the UK’s Associated British Foods – as distribution partners.“After less than three years on the US market, Truvia sweetener has fundamentally changed the sweetener category and contributed to the growth of a previously stagnant retail category. The category has grown 18 per cent in three years,” Truvia said.Merisant, marketing the sweetener under the brand Pure Via, reckons the European market for Stevia-based sweeteners should reach an additional $100m – on top of the existing $500m sweetener market – next year.In the US, Packaged Facts, the market researcher, estimates that sales of stevia will grow from $210.6m in 2010 to $1.19bn (£763m) this year.Optimism is based on global efforts to tackle obesity and diabetes, which has left the food industry desperately seeking ways to make healthier products.Manufacturers of fizzy drinks and other sweet foodstuffs already have a toe in the water. Coca-Cola uses stevia to sweeten Fanta Still in France – which now accounts for more than 5 per cent of total French Fanta sales – and VitaminWater Zero in the US. Also in France, Danone uses it to sweeten its Taillefine yoghurts.Pepsi, which uses stevia in Trop50, says performance has been “outstanding”. The drink became a brand with annual sales of $150m in two years and sales are up 50 per cent year to date.Despite the enthusiasm, some analysts warn that stevia still has to overcome issues on taste – some say the liquorice-like profile is a deterrent to some consumers. There is also an innate conservatism among consumers, as testified by the outcry in Britain when the recipe for HP sauce was changed.

375;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Starbucks to buy California juice group;;Starbucks, the US coffee chain, is tapping into growing demand for healthy food and drink by paying $30m to acquire a juice business that it will use to open a new line of outlets focused on nutritious products.The Seattle-based company said it was buying Evolution Fresh, a Californian juice maker, and declared its determination to change the way juice is sold in the US in the same way it helped to do so for caffeine shots.The Starbucks move follows steps by other big corporations, including McDonald’s and PepsiCo, to promote healthier food and drink amid growing criticism that they are contributing to an obesity crisis in the US.Starbucks fell into financial trouble after over-expanding to the point of ubiquity before the global financial crisis. Diversifying into juice is the brainchild of Howard Schultz, a former chief executive who returned to the job in 2008 to revive the company.Announcing the juice acquisition on Thursday, Mr Schultz said: “Our intention is to reinvent this category in the same [way] that we reinvented over the last 40 years the basic commodity of coffee.”The company said the “super premium” juice segment was a $1.6bn market in the US and that the health and wellness market overall was worth $50bn.Starbucks, which has made cups of coffee costing several dollars a staple of many people’s working days, said most juice would initially sell in 450ml bottles priced between $3.75 and $4.75.Justifying that price tag, Starbucks said Evolution Fresh peeled, pressed and squeezed its own raw fruits and vegetables and used a special high-pressure pasteurisation process that preserved freshness by removing pathogens without heating the juice.Mr Schultz said Evolution juice would be sold through three channels, including an as yet unnamed new line of stores that it will begin to open next year, which will sell juice and food and have tables and chairs for customers.A second channel will be Starbucks coffee shops, where Evolution juice will replace the current range of juices available.The third will be grocery stores – many of which already sell packaged Starbucks coffee – where it will be stocked on shelves alongside other brands.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo, said: “Over the long term, Starbucks’ ability to leverage its expertise in building a brand and creating an experience around it will translate well into the health and wellness category.”Last summer, McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, said that it was adding apples to its children’s meals and shrinking the size of its portions of fries. McDonald’s has also introduced fruit smoothies.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, has said she wants to triple revenues that the company derives from “good for you” products, but investors argue that she has neglected the company’s core salty snacks and sugary drinks products.
376;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
377;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-10T20:27:51Z;PepsiCo purchases Brazilian cookie company;Acquisition part of international growth strategy;PepsiCo, the US drinks and snacks company, expanded its push into emerging markets on Thursday with the acquisition of Grupo Mabel, a Brazilian cookie company.Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but people familiar with the deal said Pepsi acquired Mabel for about $500m.“PepsiCo continues to build its global macro-snacks portfolio and make strategic investments that will drive our business performance and unlock long-term growth opportunities,” John Compton, chief executive officer of PepsiCo Americas Foods and Global Snacks Group, said in a statement. “Brazil is an extremely important market for PepsiCo and this acquisition well positions us in a key segment in the snack category there.”Pepsi said the acquisition, which is pending approval from Brazil’s Council for Economic Defense, will strengthen its presence in Latin America and complement its snacks business. The company will employ 12,000 workers in Brazil after the deal closes.PepsiCo has been ramping up its efforts in emerging markets as the US economy continues to struggle.Last week, Pepsi said that it was selling its Chinese bottling operations to Tingyi Holding, the Tianjin-based Taiwanese beverage company, as it looks to expand its presence in the world’s fastest-growing drinks market. It will take a 5 per cent stake in Tingyi’s beverage subsidiary, which will become its franchise bottler in China, and have the option of expanding that holding to a 20 per cent stake by 2015.Meanwhile, Pepsi is revamping its strategy amid investor concerns about its sluggish stock price and the performance of its carbonated soft drinks business in the US. Pepsi said earlier this week that it was extending its 2012 business review, which was originally due next month, until early next year.
378;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-07T23:48:39Z;AJE – taking on bigger rivals;Peruvian soft-drinks maker targeted poorer consumers;"The story. In the 1980s, growing conflicts led mainly by guerrilla movement Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), forced Eduardo Añaños to flee his family farm in the Peruvian countryside for the small town of Ayacucho.To support his family, Mr Añaños launched the soft drink Kola Real in 1988. The Añaños family had spotted an opportunity: because Coca-Cola and Pepsi trucks from Lima often came under attack from criminal groups, the two multinationals had limited their shipments.Production began in a courtyard, after mortgaging the family home and using Mr Añaños’s personal savings. The family began selling the drink in recycled bottles, door to door, to local residents and stores, before expanding rapidly to the rest of the town. In 1991, the family founded AJE to bottle and expand the distribution of Kola Real.The challenges. Peruvian society, like the rest of Latin America, is characterised by socioeconomic inequality. Wealth is concentrated in an upper class minority, while a lower class majority has an annual income of less than $650.Big multinational soft-drink makers had traditionally targeted the upper classes with high purchasing power, and ignored the rest – ie the base of the pyramid, the demographic championed by economist C.K. Prahalad, author of The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid.AJE focused on serving the lower income brackets. It concentrated on offering lower prices and invested in distribution that would reach more remote areas. This involved micro-entrepreneurs who used their own transport to distribute the product – an approach replicated everywhere that the group has since operated.AJE’s success drew the attention of the big operators, who aggressively slashed prices and increased spending on advertising. However, this strategy only worked in the short term: poorer consumers reverted to Kola Real once the promotions had ended.The strategy for expansion. For the launch of Kola Real in Lima, the Peruvian capital, the slogan was “The Fair Price Drink”. This strategy would be replicated in other markets to convey an idea of overpricing by rivals, while reinforcing perception of its product for quality.AJE also developed other drinks, including water and juices, and bought up bottlers using PET containers, which were an innovation in the 1990s.In 1999, the company decided to break out of Peru, starting with Venezuela.It later entered the huge Mexican soft-drink market, which was dominated by Coca-Cola, deploying a sales force of 800 and focusing on developing a personalised service for retailers. The country has become AJE’s most important market.The company then entered Central America, and in 2006 it set up in Asia.The results. The company has annual sales of about $1.5bn in 16 countries. These include Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and Colombia, as well as other markets in Central America.It is also represented in Thailand and Vietnam, where the target consumer is, again, in the lower-income strata.The company’s goal is to rank among the world’s top 20 multinational food and drinks groups by 2020.Key lessons. The company identified a “parallel” market – the bottom of the pyramid – that was underserved by big, established brands. In Peru, this segment of society represents 80 per cent of the market. Worldwide, the bottom of the pyramid represents about 2bn people. Many of them aspire to improve their lives. One manifestation of this is the increased consumption of branded goods.AJE learnt that, rather than focusing on becoming the leader in a market, it had to focus on generating enough profits to enable it to sustain growth. In this way, it was able to fend off bigger and better resourced rivals that were able to lure customers with short-term strategies such as slashing prices.AJE also realised early on that it had to adapt its bottom of the pyramid offering for each market’s specific needs.The writers are, respectively: a professor at Iese Business School; professor at the University of Piura; and a researcher at Iese"
379;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-04T22:03:27Z;Are they not fragrant?;Celebrity perfumes are among the bestsellers but how do they rate as fragrances?;"When Justin Bieber’s Someday, the first fragrance from the teenage singing star, was released this autumn it broke all predicted sales forecasts and is on track to become the best-selling fragrance of 2011. Some experts are saying it’s the most successful fragrance launch in history.So, would you buy it or would you, well, turn up your nose because it’s a celebrity fragrance. Can such mass-market perfumes be anywhere near as good as small, artisanal scents made by serious perfume makers?Consider the following: Elizabeth Taylor’s White Diamonds, the best-selling celebrity fragrance of all time, was launched in 1991. It is deemed a classic perfume (ie not just a classic celebrity perfume) and last year had global sales of $61.3m. “Celebrity fragrances, like celebrities themselves, can sometimes be elegant and alluring and sometimes vacant, brain-dead white trash,” says Linda Pilkington of the exclusive perfume brand Ormonde Jayne. “They are not all bad. J Lo’s and Naomi Campbell’s are a couple I have smelt in the past and thought they could pass the ‘Pepsi challenge’ if one was blindfolded.”Indeed, Sarah Jessica Parker’s Lovely is so good it could be a Chanel. Lovely is made by Coty, the company that also makes fragrances for Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta, and is considered by connoisseurs such as Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez, authors of Perfumes: the Guide, to be the best celebrity perfume. Etat Libre d’Orange’s Like This (Tilda Swinton’s creation) and Rossy de Palma are other celebrity fragrances that are wondrously idiosyncratic and recherché.So is there a prejudice against celebrity scents? Part of the problem is the sheer number of celebrity perfumes released every year. For a time White Diamonds stood alone but in 2002 Jennifer Lopez launched Glow and its soapy, jejune, fresh-from-the-shower scent became a huge commercial hit, inspiring other stars to launch a signature fragrance. According to NPD Beauty Trends, there have been 62 celebrity launches since 2007, from A-listers such as Beyoncé and the Beckhams to reality stars and Z-listers.The latest to announce perfumes in development are Madonna, Keith Urban (Nicole Kidman’s husband) and Dita Von Teese. Lady Gaga’s first perfume, made in conjunction with Coty, is due out next year. Britney Spears, the pre-Bieber bestseller of celebrity fragrance, has 10 perfumes to her name. J Lo has 14. So, how is one to tell the good from the gruesome?Lavanya Krishnan, a 29-year-old PhD student and perfume collector, says: “Most celebrity perfume seems to be just a marketing ploy and a way of making quick money for the celebrity and the fragrance house. Nothing wrong with that, except it makes me less motivated to seek out perfume that is marketed as a celebrity perfume.”Stephen C Mormoris, senior vice-president, global marketing at Coty Beauty, says the celebrities on its roster (among them SJP, J Lo, Kylie Minogue, Beyoncé and the Beckhams) spend, on average, about 100 hours (or 14 working days) developing each of their perfumes. The finished product is not, as you might cynically think, merely wafted under a star’s nostrils to elicit a yes or a no. On the other hand, it also doesn’t take two years and two professional noses to perfect, as was the case with Valentino’s recently launched Valentina.Although Bieber’s fragrance is unlikely to make it into the canon of perfume greats alongside Joy, Mitsouko, and Chanel No 5, it’s not unpleasant. Like many celebrity fragrances (it’s quite similar to Rihanna’s bumptious Reb’l Fleur), it’s an affable bubblegum conflation of fruit and flowers with top notes of pear and wild berries, heart notes of jasmine, water lily and coconut orchid, and basenotes of sandalwood vanilla and musk.According to Coty’s Mormoris, “Celebrities are cultural icons. They are often beautiful, accomplished, wealthy and sexy – all dreams that consumers project themselves into if they are wearing that celebrity’s personal fragrance,” which can make for a powerful package.After all, many celebrity scents have now enjoyed lingering success, suggesting that people might actually like them as a fragrance. Perhaps it’s time for the doubters to wake up and smell their preconceptions.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………An insider’s view: ‘Sarah Jessica Parker had chosen the teacups they sent home with us’One reason why so much scepticism surrounds celebrity perfumes is the lack of information on how the process of making them actually works. Often, the logistics of the exchange are shrouded in mystery. Coty, for example, says: “We believe it is crucial that each of our celebrity partners share an equal stake in the entire fragrance development process, from selecting the various notes, to designing the bottle and packaging.”Alternatively, one industry expert, who asked to remain anonymous, tells us: “Rarely does a famous star want to do their own thing.”Here, they explain why.“Large beauty companies do an enormous amount of research. Celebrity perfumes usually begin with a focus group. They’ll ask consumers, ‘Who do you most respond to? Who do you want to be?’ Armed with that information, they’ll usually approach a celebrity.”“Occasionally the impetus for a perfume will come from the celebrity themself, but that tends to happen with less A-list names …Even if you can create a scent, it’s difficult without the machine of a large group behind you to get the necessary distribution.”“Once a deal has been signed, the level of involvement from each celebrity varies tremendously. I remember the launch of Sarah Jessica Parker’s first scent, for example, and she was all over it. She had chosen the teacups they sent home with us as gift; she could talk about every note. Similarly, Jennifer Lopez’s first fragrance was a sort of love it or hate it scent – it wasn’t a generic fruity floral, and it was clear she had her own opinions about it, which is why I think it was so successful. Even if it’s just a thought about what the fragrance should be, it makes a difference. On the other hand, I was at another launch once when the celebrity in question was asked how she felt about her perfume. She replied: ‘Oh, I haven’t tried it yet!’”"
380;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-11-04T18:15:55Z;Pepsi to sell Chinese bottling operations;;PepsiCo, the US drinks and snacks group, said on Friday that it was selling its Chinese bottling operations to Tingyi Holding, the Tianjin-based Taiwanese beverage company, as it looks to expand its presence in the world’s fastest-growing drinks market.Pepsi said it will take a 5 per cent stake in Tingyi’s beverage subsidiary, which will become its franchise bottler in China. It will have the option of expanding that holding to a 20 per cent stake by 2015.The move comes as Pepsi is working to catch up with rival Coca-Cola in China. According to data from Beverage Digest, Coke currently controls 55 per cent of the carbonated soft drinks market in China, with Pepsi at 32 per cent.“To win globally, we need to have absolutely the best business partners locally,” Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive, said in a statement.Tingyi will sell and distribute Pepsi’s carbonated beverage and Gatorade brands and will co-brand its juice products with Tropicana. Pepsi said that the joint venture would allow it to distribute its products more efficiently across China and to cut costs.“Tingyi and PepsiCo will continue building up the capacity to seize market opportunities and satisfy consumers’ diversified demands with world-class products,” said Wei Ing-Chou, Tingyi’s chief executive.Analysts at Barclays estimate the potential value of a 20 per cent stake in Tingyi’s beverage business at $14.2bn and note that Pepsi’s Chinese bottling business was worth about $600m, while losing $175m after taxes in 2009 and 2010.Pepsi’s franchise model in China and in other international markets is different from in the US, where last year it acquired its bottlersAccording to Steve Powers, beverage analyst at Bernstein Research, the deal will help Pepsi because it will not have to spend as much money investing in distribution infrastructure in China and because Tingyi will have its own motivations to expand.“If they can get the deal structure in place, they’ll be a more formidable competitor to Coke,” Mr Powers said. “It if works, it can be a powerful combination.”PepsiCo has been investing heavily in China recently. Last year, it announced a $2.5bn investment over three years, after announcing a $1bn investment in 2008.In August, Coke said it was it was increasing its focus on China with a $4bn investment over the next three years.Shares of Pepsi slipped 1.29 per cent to $61.99 in midday trading.

383;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-31T19:54:16Z;Welcome to London 2012: the apparatchiks’ games;Britain’s capital city is promised an exercise in authoritarian elitism to rival Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union, writes Philip Stephens;Thinking of visiting London next summer? Here is some gentle advice. Think again. Britain’s capital city is playing host to the Olympics. Unless you have tickets to the 100m finals, you would do well to stay away.London 2012 was billed as a celebration of the vitality, youth and diversity that have made the city a global hub. Multicultural London triumphed over provincial Paris. All trace of such romanticism is now being extinguished in the cause of cash and comfort for the games’ organisers.London is promised an exercise in authoritarian elitism to rival Leonid Brezhnev’s Soviet Union. The people’s games have been turned into the apparatchiks’ Olympics. The stadiums and arenas will overflow with politicians, bureaucrats and corporate sponsors. More than 1m ordinary families have failed to secure a single ticket even to the opening stages of the most obscure Olympic sports.Civil liberties are to be suspended for the duration of the games. David Cameron’s government is promising draconian penalties for anyone who dares jeopardise the exclusive rights of commercial partners such as McDonald’s and Coca-Cola.The long arm of Olympic law will reach well beyond running tracks, pools and velodromes. Advertising sponsors have been promised what is chillingly called a “clean city”, handing them ownership of everything within camera distance of the games. Wear a T-shirt expressing a preference for Burger King and Pepsi and you may be thrown into the Tower. The crackdown extends to what the Olympic Stasi call “advertising on the human body”. Freedom of expression can go hang.For those lucky enough to have secured tickets in the public draw, the air is thick with warnings that London’s creaking infrastructure will crack under the weight of visitors. Cars are banned for all but the privileged, but the mayor’s office concedes that public transport will struggle to meet the demands of the Olympics and daily life. Even during the August holiday season, trains are already packed to overflowing.The system will work only if Londoners abandon their daily commute. Those who cannot rearrange holiday plans are being told to work from home. No one will miss the bankers who inhabit the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf, but it is a bit tough if you are a doctor or a plumber.Even then, travel will be at snail’s pace. The journey time from city centre to the Olympic stadium should be 35 minutes by underground rail. The authorities say that once crowd control and security measures are put in place, the trip will take more than two hours.All this is to one purpose: to make life comfortable for the privileged elite that goes by the name of the “Olympic family”. I am not talking about competitors. Most would agree the runners, riders and rowers should be cossetted. No, the “family” comprises the 40,000 – yes 40,000 – Olympic bigwigs, national bureaucrats, commercial sponsors, hangers on and politicians who are preparing to slip into all the best seats at all the best events.These oligarchs of sport have already grabbed every half-decent hotel room in the capital. They will whizz from their Park Lane suites to the Olympic venues along 100 miles of dedicated Zil lanes carved from an already congested road network.Traffic lights will be programmed to turn green as the limousines approach and red again as they pass. Ordinary folk who inadvertently stray into the reserved lanes will face draconian fines. Penalties for parking in Olympic “exclusion zones” will rise tenfold.There is always, you could say, the legacy. The promise was that the billions in public money poured into the Olympics would provide a lasting bequest to regeneration, youth opportunity and sport in one of the British capital’s most deprived areas.Ah, the legacy. The charitable Wellcome Trust came up with a glorious plan to turn the Olympic Park into a world-class centre for the life sciences and advanced technology. The powers that be had other ideas. The site is being sold off to property speculators.The privileged 40,000 will not entirely escape the inconvenience inflicted on everyone else. Most will come through Heathrow, the dismal collection of overcrowded sheds that passes for London’s main airport. There they will experience the dinginess, congestion, queues and delays that Heathrow has made its trademark. On my last visit, the journey through immigration and baggage reclaim was taking two hours. Wait for the Olympics.I hope I am wrong about all this. Perhaps everything will run smoothly. The roads will be empty, the trains on time, and the police will refuse to enforce ridiculous and repressive laws. The sporting spectacle will be memorable, and the world will see London at its best. Britain might even win a clutch of medals. Yes, it could just work. As long, that is, as everyone stays away.
384;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-30T18:46:13Z;US groups fear effects of a stronger dollar;;The risk of a stronger dollar is becoming as big a concern as commodity inflation for US consumer goods companies ranging from the maker of Huggies nappies to PepsiCo.Thomas Falk, chief executive of Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies and Kleenex tissues, told analysts last week that currency moves were likely to dent the company’s earnings this quarter just as the negative impact of higher material costs was beginning to abate.“Commodity costs will be a little bit better [in the] fourth quarter versus [the] third quarter – still higher than last year, but [they] should be sequentially better,” he said. “Currency will be a drag. And so that’ll partially offset [slowing cost inflation].”US consumer goods makers have suffered from a two-year rally in commodity prices that has steadily eroded their profit margins, but they benefited from a parallel weakening of the dollar, which raised the value of their foreign earnings in their home currency.Although Kimberly-Clark and its biggest rivals in household and personal products – Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive – all said higher input costs had eaten into their profits in the third quarter, the market trends behind the problem have been shifting.The dollar strengthened by 5.7 per cent on a trade-weighted basis in the three months to the end of September, while the IMF Commodity Index fell back by 4.6 per cent.Jon Moeller, P&G’s chief financial officer, said last week: “Typically when we see a commodity help, we …have a currency hurt. Typically when we see a commodity hurt, we …have a currency help.”He said currency trends were a “negative development” for P&G, which makes Tide laundry detergent and Gillette razors, but that the group would continue to face “very difficult commodity cost comparisons” in the current quarter.Commodity prices have eased in recent months amid signs of slowing global growth and concerns about the effect of the eurozone debt crisis. Some, such as iron ore, have fallen more than 30 per cent. However, the prices of many commodities that are crucial for consumer goods companies, such as crude oil and grains, remain stubbornly high.All consumer companies have sought to mitigate the impact of higher materials costs by passing some of them on to consumers through raised prices.Steve Powers, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said a retreat in commodities would not necessarily provide relief for consumers. Instead companies such as Coca-Cola would need to continue raising prices because they would lose the currency tailwinds that had been helping them absorb cost increases.Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s chief financial officer, said earlier this month that due to a stronger US dollar the company now expected currency effects to add 1 percentage point rather than 2 percentage points to its earnings growth in its current fiscal year.Since the start of October the dollar has weakened again by 4.4 per cent, but some analysts say it could strengthen if the US economy picks up.Across the consumer sector, foreign exchange effects will cut 2 to 3 percentage points off earnings over the next 12 months, according to analysts at Sanford Bernstein.
385;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Obesity: An ever heftier problem;Industry under fire for what many see as undue influence over health policy;"In the food fight between governments and the “big snack” sector, Ronald McDonald and Tony the Tiger appear to have won the latest round. As ambassadors for multinationals that sell fast food and sugary cereal, the duo boast powerful backers. So it was perhaps less than surprising that US regulators this month retreated from proposals to ban the advertising of less healthy foods to children in a drive to combat ballooning rates of obesity.Five years after the ranks of the obese overtook the number of malnourished in the world, numerous governments are acting to tackle a problem that is taking its toll on public health, healthcare budgets and workplace productivity alike. The global bill for type 2 diabetes alone, a condition brought on largely by being overweight, will on some estimates approach an annual $500bn by 2030.That has sparked a debate over the role played by the food and drinks industry in setting the policy agenda. Critics charge that manufacturers of products that many see as contributing to the obesity epidemic increasingly wield undue influence over governments and social policymaking through their lobbying dollars. For its part, the industry argues that it is working in partnership on the issue and that self-regulation will prove more effective than measures, such as taxes and advertising restrictions, which it says will have costs that struggling households can ill-afford.But can an industry that is seen as a big part of the problem also be part of the solution? The question was highlighted in New York last month at a UN summit on non-communicable diseases, many of which are caused by obesity. A decision to place business interests and advocacy groups under the same “civil society” banner irked non-governmental organisations that believe food and beverage companies should not be involved in setting policy but be brought into the process only at the implementation stage. For some, the omission of targets from the final document was taken as evidence of effective industry lobbying.Weighty question Can an industry seen as part of the problem also be part of the solution? The question was highlighted at last month’s UN summit on non-communicable diseases, many of which are caused by obesity. Some saw the omission of targets from the final document as evidence of effective industry lobbyingSmoke free The industry is keen to distance itself from parallels with tobacco, citing a lack of precise proven correlation between its products and the growing global burden of cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseaseNew markets Manufacturer behaviour is hard to monitor at global level – and fears remain that food producers simply dump their less healthy offerings on poorer countries with weaker regulations“The reason we are particularly anxious they should not be there at the policy formulation stage is some of the policies one wants to discuss are controls on the market,” says Tim Lobstein of the International Association for the Study of Obesity, funded in part by the European Commission and the World Health Organisation. “If industry is there it will be very vigorous in undermining this, because that’s what it doesn’t want.”Foodmakers retort that they too have an interest in prolonging life. “We want consumers coming back to us in the long term, enjoying products that are good for their health, or we will lose them, from a purely business point of view,” says Derek Yach of PepsiCo, the US beverages and snacks maker. Some governments appear to buy this line. On the Responsibility Deal Food Network, Britain’s task force on the issue, business interests have more representatives – six out 12 – than any other group.This blending of industry and advocacy groups led to the crumbling of a similar deal on alcohol – NGOs walked out after grumbling that spirits producers had seized control of policymaking – but food manufacturers are quick to insist their network is one of equals. “This is not a lovey group on behalf of industry. It’s a partnership we believe will move quicker and make more progress working together as a group,” says Fiona Dawson, president of Mars Chocolate UK and a member of the food network.The structure chimes with the UK’s strategy of “nudging” citizens into correct habits rather than wielding a legislative stick. Academics such as Harvard University’s Edward Glaeser see this type of “soft paternalism” as an “emotional tax on behaviour, which yields no government revenues”. But Anne Milton, Britain’s public health minister, bristles at any suggestion of laxity. “I don’t think we are at the soft end on this. There are already quite a lot of regulations out there about food, particularly on advertising to children,” she says.…Across the Atlantic, the industry fended off the recent move towards tougher rules by marshalling numbers, rhetoric and a dose of ridicule to keep airing advertisements to children over the age of 11. “Does anyone seriously believe that ‘voluntarily’ removing corporate icons such as Tony the Tiger or making ‘Snap, Crackle and Pop’ Public Enemy Number 1 or removing pictures of well-known athletes from cereal boxes would materially reduce childhood obesity?” wrote Daniel Jaffe of the Association of National Advertisers, a US marketing organisation, in congressional testimony.There is, however, evidence to the contrary. After the UK government ordered curbs on advertising fatty, sugary and salty foods to children, children’s body mass index dropped, a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found. In the case of self-regulation, “the effects of the intervention were assumed to be half of those produced by formal regulatory measures, because of possibly looser limitations self-imposed on advertising and a less than universal compliance to the voluntary arrangements,” the Paris think-tank concluded.Yet industry has a back-up answer to that one too: shackle us with restrictions and you choke off jobs. The more successful curbs on advertising are, “the greater will be the economic damage to jobs and numerous businesses”, wrote Mr Jaffe.For Rhona Applebaum, chief regulatory officer of Coca-Cola, taxes conjure up pictures of a Big Brother state. “It’s almost a rat in a cage model, where they are giving us the food and taking our choice away. We’re not going to control all human behaviour, nor should we strive to. If you give people the information, 99 per cent of the time they’re going to make the right decision.”Denmark is not the only country to combat obesity with fiscal levers – Hungary recently brought in a tax targeting soft drinks and snacks; France too is planning a levy on soft drinks, write Louise Lucas and Clare MacCarthy. But when Copenhagen imposed the world’s first “fat tax” this month, it highlighted something of an anomaly.For as well as its famed buttery pastries, Denmark also produces relatively slim people. About 13 per cent of the population was classed as obese last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, lower than the European average. The goal, according to the previous government, which introduced the levy, was to raise life expectancy.The tax – DKr16 ($2.98) per kilogramme of saturated fat in a product – will increase the price of a burger by about $0.15 and that of a pack of butter by about $0.50.Critics contend that the levy is complicated and costly to calculate, and harms business. With suppliers refusing to issue details on ingredients, some stockists have dropped speciality products such as Tuscan salami. Swedish supermarkets have reported a run on butter as Danish shoppers cross the border seeking cheaper fare. And the Danish bakers’ guild has complained to the European Union that the levy skews competitiveness: Danish-made deep-fried Christmas cookies are levied on the oil used to cook them, including the fat that remains in the vat. The charge on their German-made equivalents covers only the fat content of the finished product.Officials counter that calculating the fat content of most dairy products and oils is “administratively relatively simple”. Government guidelines, however, show the process can be arcane: fat levels in sunflower seeds from a south-facing Spanish field can be different from those grown in Germany. The milk of cattle fed on fresh grass all summer will differ from the output of those fed on hay.Despite generating an expected DKr550m in extra public revenues this year, the surcharge could soon be overhauled: the new centre-left government is considering changes in response to business and consumer protests. Christian Bitz, Denmark’s favourite television nutritionist, offers an attractively simple alternative – why not just drop value added tax on healthy food such as fruit and vegetables instead?Persuading the authorities to make their own “right decision” is a process on which her company and its rivals, meanwhile, lavish both attention and cash. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a US consumer advocacy group, Coca-Cola has spent nearly $25m on government lobbying in the past six years, and PepsiCo close to $19m. Both complain about being unfairly targeted as culprits of obesity, while acknowledging that their products should be used in moderation and not marketed aggressively towards children.Above all, the industry is keen to distance itself from parallels with tobacco. Its arguments include the lack of a precise proven correlation between its products and the growing global burden of cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease; and the fact that, unlike tobacco, moderate consumption of food and drink is not only harmless but also necessary.“It’s a fundamental mistake to think you can apply tobacco policy to food policy. Tobacco policy worked because every type of tobacco can be taxed. We have no idea if people will switch to other beverages with higher calorie content if sodas are taxed,” says Pepsi’s Mr Yach.Lobbying is not the only weapon in companies’ arsenal. Producers are themselves removing fats, sugars and salt by the truckload. Nestlé, the world’s biggest food producer by sales, recites the tens of thousands of tonnes of bad fats, salt and sugar it has cut from its output worldwide. Kraft, a main competitor, has set a goal of reducing sodium by an average of 10 per cent across its North American portfolio by next year and has reformulated about one-quarter of its products in the US since 2005.…Even these moves raise cavils, however. For one, cautions the obesity association’s Mr Lobstein, the small print does not always bear out the headlines. He cites PepsiCo’s pledge to reduce the average sugar level in its drinks. It can do this, he says, while keeping sugar amounts constant – just so long as it sells even more cans of low- or zero-calorie drinks.Second, voluntary pledges can be overturned on a whim. Campbell Soups did just this when it announced last July – in a statement to investors headed “Campbell continues to provide consumers with an array of lower-sodium choices” – that it would be “improving the taste” of 31 soups with “a variety of flavours and seasonings, including increased salt”.Third, manufacturer behaviour is difficult to monitor effectively at global level – and the fear remains that food producers “do a tobacco” and simply bump their less healthy offerings into poorer countries with weaker regulations. There they are free to use tactics, such as advertising targeted at children, that are no longer acceptable in the west.In China, which has seen the biggest growth in diabetes in both percentage terms and absolute numbers – 92m have the condition and another 140m are on track to acquire it, according to the International Diabetes Federation – the debate shaping a public agenda on obesity is just beginning. India trails even further behind.Beyond China and India are a long list of smaller countries that are no match for the might of business: 60 per cent of the world’s nations have an economic output lower than the annual turnover of the top five food and beverage companies, according to one academic’s calculations.It is in these countries too that particularly questionable tactics for marketing to children are in evidence. Consumers International, a UK-based watchdog, points to Kentucky Fried Chicken’s Chicky Club in Malaysia, the biggest children’s membership organisation in the country, which offers discounts on unhealthy products directly to children. In the Philippines, Nestlé’s “fuel for school” television commercial alludes to increased academic performance from eating its high-sugar Koko Krunch cereal.Nestlé says the advertisement merely “communicates that eating breakfast is a good start to help children perform well at school”.The OECD finds counter-productive effects from the preponderance of food companies that help to run health education and exercise initiatives, such as Coca-Cola’s and Kraft’s after-school health and wellness programmes for pupils. “These initiatives likely contribute to brand loyalty and may even increase consumption of the products of the sponsoring firms by those who are exposed to them,” says the report.For the industry, this is all part of its well-meant efforts. But as the survival of Ronald McDonald and Tony the Kellogg tiger suggests, the common ground only goes so far – perhaps just so far as agreeing that no one wants to be fat.For some, those extra layers of blubber are the profits of the food and drink industry made flesh. Others demur. Says Michael Silverstein of Boston Consulting Group: “It’s not the food industry’s fault. It’s the human condition.”"
386;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-26T08:22:58Z;IBM names Rometty as next chief executive;First female head of 100-year-old company;IBM has named Virginia Rometty to succeed Sam Palmisano as its chief executive from the start of next year, making her the first female leader in the 100-year history of the US computing giant and one of only a handful of women to head a large US corporation.Currently head of sales, marketing and strategy, Ms Rometty is also the first head of IBM not to have run part of its traditional hardware business. At one time she headed the business services unit that accounts for around a third of IBM’s total services division, but has otherwise spent her 30-year career at the company mainly in sales and marketing roles.In an interview, she brushed aside questions about her relative lack of broad operating management experience, adding that services now accounted for some 60 per cent of IBM’s total business. Also, having led sales in some of IBM’s main markets, she stressed her experience in packaging IBM’s range of hardware, software and services into broad solutions for its customers – that core of the approach that has seen the company rebound under Mr Palmisano to become the biggest supplier of technology to big companies and governments.“The 15-year arc of IBM has been about services, and she’s been right in the middle of that,” said George Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research.A close lieutenant of Mr Palmisano during his decade at the helm, Ms Rometty was instrumental in planning the 2002 acquisition of the PwC consulting business that broadened IBM’s range and added a stronger business component to its technology skills. She was also given the job of integrating the business with IBM’s other units, helping to make a success of Mr Palmisano’s riskiest corporate gamble.“He stuck his neck out, and it was Ginni that made it work,” said Bob Djurjevic, an analyst at Annex Research.Ms Rometty, 54, had been the favourite to succeed Mr Palmisano, who earlier this year passed 60, the normal retirement age for IBM CEOs. Other executives elevated by a management reorganisation last year into positions that made them potential successors included Steve Mills, head of software, and Mike Daniels, head of services. However, both are closer to the company’s retirement age and had been seen as less likely candidates for the CEO job.Her appointment makes IBM the largest company with a female chief executive, ahead of PepsiCo, where Indra Nooyi has served as chief executive and president since October 2006.Ms Rometty will now compete with Hewlett-Packard’s chief executive Meg Whitman for the unofficial title of most powerful woman in technology, continuing the bitter rivalry between the two companies. Other high-profile female chief executives in the technology and industrial sector include Ursula Burns of Xerox and Ellen Kullman of DuPont.Ms Rometty joined IBM in 1981 as a systems engineer. She takes charge of the company as steady profit growth has lifted the value of its shares to the highest since the company went public in 1915. Earlier this year it briefly topped Microsoft to become the second most valuable technology company after Apple, capping a turnaround that began in the early 1990s after it fell behind in the early days of the PC era.
387;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-24T22:40:05Z;A new kind of benevolence;;"A harried new mother reaches for a packet of nappies in Belgium and in Bangladesh a baby is vaccinated against tetanus; in San Francisco, a teenage boy swigs a bottle of fizzy drink and an Ethiopian chickpea farmer becomes a little bit richer.Consumer-facing multinationals, having banged the drum on corporate and social sustainability, are also turning their attention to a more tangible social issue: the world’s poor.An increasing number of initiatives have been designed to spark the interest of consumers, who have become increasingly apathetic and cynical about environmental claims, while keeping other stakeholders – particularly investors and employees – on side. A recent global study by Nielsen found that US consumers recorded one of the steepest declines in concern about global warming: less than half of Americans polled fret about climate change and only 58 per cent of Britons do.Thus, at last month’s Clinton Global Initiative– former US president Bill Clinton’s annual philanthropic summit, which attracts business executives, celebrities and heads of non-profit organisations – a slew of heart-warming deals were launched, ranging from efforts to restore sight to the blind to coaching young adults and eradicating disease.Meanwhile, Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer goods company, has put the heft of its $9bn Pampers nappies brand behind a campaign, conducted with Unicef, to help protect 100m women and babies from tetanus. For each pack of nappies sold, Procter & Gamble will donate one tetanus vaccine.“Baby care consumers want a clear idea of the benefits,” says Matthew Price, an executive at Procter & Gamble who heads the Pampers-Unicef initiative. “This is an emotional story.”Emotional, but not purely altruistic. P&G says it recoups the 7 cents per vaccine it donates through increased sales because of the vaccine campaign marketing.Similar initiatives by companies in other sectors tick different commercial boxes: food and drink companies’ support of smallholders helps ensure security of supply; drugmakers Eli Lilly and Dow Chemical both have pledges to help educate the next generation of scientists.Derek Yach, senior vice-president for global health policy at PepsiCo, is clear that the US beverage and snack group’s project helping chickpea farmers in Ethiopia improve productivity fits firmly into the bigger corporate picture. The company, which has already established its agronomist credentials through potato farming in China and sunflower oil farming in Mexico, literally reaps what it sows: potatoes and oil in crisps, chickpeas in hummus and smoothies.“As a company, we felt we needed to start diversifying our supply chain, first in terms of where we source for our global business and look to where we could boost [production] without changing the environment,” he explains.The company also aims to lift communities out of poverty and turn subsistence farmers into entrepreneurs through the provision of superior seeds, training in modern farming methods and irrigation.Similar projects are being carried out across the globe by other companies. Nestlé, the world’s biggest food and drink company by sales, deals with more than 500m farmers who supply it with everything from crops to milk. SABMiller, which derives 80 per cent of sales from emerging markets, has 28,000 smallholders, 19,000 of which are in Africa, from whom it buys grains.Both organisations are providing farmers with training and specialist knowledge on how to improve crop yields which, in turn, helps the companies improve the quality of their products.Today’s corporate benefactors thus clearly have an eye on their own commercial concerns, as well as wider society. But this was not always the case.“Traditionally, these were done from a purely philanthropic perspective and in a somewhat haphazard way,” says Karina Litvack, head of governance and sustainable investment at UK-based F&C Investments.If charity begins at home, philanthropy often begins on the farm. Food and drink manufacturers are pouring resources into farmers, helping them procure superior quality seeds and teaching modern agricultural methods.The aim is two-pronged: improved yields for manufacturers and more money for farmers. Nestlé says that by replacing cocoa trees in Ivory Coast with varieties that produce three times more cocoa beans, a farmer’s annual income of $480 per hectare is likely to more than treble to $1,800 per hectare.This has led to the rise of a relatively new figure on corporate payrolls: the agronomist, teaching the benefits of modern farming.The role can, however, extend to helping procure equipment or liaising with banks to arrange better terms for loans.Thus PepsiCo, which works with 25,000 farmers globally, has 200 agronomists on its books. Nestlé employs 1,000 agronomists and SABMiller has 60.But an increasing number of companies, she says, are now carrying out extensive research and engaging in activities directly linked to their business. Ms Litvack cites as examples mining companies offering treatments for HIV to employees and staff.It is also a strategic decision that reflects a growing focus on fast- growing emerging markets. Companies hope that building loyalty and a reputation now will pay dividends when incomes rise and consumers in a country turn from recipients of aid to buyers of goods.It may be some time before Bangladeshi mothers are bulk-buying Pampers, but in Ethiopia – where gross domestic product, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, is expected to grow 7.75 per cent in 2011-2012 – consumers are a ready market for processed chickpeas.Indeed, says Mr Yach, in a country where the Ethiopian Orthodox Church prohibits the eating of certain meats and dairy products for up to 200 days a year, the market for alternative proteins is particularly attractive.However, doing good is not always easy. A report by Saïd Business School’s Linda Scott, Mary Johnstone-Louis and Catherine Dolan on the Pampers initiative lays bare an intricate administration and bickering over minutiae.Even after P&G acceded to a last-minute 40 per cent increase in the cost of the vaccine, there were further problems getting it to recipients, who were often in remote places and un­able to fund the long trek for a free jab.The use of celebrities by P&G caused another spat. P&G uses stars, such as actress Salma Hayek, to advertise its products, and liked taking them – along with top-ranking staff and press – to watch the vaccines being administered. According to the report, the celebrity focus “was unseemly, perhaps too commercial for Unicef . . . [whose field offices] sometimes grumbled that these press junkets were an unwelcome distraction”.Success also brought its own pitfalls. According to the report, gung-ho Procter & Gamble employees wanted to roll the campaign out to other products in the portfolio, where the link with babies was rather more tenuous, such as Ariel washing powder and Duracell batteries.Yet, despite such pitfalls, “everyone has benefited,” says Ms Scott. Procter & Gamble sold more nappies, gaining share even in mature markets and Unicef also built its brand. Tim Hunter, Unicef’s international fundraising director, says: “This is a great way of engaging with an audience, which Unicef would not be able to do itself because we don’t have the big ad agencies.”"
388;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-23T23:24:52Z;Value-added travel;Globetrotting students find not everyone does business the same way, writes Vincent Bevins;Carlos Quintana is Mexican and Genilson Melo is Brazilian. But their small national differences are nothing compared with the unexpected cultural challenges they face studying together on the executive MBA programme at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) in São Paulo, Brazil. What has proved most demanding is working on projects via phone and email with a team scattered around the world and who are all from different nationalities and sectors.“I think most of us were surprised by how difficult it would be to really work with people from different business cultures around the world, since we mostly have already had plenty of international experience,” says Melo. “But we’d often stayed within our own hemispheres or at least our own sectors or companies. Dealing with truly different cultures has proved a real challenge, which I suppose speaks to the value of doing a course like this.”“Maybe we didn’t know it,” adds Quintana, “but this kind of tough lesson is probably something we needed.”Melo, financial manager at Copersucar, Brazil’s largest sugar and ethanol exporter, and Quintana, director of compensation at PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks company, in Mexico, are on the Global Executive MBA programme, one of a number of EMBAs focused on giving working professionals a truly international experience in addition to more traditional coursework.On the OneMBA programme, participants are based either at FGV in Brazil, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Egade Business School in Monterrey, Mexico, Rotterdam School of Management at Erasmus University in the Netherlands or Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina in the US. Students meet periodically at their home campuses, spend some time studying at each of the others, and in between – over the course of the 21-month programme – work on projects in teams made up of students from all the other locations.Elsewhere, on the Georgetown/Esade Global Executive MBA programme, students of various nationalities do not have a home base close to where they live or work, but travel to meet for 12 days of intensive, non-stop coursework six times over two years. What amounts to 60 working days of study – on location in Washington DC, Barcelona, São Paulo or Buenos Aires, Bangalore, Beijing or Shanghai, and New York – includes special attention given to international geopolitics.“Normally the participants recognise their need to do the global executive MBA,” says Pollyanna Nethersole, associate director of admissions at Esade Business School in Spain. “Either they wish to conduct an international career, or they have already been doing so for several years.” She says three special themes loom large in the course – local-company case studies at each of the international locations, management and leadership skills, and the global business environment.It is important for students to be certain this type of programme is what they want, say Melo and Quintana. That is not only because of the cost – the OneMBA costs R$112,000 ($60,000) if based in São Paulo – but also because they are so demanding.In addition to carefully selecting candidates to maximise interaction at high-executive level across national and sector boundaries, such programmes attempt to ensure participants get the most from every hour they can carve out from their professional and family lives.“We aren’t allowed to miss our classes or our meetings with global teams,” says Quintana. “This has led to some tense conversations with the directors in Mexico City when it meant I had to miss important PepsiCo meetings. But they had to understand: I’m doing this course.”“It can be tough to juggle home, office, classroom, and global projects,” says Melo. “But that’s another skill we need to build.”Didier Guillot, director of FGV’s Hong Kong programme, says he sometimes discourages students he thinks really want something else. “There is a big gap between a normal MBA in Hong Kong and the Executive MBA,” Guillot says. “Most international MBAs here are based exclusively on mainland China. For students that only want to put their focus there, we tell them to stay with the local programmes.”That is not the only warning. “I tell them: ‘This is going to be a challenging programme,’” Guillot says. “They think they are prepared to work with global teammates, and I tell them: ‘Be really, really careful, because you only have experienced this in your own business.’ I don’t think they anticipate the difficulty of this. That is exactly what we want.”Indeed, it seems the programme aims to force learning by wrenching students out of their comfortable routines, before globalisation itself inevitably does so.“These people are executives. They are bosses,” says Marina Heck, associate dean for the FGV programme. “Here, they become students and have to work with people they can’t command. This obliges them into some kind of sociability. If you put five stars in a room and tell them to make a decision, it’s not easy.”Melo and Quintana recall some such moments with looks of exasperation. “We in the Americas or Europe tended to assume that once a clear majority came to one conclusion, the decision was made,” says Melo. “But our colleagues in Asia tended to insist that everyone fall into line before a conclusion was reached. I’d never dealt with that.”But both say they emerged from such delicate negotiations with valuable experience and a network of contacts abroad. And for the moment, all has been resolved. They are planning to go for drinks after the last day of class in this round – and not talk too much about the course.
389;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-23T23:24:10Z;On management: Different strokes;For some of the world’s most successful companies, going against the flow has been the key;"It is a curious fact that in industry after industry there is at least one company that appears to succeed not by doing the same thing better than everyone else but by playing a completely different game.Take Apple. The technology company is unique: this vertically integrated corporate dictatorship makes expensive, beautiful niche products that have revolutionised several industries (not counting retail, of which it is also now a most skilful exponent).Or Toyota, which despite recent slip-ups, it is still the most formidable car manufacturer. Probably not one in 100 people could name its chief executive, and its management processes are so grooved that appointing a new one causes as much ripple as changing a lightbulb. The Toyota Production System, a wonder of the industrial world rivalling the original assembly line as the most studied industrial phenomenon of all time, sets the carmaker apart from less successful competitors.John Lewis’s model – the department store is owned by its employees – is unique, but its rivals would love the same rapport with their customers. Equally distinct from the norm is Whole Foods Market, an upmarket organics chain whose chief executive, John Mackey, is a libertarian capitalist, yet the company has a salary cap that limits compensation for everyone to 19 times the average wage of an employee. Semco, the extraordinarily successful Brazilian mini-conglomerate, has no corporate rule book and allows employees to set their own salaries. At WL Gore, the maker of Gore-Tex fabric, there are no formal management titles: leaders become leaders by attracting followers. Lonely Planet was founded by a couple of hippies – which did not stop it from turning the guidebook industry on its ear.Yet it is as if companies such as these are invisible to conventional management wisdom. They are explained away as exceptions that prove the rule or appropriated as examples of radical differentiation (true, but that does not get us very far). Or they are simply ignored. The result is that, far from being allowed to challenge the paradigm of the day, they are co-opted into it.Such marginalisation is harder to sustain since 2008. The collapse of major financial institutions was as much a challenge to management as to economics, undercutting assumptions about reward, recruitment, risk, strategy and governance.In this light, perhaps the “exceptions” have something to tell us. If they are seen not as exotic outliers, but the advance guard of a new order, the first obvious quality that these companies share is a sense of purpose beyond making money for shareholders. As Steve Jobs, Apple’s founder who died earlier this month, famously asked John Sculley, the former president of PepsiCo who became the chief executive of Apple, in 1983: “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?” Apple’s products and Toyota’s processes did alter perceptions of the world; but all the exceptions share the belief that they do not need to accept the world as others see it.The introduction of products such as the iPod, iPhone and iPad under Steve Jobs’ leadership turned Apple into the world’s most valuable technology company. He died on October 5 2011 at the age of 56.They all back purpose with guiding principles. For Lonely Planet’s founders, it was to write guidebooks for poor but obsessive travellers such as themselves. For Ricardo Semmler of Semco and Bill Gore it was stripping away management to free ordinary people to work creatively. Jobs again: the Macintosh computer turned out so well, he said, “because the people working on it were musicians, artists, poets and historians who also happened to be excellent computer scientists”.These businesses all temper purpose (or the founder’s personality) with a visceral connection to the customer: they are “outside-in”. Toyota’s “pull” production system, geared to delivering a car to the customer in minimum time and with minimum fuss, is the archetype here. Purpose and principles are held together by measures that track the organisation’s purpose, not the City’s or Wall Street’s.Still not convinced? The biggest, indeed elephant-sized, exception to its industry is an investment company that obeys all the above requirements. It denounces derivatives, eschews hedge funds and invests only in real firms making real goods and services that it understands. Its preferred holding time is “forever”. It is, of course, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which since 1965 has provided shareholders with a compounded annual book-value gain of 20.2 per cent, for a total increase of 490,409 per cent.Perhaps Management 2.0 does not need to be invented. It is already here, just – as science fiction writer William Gibson said of the future – unevenly distributed."
390;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-20T23:55:37Z;Britvic posts flat sales in a growing market;;Britvic, the soft drinks maker, lost market share in the fourth quarter, reporting flat revenues in Britain in a growing market.For the full year, the maker of Robinsons, Tango and Fruit Shoot drinks saw overall revenues rise 14.6 per cent to £1.29bn ($2.04bn). Stripping out France, which was only included for four months of the past year, revenues were up 0.8 per cent. Market share in the full year slipped 20 basis points.Revenues in Ireland, which are about one-fifth the size in Britain, slumped 8.3 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter, attributed in part to the “very challenging” macroeconomic conditions that Paul Moody, chief executive, said had a big influence on consumers.This is expected to remain. “They do have a Budget in December which we would expect to contain some reduction in government expenditure but also some increase in taxes, so I would expect it will still be a challenged market,” Mr Moody said.Tough economic times shaped drinking habits of the British, with more people switching to cheaper fizzy drinks. That impacts margins. Britvic is the bottler for third-party brands including Pepsi, and as such keeps lesser profit. Collins Stewart estimates the gross margin on still drinks can be up to three times higher.Total sales in Britain rose 2.5 per cent, but while the bigger carbonates business was up 8.3 per cent in the quarter, still drinks fell 5.2 per cent.Mr Moody said he has taken a “pessimistic view” on the UK consumer. “As you look out over the next 12 months, we have inflation running at 5.2 per cent, energy costs going up, unemployment growing and we expect that to bite harder next year.”Despite this, he noted that soft drinks are relatively resilient, as demonstrated by Britvic’s full-year performance.The nascent international business, worth a modest £29m in the full year, grew the strongest, up 9.5 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter.Analysts broadly welcomed the trading update, and the shares – which have underperformed the broader market by 27 per cent so far this year – closed up 6.39 per cent at 328p.Damien McNeela, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the update showed trading in line with expectations. “We expect Britvic’s margins to improve through fiscal year 2012 as input cost pressures ease and cost saving initiatives take effect,” he wrote in a report to clients.The group will announce its full-year results on November 30.
391;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-19T19:10:24Z;PepsiCo faces digital deception accusations;Group allegedly uses false advertising to lift sales;PepsiCo is under fire from consumer advocacy and privacy groups for allegedly using deceptive digital marketing practices to lift sales of unhealthy snacks to children.In a complaint to the US Federal Trade Commission filed on Wednesday, the groups allege that Pepsi disguised its marketing efforts as video games and online entertainment, used viral marketing in violation of FTC rules, and collected personal information without any notice and consent.“Pepsi designed these ad campaigns knowing full well that a teen would not know it was an ad,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, one of the groups behind the complaint. In doing so, he said, Pepsi violated Section 5 of the FTC Act that bans false advertising.In one campaign, Pepsi gave teens access to a website with exclusive content from pop singer Rihanna if they entered a code found on a bag of crisps. In another, it created an online house of horrors that collected personal information including a user’s birthday and phone number. Pepsi declined to comment.The complaint comes as food and beverage companies are coming under pressure to take more responsibility for the obesity crisis in the US. Last April, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the agriculture department released a set of voluntary guidelines that asked companies to promote healthy foods. It also urged them to avoid advertising targeted at children for unhealthy products.The food industry has resisted the plan as overly restrictive, saying it is not possible to discern what age group ads are targeting.The criticism of Pepsi’s marketing practices is a sensitive issue for Indra Nooyi, the company’s chief executive, who has made a focus on nutrition central to the company’s goals. Ms Nooyi has set a goal of tripling the company’s annual revenues from nutritional products to $30bn by 2020.However, the company has focused its advertising on younger consumers through its “next generation” campaigns. In August this year, Pepsi sought to tie its products more closely to the video gaming community, embedding special codes inside packages of Mountain Dew and Doritos’ tortilla chips that can be used while playing Modern Warfare 3.Parry Aftab, executive director of WiredSafety, a watchdog group not involved in the complaint, said her group had looked into Pepsi’s marketing practices but not found any problems. “Just because a company is selling products that are not healthy, it doesn’t mean we should stop them from communicating through games,” she said. “We need to pick our battles.”
392;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-17T16:52:56Z;Pepsi: bullish on Russia;;"While investors in Russia have been complaining recently that the “country is going down the toilet” and that Vladimir Putin “is in la la land on the budget”, there are some groups that seem to be perfectly content about the country’s political and fiscal direction. Take for instance Pepsico.Over the last decade, the company has invested $19bn in Russia, thanks to a close working relationship with the Kremlin leadership. And over the next two years, under Putin’s leadership, the company will invest an additional $1bn more, Indra Nooyi, Pepsico’s chief executive, said in Moscow on Monday after a meeting between Putin and global business leaders.Speaking to journalists at a separate event after the meeting, Nooyi said Pepsico was unpeturbed by Putin’s return to power.“The politics of Russia is not what worries us,” she said in a response to a question from beyondbrics. “We worry about whether the leadership is friendly to investment and I can tell you that over the last few decades the leadership in Russia has been friendly to Pepsi. And we’ve had a great record with them whether it is building plants, whether it is helping us through regulation and licenses to put in a potato crop, the Russian government has worked very constructively with us. And that’s what matters to us.”Nooyi met with Putin late last year when Pepsico was sealing its $5.4bn deal to acquire Wimm-Bill-Dann, the Russian dairy producer. Meanwhile Pepsico’s own relationship with Russia dates back to the 1950s when Soviet leader Nikita Kruschev was handed a cup of Pepsi by a young company executive at an American trade exhibition in Moscow.In her comments, Nooyi was bullish on Russia calling it a “well managed country” – a phrase that might not sit well with members of Moscow’s more liberal circles, but exemplifies all that has worked to Pepsico’s advantage here.“Surprisingly we view Russia’s volatility as less than other emerging markets’. If you trace the history of Russia, the fact that the consumer movement is now emerging is a good thing for us. It means years of growth,” Nooyi said.“Russia’s fundamentals are very good. It’s got a great base of oil, natural resources. It’s got all the basics required to be a successful country for the long term,” she added.Pepsico is now working on rolling out a Wimm-Bill-Dann dairy product within the next 12 months with the goal of having a Russian product become one of the group’s billion-dollar-brands.Among possible options are chocolate covered bars of curd cheese and a yogurt beverage mixed with fruits and grains which Nooyi said she had sampled for breakfast that morning.“I don’t know if it was a snack or a beverage. But after I drank it I was pretty full,” she said.It remains be seen whether American consumers will feel similarly.Related reading:

393;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-14T16:39:17Z;Unilever buys Russian beauty company;;"Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group, is beefing up its Russian portfolio with the acquisition of Concern Kalina in a deal that values the domestic beauty company’s equity at €500m ($693m).Unilever will initially pay €390m for an 82 per cent stake in Kalina, subject to regulatory approval, before launching a mandatory tender offer to buy the remaining shares. The deal is the latest in the consumer sector designed to tap into the Russian market, which is robust by European standards albeit less so than the other big emerging markets.Late last year PepsiCo made a $5.4bn bet on the Russian food and drinks market through the acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann, the dairy and fruit juice company. At the same time Danone of France acquired Russia’s Unimilk. Unilever itself acquired Inmarko ice-cream company in 2008.Unilever, which derives more than half its sales from emerging markets, has a weaker position in Russia than in Brazil and India. Announcing the deal, Paul Polman, chief executive, said the deal would transform its personal care business in Russia. “This . . . [gives] us leading positions in skin care and hair care, as well as establishing a presence in oral care. It will also strengthen and rebalance Unilever’s portfolio and competitive position in Russia, an emerging market with considerable potential and one of our priority countries.”Concern Kalina, Russia’s biggest local personal care company by sales, is expected to generate sales of €303m this year.The price tag implies an enterprise value to this year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation multiple of 11.7 times. This is higher than the multiple the Anglo-Dutch group paid for Sara Lee’s personal care business announced in 2009 but below what it paid for Alberto-Culver. Savings in the latest deal are expected to be modest.While Russia is seen as an attractive market for consumer companies, last year eastern Europe proved a disappointment for L’Oréal, the world’s biggest cosmetics company by sales. At the half-year stage turnover in the region fell 5.4 per cent year on year. Eastern Europe accounted for €325.3m of sales.It is understood L’Oréal participated in the auction for Kalina, although the French group declined to comment.Shares in Kalina, which has a free float of just 15 per cent, have shot up in recent weeks. Even at their elevated level, Unilever’s offer of Rb4.098 per A share represents an 86 per cent premium and it is more than three times the level of a few weeks ago.Analysts welcomed the deal, although Darren Shirley at Shore Capital said the group’s record in Russia was mixed with Inmarko proving “very successful” and the Baltimor sauce business “somewhat less so”.Unilever’s latest deal also illustrates the rebalancing of its portfolio more towards the higher margin personal care sector. A decade ago personal care accounted for one-fifth of group turnover; today it is nearer one-third.However, Mr Polman said the group’s ambitious targets to double turnover would still largely come organically. “Organic growth remains the cornerstone of our ambition to double the size of Unilever . . . Acquisitions such as Concern Kalina supplement organic growth and add powerful new brands to our portfolio.”"

Revenues have been boosted by a series of hotel acquisitions.Host rose 4.2 per cent to $62.70.“US corporate earnings continue to confound the market with their strength,” said Doug Cote, chief investment strategist at ING Investment Management.The S&P 500 moved above 1,200 for the first time this month, closing up 1 per cent 1,207.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 11,518.85, briefly straying into positive territory for the year in mid-afternoon, before closing a fraction in the red.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.8 per cent to 2,604.73.Traders are watching to see if the S&P 500 can break above 1,220, a level at which previous rallies this summer have broken down as investors booked profits.Networking equipment manufacturer Tellabs fell 5.3 per cent to $4.27, the biggest fall in the S&P 500 after its rival Adtran reduced guidance for fourth-quarter revenue.Adtran cited unexpectedly low demand from a main domestic client, which analysts believed to be mobile phone network AT&T.“Adtran’s guidance was a surprise, and I think Tellabs’ exposure to AT&T is definitely weighing on its share price,” said Blair King, an analyst at Avondale Partners. “There’s a concern that both Adtran and Tellabs might be left with a lot of unsold inventory.”Johnson Controls was up 5.2 per cent to $31.72 after the car parts manufacturer raised its full-year guidance to $44bn in sales and double-digit earnings growth.JC Penney was up 0.9 per cent to $30.23 after announcing the $288m capture of the Liz Claiborne and Monet fashion brands from Liz Claiborne Inc.Liz Claiborne shares were up 34.1 per cent to $6.84 after the company also announced the sale of its Kenzie brand to affiliates of brand management company Bluestar Alliance and the sale of its Dana Buchman brand to Kohl’s Corp.The Kenzie and Dana Buchman sales will net a further $40m. Kohl’s was up 0.6 per cent to $50.40 after the announcement.Sprint Nextel was up 7.6 per cent to $2.56 as optimism grew that the company may be able to raise capital required to roll out fourth-generation services and upgrade its network without issuing new equity and diluting existing shareholders.Genworth Financial was up 4.5 per cent to $5.87 on hopes that a European rescue package will forestall a spike in claims on its European consumer debt insurance product.Shares in Research In Motion were only down 2.2 per cent to $23.88, as service interruptions to its signature BlackBerry handsets began to impact on the stock price. RIM is still up 2.2 per cent for the week however.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was up 2.7 per cent, outperforming all other sectors, the day before JPMorgan kicks off the banks’ earning seasons. On Wednesday, Standard & Poor’s said analyst expectations of full-year earnings growth for the financials sector had ticked into negative territory for the first time, with earnings now expected to decline 1.4 per cent year on year for the sector.Citigroup was up 4.9 per cent to $29.20 and Wells Fargo was up 3.5 per cent to $26.95, as universal banks fared better than investment banks. Goldman Sachs was up 2.5 per cent to $99.11 and Morgan Stanley rose 2.9 per cent to $15.84. JPMorgan Chase was up 2.8 per cent to $33.20.
395;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-12T12:30:43Z;Pepsi executives resist calls for split;;PepsiCo executives defended the company’s structure on Wednesday, rebuffing suggestions from analysts that it would be better off splitting up.Speculation that Pepsi is ripe for a split began last summer after Kraft announced that it was spinning off its North American grocery unit and making its snacks business into a standalone company. That move appeared to be an about-face for Kraft, following several other high-profile splits this year, and raised questions about Pepsi’s future.“I firmly believe that PepsiCo’s value is maximised as one company,” said Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive. “It was created as an integrated snack and beverage business and its success is tied to this combination. This has been true in the past and will remain in the future.”Last month, analysts at Bernstein Research said that splitting Pepsi into separate food and beverage companies could make strategic sense and that Kraft, General Mills, Kellogg and even Coca-Cola could be potential bidders for the snacks portfolio. Analysts Edward Jones & Co said that if Pepsi imitated Kraft’s split, the individual companies would be more valuable, with shareholders standing to gain 49 per cent.Hugh Johnston, Pepsi’s chief financial officer, said the company is “extremely shareholder oriented” and is “turning over every stone” to unlock shareholder value, but that splitting would create additional costs without clear benefits. He said that in emerging markets, the snacks business benefits from the scale and local knowledge of the beverage business, and that in the US, the divisions share back-office operations and research and development.The comments came as Pepsi announced third-quarter profits that rose as sales in emerging markets offset its flat US beverage business.Net income at Pepsi rose 4 per cent from a year ago to $2bn, or $1.25 a share, on revenues 13 per cent higher at $17.58bn. The results beat analyst expectations and Pepsi’s shares rose 2.38 per cent to $62.40 in mid-morning New York trading.Pepsi maintained its 2011 target for high single-digit earnings per share growth.Sales volume growth was strong in Europe and Asia, but North America remained a weak spot for Pepsi’s food and beverage businesses. Sales volume for the US food business rose 1 per cent and sales in the US beverage division were unchanged from a year ago.Analysts have warned that the rest of the year could be challenging for US beverage companies as they lose foreign exchange benefits and cope with volatile commodity prices and a weak economy.On Wednesday Pepsi said carbonated beverage sales continued to fall in the US, but that it experienced an uptick in overall beverage market share and that Gatorade was showing solid growth.During the past three months, Pepsi shook up its marketing team and reshuffled its beverage unit in an effort to jump-start sales and regain some of the market share it has been losing to rival Coca-Cola.

397;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Bakers eye combining operations;;"Bread would be a textbook candidate for consolidation but for one thing: it is already consolidated.The three big bakers, led by Warburtons, control well over half of the market in volume terms. Add in private label manufacturing and bolting even the weakest two together would result in a single baker controlling nearly half of the market – a scenario industry veterans believe would fall foul of the competition authorities.That leaves partial consolidation, or bringing together operations further down the supply chain. Options include outsourcing manufacturing and shared distribution, which could also be contracted out to a third party.At first look, sharing trucks appears to tick every box. Fewer trucks on the roads means fewer traffic jams and less carbon emissions. It cuts costs for both manufacturers and retailers, for whom emptying cargoes at the loading bay is expensive.And there is precedent in the beer and soft drink industries. SABMiller distributes Coca-Cola, which it bottles, and other soft drinks alongside beers in emerging markets. In the UK, Britvic bottles and distributes Pepsi alongside other brands.Indeed, co-operation in the drinks world goes further still: Anheuser-Busch InBev and PepsiCo last year teamed up to jointly buy media space.Jon Goldstone, marketing director at Premier, said: “Environmentally it makes sense. We’ve all got [environmental] targets we have to hit, so maybe if we have fewer Hovis lorries in future, and get to market faster and quicker, then why not?”Analysts have two responses: competitors and retailers. The proudly independent – and flourishing – Warburtons would be less keen to throw in its lot to the advantage of a less healthy rival, they say.Retailers say they would be open to joint deliveries; indeed, some already operate this way for smaller bakeries. But their blessing is unlikely to translate into greater profits for those beleaguered bakers, says Credit Suisse’s Charlie Mills.“I doubt the manufacturers would hold on to price savings, because the minute they make them the retailers would be on the phone saying, ‘I’ll have that’. As a bread company, how could you resist the powerful retailers? Therein lies the problem.”"
398;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Technology visionary who reshaped the world;Obituary: Businessman who became a pop culture hero;"Steve Jobs stamped his mark on more than 35 years of personal computing history, from the rudimentary but ground-breaking Apple II to the sleekness of the touch-screen iPad. In the process, he helped to instill new digital tastes in a generation and was instrumental in the reshaping of digital media and entertainment.Hailed as a technology visionary, Jobs also represented a new phenomenon in the 1970s: the businessman as a pop culture hero, as recognisable and charismatic as a film star. Almost from the founding of Apple, at the age of only 21, he was propelled into the public eye as the maverick face of a liberating new technology culture.Jobs was not an inventor in the classic sense and borrowed, bought or merely popularised many of the ideas most closely associated with his company’s success. But his genius at anticipating what millions of consumers would want next from their digital devices, and at shaping the conditions that would create feverish excitement for each successive Apple advance, were unparalleled.Among these were the Apple II, the first practical personal computer with sales of 1m and the brainchild of Apple’s other, more technical co-founder, Steve Wozniak; the Apple Macintosh, which introduced screen pictures or icons to represent activities on a virtual desktop controlled by a mouse; and, later, a string of hits that included the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad.Steven Paul Jobs was born in Los Altos, California, in 1955, the illegitimate child of a Syrian professor of political science and a US speech therapist. He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, a hard-working couple of moderate means.Though devoted to them, he always retained a sense of baffled anger that he had been rejected by his natural parents, according to friends. He was renowned among those who worked closely with him as an inspiring but difficult leader who could deflate subordinates who did not live up to his demanding standards with withering anger. A perfectionist when it came to his company’s products, Jobs insisted on having the final say over the technology, design and marketing of everything that was stamped with the Apple name.His journey to the top of the computing industry began when he was in high school, working for the summer at Hewlett-Packard, where he met Wozniak, who was working as an engineer.Jobs later dropped out of Reed College, Oregon, and in 1974 went to India in search of spiritual enlightenment. He once said that his rival, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, would have benefited from similar experiences. Jobs retained the 1960s bohemian spirit throughout his life, usually dressing in the “artist’s’” uniform of black turtleneck sweater and jeans.Back home, he and Wozniak designed a simple computer, the Apple I, in Jobs' bedroom. They sold the machine for $666 and took in $774,000 in sales. That was followed, in 1977, by the Apple II, which was aimed at ordinary consumers rather than just hobbyists and featured circuitry for connections to a colour monitor, a dramatic innovation at the time.The success of the Apple II made Jobs a rich man. When Apple went public in 1980, its market value hit more than $1bn. In 1983, however, IBM – at the time the world's largest computer manufacturer – introduced its own personal computer. The IBM brand legitimised the PC in the business marketplace and established the Microsoft operating system as the industry standard.That year Jobs asked PepsiCo president John Sculley, who had a reputation for brilliant marketing, to become Apple president and help counter the IBM challenge. In a display of Jobs’ persuasive skills that would enter business history, he said: “If you stay at Pepsi, five years from now all you’ll have accomplished is selling a lot more sugar water to kids. If you come to Apple, you can change the world.”The Apple Macintosh appeared in 1984, bringing icons and the mouse to a mass audience. Small, light and affordable, it was even described as “lovable” – probably a first for any computer. Yet Microsoft soon emulated the breakthroughs in the Mac, keeping Apple from breaking its stranglehold on the market.As the battle wore on, Sculley began to see Jobs as disruptive and forced a showdown that led to Jobs’ resignation. Neither Apple nor Jobs did well without the other.Jobs’ new company, NeXT, developed a high-powered – and expensive – computer for the education market, but was not a success. He did better with a side project: a computerised movie production house called Pixar that he bought in 1986. Pixar had a string of hits, starting with Toy Story, and its eventual purchase by Walt Disney made Jobs the largest individual shareholder of that entertainment colossus.Apple, meanwhile, lost its technological edge, and a series of chief executives failed to turn the tide. The end seemed in sight for the company until, in 1997, it bought NeXT, bringing Jobs back as an “informal adviser”. NeXT’s software was to form the core of the Mac OS X operating system.Later that year, Jobs was named interim chief executive officer – a position that was soon made permanent – and the following May brought the launch of a product that signalled the return of the company’s creative spark: the iMac, a one-piece, brightly coloured computer in a curved plastic case. It was a vivid display of how Jobs would go on rebuild the company on a union of compelling design and cutting edge technology. By the end of July, Apple had sold almost 300,000 of the new machines.It was the start of what was perhaps the most impressive comeback in business history. In completing the turnround, which eventually led this year to Apple briefly becoming the world’s most valuable company, Jobs went on to shake up the personal computing industry he had helped to create with a series of new, portable devices – in the process also upending the mobile communications industry and creating new markets for digital media and entertainment.The Apple Mac and third-party software, in combination with the laser printer, had provided the essential tools of the desktop publishing revolution in the 1980s. The more powerful Macintosh computers, with large display screens, had become the computers of choice for the graphics and design industries. But that still left Apple with only some 3 per cent of the world market for desktop computers .Then, in the early years of the new century, Jobs saw a new opportunity. Though many music services had tried to get the major record labels to provide licensed versions of their content online, Jobs was able to convince them that Apple’s technology would protect their songs from piracy. The small, elegant iPod quickly came to dominate the market for portable music players, while iTunes would go on to become the top seller not only of digital music but all forms of music.The iPhone and iPad that were to follow built on the iPod’s success of combining Apple’s high style and user-friendly technology with online services – in their case, the App Store – to create digital experiences that rivals could not match.Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004. The following year, in a commencement speech to students at Stanford University, he said that receiving a diagnosis that he might die had reinforced a personal philosophy that had been with him since the age of 17. “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life,” he said. “Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.”The illness returned, forcing Jobs to step aside as Apple’s chief executive during the first half of 2009, during which he had a liver transplant. Early this year he announced that he would take another leave of absence from the company because of his health. He retained the title of chief executive until August, when he stepped down while remaining chairman.Jobs was eventually reunited with his natural mother, Joanne, and met his sister, the novelist Mona Simpson. He was romantically involved with a number of charismatic women, including folk singer Joan Baez, once the lover of Bob Dylan, Jobs’ favourite artist. His high school girlfriend, Chris-Ann, bore him an illegitimate daughter, Lisa. After initially refusing to recognise the child as his, he eventually accepted her and took a strong interest in her career.In 1991 he married Laurene Powell, an MBA student he met when lecturing at Stanford Graduate Business School. They had three children. She survives him, as do his four children.Alan Cane, Joseph Menn and Richard Waters"
399;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-10-03T14:00:48Z;Consumers: A new middle class that likes to shop;Paul Gould finds that retail is picking up after the 2009 blues;"There is a spreading retail footprint in the Moscow suburb where Ikea opened its first store in Russia 11 years ago. Other warehouse-type stores have sprouted up close by, car parks sprawl in all directions and there is gridlock on the roads to get there; Russians seem insatiable in their desire to be out spending.Not content with being the biggest owner of retail real estate in the country, Ikea sees scope to expand. “We’re not saturated here,” says Per Wendschlag, the Swedish furniture group’s general director for Russia.Mr Wendschlag recalls the opening of that first store in 2000. Barely nine years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, few Russians had credit cards, he says, so “masses of people came with shopping bags stuffed full of roubles”.Now, 11 years on, he oversees 14 stores, as well as Ikea’s Mega malls. The group owes its success, he says, to doing its homework. “We visited thousands of Russian homes to see how they live, how they store their shoes.”Soviet-era deprivation, still a recent memory in 2000, made Ikea well-placed to feed Russians’ hunger for consumer goods. That hunger has lured many an overseas company to cash in on a boom that lasted roughly a decade.Now, after 2009’s downturn, analysts are bullish once more. “Russia is poised to become the largest consumer market in Europe,” says Per Hong, Moscow-based partner at management consultancy AT Kearney.The Russian middle class is perceived as expanding, with its real-terms disposable income rising at just above 4 per cent. Consumer credit is on the up, too, albeit from a low base. This has helped drive a renewed climb in retail sales, which this summer grew 5.6 per cent year on year. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, even makes a bold forecast of double-digit growth in retail sales in the first quarter of 2012.Domestic consumption is being credited with sustaining a year-on-year rise in gross domestic product.Like retailers, consumer goods manufacturers such as Henkel, the German toiletries and household products group, have set their sights on thriving sales. “Russia is one of our top three growth zones,” says Peter Günther, president of Henkel Russia. “In the past five to seven years, Henkel has seen double-digit growth rates, and that is also our expectation in coming years.” Russia accounts for 50 per cent of the group’s global sales, he says.But the best route to expansion is less clear. Rather than high profit margins, says Mr Wendschlag, Ikea pursues an aggressive strategy of further store openings. France’s Auchan, another early entrant to Russia, now has more than 40 hypermarkets there. By contrast, rival French group Carrefour opened only two and pulled out in 2009 after just four months.Similarly, in late 2010, US retailer Walmart closed a Moscow office that it had opened to pursue acquisitions. PepsiCo, however, succeeded in taking control of Russian dairy and juice producer Wimm-Bill-Dann last December at the same time as Danone of France acquired Russia’s Unimilk.Nevertheless, mergers or acquisitions may not be the easiest way to get a piece of the consumer pie. As AT Kearney says in its global retail development index: “For foreign companies, entry to Russia via M&A has proved difficult as local companies have strong lobbying advantages.”These homegrown operators include Russia’s three biggest supermarket chains, Magnit, X5 and O’Key. The latter raised £270m via an initial public offering in London last November, following the example of Magnit, whose shares have more than doubled since their 2008 London listing.“The profitability of Russian food retailers is higher than in the west,” says Daniel Wakerly of Morgan Stanley Research.Russia’s grocery market is becoming less fragmented too. Last December, X5 bought discount chain Kopeyka, rebranding some of its stores as the more upmarket Perekryostok. Food retailing is not yet dominated by supermarkets, but manufacturers welcome consolidation. Mr Günther says it would improve presentation and distribution. “Logistics in Russia is sometimes a nightmare,” he says, complaining of high costs and difficulties with freight capacity.Another perennial deterrent is bureaucracy. The World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business” index ranks Russia 123rd out of 183 countries.Alexei Popovichev, executive director of Rusbrand, an association representing mainly consumer sector multinationals, has lobbied for improvements on behalf of his members. “All companies operating in Russia want to see more predictable changes to law and regulation,” he says.Rusbrand’s original raison d'être was brand protection and, having secured changes to intellectual property law, Mr Popovichev says his member companies are upbeat. Asked what sustains his faith in ever-greater sales, he simply says: “Russians love brands.”"
400;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-09-30T14:44:41Z;Groups line up for launch of stevia sweetener;;A sweetener billed as an advance against the obesity and diabetes epidemics is due to hit UK shelves as early as November, opening a market that multinationals ranging from Cargill to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are lining up to exploit.Stevia, which comes from a basil-like shrub native to Paraguay, is already available in the US and France and is now used in 6m US households.Following European approval, expected in the next month, Cargill will initially target the UK, where it is partnering Silver Spoon, the sugar brand owned by Associated British Foods. It is planning a £5m ($7.8m) TV and press advertising campaign for a market it says could be worth £10m in the next few years.In the US, Packaged Facts, the market researcher, estimates that sales of stevia will grow from $210.6m in 2010 to $1.19bn (£763m) this year.Optimism is based on global efforts to tackle obesity and diabetes, which has left the food industry desperately seeking ways to make healthier products. However, bullish targets come despite a drop in sales at existing supplier PureCircle.The Aim-quoted group, a one-time stock market darling, last week reported a 12 per cent dip to $53m in sales of high-purity stevia for the year to end-June. Its share price, which once hit 300p, is now languishing at about 90p. Magomet Malsagov, chief executive, cites inventory build-up by manufacturers as one reason behind his company’s patchy performance.None of this deters stevia’s flag-bearers. “It’s a miracle plant,” said Zana McFerson, who is leading Cargill’s push with its Truvia brand of stevia sweetener.Hugues Pitre, a regional managing director of Merisant, which is promoting its Pure Via brand, said there was a “big opportunity for growth in terms of sales and expansion of the [sugar substitutes] category”.They also argue that higher sugar prices mean partial substitution with stevia is also starting to make economic sense.Manufacturers of fizzy drinks and other sweet foodstuffs already have a toe in the water. Coca-Cola uses stevia to sweeten Fanta Still in France – which now accounts for more than 5 per cent of total French Fanta sales – and VitaminWater Zero in the US. Also in France, Danone uses it to sweeten its Taillefine yoghurts.Pepsi, which uses stevia in Trop50, says performance has been “outstanding”. The drink became a brand with annual sales of $150m in two years and sales are up 50 per cent year to date.Even so, drinks makers have not rushed to embrace stevia wholeheartedly. Analysts attribute their caution to conservatism and the slight liquorice flavour of some derivatives of the plant.
401;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

Interested in a contrarian or upbeat interpretation of Tuesday’s otherwise routinely vapid confidence and house price numbers? August data showed that the mood of American consumers was largely unchanged versus the month before and remains weak. Meanwhile, the headline Case-Shiller index for July is about 4 per cent lower than where house prices were a year ago.But step closer and consider the consumer confidence numbers first. Such low readings from the monthly Conference Board survey of 3,000 households are normally consistent with markedly lower spending. But this is not happening. The Johnson Redbook survey of retail sales is expected to be up again in September and month-to-date sales are 4 per cent higher than last year. As High Frequency Economics notes, confidence may be affecting the stock market these days (and vice versa), but it does not seem to stop people from popping to the shops.Likewise, the housing market looks pretty horrible in isolation. But homeowners should cease thinking about their property as a red hot investment and rather as an OK store of value. The average US home across America’s 20 main cities is now worth 14 per cent less than in 2008. But so are the stock prices of boring old Walmart and PepsiCo. JPMorgan has lost a third of its value over that time; Citigroup three times as much. The silver price, supposedly a store of value, dropped by more than a third in six sessions from the Friday before last.What is more, owning a house is not a bad hedge against inflation. And better still if you are lucky enough to be one of the 65 per cent of 75m homeowners with a mortgage, inflation will help pay it off more quickly. Of course, no one knows if there will be rampant inflation or not. But at least you can live in your house, which is more than you can say for a bar of gold or equities.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
403;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-09-27T11:30:10Z;Tax wars: the accidental billion-dollar break;;A simple rule meant to cut paperwork for US companies has grown into one of the biggest multinational tax breaks around, costing the US and other governments billions of dollars in lost taxes each year.It thrives thanks to determined business support, including a campaign two years ago that forced the Obama administration to retreat from altering it, and tax professionals worldwide who exploit its benefits.The rule is known as “check-the-box.” It allows US companies to shift profits from operations in high-tax countries simply by marking an Internal Revenue Service form that transforms subsidiaries into what the agency calls a “disregarded entity”. Others have labelled them “tax nothings”.Check-the-box allows companies to avoid the normal 35 per cent US corporate tax on certain types of income. The Treasury Department estimates that annual revenue losses from check-the-box have hit almost $10bn. Other countries are also said to lose billions as income is shifted from other high tax jurisdictions to places with low or no taxes, although there is no official estimate.Check-the-box is “an open invitation to arbitrage,” said David Rosenbloom, director of the international tax program at New York University’s School of Law.The impact of check-the-box goes beyond the drain on government coffers. The rule, along with other tax provisions, has helped fuel explosive growth in foreign investment by American corporations. Since 2004, the earnings that US companies keep overseas have doubled to about $1800bn, US Department of Commerce data show.Now, these “unrepatriated” earnings, which are not subject to tax while held abroad, figure prominently in Washington’s debate about corporate taxes. While President Obama has proposed clamping down on loopholes, business groups and allies in Congress are rallying for a tax holiday on overseas profits and a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate.Their argument is that the high tax rate in the US creates a disincentive to invest in jobs at home. US companies with the most profits accumulated abroad tend to invest heavily in research and development that can spur job creation.Check-the-box is just one of many forms of “tax arbitrage” – the art of exploiting differences in countries’ tax systems. It can reduce taxes by itself or feature in more complex transactions. As the Financial Times and ProPublica reported on Monday, the IRS in recent years has clamped down on what it views as abusive arbitrage deals involving foreign tax credits.But check-the-box lives on. It is not among loopholes targeted by Obama’s new plan. Its seemingly untouchable status – the government has twice tried to kill it and balked – provides a case study in how a billion-dollar tax break was born by mistake, then protected by the power of the business community.The original idea was innocent enough – to cut red tape by making it easier for companies to decide how to categorise their subsidiaries.In the mid-1990s, US companies were creating a growing number of domestic entities. The new rule said that, by simply checking a box on IRS Form 8832, businesses could declare them as corporations or partnerships.But within days of its announcement in 1996, tax lawyers were saying that the Treasury Department had overlooked the international ramifications. Inadvertently, the government had provided a way for companies to move profits from subsidiaries in high-tax countries to Luxembourg, the Caymans or other jurisdictions with lower or no taxes on certain kinds of income. Often, this is done by making royalty or interest payments between operations in different countries.For decades, the IRS has had anti-abuse rules to make sure such payments could be subject to taxes. However, these rules generally don’t apply to payments made within a corporation. Check-the-box made it simple for a company to designate a subsidiary as a branch, with no US tax consequences for the income unless it is repatriated.The Financial Times and ProPublica examine how banks and companies have used the tax system to their own advantageJoseph Guttentag, international tax counsel at Treasury when check-the-box was introduced, said the government may not have understood, but tax lawyers quickly “saw all the avoidance goodies they could do.”Countries such as the UK and Germany quickly raised concerns that the rule was stripping earnings from their tax bases. By early 1998, the US Treasury said check-the-box was being used to “circumvent” anti-abuse rules. It proposed new regulations – and corporate America erupted.General Electric, PepsiCo, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Monsanto and other major companies urged Congress to resist the change. The US, they said, was trying to be “the tax policeman for the world.’’ Allies in Congress dug in, and Treasury quickly rescinded the proposal.By March 2000, Treasury reported the existence of nearly 8,000 “disregarded entities’’. A paper by Heather M. Field, an associate professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, found that tens of thousands more were created between 2001 and 2006.Check-the-box became an essential tool in tax planning, driving down the average effective corporate tax rate on the foreign income of US businesses by 1 per cent to 2 per cent between 1996 and 2004, according to a private, unpublished paper by Treasury economist Harry Grubert.The Netherlands became the preferred location for US companies using check-the-box, according to tax lawyers and government data, although Luxembourg also attracts considerable activity.The Dutch tax system offers a favourable legal and regulatory environment, including special tax treatment for financial services and for licensing and royalty payments. As a result, multinationals channel trillions of dollars a year through the Netherlands.A report by the Dutch Central Bank found that the US corporate share of funds flowing in and out of the country via special Dutch entities increased sixfold between 2005 and 2009. US Commerce data show that US businesses kept $118bn of income in Dutch holding companies between 2006 and 2009.In 2004, with overseas earnings piling up, Congress approved a temporary tax holiday that allowed American companies to bring home profits at a rate of 5.25 per cent. The largest source of repatriated funds, about $90bn, came from the Netherlands, according to a 2008 IRS study.Check-the-box continued unchallenged until 2009, when Obama took office. In his first budget proposal, he made closing tax loopholes a top revenue-raising goal. And in the international area, check-the-box was his top target, the biggest revenue raiser in a list of 11 reforms.Again, corporate opposition was swift. Philip D. Morrison, a tax lawyer at Deloitte Tax, wrote in a prominent tax journal that it was “ridiculous” for the Obama administration to claim that check-the-box was an “unintended” loophole because the business community had already fought – and won – this battle in 1998. Morrison faulted the administration for using overheated rhetoric and “deep cynicism” in its portrayal of the rule.*Some of the nation’s most influential business groups, including the Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers, National Foreign Trade Council and Chamber of Commerce, quickly criticised the Obama proposals in May 2009 as part of a pro-jobs campaign.In Congress, tax committee members lined up alongside business leaders, with Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee and now its chairman, saying the proposals would put US corporations on the auction block.“Ironically, what the president proposes will make it more likely that American companies will be bought by their foreign competitors,” Mr Camp asserted.The Obama administration quickly retreated.“They knew the business community was going to push back. What they were really surprised by was how vehemently the business community reacted to it,’’ said Catherine Schultz, vice-president of tax policy for the National Foreign Trade Council.In early 2010, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner informed the Senate’s tax-writing committee that the administration was dropping its attempt to broadly reform check-the-box. Instead, the Treasury would focus on combating misuse of the rule as part of other tax-avoidance techniques, including inappropriate foreign tax credits, he said.“Our goal in these proposals is to limit the role taxes play in business investment decisions by reducing implicit incentives to move jobs and investment overseas,” Geithner testified.While announcing his deficit-cutting plan last week, Mr Obama faulted the corporate tax system as “riddled with special-interest loopholes” and a high rate that hurts “our competitiveness in the world economy.”He proposed more than a dozen business tax reforms, including ending breaks for fossil-fuel development and tightening accounting measures involving foreign income. Although Mr Obama did not mention check-the-box, its business supporters have defended it on Capitol Hill.On the same day that Mr Obama addressed Congress, an executive from Cargill, the world’s largest trader of agricultural commodities, outlined possible reforms to the tax code, but not to check-the-box.Repealing check-the-box, said Scott M. Naatjes, Cargill’s vice-president and general tax counsel, would cause US companies to pay more taxes abroad and make them less competitive. Cargill has 60 per cent of its operations outside the US.The Senate panel also heard testimony from a law professor suggesting that American companies were not so disadvantaged.Reuven Avi-Yonah, head of the international tax program at the University of Michigan Law School, testified that large European countries have stricter rules when it comes to taxing profits made outside their country. Japan and Germany have recently made it harder for corporations there to avoid taxes or shift income to lower-taxed jurisdictions, he said.In an earlier interview, Professor Avi-Yonah said it would take a comprehensive approach by Washington to curb the ability of corporations to find new loopholes.“It’s a problem to only close specific loopholes instead of addressing the issue in a general way,’’ he said. “Companies simply find new ways to replace the approaches shut down by authorities.’’Meanwhile, check-the-box deals “are going like crazy,” according to one prominent tax lawyer who helps structure such transactions. He added: “I can design these a thousand different ways.”* This article was amended from the original on September 29. Tax lawyer Philip D Morrison said in a prominent tax journal that it was “ridiculous” for the Obama Treasury to claim check-the-box allowed for an “unintended avoidance of current U.S tax”. He did not say the Obama proposal to change the tax provision was ridiculous, as stated in the original.
404;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Coca-Cola looks to give sales extra fizz;;Carbonated soft drinks have become a public enemy among health advocates and lawmakers who have been trying to tax them, but Coca-Cola’s chief executive argues that the beverages’ demise has been greatly exaggerated.“There’s a misnomer in the notion that sparkling beverages are not growing, or that we’re not able to grow sparkling beverages,” Muhtar Kent, chief executive of Coke, said in an interview with the Financial Times. “There’s a view that trends are negative, that trademark Coca-Cola is not growing, and that’s not the case.”Mr Kent pointed to 4 per cent year-on-year growth in its sparkling beverage businesses during the first half of 2011, noting that sales were up in the US. He said that US consumers are “confused” by the sluggish economic recovery, but that Coke is succeeding by giving them more options.Last week Coke lowered the prices on its “mini-cans,” to offer consumers a smaller beverage at a reduced price. The move is intended to give a cheaper option at a time when the company has been forced to raise prices on its standard-sized drinks because of the high cost of raw materials.Coke has been a darling of Wall Street during in the last year, with its share price up nearly 17 per cent since September 2010. The company had $35.1bn in net revenue last year and continued to take market share from its biggest rival, Pepsi.“They’re firing on all cylinders,” said Bonnie Herzog, beverage analyst at Wells Fargo. “They didn’t give up on the trademark Coca-Cola brand, they made it more relevant to consumers.”Ms Herzog said that Coke has benefited from targeting its products at younger consumers and from the acquisition of its biggest US bottler, which has reduced costs and made its supply chain more nimble.Analysts at Bernstein Research polled Coke investors and found that 80 per cent of those queried were pleased with its performance. However, some were fearful that the company was overvalued and that it was investing too heavily to drive sales volume at the expense of profit growth.Threats of taxes on carbonated soft drinks are also a potential headwind, but the company has so far been successful at fending off significant legislation.Coke investors are eager to see what Mr Kent’s “next act” will be, and bankers speculate that it could be a potential suitor for PepsiCo’s snacks business or perhaps acquire an energy drink company. Although Coke is a distributor of Hansen’s Monster energy drink, Mr Kent has downplayed the future of the category.“As a long-term perspective, there will be a tapering off of demand,” he said. “It’s not something that will be here to stay in 20 years’ time.”Meanwhile, Mr Kent said that rather than concentrate on a next act, he remains focused on achieving his larger goal of helping Coke double its annual revenues in the next 10 years.“We are cautiously pleased with what has happened with our brand metrics, with our progress, with our investments,” he said. “But we know we can do better.”
405;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-09-19T16:30:25Z;Dollar’s rebound bodes ill for Wall Street;;The rebound in the US dollar may be the last thing that equity investors want to see after a torrid summer on Wall Street.For much of the past year, a weak dollar has been seen by investors as a tailwind for US stocks, that has at various times helped boost quarterly earnings for a string of global companies such as McDonald’s, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.Yet amid no end to the eurozone debt crisis, the dollar has risen sharply and is near a seven-month high on a trade-weighted basis. With some currency analysts forecasting further weakness in the euro, even towards $1.20 from its present level of $1.3640, earnings expectations for the S&P 500 could erode further, pressuring the world’s biggest equity benchmark.“The rally in the dollar is a two-edged sword,” says Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird, a wealth manager. “The relative strength in the dollar is attracting assets from abroad but it could cause our export markets to suffer and change the equation for global companies when profits are translated back into dollars.”In recent years, the weak dollar has helped many US exporters by making their products more affordable abroad. For example, John Deere, the world’s biggest tractor maker, is one company for which the value of the dollar often makes a big difference to its bottom line, as it brings home profits earned overseas.Ahead of the third-quarter reporting season next month, analysts have dialled down their forecast earnings per share growth for the S&P 500 to 13.5 per cent from 16.4 per cent at the start of July, according to FactSet.But a stronger dollar would not harm all sectors. In general, periods of dollar weakness have rewarded industrials and materials sectors with some energy and technology names also performing well, according to Citi. A weak dollar also tends to boost technology hardware and equipment. Yet according to Citi, a stronger dollar favours tech software and services and also boosts healthcare stocks.“The dollar has some impact, but it is not the end all,” says Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi, who estimates that 30 per cent of S&P 500 sales are derived from outside the US, with 20 per cent coming from Europe.He adds that there are some benefits of a stronger dollar resulting “in lower commodity prices [that] would help the economy and broader stock market”.Others are also relatively unconcerned by a strengthening dollar.“The dollar has definitely been a benefit for a lot of our companies but right now we’re not too worried about it,” says Eric Schoenstein, principal at Jensen Investment Management, with $5bn in assets under management.Though Jensen’s primarily large-cap portfolio has more than 50 per cent of its holdings’ revenues generated outside the US, Mr Schoenstein says: “Big companies know how to manage their exposure and have been in emerging markets for years.”He also notes that companies’ diverse exposures will mean that divergences between Asian and Latin American currencies against the dollar may offset each other.Other big US manufacturers have deliberately shaped their companies to limit the impact of currency moves. Faced with rapid growth in emerging markets, big US industrial multinationals have established operations globally in recent years to reduce the risk posed by foreign exchange fluctuations and win local political and consumer support for their products.Some companies avoid currency risk by doing all their business in US dollars. For example, Boeing, the aircraft-maker and the US’s biggest exporter, sells internationally in a market that is wholly dollar-denominated.Even so, many view a stronger dollar as a clear negative for US equities, which so far this year have held up better than many other share markets.Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management, says: “The dollar is something to watch and it will have an impact, no doubt about it.”Adam Parker, US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, adds: “One source of the strong profitability of US companies so far this year was the earlier dollar weakness. That tailwind is likely to be diminished or even turn into a headwind for some companies, depending on the lag factor.”With fears of a slowdown in global growth mounting, investors in US equities will be hoping that any headwind from a stronger dollar will be minimal.Additional reporting by Alan Rappeport
406;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-09-14T17:23:24Z;Pepsi reshuffles troubled beverage unit;;PepsiCo unveiled a management reshuffle in its US beverage business on Wednesday, accelerating efforts to revive sales in the sluggish unit, which has become a concern to investors.The US drinks and snacks company named Albert Carey, who has been head of Frito-Lay North America, as chief executive of PepsiCo Americas Beverages, a new position that will oversee the company’s US bottling and drinks business.The decision was triggered by the retirement of Eric Foss, head of Pepsi Beverages Company, and marks a demotion for Massimo d’Amore, who has been chief executive of PepsiCo Beverages Americas. Mr Foss’ departure was expected after Pepsi acquired the North American bottling business last year.Mr d’Amore will continue to run the North American Gatorade and Tropicana businesses and the Latin America beverage business, but will no longer be responsible for carbonated soft drinks in the US. He will remain head of the company’s global beverage group, focused on innovation.The company said that Tom Greco will move from Pepsi Beverages Company to become president of Frito-Lay North America.Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive, said the changes reflected a “deep bench” of talent at the company and promised a smooth transition.The moves come as she has been under pressure to revive the US drinks business amid tough competition from rival Coca-Cola and consumer preferences that have shifted away from sparkling beverages. In its latest quarter, Pepsi’s beverage sales volume declined by 1 per cent from a year ago in North America.Earlier this month, Hugh Johnston, Pepsi’s chief financial officer, acknowledged that the rest of this year could be challenging because it has been difficult to pass on higher commodity costs to struggling US consumers.However, Pepsi has been investing in its brands with new advertising campaigns to lure consumers back and in June it announced a shake-up of its marketing team.During the summer its poked fun at Coke by appropriating its Santa Claus imagery in its commercials. It also invested $60m-$70m in a sponsorship of Simon Cowell’s new X-Factor talent show, and last month it signed an extension of its sponsorship deal with the US National Football League, which could be worth up to $2.3bn over 10 years.Bonnie Herzog, beverage analyst at Wells Fargo, said Wednesday’s changes showed that the turnround of Pepsi’s drinks business was ongoing and could be a long-term effort.Carlos Laboy, analyst at Credit Suisse, called the changes “favourable” and “necessary” but questioned if Mr Carey had the marketing experience necessary to revive the beverage business.Shares of Pepsi rose $1.65 per cent to $61.54 in midday trading on Wednesday.
407;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-09-08T22:50:31Z;Coke in French ‘sugar’ tax row U-turn;;Coca-Cola has become embroiled in a dispute with the French government over a new tax on fizzy drinks, leading the company to threaten to cut its investment in the country, before making an abrupt U-turn after drawing criticism.In the latest outbreak of hostilities in the long-running Franco-US culture wars, the US drinks maker’s bottling affiliate said early on Thursday in a statement that it had suspended €17m ($24m) of investment in its historic Pennes-Mirabeau plant near Marseilles. The move was in retaliation for measures in the French prime minister’s austerity budget, which target “sugary beverages” for extra revenues.Coca-Cola Enterprises also announced it was cancelling a party to celebrate the 40-year anniversary of the factory, which produces 2m litres of drinks a day.However, hours after learning of the announcement made by its France office, Coca-Cola Enterprises, overturned the decision, reconfirming the investment and its commitment to the country. The company blamed a miscommunication.“Let there be no doubt, and let me say it as a Frenchman: Coca-Cola is committed to France,” said Hubert Patricot, president of Coca-Cola Enterprises’s European group.Coca-Cola executives have been furious at what they say are government attempts to “stigmatise” their products as unhealthy in a similar way to tobacco and object to the financial cost of the tax. The company has invested €260m in France since the middle of the last decade.The dispute has revived memories of other Franco-US trade disputes, not least Paris’s decision in 2005 to give Danone, a yoghurt maker, protected national status after talk of a €30bn bid from PepsiCo, Coca-Cola’s main rival. France also blocked Coke’s bid for Orangina in 1999.The French finance ministry had earlier on Thursday called Coca-Cola Enterprises’s threat “regrettable in economic terms” but insisted that “this tax of an extra centime [on a can of drink] does not endanger the industry”, adding that the measure was “motivated by a public health goal”.Coca-Cola Enterprises originally said it had cancelled the party and suspended the investment “in a symbolic protest against a tax that punishes and stigmatises our company and our products”.A spokesman for the listed bottler later said that the party will now be rescheduled.Ali Dibadj, a beverage analyst at Sanford Bernstein, noted that soda taxes could become a bigger problem for the company as cash-strapped governments look for additional revenue. “For Coke, my sense is that it may be more of a jockeying with authorities to put some pressure on them,” Mr Dibadj said.Coca-Cola has the support of other French drinks producers in its campaign. The country’s National Association of Food Industries said it “understood” the company’s protest and expects local rivals to follow suit.
408;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-09-07T23:00:40Z;Higher costs threaten PepsiCo performance;;PepsiCo, the US drinks and snacks group, said on Wednesday that a “degrading” consumer environment is hampering its ability to raise prices and squeezing its performance, as the company tries to cope with higher costs.Hugh Johnston, Pepsi’s chief financial officer, said at an industry conference in Boston that optimism earlier this year about a consumer-led recovery has failed to play out during the past six months and that developed markets are locked in a “stagflationary” environment. The more challenging economic backdrop has made it difficult to make planned price increases.“While our brands are solid and our company is highly productive, this stagflation has made pricing a tricky balancing act,” Mr Johnston said. “Price elasticities have become steeper.”Mr Johnston said Pepsi is looking to improve productivity, scrutinise every expenditure and adjust its packaging to accommodate the widening gap between the value, mid-range and premium consumers. However, he said the company anticipates that commodity markets will rebalance eventually and that Pepsi does not need a large-scale acquisition to overhaul its portfolio of brands.“It was clear to us that the pricing and commodity environment are still challenging and beverage reinvestment will take time to pay off,” said Michael Branca, analyst at Barclays Capital.In spite of efforts to cut costs, Pepsi is continuing to invest aggressively in its brands. Earlier this week, it announced an extension of its sponsorship deal with the National Football League, which people familiar with the agreement said could mean and investment of up to $2.3bn over 10 years.Meanwhile, Kraft, the world’s second-largest food company by revenues, also painted a dark picture of the US consumer on Wednesday. Speaking at the same conference, Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive of Kraft, said that she believes North America is facing a “new normal” of slowing consumption growth that, when mixed with higher costs, have created a perfect storm.Ms Rosenfeld argued that the new landscape justified Kraft’s decision last month to split the company into a North American grocery business and an international snacks and confectionery business. Although many analysts lauded the logic of the move, some questioned the timing of the decision and wondered if Ms Rosenfeld had a change of heart about the direction of the company after its $19bn acquisition of Cadbury.“As an independent company, the North American grocery business will gear its investments, infrastructure and supply chain to this new normal of slower industry growth,” Ms Rosenfeld said. “Overall, North American grocery will target moderate revenue growth in line with its categories.”Kraft has also had to raise prices this year, but Ms Rosenfeld said the company has benefited from introducing the increases early and by ramping up advertising to support products that would have higher prices.“We feel quite comfortable with the response that we’ve seen to our pricing actions and, in fact, I think our shares have held up reasonably well,” she said.
409;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-09-06T18:14:49Z;Pepsi and NFL ink multibillion-dollar deal;;PepsiCo on Tuesday agreed to a new multibillion-dollar sponsorship deal with the National Football League, in an aggressive effort to increase sales of more of its brands in the US.The 10-year deal begins in 2012 and will extend existing partnerships between the league and PepsiCo’s Gatorade, Pepsi and Frito-Lay brands. The company is adding Tropicana and Quaker Oats brands to the deal for the first time, as it looks to align more of its portfolio with the robust and youthful NFL audience.People familiar with the deal estimate that Pepsi will invest up to $2.3bn through its NFL sponsorships up to 2022. The league receives between $15m and $20m a year for each brand, they said.“We love to be at the centre of the NFL action and look forward to deepening the NFL’s relationship with athletes and fans through best-in-class marketing, food and beverage innovation and retail experiences,” said Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive.Consumer companies had feared that a contract dispute between NFL teams and players, which has since been resolved, might have led to a shortened season, threatening investments with the league. Pepsi’s move shows the confidence that such companies continue to have in the NFL’s ability to draw television viewers and fill stadiums.Gatorade has been an NFL sponsor since the 1980s and its orange jugs have become sideline staples at games. Pepsi, the second-largest US soft drink maker by revenues, won the NFL sponsorship in 2002 from rival Coca-Cola, which had controlled it for nearly two decades.Pepsi, which has traditionally targeted young people with its marketing campaigns, said on Tuesday that it would work with the NFL on ways to use social media to engage young fans. It said it would look for ways to work with the NFL to improve food and beverage offerings at stadiums.Pepsi has been under pressure to improve its business in North America and boost sales of its flagship brand. The company made a big gamble in March when it announced a $60m-$70m US TV and digital campaign around its sponsorship of X Factor, Simon Cowell’s talent show. Coca Cola is one of the big name sponsors of American Idol.In July, Pepsi said it was stepping up its marketing efforts in the US by boosting advertising spending on beverages in North America by 30 per cent this year.
410;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-08-28T23:21:11Z;Global warming fears rise in developing world;;Consumers in the developed world are becoming increasingly apathetic about global warming, while Latin Americans – who have suffered much from unusual weather patterns – are becoming more concerned, according to a survey.Nielsen’s global study of online consumers comes as scientists and politicians, among others, debate the role of global warming in the severity of Hurricane Irene, which lashed the American east coast over the weekend.According to the global data and information consultancy’s findings, the US recorded one of the steepest declines in concern about global warming: less than half of Americans polled fret about climate change and only 58 per cent of Brits.By contrast, 90 per cent of Latin Americans are concerned, up from 85 per cent in 2009, and 93 per cent of Thais. Concern in China and Russia also exceeds that in the UK.Dr Maxwell T. Boykoff, senior visiting research associate from Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute and adviser on the survey, attributes waning interest in the western world to a return to more immediate personal concerns.“Focus on immediate worries such as job security, local school quality, crime and economic well-being have all diminished media attention for climate stories in the past two years,” he said.“In the face of other pressing concerns, a public ‘caring capacity’ for climate change has been tested.”Fiscal and economic concerns have also nudged green issues lower down the political agenda. Some politicians go further still. Texas governor and presidential candidate Rick Perry, for example, dismisses the theory that global warming is caused by human impact.But while those in North America are more focused on the price of gas in their tanks and the state of the country’s finances, south of the border, climate change worries are rising. This is fuelled by natural disasters on their own doorstep, said Arturo García, Nielsen’s president for the region.“People are expressing clear concern about unusual weather patterns including increased rainfall, hurricanes, and floods in some parts of Latin America, and severe drought in others,” he said.Similarly, consumers in Asia Pacific are most focused on the environmental issues closest to home, including water shortages and air pollution.The findings, garnered from more than 25,000 respondents in 51 countries, come as manufacturers of consumer goods are ratcheting up their sustainability credentials – in part, to win over shoppers buying their products.The likes of Nestlé, the world’s biggest food company by sales, drinks makers Coca-Cola and PepsiCo and Anglo-Dutch Unilever, are all pursuing policies that range from reduced packaging to cutting water usage to sourcing sustainably-produced raw materials.But Nielsen notes that consumers’ desire to see companies do the right thing by the environment – 83 per cent of global online consumers want to see companies implement such strategies – is not replicated at the cash register.Only around one-fifth are prepared to pay more for an eco-friendly product. Those in the Middle East and Africa are the most willing: one-third are ready to dig deeper in their pockets compared with just 12 per cent of Americans and Canadians.
411;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Coca-Cola in $4bn focus on China;;Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drinks company by revenues, said on Thursday it was ramping up its focus on China with a $4bn investment over the next three years.Beginning in 2012, it will build upon a $3bn investment announced in 2009, bringing the company’s total investment in the world’s second-largest economy to $7bn across a five-year period.“China is one of our most important growth markets in the world,” said Muhtar Kent, chief executive, in a statement. “Besides our infrastructure and capabilities, the new investment will also focus on enhancing the consumer experience, ensuring product affordability and building brand loyalty, which will deliver sustainable growth.”Coke has about 40 factories in China, where it employs more than 48,000 workers, and sales in the country represent about 7 per cent of the company’s annual volume.In the first half of 2011, the company sold $1bn cases of Coke products in China, doubling its rate from five years ago.During the second quarter, sales in China of Coke’s namesake brand jumped 24 per cent from the same period a year ago.“These achievements are driven by a renewed focus on core brands, continued distribution gains and expansion of cold drink equipment, all made possible by our continued investment,” Mr Kent said.Coke’s aggressive bet on China comes as the company continues to face economic headwinds in the US and an ongoing battle with high commodity costs.The new investment will be directed at building more factories and creating better awareness of its brands in China.The decision is also another indicator of China’s rapid growth. Coke said that between 1979 and 2009 it invested about $2bn in its China business, making the recent allocation a dramatic shift in the company’s resources.China also represents an important front in the cola wars. According to figures from Beverage Digest, Coke has a 55 per cent share of the market in China, outpacing Pepsi’s 32 per cent.In spite of Coke’s lead, PepsiCo has also been investing aggressively on infrastructure and distribution in China. Last year it announced a $2.5bn investment over three years, after announcing a $1bn investment in 2008.Coke has traditionally had a stronger hold on rural Chinese markets, while Pepsi has a bigger presence in major cities. Pepsi has also benefited from being sold at KFC restaurants, which are popular in China.Mr Kent said in a conference call last month that Coke would look to introduce smaller bottle sizes in China to help drive more transactions and get more consumers familiar with the brand. He also indicated that the company’s recent focus on China was just the beginning of its efforts there.“As one of the only true multi-category beverage players in China, the measure of our success will be how we grow our total business between now and 2020 versus our growth in any particular quarter,” Mr Kent said. “Clearly, I think, with the consumer fundamentals and our strong position in China, we’re just getting started.”
412;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;[Emerging difficulties]: Pepsi meets Putin;;"When Donald Kendall, Pepsico’s former chief executive, flew to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin last year and seal the company’s takeover of Russian dairy group Wimm-Bill-Dann, there was a bit of déjà vu in the air.Fifty years earlier, Kendall had come to Moscow as a young Pepsico executive and met another Russian leader, Nikita Kruschev – an encounter that paved the way for Pepsico’s entrance into Russia just a couple years later and everything that has come since.While other stories, such as the renewed spat between BP and its Russian oligarch partners, paint a vivid picture of the risks of investing in Russia, it is deals like the Pepsico-Wimm-Bill-Dann acquisition that provide a healthy counterexample: occasions when a multinational actually gets it right.The success of the $5.4bn deal, which was pitched, lawyered and signed in the record speed of three months last year, owes much of its success to Kendall, who made sure Pepsi entered Russia well before any of its competitors, a legacy that has served both parties well.In 2008 Pepsi took a 75 per cent stake in JSC Lebedyansky, Russia’s leading juice maker, for $1.4bn, its biggest foreign acquisition before the WBD deal, while separately it has spent more than a decade building up factories in cities such as Samara and Yekaterinburg, a boon to the local regions.“It’s groundwork that has been done over many years,” explains Ramon Laguarta, head of Pepsico’s eastern European division. “We see them not only as a Russian business, we see WBD as a platform for us to expand outside Russia.”Therein may lie the difference between Pepsico and other foreign groups which, looking to flex their muscles in Russia, have faced obstacles ranging from pesky oligarchs and bribery allegations, to seemingly minor problems like visa issues.BP was forced to pull its Arctic deal with Rosneft following legal threats from its oligarch partners in TNK-BP, while three years earlier Robert Dudley, then head of TNK-BP, was kicked out of the country after being denied a full visa.Meanwhile, Ikea, Daimler and Siemens have all faced allegations of corruption or bribery.Most recently, Indigo Partners, a US venture capital firm, has found itself the latest group to become embroiled with Alfa Group, one of the TNK-BP shareholders, over control of budget airline Avianova.Matt Lasov, director of research, at Frontier Strategy Group, a consultancy, says one reason that Pepsico has faired so much better than BP may just be the companies’ sectors.“Energy in Russia is obviously going to be highly sensitive. You’re going to encounter more risks and more roadblocks,” he says.“When you’re dealing with the real sector, the chances of the deal going through are much higher.”Another aspect may be Pepsico’s attitude towards investing in Russia. While the company has said previously that it had faced internal problems when setting up in China, Laguarta notes that in Russia the company has benefited from having strong local mangers who have worked in the company for years. “You can never run a huge business like we have with expats,” he says.As part of its deal with WBD, Pepsico is also promising to expand WBD and find new markets for its dairy product kefir, a Russian fermented milk, something that may also have endeared the group to the Kremlin which at times has come to associate foreign groups with asset grabbing.“[The Russian government] is very interested in foreign investment coming here and building companies of a global nature,” says Marina Kagan, a member of WBD’s management board at the time of the deal.But the end of the day, Pepsico was perhaps best helped by its high offer price: the group paid a premium of over 30 per cent for control of the group.Related reading:

413;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-08-04T17:35:46Z;Cadbury buy makes split easier for Kraft;;Breaking up became much easier for Kraft to do after its hostile acquisition of Cadbury 18 months ago gave the world’s second-largest food company a snacks business with the scale to stand alone.Even so, Thursday’s announcement that the company is splitting in two came as a surprise – and one that raises questions about the future of Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft’s chief executive and the architect of the Cadbury deal.Ms Rosenfeld said on Thursday that she and the board had been considering the split since 2007 when it acquired Danone’s LU cookie business. Rather than being an about-face, the move was a “validation” of the company’s strategy, she said.“We believe this is the next logical step in realising our vision of being a global snacking powerhouse and unleashing the value of the North American grocery business,” Ms Rosenfeld told the Financial Times.However, sceptics questioned the timing and logic of the deal after Kraft failed to give details on the growth outlooks for the split companies or how different brands might fare when split from their stablemates.“I’m not exactly clear why this is occurring,” asked Eric Katzman, analyst at Deutsche Bank. “I mean, if the pieces aren’t going to grow at a faster rate because they are more focused or because the tax rate efficiencies are greater … why do it?”Other analysts wondered if the decision to split the companies would create “dis-synergies” and what it would mean for Kraft’s vaunted sales force, which uses its grocery and snacking scale to the company’s advantage.Within the next 12 months, the $48bn Kraft will be split in two publicly traded companies, creating a global snacks business with revenues of $32bn and a $16bn grocery business, focused on North America. Brands such as Cadbury, Oreo, LU and Tang will be separated from Philadelphia cream cheese, Miracle Whip and Oscar Mayer meats.The move comes as Ms Rosenfeld has been under pressure to drive growth at Kraft after a variety of efforts to rejuvenate the company failed to spur its share price or satisfy investors. Investors lauded the move, sending Kraft’s share price up 5 per cent after the announcement.Kraft said on Thursday that its second-quarter net earnings rose 3.9 per cent year on year to $976m, or 55 cents a share, as revenues jumped 13.3 per cent to $13.8bn. The company raised its full-year earnings outlook.Big shareholders, such as Warren Buffett and Nelson Peltz, who recently increased his stake in the company, praised the decision on CNBC.Sir Roger Carr, who led a staunch defence of Cadbury as head of the confectioner at the time of the takeover, said: “My biggest concern for Cadbury at the time of the acquisition by Kraft was that it would lose momentum as part of a lacklustre low-growth conglomerate. I know that Nelson Peltz has similar views and would probably have made these clear to Irene Rosenfeld since making his recent large investment.”Andrew Lazar, analyst at Barclays Capital, suggested the split last September, when he wrote a wrote a note to clients arguing that Kraft should pursue a “divide and conquer” strategy if the investment case for the Cadbury deal was not panning out. By splitting the group into a growth company and a yield company, each would have a more focused strategy.“The creation of two separate, standalone companies out of the current portfolio – one geared to faster-growth snacking categories across the globe, the other more ‘resigned’ to its lower-growth assets but instead focused on taking advantage of their prowess for cash flow generation – would arm each with a more refined ‘reason for being’,” Mr Lazar wrote.Kraft’s split comes as other food companies are debating the benefits of scale and could trigger similar moves from companies such as the Campbell Soup Company, Heinz and PepsiCo.Other conglomerates in the sector have so far resisted pressure to split, arguing that economies of scale and synergies – such as consumer insights or dealing with retailers – outweigh the benefits.Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch maker of Dove shampoo and Lipton tea, came under repeated pressure from investors to separate its household and personal care division from the lower-growth food and beverages operations. However, it is an issue that Paul Polman, chief executive, says seldom comes up with investors now.“We think there are enough synergies we can drive across the business while leveraging scale and also providing the focus where focus is needed,” he said. Multiples in the two sectors are also more closely aligned, he added.As for Ms Rosenfeld, she declined to respond directly when asked if she would be running one of the two companies but said she remained fully committed to delivering results in 2011 and 2012. Kraft had a “rich bench” of managers ready to populate the companies.“I’m not going anywhere,” Ms Rosenfeld added. “I plan to keep a leadership role after the transaction closes.”
414;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-08-02T22:02:18Z;It’s OK to launch before you’re ready;;Most of us have built prototypes to communicate and validate our ideas. Even a simple sketch or mock-up of an advertisement can help solicit high-quality feedback from potential customers. And any part of your start-up can be prototyped – even the final pre-launch press release.Although most of us prototype in some way, too often we avoid taking our prototypes out into the big wide world. We have all been trained to perfect our offer before going public, perhaps through a fear that we’ll be copied, we’ll lose the option to patent or because we’re embarrassed to launch without all questions answered.The power of social media and television programmes such as Dragons’ Den may have even increased our fear of public humiliation from failure in business.But there is an alternative: instead of soliciting feedback from customers in focus groups, which we all know never really mimic real life, why not try placing the prototype in its real context?Walter Faulstroh did just this. When co-launching V Water, a soft drink that was subsequently acquired by Pepsi, he took a prototype of the product and placed it on supermarket shelves without asking for permission from the retailer.After watching if passing shoppers ignored or picked it up, he would ask them why. The in-market feedback was faster and higher quality because the context was real.Social media are making it even easier to release prototypes to a wide number of users. Zynga, the social gaming developer, goes public even before it has written a line of code. It prioritises new game concepts by creating a five-word pitch for each and advertising it on a high-traffic website of relevant users. If the pitch is clicked on, the user is diverted to a survey that harvests e-mails and additional information. Zynga then compares interest for each pitch and prioritises accordingly. The company calls this approach “ghetto testing” and it guarantees an excited market before launch, lowering the chance of most entrepreneurs’ greatest fear: market rejection.An ex-colleague of mine, Scott Wilson, has had astonishing success using a similar approach. He had a hypothesis that the iPod nano would make a great wristwatch but didn’t know whether enough potential customers would share this belief. To test market appetite, he placed a short video describing his idea on Kickstarter, a crowdfunding website, and asked people to make commitments to purchase ranging from $1 to $500. Scott’s goal was to raise $15,000 within 30 days but he actually raised almost $1m, shattering all Kickstarter records and instantly validating his designs – all without giving up a single per cent of equity. Scott now runs LunaTik, a successful company based on the watch, but had he been too scared to go public with his idea, it may never have seen the light of day.A similar process can be employed by big companies, too. Amazon’s innovation approach, which it calls “working backwards”, has hinged on prototyping since its early days as a start-up. Its product managers begin any project by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product, forcing themselves to be concise about the benefit.Technology company Intuit went a step further. It had the courage to release unfinished prototypes to market. When it wanted to create a text message marketplace to help Indian farmers reduce waste produce, it sought real feedback from them. Instead of spending months building the complex technology behind the trading platform, the company launched a prototype direct to farmers in just seven weeks. In place of the back-end technology, however, the trades were fulfilled by the project team themselves.By launching the fake site and finding that the farmers embraced the project, Intuit confirmed that its product fulfilled a need and, when it began coding the complete platform, it was able to incorporate the feedback it received from its customers.For a start-up, launching a prototype of all or part of an offer can yield a real competitive advantage by shortening the time to receiving quality feedback. This is likely to become the norm given the new tools that technology provides us with and because markets are more dynamic and unpredictable than in the past.Any start-up consists of a string of unanswered questions and an entrepreneur’s job is, in part, to prioritise answering them with limited resources. Launching prototypes to the world is an important tool for choosing how to answer these pressing questions.So, what are your unanswered questions? And in what order do you plan to answer them?Don’t be afraid to launch a prototype and you may be able to answer them faster and more accurately than you think.The writer is a design director at Ideo, the innovation consultancy, an angel investor and serial entrepreneur.

415;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-07-31T21:14:50Z;Green group disputes carbon reporting costs;;"Forcing companies to publish their carbon emissions – a pre-election promise by both coalition partners – could cost British business up to £6bn over the next decade, the government has claimed in an impact assessment study.But the calculation has been questioned in a report by independent consultants working for the Aldersgate Group, which represents big green-leaning companies such as Microsoft, BT, PepsiCo and Marks and Spencer.The group fears that some ministers and officials will use the environment department’s upper figure – which they believe is far too high – to justify dropping the plans later in the autumn.The department is under pressure from the Treasury and from some business lobbying groups to abandon the policy because of its potential costs on corporate Britain.Mandatory reporting has won a groundswell of parliamentary support, with 137 MPs having signed an early day motion on the issue.The report, commissioned by Aldersgate and three charities – WWF, Christian Aid and the Co-operative Group – says the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) appears to have overestimated the total costs of mandatory carbon reporting for large companies by up to £4.6bn and underestimated the benefits by £980m.“We believe that as both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats pushed for mandatory carbon reporting in opposition, the government needs to commit to full MCR as a way of reducing carbon emissions and backing moves towards a greener economy,” it said.Defra did not dispute the research, which was carried out by Adelphi, an independent consultancy, on behalf of the groups.Instead it said it welcomed all contributions to the debate ahead of the final decision by Caroline Spelman, environment secretary, expected in October.“We asked for comments on our initial impact assessment as part of the greenhouse gas reporting consultation,” a spokesman said. “The work by Adelphi will be considered alongside all other responses to the consultation.”Ms Spelman’s options include keeping reporting voluntary, as it is now. Compulsory measures could mean enforcing reporting for just the listed sector; the 24,000 largest companies; or only the biggest consumers of energy.Defra has produced a range of potential costs and benefits depending on which of the four options is used: applying mandatory reporting to all large companies would produce the biggest potential cost of £6bn.The WWF said: “We are concerned that as the [study] was based on questionable figures, that major benefits to society and the environment will be missed in the final decision because they cannot be quantified as a benefit to UK business.”Many companies already publish details of their carbon emissions, but the practice is not universal or consistent. A recent survey of listed companies by Deloitte found most failed to comply with the government’s voluntary guidance on reporting carbon footprints.Companies already face carbon reporting commitments under the European Union emissions trading scheme and Britain’s carbon commitment. The new system would go further by including all greenhouse gases and not just carbon dioxide.Paul Brannen, head of advocacy at Christian Aid, said British companies were responsible for a large share of global emissions and climate change. “People living in poverty around the world need the government to introduce a robust version of mandatory reporting to give companies and investors all the information and incentives they need to clean up their acts.”"
416;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-07-31T17:04:32Z;US food groups step up healthy eating drive;;US food and restaurant companies are aggressively stepping up their healthy food initiatives to get ahead of government regulations, but sceptics warn that they could be overreaching at their own expense.McDonald’s, the US fast-food restaurant chain, last week bowed to pressure over its marketing to children, putting its “Happy Meals” on a diet by shrinking the size of its French fries and offering apple slices. That followed a move in early July when 19 US restaurant chains promised to offer a children’s meal with limited calories, fat, salt and sugar.Big food companies have also been forging ahead to be healthier. Ken Powell, chief executive of General Mills, the maker of Cheerios cereal and Progresso soups, said its organic business is now a “growth engine” for the company and that the success of that division is informing its entire product line.“Consumer attitudes are changing,” Mr Powell told the Financial Times.PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks company, has been especially ambitious on this front, aiming to double the revenues it generates from nutritious products by the end of the decade. Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s chief executive, in February said, “This is no longer a trend or a fad, this is here to stay”.In spite of these efforts, some argue that food groups risk overreaching by investing in food fads and straying from their strengths.A former chief executive of a top US food company, who now advises other companies, warns about the costs of overreacting to the health push. He said companies risk confusing their research and development departments, which have spent years focused on taste, and that they may be opening opportunities for groups that stick to their less calorie-conscious roots.Steve West, analyst at Sifel Nicolaus, said that healthy options still account for a small percentage of sales at restaurant chains and that companies need to adapt their recipes gradually because flavour preferences are deeply ingrained in their customers. He points to the grilled chicken venture by Yum! Brands’ KFC as an example of the pitfalls of trying to change.“They spent millions of dollars a couple years ago buying ovens for franchises to make grilled chicken to capitalise on the healthier food craze, and it flopped,” Mr West said. “They did not see any sales lift at all.”Last year KFC made a bigger bet on taste with its “Double Down” sandwich, encasing bacon, cheese and sauce between two slabs of fried chicken.Jerry McVety, president of the restaurant consulting firm McVety & Associates, said that some restaurant chains, such as Taco Bell and Hardee’s, have thrived by clinging to core values that are not healthy. He advises restaurant groups that appetite for healthier food is likely here to stay, but that they should be careful about straying too far from what made them successful.“If you change things too much, it can come back to haunt you eventually,” Mr McVety said.

Instead of a shiny briefcase often carried by the bank’s executives, Mr Jain is known to sling a backpack over his shoulders – regarded in Germany as refreshingly different.Josef Ackermann, his predecessor, once said that the real home of a Deutsche Bank chief executive was in the cabin of an aeroplane, but Mr Jain will have a house in Frankfurt am Main as well as London. His two passions are cricket and shooting wildlife – with a camera that is. Having enjoyed trips to Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania, he is planning a few more holidays in the near future.

The former Goldman Sachs banker has decided to place some beehives on the roof of the LSE’s offices in Paternoster Square, to show that the bourse is doing its bit for global pollination. The project is in partnership with The Golden Company, a social enterprise based in east London that works with inner city youth to produce and sell “urban honey”.It seems to be a growing trend in the City. This week, Nomura held a “bee breakfast” at which it showed off the first honey from beehives on the roof of its headquarters.

418;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-07-26T22:47:49Z;The rise of the machines;;Not many entrepreneurs can claim their businesses were saved by a risqué comedian appearing in his underpants on national television. But that is pretty much what happened to Colin Angle, co-founder and chief executive of iRobot.In 2003, iRobot had brought out its signature product, Roomba, a cute autonomous vacuum cleaner, about the size and shape of a dinner plate and the thickness of a novel, that zips around homes, picking up dust as if it has a mind of its own.After a strong start in its first year, sales stumbled and iRobot was in trouble. Until, that is, the company caught a break when PepsiCo ran a television advertisement showing a famous stand-up comic battling a Roomba-like machine.“Pepsi put millions of dollars into a TV commercial with Dave Chappelle losing his trousers to a Roomba and it was remarkable,” says Mr Angle. “Sales tripled, we blew through our inventory and learnt an important lesson about marketing.”The company, whose name is reminiscent of Isaac Asimov’s short stories collection I, Robot, has now shipped more than 6m units. These include robots to clean swimming pools and wash floors, while Roomba has spawned a host of commercial imitators and earned a place in popular culture – including a racy skit on Saturday Night Live involving Tina Fey, a pink “Woomba” and some unexpected cleaning chores.That success has brought iRobot annual sales of $400m and a market value of about $962m, while Mr Angle has become the leading evangelist for a burgeoning industry populated by appliance makers LG and Electrolux and military robot makers such as Qinetiq.Like most foundation myths, the Pepsi story obscures as much as it reveals, glossing over years of hard grind. Mr Angle founded iRobot in the 1990s, after graduating from MIT and then working in its Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, roping in his professor Rodney Brooks and fellow student Helen Greiner to work on applications for his thesis project, a six-legged crawling robot called Genghis.At the core of the group’s mission was a determination that robots should be useful. Mr Angle is fond of saying that his favourite robot from Star Wars is not the glamorous C-3PO or R2-D2 but the little black boxes that guide storm troopers around the Death Star.The trio set themselves up in Mr Angle’s apartment, using his living room as a makeshift laboratory and sneaking back on to the MIT campus when they needed more advanced equipment.Two decades on and sitting in the company’s glass and steel headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts, Mr Angle, 44, talks with a fluency polished by hundreds of corporate presentations. Though in his black jeans and ill-fitting jacket, the gawky, cheeky engineer is still very much in evidence. During conference speeches he occasionally wheels out a life-size cut-out of his mother to help him demonstrate new products for helping seniors to stay in their homes longer – an area in which iRobot hopes to grow in the future.● Strategic Partnering “[Partnering larger companies] allowed us to explore a great many things and mature as a company without piling up debt that would be difficult to repay or burning through years of venture capital investment patience, so that when we finally did take VC money in 1998, we had a much clearer view of what we would do with it and where we were going.”●Fun is key “You best have an enjoyable job because there are going to be bad days. And if you have bad days compounded by ‘I hate my job’, it is not a good recipe for success.”● Nothing is certain “We could have built Roomba 10 years earlier. The technology to do a robot may have cost $50 more, but we could have done it …Why did it take so long for us to get where we got? I was new on the job with less experience. So I was looking for justification. I wanted iron clad ‘if thens’, which you are never going to get.”● Lay the groundwork “Good things happen sometimes. We had enough bad things happen to us – contracts cancelled at the 11th hour for things that weren’t our fault. And I think that luck plays into it but …over the years we had been very open and willing to work with the media and …[when Roomba came out] they loved it and wrote about it, and that created the interest so we got enough attention that the Roomba was sufficiently known for other people to run with it.”●Take calculated risks “As an entrepreneur, having a good answer to ‘if this doesn’t work out, then what?’ is a good idea. Is there a way I can have a couple of irons in the fire to better my odds of success?”“We actually went six and a half years never starting a month with enough money in the bank to make payroll,” Mr Angle says, recalling one particularly disastrous week when a robot blew up during final testing.As a result the fledgling company took whatever work it could get, including building robotic dinosaurs and baby dolls for Hasbro, floor cleaners for SC Johnson, mine-clearing robots for the military and gadgets to gather data from deep wells for the oil industry.In the process, the group stumbled on key ingredients of their later success. SC Johnson opened iRobot to opportunities in cleaning, while working for the military created a focus on rigorous financial controls.“One of the more powerful tools that an entrepreneur has is the naivety to go start down a path which someone who knows more might find too daunting to attempt,” says Mr Angle.Moreover, through its contracts with larger partners, iRobot was able to develop skills and test markets without giving the company away to investors or burning through venture capital funding early on. It only received its first funding in 1998.“The idea that an entrepreneur is the great risk-taker is nonsense. Successful entrepreneurs look like they are taking immense risks, but kind of like a rock climber scaling a 1000ft cliff, they also have a rope,” he says.For iRobot part of that safety net was building a military business. The company first deployed PackBot, a remote-controlled robot used mainly for bomb disposal, in 2002 and has gone on to sell more than 4,000 units to the Pentagon. When the company floated in 2005, Mr Angle became a multimillionaire. Last year he bought a mansion, which he is packing with robots. He retains a 3.4 per cent stake in the company worth about $30m. Nonetheless, he has mixed feelings about going public, describing it as both “invigorating and frustrating”.…Success has also brought him prominence in the robotic community and made iRobot something of a hub for start-ups. Co-founders Mr Brooks and Ms Greiner have both moved on to form new robot businesses, as have other iRobot alumni. “I am proud of all of that,” he says. “[We have created an] ecosystem of entrepreneurship that you usually read about in Silicon Valley. But here near Boston we are seeing it with robots.”Those changes and the growth of the company have forced Mr Angle to constantly re-evaluate his role. Last year he appointed a former Navy research and engineering expert as chief operating officer, allowing him to focus on long-term strategy. That has proved useful given the bumpy time iRobot has had during the recession. Sales of Roomba slipped as consumers cut back and the military restructured pipeline projects.He is currently focused on Ava, which he describes as the next generation of robots. With an extendable lamp-post-like platform, it has a tablet computer for a head and can follow people around, avoid objects and relay video and audio data. That could allow it work as a mobile kiosk, a video conferencing tool or as a security guard.Whatever Ava turns out to be, it is clear Mr Angle’s enthusiasm is as high as it was when he started out in the industry: “This stuff is cool.”
419;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-07-21T23:17:03Z;Pepsi shares tumble as cola sales disappoint;;The pressure on Indra Nooyi, chief executive of Pepsi, to revive the company’s struggling US beverage business intensified on Thursday after disappointing second-quarter results and a cut to the multinational’s guidance on earnings for the full-year.Ms Nooyi blamed consumer and competitive conditions that had become more difficult than that the company expected. She said the pick-up in consumer spending this year had reversed in the past few months.However, Pepsi faced criticism from analysts for neglecting its carbonated beverage business and focusing too heavily on healthier products. In a sign of investor disappointment, Pepsi shares fell 3.39 per cent to close at $66.17 in New York on Thursday.As an owner we are disappointed,” Jim Tierney Jr, chief investment officer of WP Stewart, a Pepsi shareholder, said. “It seemed like the US business was turning a corner and now that corner is a way off.”Pepsi’s beverage sales volume declined by 1 per cent from a year ago in North America, with waning thirst for carbonated beverages offsetting greater demand for still drinks. The company ramped up advertising for its cola brands and reshuffled its marketing department after Pepsi Cola fell behind Coke and Diet Coke in US market share rankings.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo, called Pepsi’s performance “unimpressive” and said that the “tenuous” predicament facing the beverage business could make it harder for the company to make its planned price increases.In a conference call, Ali Dibadj of Sanford Bernstein asked Ms Nooyi if she was putting too much blame on external factors instead of looking at what Pepsi could be doing better to revive its brands. She said that the company was in a constant “state of discontent” and looking to improve.“The lack of internal focus in terms of explaining the situation is troubling,” according to Mr Dibadj. “I’m not sure that this report helped with management credibility. People are frustrated.”Pepsi said it would offer its guidance on a US dollar basis like peer Coca-Cola rather than on a constant currency basis, which smooths out currency fluctuations. It also lowered the bottom range of its earnings outlook by 2 percentage points. It was the second time Pepsi has lowered its outlook this year.In spite of domestic difficulties, Pepsi’s international sales and snacks business supported its second-quarter profits.Net income at Pepsi grew 18 per cent to $1.9bn, or $1.17 a share, from $1.6bn, or 98 cents, in the same period a year ago.

But even the world’s biggest purveyor of these moreish ingredients can have a bad quarter. On Thursday, PepsiCo released results of lower quality than investors had hoped, and said that profits for the full year would be weaker than projected. PepsiCo’s shares fell 5 per cent – a big move for a supposedly defensive stock.Should investors be choking on their Doritos? Hardly. PepsiCo’s share price performance has been on an strong upward trend for two decades. A breather is to be expected. High-profile boss Indra Nooyi is doing her job just fine. Since her first day in the chief executive’s chair in 2006, PepsiCo has outperformed the broader US market and matched Coca-Cola’s total share price return of about 15 per cent.Yet there are whispers behind Mrs Nooyi’s back. To understand why, a shorter time period must be examined. Coke rebounded harder from the financial crisis because it fell further but, even over the past year, PepsiCo’s share price has trailed its rival’s and the market by more than 20 per cent. This underperformance has helped fuel questions about whether the company’s decade-long push into food at the expense of sugary liquids is the correct strategy.But that is the wrong question. It is actually the drinks business in America that is hurting PepsiCo at the moment. Volumes were down 1 per cent year on year last quarter, with operating profits 7 per cent lower. Some accuse Mrs Nooyi of taking her eye of the ball but the similarity with Coke’s US beverage results suggests otherwise. It seems that a soggy economy, competition and higher commodity prices really were to blame. Food performed much better, particularly in emerging countries. Trendy, so-called nutritional products championed by Mrs Nooyi also did well. If the global economy simply muddles along, diversifying beyond drinks might help maintain margins. But if things turn really bad, it is hard to imagine customers buying Spitz sunflower seeds ahead of a can of Pepsi.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

The loss was the result of a charge related to the conversion of Mitsubishi UFJ’s preferred stake.The financial sector led all the S&P sectors, gaining 2.5 per cent.Morgan Stanley was the last of the large Wall Street banks to report second-quarter results in what was a largely positive earnings season. Bank of America gained 3.9 per cent, while Citigroup added 4.4 per cent. Regional banks SunTrust and Fifth Third were also boosted, gaining 3.2 and 3.5 per cent respectively. The regional banks report on Friday and next week.American Express, which reported after the bell on Wednesday, gained 0.9 per cent on strong profits. Cardholders spent a record amount in the second quarter, helping the credit card group report a 31 per cent increase in net profitAfter the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.4 per cent to 1,343.80, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.72 per cent to 2,2834.43. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.2 per cent to 12,724.41.US media reported on Thursday that the Republicans and Democrats were nearing a deal to raise the US debt ceiling and avoid default. While not confirmed, the rumours cheered markets.Also on the economic front, eyes were on a possible European deal to help bail out Greece with the aid of private sector bond holders. Despite the agreed bail-out, some analysts were not sure it was enough to cure risk fears.“Discussions with officials suggest policymakers understand how serious the situation is,” Credit Suisse analysts said. “We think an effective solution to private sector participation in the Greek bail-out is not sufficient to ease markets’ fears.”E*Trade gained for the second straight session, adding 4.8 per cent to $15.43. The online broker gained nearly 14 per cent in Wednesday trading following news that Citadel, a fund that is a shareholder, asked for two board members to step down.“The hedge fund injected $2.55bn of cash into E*Trade back in November 2007 so that it could avoid bankruptcy, and that hasn’t turned out to be a winning investment so far,” noted Canaccord Genuity.A $29bn pharmaceutical deal boosted the sector 1.5 per cent despite Eli Lilly reporting a drop in quarterly earnings.Express Scripts agreed to a $71.36-a-share offer in cash and stock to buy Medco Health Solutions in a deal that will make it the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the US. Medco shares soared 14.4 per cent to $63.83. Express Scripts also benefited, rising 5.3 per cent to $55.36.Eli Lilly reported that sales beat forecasts and the drugmaker boosted its full-year profit outlook. Shares rose 3 per cent to $39.32.The technology sector was cheered by positive results released after the bell on Wednesday. The sector gained 0.5 per cent after finishing the previous session slightly down. It was dragged down by Western Digital, which fell 7.8 per cent ahead of earnings after the bell on Thursday.F5 Networks was down 11.3 per cent after losing 6 per cent over the last two sessions. The cloud computing software maker reported third-quarter profit climbed 54 per cent.Ebay results exceeded expectations, registering a revenue gain of 25 per cent. The online auction company’s shares gained 0.8 per cent to $33.44.“Despite the strong quarter, the company’s updated 2011 guidance was disappointing … We believe the guidance is likely conservative – all key businesses are experiencing acceleration, and there is upside to guidance, even if they stayed at current growth rates,” said analysts at Collins Stewart.Traders were looking ahead to Microsoft’s results after Thursday’s close, which many expect will include warnings about sluggish PC growth.In consumer results, Safeway, the US grocery chain, fell 9.4 per cent after reporting weak same-store sales and lowering forecasts for the same group. Citigroup analysts were positive about Safeway’s forecast that same-store sales will gradually increase, but said investors were still “disappointed”.PepsiCo shares also suffered after the company’s second-quarter results missed expectations. The beverages division was hardest hit and sent shares down 3.4 per cent to $66.17.In its first report after activating its online paywall, the New York Times reported losses weighed down by print costs. Reports that more than 220,000 people subscribed to the digital model cheered investors sending shares 1.9 per cent higher to $9.14.
422;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-07-20T16:30:41Z;Fuller sues Fox over X Factor credit;;Simon Fuller, the creator of the American Idol television series, is suing News Corp’s Fox television network, and the producer of the series, for alleged breach of contract over Simon Cowell’s X Factor show, which will soon hit the airwaves in the US.In his lawsuit, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court this morning, Mr Fuller alleges he was promised an executive producer credit and a fee if a US version of X Factor, in which singers compete for a recording contract, went into production.The dispute between Mr Fuller, Fox and Fremantle, the company that produces American Idol – and which is also producing the new US version of X Factor – relates to a 2005 legal settlement between Mr Fuller and Mr Cowell.The 2005 settlement was struck after Mr Fuller sued Mr Cowell in the UK because of the similarities between the X Factor show and his own American Idol programme. The 2005 dispute ended when Fox “interceded”, according to the suit Mr Fuller filed on Monday.Mr Fuller’s lawsuit alleges the 2005 deal was struck when Fox and Fremantle Media “contractually promised” that when X Factor aired in the US, he would “receive an executive producer credit on X Factor and would be paid an executive producer fee”.With X Factor weeks from launching, Mr Fuller alleges that those promises have been broken.A spokesman for TV impresario said: “Mr Fuller has prudently attempted to settle this matter privately but the other parties have refused to honour the original contract leaving him no other choice but to pursue legal action.”In a statement, Fremantle Media and Fox said Mr Fuller had “not been hired, nor performed any duties, on the US version of the X Factor. His suit seeks payment and credit as an executive producer despite his neither having been approved by the required parties, nor hired, as such. The lawsuit was “without merit and we expect to prevail,” the companies added.Mr Cowell is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, but in taking on Fox and Fremantle in the US courts Mr Fuller has lined up against companies that have been his broadcasting partners for much of the past decade.The lawsuit also raises the stakes in a long simmering rivalry between Mr Fuller and Mr Cowell– friends and colleagues who have clashed with each other on numerous occasions over who deserves the credit for their success.Mr Cowell left the judging panel of American Idol last year to concentrate on bringing his phenomenally successful X Factor show to the US. Television critics had widely predicted the demise of American Idol without Mr Cowell but with a new roster of judges the programme generated better ratings than in its previous series.American Idol has topped the ratings for the past eight years, attracting big sponsorship deals from the likes of Ford and Coca-Cola. Mr Cowell’s defection saw PepsiCo move to back the new version of X Factor, marking a return of the cola wars that dominated music and entertainment in the 1980s and 1990s, when the two biggest brands fought for the most lucrative sponsorship opportunities.Pepsi now plans to spend $60m-$70m on its X Factor sponsorship, which is more than expected, claiming it will feature the deepest product integration seen on TV and in digital media to date.
423;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-07-18T18:18:03Z;Pepsi takes aim at Coca-Cola’s ad icons;Stakes raised with the latest campaign;The battle of the cola brands has had many flavours over the years, with television commercials depicting vending machines spewing cans of Coke and Pepsi at each other, ads with bottles wielding boxing gloves and even a mission to see which beverage held up better in space.This summer the stakes have been ratcheted even higher.PepsiCo, notorious for poking fun at its bigger rival, Coca-Cola, has launched television advertisements in the US this month casting Santa Claus and polar bears, classic Coke mascots, as converts to Pepsi’s core cola brand. The videos, which have gone viral online, have drawn heated responses on social media, with viewers arguing that this time Pepsi has taken things too far.Although many lauded the campaign’s cleverness, some called it “offensive” and accused Pepsi of hijacking the images. Critics complained that it reinforced Pepsi’s second place status.In one, a fun-loving Santa Claus orders Pepsi at a pool party, telling the bartender he was taking a vacation from his deal with Coke. Another shows an animated polar bear choosing Pepsi over Coke before jumping on a yacht.Coke began using Santa Claus in magazine ads in the 1930s and is often credited with having created the modern image of the Christmas icon. The company’s polar bear campaign began in 1993.“I really hate that Pepsi is playing off of Coca-Cola’s classics for their new campaign,” tweeted Sirena Carpenter. “Polar bears and Santa are off limits. Shame on you.”But Pepsi sees value in such responses.“Like many wars, there are moments of truce and moments of war,” said Massimo d’Amore, chief executive of PepsiCo Beverages Americas. “Consumers like the healthy competition and we felt this was the right time to have another episode.”The campaign comes after Pepsi lost a key battle in the cola wars in March, when data from Beverage Digest showed that US market share for its namesake brand had fallen behind both Coke and Diet Coke to third place. Sales of Pepsi and Diet Pepsi fell by about 5 per cent last year, while Coke’s were nearly flat, and it disappointed investors in February by lowering its earnings outlook because of steep commodity price inflation.After facing criticism for losing focus on its carbonated beverage business, Pepsi says it is increasing marketing spending on beverages in North America by 30 per cent this year. Beyond its summer ads, it is investing $60m in a US TV and digital campaign around its sponsorship of X Factor, Simon Cowell’s talent show, to help revive its core cola brand.John Faucher, a beverage analyst at JPMorgan, said that the new Pepsi ads are “classic number two behaviour” but said they succeed by being playful without being disrespectful.“It’s a way of being cheeky,” Mr Faucher said. “It’s going to annoy some people but that’s what they are aiming for.”According to Alan Adamson, managing director of Landor Associates, a brand consulting firm, Pepsi faces an uphill battle against Coke so it must take such risks.“Pepsi has a bigger challenge,” Mr Adamson said. “For them to stay effective, they need to stay current. That’s always harder than being timeless and unchanging.”Coke declined to comment on Pepsi’s new campaign.A spokeswoman noted that Coke launched a summer marketing programme in May. That campaign includes an advertisement with Coke-drinkers enjoying summer.Meanwhile, the most important gauge of the cola wars will come this week. Coca-Cola will release its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, while Pepsi’s are due on Thursday.
424;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;India: no weaning off the sweets;;"India is a country obsessed with food. Social gatherings often revolve around culinary preparations, while eating together is a well-ordained ritual. In such a country, do packaged healthy foods – the fat-free and sugar-free variety – stand a chance?The data say no. This is because Indians view packaged foods as an indulgence, and nobody skimps a few calories when indulging, according to a new report from Euromonitor, the market research consultancy.The Indian market for healthfoods grew at a compounded annual rate of 16.8 per cent from 2005 to 2010. But sales are set to grow more slowly, at 7.8 per cent CAGR until 2015, according to Euromonitor’s report, “Better for You Beverages and Food in India”.This has prompted healthfood manufacturers to take some products off the shelves. Pepsi has stopped offering Pepsi Max, its no-sugar cola, barely a year after launch, while Parle, India’s largest biscuit maker, has withdrawn its baked crisps.Even this writer’s local ice-cream vendor has stopped offering sugar-free kulfi – Indian ice-cream – due to falling demand.“While consumers talk a lot about healthier options, they are still to really warm up to the idea,” Mayank Shah, product manager at Parle, told the Economic Times.“The learning for us in the case of Monaco Smart Chips was, consumers are willing to cut down on frequency of consumption but won’t give up on taste.”Sales of health and wellness products in India, at $6.8bn in 2010, are a tiny fraction of those in the US and China, where sales were estimated at $153bn and $33.6bn, respectively, in 2010, according to Euromonitor.Indians are increasingly at risk from lifestyle diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Despite this, it has been hard to wean Indian consumers from their sugar and fat cravings and sales of confectionery are poised to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 12 per cent from 2009 to 2014.Rising disposable incomes have helped the sales of health-conscious foods to a much smaller extent, as Indian consumers have shown an overwhelming preference for what they like best – rich, sugary foods.Related reading:

425;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-06-22T16:38:01Z;Orange juice soars to 4½-year high;;Orange juice prices hit a 4½-year high on Wednesday as the market braced for a smaller than expected crop in the 2010-11 season due to the impact of a winter freeze, diseases and a drought hitting Florida in recent months.The surge in wholesale prices, if sustained, would force retailers to increase prices, bringing more inflation to the breakfast table after hefty rises in the retail cost of commodities such as coffee, wheat, sugar and corn.Orange juice is a $20bn industry with prices affecting farmers in Florida and Brazil, processors, trading houses and bottlers such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. The market was given visibility by the 1983 film Trading Places, with Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd. As in the film, the market is focused on the new crop forecast, with bulls betting that output would not be as high as expected.Although the US department of agriculture said earlier this month that Florida, the largest orange producer in the country, would produce 140m boxes this season, each weighing 90lb or 40.8kg, up from 133.7m in 2009-10, the estimate was below expectations.The forecast for the season is well below the production of 170.2m in 2007-08 and 162.5m in 2008-09.Citrus growers blame the lower than expected output on a cold snap earlier this year, which damaged some fruits, and a persistent drought over the past few months. Moreover, the spread of the “greening” disease, which forces farmers to uproot trees, is lowering the production outlook.The forecast of an active hurricane season, which runs from June to November, is adding fuel to the fire, analysts say. Bad weather can trigger wild price movements in the orange market. Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Jeanne in 2004 and Wilma in 2005 caused lasting damage to Florida’s citrus industry, helping to push the cost of orange juice futures to a record high of 209.50 cents per pound.In New York, ICE July frozen concentrated orange juice futures hit a session high of 197.5 cents per pound, the highest level since March 2007.The contract later pared gains to trade at 194.3 cents per pound. FCOJ futures prices have surged nearly 13 per cent since January.Florida is the second-largest orange juice producer after São Paulo state in Brazil.
426;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-06-21T17:11:19Z;Delivery curbs spark aluminium price row;;It takes only a few days to deposit aluminium in the largest metal store in Detroit. But ask for your metal to be delivered and it will take not days, but more than six months.The problem stems from an arcane rule on the London Metal Exchange, the centre of global industrial metals trading, which limits the quantity of metal that warehouses must deliver each day.The issue is not merely a dry backwater of exchange regulations. The long queues have driven up the cost of the metal for consumers ranging from manufacturers of cars and planes such as BMW and Boeing to users of the metal in packaging, such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, many traders believe.They have also sparked a fierce debate among the metals community, pitching consumers against Wall Street banks and traders who have in the past two years acquired warehousing companies. The large majority of warehousing capacity in Detroit, for example, is owned by Metro, the warehousing arm of Goldman Sachs.Physical traders say the bottlenecks have helped push up US physical premiums for aluminium – the cost of aluminium in the physical market relative to the LME price – to record levels of about 10 cents per pound ($220 a tonne).Nick Madden, chief procurement officer for Novelis, the world’s top buyer of aluminium metal and a supplier to companies including Ford, LG and Tetra Pak, argues that the record premiums for aluminium in the US are “entirely attributable to this Detroit situation”. The level of premiums is an “anomaly in the market”, he says.The queues at Detroit are not the only factor influencing physical premiums. The tightness in the market is largely due to a high proportion of inventories being held by banks and trading companies in long-term deals. But physical traders estimate that the bottlenecks have added 2-3 cents per pound ($44-$66 per tonne) to the premium.While large consumers rarely buy their metal from the LME, the situation affects them since many contracts are partially based on the physical premiums.Current LME rules stipulate that each warehousing company must deliver out at least 1,500 tonnes of metal per location per day.But with stocks of aluminium in Detroit – which soared during the financial crisis when the auto industry sold down its inventories – now numbering 1.15m tonnes, it would take three years to clear the warehouses at that rate.Since owners of the metal must continue to pay rent on it, even while it is in a queue to be delivered out, the limit on the loading out rate gives warehouses a guaranteed income.As a result, once stocks reach a certain level, it becomes economical for warehouses to buy metal into their warehouses, and then sell that metal on the exchange, in the knowledge that whoever buys it will be forced to pay rent while they wait for physical delivery out of the warehouse.“Warehouses are now able to compete directly with consumers for metal,” says one large aluminium consumer.While this is well within the LME’s rules, it means a long queue can become entrenched, and the LME contract risks becoming detached from the physical market.In a statement, Goldman Sachs said that “warehouse companies, such as Metro, serve an important role in promoting the reliability and liquidity of markets”, adding that market dynamics “reflect many variables”.The debate has come to a head after a day-long meeting of the LME board last Thursday that ended in no agreement on new regulations for the largest warehouses, concluding only that the load-out rate for these warehouses would be raised to at least 3,000 tonnes a day.A major point of debate, according to people familiar with the discussions, was the feasibility of loading out metal more rapidly than 3,000 tonnes per day.Since each LME contract refers to a specific bundle of metal, it is a time consuming activity to find and load out large quantities of metal, traders say. It takes about 80 trucks to meet the current requirement of 1,500 tonnes a day. Some traders doubt whether there is sufficient trucking capacity in Detroit to meet much higher loading out requirements.That means proposals for a very large increase in loading out rates are unlikely to hold sway. Most believe that the changes under discussion will ease rather than fully resolve the problem. What is more, the new rules don’t come into effect until April next year. “Too little, too late,” says Mr Madden.
427;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;MNCs in China: missing the point?;;"Multinational companies are never slow to complain about what they say is an unfair playing field in China: when Beijing gives Chinese companies a leg up, in the form of government procurement or indigenous innovation policies that favour locals, foreign corporates are the first to say so.But according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, which today published a report on the China consumer market with management consultants Booz&Co, MNCs are missing a trick or two, when it comes to e-commerce.After surveying 135 companies competing in China (foreign and local), the report found that 93 per cent of Chinese respondents already use, or plan to use the internet as a selling tool – while a staggering 41 per cent of multinationals do not now, and do not even plan to do so in future. More than twice as many Chinese companies in the survey said at least 11 per cent of their revenue already comes from “technology-enabled transactions”.Chinese companies are also investing in research and development for the mainland market far more seriously than their foreign rivals – a trend that multinationals ignore at their peril, says JoAnne Bessler of Booz, one of the report’s authors. Some 61 per cent of Chinese companies surveyed said they were expanding or planning to expand their R&D capability in China, compared to only 26 per cent of Western multinationals.That kind of R&D push could soon turn the conventional wisdom about China on its head – that Chinese companies have the advantage on cost, while foreign companies have the lead on quality and innovation.“Chinese companies are able to move dramatically faster than MNCs, and able to innovate sometimes twice as fast,” says Ken Newell, China President of Pepsico. “If companies miss the opportunity to invest in R&D here…I think it will be too late”.Chinese companies are also blissfully unworried about recruiting and retaining quality staff, with only 13 per cent of Chinese respondents expressing concern about that – compared to nearly three quarters of foreigners. That may reflect another recent trend that could dwarf all the others: a marked decline in the percentage of Chinese job seekers who want to work for a foreign company, instead of a home grown one.If foreign companies no longer have the obvious upper hand on recruitment, retention, e-commerce and R&D, their days of easy dominance over what will soon be the world’s second largest consumer market could be numberedRelated reading:

428;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-06-08T15:25:19Z;India: health products in demand?;;US based food and beverage giant PepsiCo has been working hard to stay relevant in India’s mass market. Eyeing new consumption opportunities, PepsiCo plans to introduce a new low-priced energy ‘healthy’ drink just in time for the hot months of summer.NourishCo, the result of a new joint venture with Tata Global Beverages, is part of the company’s ‘good-for-you’ platform. Aiming to capture over 300 million consumers who are hovering around the bottom-of the pyramid, PepsiCo has begun market testing ‘Lehar Gluco+’ – a lemon flavoured non-carbonated drink.The drink will be priced at a basic Rs5 for every 200ml pack, roughly 35 per cent cheaper than PepsiCo’s flagship beverage Pepsi.“The product has been developed in India keeping in mind the requirements of the average Indian consumer. We have received phenomenal response to the product during trials and believe it will become a big success given its value proposition”, said Geetu Verma, Executive Director, Innovation, PepsiCo India.PepsiCo is hoping to tap that ‘next one billion’ consumers and believes offering healthier products is the next logical step forward.“We have built a strong platform for our next phase of growth in India, which is on its way to becoming one of the largest economies in the world” said a PepsiCo spokesperson.The conglomerate is hoping to diversify the mix of products by introducing new products with more nutritional value. The introduction of low priced products is reflective of Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s Global chairman’s objective to generate a whopping $30 bn in revenues from ‘healthier’ products-internally called better-for-you and good-for-you products-by 2020.With PepsiCo pitching lemony Lehar Gluco+ as ‘good-for-you’ to its customers, the company is likely has its fingers crossed that the product will be good for its sales too.
429;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-05-29T23:13:22Z;India’s entrepreneurial road ignored;;Everyone in India is a businessman, from the roadside stall owner selling snacks, to the country’s corporate elite such as the billionaire magnate Mukesh Ambani. In fact, the country is said to have the highest number of entrepreneurs in the world.But only a small percentage of these businessmen and women are leading the country’s growth through innovation and new ideas on a big scale. The majority of India’s traders work in privately run businesses and their number, in a population of 1.2bn people, is difficult to estimate.Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) were established to create a pool of the best and brightest individuals who would foster development, creating a growth story for India that would include every individual from the top to the bottom of the pyramid. But even among graduates of these schools, arguably the most qualified and best placed in society to become entrepreneurs, few go on to do so.Although some former students such as Tapangshu Das do opt for the entrepreneurial route, such examples are few and far between. The reality is that more than 90 per cent of graduates at IIMs prefer to take secure, well-paid jobs at international companies such as Accenture and Goldman Sachs, or domestic corporations such as Hindustan Unilever after finishing their postgraduate programme in management – the PGP – often likened to a Masters of Business Administration in India.But John Sculley, a former president of PepsiCo and former chief executive of Apple, says that if India is to grow, it needs to embrace its entrepreneurial spirit in order to innovate.“When it comes to innovation, there is a huge gap. You can trace it to the fact that India is very strong with the left brain, which is about frugal engineering, execution, adapting to processes, for example, where it has built a huge reputation.He told journalists at a leadership summit in Mumbai, organised by the information technology lobby Nasscom that “innovation takes both right and left brain thinking, and the right brain is about taking risk”. Risk-taking is not part of the culture of India, he added.Bakul Dholakia, director of the Adani Institute of Infrastructure Management and former director of the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad (IIMA), echoes Mr Sculley’s views.He says: “In Indian culture, in your early 20s, your parents still play a very important role in your lifeand have a huge influence on key decisions. When I was director at IIMA I really did try to encourage entrepreneurship, but it wasn’t the students that didn’t want to take the risk. It was their parents who objected and questioned why their sons and daughters would want to give up a good job and the security of a certain type of lifestyle and salary that goes with it. They do not want their children to have to struggle.”Moreover, securing a coveted place at one of the 11 highly competitive IIMs involves considerable amounts of time, effort and money and many parents would rather their offspring opted for a foot on the relatively secure corporate ladder, than embark on an entrepreneurial venture.To encourage entrepreneurship, Prof Dholakia introduced a policy change at IIMA in 2006. If students embarked upon an entrepreneurial route that after a year was unsuccessful, they would be eligible for placements at big-name corporations for the two years after graduation.“Parents really welcomed this, as they wanted something for their children to fall back on. But hardly any of these students came back [for the placement],” he adds.Age is also a factor. B.H. Jajoo, dean at IIMA, says that the average age of an IIM graduate is 24. However, globally, most entrepreneurs do not consider their own entrepreneurial venture until the age of 28.“Remember that MBA students in India really are less experienced than their counterparts abroad. They tend to complete all of their education first, and then start work. They would rather use those few years after graduation to gain some on-the-ground training.”A lot of students are also deterred because “an unsuccessful venture takes away prime time for career building”, says Prof Jajoo. Failure at such a venture could result in two or three years of lost time in which a student could have moved up the corporate ladder significantly, he adds.At IIMA more than 90 per cent of graduates accept offers from domestic and international companies, with nearly 60 per cent accepting jobs in finance or consulting. These ratios are typical across all IIMs.However, the climate may be changing. The government-backed IIMs are trying to cultivate entrepreneurship to provide more chances to those Indians willing to take that leap of faith.The IIMs at Bangalore, Calcutta, Lucknow and Kozhikode all have centres for entrepreneurship and the Indian School of Business at Hyderabad has a compulsory course in entrepreneurship as part of its PGP.IIMA offers a number of entrepreneurship courses alongside seed funding from private equity groups, incubation labs, finance training and a mentoring system to support fledgling entrepreneurs. But such opportunities are only available to a few people.“We take around four or five companies on a year [into the incubator], some from IIMA and some from outside,” says Prof Jajoo.…To date, IIMA has taken on about 25 companies. Of IIMA’s 9,000-strong alumni, about 10 per cent have set up or are running their own businesses. “Every year around 15 to 20 students will go into business,” adds Prof Jajoo. About 300 chief executives of professionally run organisations in India are IIMA alumni, he says. Prof Jajoo is keen to emphasise the role of private equity funding in fostering entrepreneurship.“This funding for postgraduate ventures is picking up. As the economy grows and consumption increases, there is a greater demand for new technology. This is providing fertile ground for innovation particularly in India,” he says.
430;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Commodities costs weigh on Britvic results;;The soaring cost of commodities such as sugar and oil weighed on interim profits at Britvic, as the maker of Robinsons, Tango and Fruit Shoot drinks raised the prices that it charges retailers.Britvic, which makes four-fifths of its revenues from the UK and Ireland, blamed input cost inflation for the price increases negotiated at the start of the year, which the group declined to quantify.“Clearly raw material cost inflation has been an issue for the general food and beverage market over the past year,” said Paul Moody, Britvic chief executive.Mr Moody said the Chelmsford-based company was tackling higher material costs by introducing lighter, less plastic-intensive bottles, as well as promoting sugar-free drinks such as Pepsi Max, which it distributes in the UK.“Across all three of our trading units, Great Britain, France and Ireland, we’ve been successful in securing price increases with our customers,” Mr Moody said. “Whilst retailers will never be happy with higher prices, we’ve secured the increases that we wanted.”Mr Moody said that consumers had also accepted the price increases with little complaint, in spite of the financial constraints facing them.“Over the past few years what we’ve seen is that the soft drinks category is very resilient to economic pressures,” he said.At Britvic’s Great Britain division, volumes of still drinks fell by 3.9 per cent, dragged down by sluggish trading at pubs and clubs. However, take-home market volumes of carbonated beverages grew by 5.9 per cent year-on-year, driven by strong sales of energy drinks.The group left its input cost inflation guidance for the remainder of the year unchanged at 9-11 per cent, but noted that trading over the past few weeks had been strong.The higher costs come as Britvic continues its global expansion following last year’s acquisition of Fruité, the group’s new French division, and the roll-out of Fruit Shoot in Australia.Britvic, which distributes Pepsi in the UK, is expanding its presence across the Atlantic, and plans to commence distribution of Fruit Shoot in North and South Carolina during the coming year.Britvic’s global expansion follows a £104m writedown of the value of its Irish assets in December, and a restructuring of the division to cope with the tough economic conditions in the Republic. Britvic on Friday said it booked a one-off charge of £7.5m for its Irish business.During the 28-week period to April 17, Britvic released two new products – Juicy Drench and Mountain Dew Energy drinks.Like-for-like revenues rose from £505.3m to £515.7m. However, when revenues from Fruité were included, Britvic turnover rose by a quarter to £633.1m during the half.Pre-tax profit fell from £27.8m to £20.1m, and diluted earnings per share fell from 9.5p to 6.4p. The dividend per share rose 8.5 per cent to 5.1p.Britvic shares rose 3.8p, or 0.9 per cent, to 429.8p in early London trading.
431;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-05-15T21:35:46Z;Birds Eye Iglo wants to reel in Russian buyers;Seeks to broaden sales ahead of a possible flotation;Birds Eye Iglo, the frozen foods businesses bought out of Unilever by Permira, is attempting to win over Russian consumers to fish fingers as it seeks to broaden its sales ahead of a possible flotation.The company, which invented the fish finger, currently sells them in Moscow and St Petersburg and plans a further roll-out of the product in Russia.However, the sales drive must overcome a cultural suspicion of breaded foods, according to Martin Glenn, chief executive. “Russian consumers are brought up to believe food is covered with stuff because it’s bad quality,” he said.Mr Glenn was speaking ahead of the publication of annual results on Monday, which show underlying net sales growth of 2 per cent to €1.1bn in 2010.Overall, the western European frozen foods market, which has typically been outpaced by chilled foods, grew 1.8 per cent to €25bn last year, according to Euromonitor.In the first quarter of 2011, the company said underlying net sales growth was 4 per cent, which Mr Glenn attributed partly to consumers turning to frozen meals rather than chilled meals because they stayed fresh longer.“Post-recession, people still want great food but there is a far bigger awareness of waste and value than there was, and that works brilliantly for us,” he said. Mr Glenn, who was plucked from PepsiCo’s Walkers Crisps to run the frozen goods group in 2006, further attributes growth to innovation and marketing.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 8.7 per cent last year to €233m, including €16m from Findus Italy. Gross margins were lifted 3.5 percentage points to 32.3 per cent.Birds Eye Iglo closed a factory in Hull shortly after acquiring the Birds Eye business from Unilever for €1.7bn in 2006 and is in the process of scything around a quarter of the labour force at a recently acquired Italian factory.The company has completed a refinancing which excised payment-in-kind notes as well as replacing pricier bank loans with cheaper debt.At the end of 2010, net bank debt – excluding shareholders’ loans and mezzanine debt – stood at €1.4bn, equivalent to 4.6 times rolling 12 months’ ebitda. All in, total debt came to €2.7bn.Progress on the underlying business and the balance sheet comes ahead of an expected exit by Permira: bankers reckon the company could be ready for an initial public offering as soon as next year.
432;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-05-15T18:52:21Z;US tax fears prompt overseas M&A rush;;US multinational companies are stepping up efforts to deploy their overseas earnings in cross-border mergers and acquisitions as they seek to avoid the tax hit from repatriating their so-called “trapped cash”.The activity has prompted debate among bankers over whether tax issues are distorting business decisions, potentially leading US companies to favour overseas investments over opportunities at home.“Companies have been asking bankers to find them targets in countries where they can use this cash,” said one adviser. “It is earning them zero and lowers the opportunity cost of an acquisition in an overseas market.”Other bankers, however, argue that using foreign cash to make acquisitions does not meaningfully contribute to decision-making but is just a bonus.Use of cash in international deals by US buyers is at record levels, according to Dealogic. Cash-only deals accounted for 90 per cent of international deal activity this year and last, and about 60 per cent of global deals.Last week, Microsoft said that it would use $8.5bn in offshore cash to buy Skype, a Luxembourg-based company.Companies rarely disclose the source of the cash used in deals. But people familiar with the matter said offshore cash was deployed in PepsiCo’s purchase of Russia’s Wimm-Bill-Dann last year and in General Electric’s recent international deals, as well as in a raft of transactions involving healthcare and technology companies with significant foreign earnings.US technology companies have been particularly vocal in calling for a tax holiday that would enable them to bring funds back to the US. Cisco, which used overseas cash in the $3.3bn purchase of Norway’s Tandberg in 2009, and Microsoft both have more than 80 per cent of their cash and short-term investments offshore.Senior officials in the Obama administration say they are fiercely opposed to such a move. Critics of a tax holiday worry that repatriated cash will be returned to shareholders rather than invested in job creation.Companies are also becoming more creative in seeking to use their overseas cash in the US without suffering adverse tax consequences, say experts. Qualcomm in January said it planned to use offshore funds to buy Atheros, the US chipmaker.Deals of this kind sometimes employ complex structures that can only be used in limited circumstances. Companies must also tread carefully. If the funds are no longer deemed to be “permanently invested” overseas, companies could be forced to provision for their potential tax liability in the US.Some credit rating agencies only give companies partial credit for cash overseas, assuming that they would lose a chunk to the government were they to bring it onshore.
433;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-05-09T01:37:41Z;China sets pace in brand innovation;;"In the Jinqiao Carrefour in eastern Shanghai, Coca-Cola and Pepsi – kingpins of the soft drinks industry the world over – are literally backed to the wall.While Coca-Cola still has the biggest share of China’s $49bn soft drinks market, pride of place on a large display is given over to fast-growing local brews.These include Wahaha’s vitamin-packed smoothies, Nongfu Spring’s exotic fruit blends, Wang Lao Ji’s herbal teas and scores of others like them.None of these names would have resonance elsewhere. There is nothing more local than food and drink, as Roland Decorvet, Nestlé’s chairman and chief executive for China, points out. “Milk drinks are big here, and the most popular flavour is peanut. Second is walnut. Try to launch that in any other country and you won’t sell much.”Just as US food and drink companies for decades ignored the rest of the world on the basis that their own market was big enough, so Chinese companies can afford to be similarly focused.China’s soft drinks market is forecast to grow from $49bn last year to $86bn by 2015, according to Euromonitor, the data agency.Moreover, per capita consumption of 46 litres is just a bit more than half the global average of 80 litres – and far short of the US’s 340 litres. Hence the marketing push by local companies to build brands, innovate and increase distribution.“The local guys are innovating more and the foreign guys are having to play catch-up,” says Ted Hurley, associate director of fast-moving consumer goods at Nielsen, the information and analytics company.He reels off a list of other local names: Mengniu, Yili and Bright Food in the dairy industry; Cofco, a state-owned agribusiness with food interests from grains to wine; and Uni-President of Taiwan.“All have top-five-selling brands,” he says.There are more prosaic examples. Toothpaste commands the same sweep of shelf space as in the west, with the same array of choice. There are tubes costing a few renminbi and international brands priced at up to Rmb18 ($2.77). In the middle of the shelving, with no fancy packaging or extreme promises, is Yunnan Baiyao toothpaste, priced at a punchy Rmb26.Yet despite its price, Yunnan – a traditional Chinese medicine company that segued into toothpaste a few years ago – has steadily been taking share from the likes of Colgate and Procter & Gamble, says Mr Hurley.“Yunnan has made the biggest market share gains in the past two or three years because it’s a local brand going premium – way more premium than anything else,” he says.Analysts attribute the success of these brands to several factors. They say they have a stronger handle on consumer trends – although, ironically, several of these are global and include healthier diets and a desire for novelty.In an effort to feed this, consumer companies constantly innovate. China is set to be the second-biggest testing ground for innovation in the world this year, Nielsen reckons.Zong Qinghou, Wahaha chief, bemoans the ceaseless pressure to launch new tastes. “I am constantly having to launch new products,” he says, noting the average product lifespan is three years. It takes that long to bring new ones to market.Arto Hampartsoumian, China chief executive of advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty, says that the race to innovate between Chinese companies and their western competitors is risky. “Offering more choice doesn’t mean you can make more money …there is a risk of self-cannibalisation.”All this creativity does not always lead to culinary delights or sustainable sales. Euromonitor cites Wahaha’s Pi Er Cha Shuang, a beer-flavoured carbonated tea. Customers, lured by the novelty, rushed to buy it – but few made repeat purchases.Stumbles like this are not expected to prevent innovation. For one, local companies have big wallets – and their stock market listings and access to venture capital means there are plenty of sources to fund it.While the brands slug it out in China, the battle is set to go global, as many local companies harbour international ambitions. Bright Food has sought to buy several overseas companies, while Wahaha wants to double its revenues, now Rmb55bn, to Rmb100bn in the next three to five years.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen in Shanghai"
434;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-05-08T22:26:54Z;Industries’ big push for niche markets;;"Community hairdressers are proliferating at a rate of about eight per week on British high streets – or roughly one-quarter the rate at which pubs are closing – providing the latest example of the burgeoning growth in ethnic minority markets.According to a survey by L’Oréal, the French cosmetics group, Afro-Caribbean salons are leading the charge, with a growth rate of some 40 per cent over the past two years.Junior Green, who runs one of an estimated 3,000 such hairdressers in London’s upmarket Knightsbridge, says consumer demand is fuelling the growth of both salons and products.“It’s come on in leaps and bounds. Back in the day there were limited products, and many were a lot harsher,” he says.Mr Green himself struggled to find an apprenticeship in an Afro salon in the 1980s, and says the pinnacle of style at that time was the “wet look” championed by the late pop singer Michael Jackson.Purveyors of these products, faced with broadly stagnant US and European markets, are rushing to help out.L’Oréal has doubled European sales of its Mizani range in the past year and is looking to expand it beyond the UK, France and the Netherlands within Europe.Unilever’s recent purchase of Alberto Culver was seen by some analysts as a means of tapping the Hispanic markets in the US and, from there, to Latin America. Bernstein, the independent research house, calculates that US Hispanics, who today represent 16 per cent of the population and 10 per cent of consumer expenditure, will make up nearly one-third of the population by 2050, when consumer spending will approach one-quarter.According to Bernstein, the group already spends a bigger proportion of its budget on soft drinks, a fact not missed by the likes of PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper Snapple which all have brands targeted at Hispanic consumers.In the UK, AG Barr – the drinks group better known for Irn-Bru – has gone after ethnic minority consumers with its Rubicon fruit juice brand, acquired three years ago.Sales of Rubicon, its second biggest brand after Irn-Bru, grew the fastest last year at 28 per cent, fuelled in part by advertising and cricket sponsorship which AG Barr says is the “core sporting passion” for Asian and black Caribbean audiences: three-quarters of attendees at the International Cricket Council Twenty20 World Cup in England belonged to ethnic minorities.Roger White, chief executive, however, notes that the major attraction is the brand loyalty attached to such products.“We run the largest ethnic brand in the UK,” he says. “It’s called Irn-Bru, and the consumers are Scottish – that’s their ethnic background.“One of our core competencies is growing brands with a strong but not
necessarily national following.”More consumer product groups are following suit to tap growing niche markets within mature economies.Nielsen, the global market information and analytics consultancy, forecasts that Asian, Hispanic and Black/African American populations in the US will make up more than half of America’s population by 2050, up from 35 per cent today.Their spending on categories tracked by the consultancy will increase 74 per cent over the same period, to $520bn.This, Nielsen says, will have an impact on how manufacturers distribute and advertise their products: African Americans, for example, are more likely to shop at dollar stores while Hispanics prefer cash-and-carry or warehouse clubs.And as well as developing and distributing new products, consumer groups manufacturers are increasingly seeking to reach these markets though more distinctive advertising in targeted media, says Nielsen.African Americans, for example, are the biggest watchers of television in the US, with house-holds clocking up 78 hours a week on average, a full 20 hours above the overall average.Some things, however, are apparently universal: Sunday Night Football and American Idol have “broad appeal” says Nielsen."
435;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-05-05T21:50:56Z;US needs to shed its taboo on economic planning;Government should set up specific vocational institutes to prepare workers for new industries, writes Kishore Mahbubani;The great debate on how to fix America’s economy and pay back its debt has begun. Most Americans assume that, in the end, all will be well. But they have failed to notice one missing dimension: in a global economic system in which Asia is increasingly central, their country is no longer a price-maker. It has slipped to become a mere price-taker instead.There was a time when the great American economy could set its own course, and the rest of the world adjusted. Like an aircraft carrier, it felt no pressure to adapt when global currents changed. Today that is no longer true. The US economy can now become globally competitive only if it makes an effort to understand its relative competitiveness in the world.Here job creation is the great challenge. But jobs can be created sustainably in the sectors where the US is globally competitive. Where they are not, the jobs will flow overseas. This fact means Americans must learn some hard truths.The paradox here is that American ideology and US business have led the way in creating globally competitive enterprises. Yet, after persuading the rest of the world to be competitive, the US government failed to educate its people that they too must adjust and adapt. Neither President Barack Obama nor leaders on the right such as Paul Ryan have rammed this message home in their debate over the US budget.The result is that American multinationals – from Apple to Google, Coca-Cola to Pepsi, Boeing to Microsoft – remain globally competitive, but US workers have been led to believe that a mixture of domestic stimulus and gradual entitlement reform will create long-term sustainable jobs in the industries in which they currently work. They will not.One symbolic move the US made in the recent financial crisis showed how out of touch its economic planners had become. To resolve global imbalances, America asked China and Germany to reduce their export surpluses. But the success of the Chinese and German economies depends on their ability to adapt to a rapidly changing global marketplace. It would have been suicidal for their manufacturers to cut off supplies to customers just to please the US.Today’s Chinese economy is thriving not because of a heavy-handed state, but because it can produce mini-Hindu deities for Indian consumers, and carnival mementos for Brazilians – as well as Apple iPad parts and bullet train components. This is how China overtook the US and became the world’s number one manufacturer in 2010.Yet the idea that the US too may have to adapt to new global economic realities seems almost inconceivable to Americans. But manufacturing is thriving in China, Germany, Sweden and Singapore only because their governments set up specific vocational institutes to prepare workers for new industries. China has rapidly overtaken the US in green technology because of a co-ordinated national response, not because Chinese businesses alone invested in green technology.In short, what America needs is a change of mindset. US economic planners must take a hard-headed look at the jobs Americans can do better than other workers in China, India, Brazil or Germany. They also must understand why so many US companies are investing overseas because of poor tax and financial incentives. A simple tax amnesty provision – with Washington insisting that any money saved should be invested in worker training – could bring investment by US companies back into America.But this also means a change in the role of government itself. I use the phrase “economic planner” deliberately. Such a notion remains taboo in an American discourse still held prisoner by the old Ayn Rand and Alan Greenspan economic mindset. Yet, in a ruthlessly competitive global marketplace, only prudent and judicious government intervention can help an economy change course and adapt. China did that when it joined the World Trade Organisation and forced its state-owned economic enterprises to absorb the pain of becoming globally competitive. Now the US too needs a comprehensive economic plan to adjust and adapt, and to take its people along for the ride.The writer is Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at National University of Singapore
436;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-05-04T17:50:19Z;High petrol prices fuel jump in US online shopping;;Online shopping grew by its fastest rate in nearly four years in the US last month as rising fuel prices prompted Americans to cut trips to malls and buy on the internet instead, according to MasterCard Advisors.US consumers spent $13.8bn online last month, a 19.2 per cent jump from April last year, according to the SpendingPulse survey, which is based on spending on MasterCard credit cards and estimates of other forms of payment.The increase is likely to outpace sales growth at bricks-and-mortar stores, due to be released on Thursday. The consensus of economists’ forecasts is that sales at stores open a year or more rose 7.7 per cent in April.Mike Berry, director of ­industry research for MasterCard Advisors, said: “We’ve started to see demand distortion, with people pumping fewer gallons and driving less.”Petrol prices are squeezing consumers as they approach $4 a gallon. The average national price was $3.96 a gallon on Wednesday, up from about $3.10 at the end of February.US consumers had more money in their pockets in the first quarter because of a ­temporary cut in payroll taxes but while consumer spending increased during the period, around a third of the rise went on energy costs.The growth in e-commerce was evident in the quarterly results of the leading online retailers last week. Amazon reported US sales up 45 per cent at $5.5bn and Ebay said its gross US merchandise volume rose 10 per cent to $5.6bn.PepsiCo said last week it had noticed consumers spending more at small convenience and dollar stores as soaring petrol prices deterred them from driving to bigger retailers.Mike Duke, chief executive of Walmart, which relies on customers driving to its “big box” stores, said its shoppers were “not yet” feeling the effects of an economic recovery.Walmart is seeking to boost its online presence. Last month it launched a test service that lets shoppers order fresh food on the internet for home delivery.When it reports its quarterly results this month, it will be watched closely to see if it can end a seven quarter sequence of falling US store sales.April was the 21st consecutive month in which online sales grew and the fourth consecutive month of accelerating growth, said MasterCard.The last year-on-year decline in online spending came in the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008 and the first half of 2009 when consumption plunged across the board.MasterCard’s Mr Berry said consumers today were becoming more comfortable shopping online, a trend that helps explain a longer-run expansion in e-commerce that began in the late 1990s.E-commerce has risen gradually from 0.6 per cent of total retail spending at the end of 1999 to 4.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year, according to Census Bureau figures.
437;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-04-28T20:20:15Z;Shoppers in US squeezed by rising fuel costs;;American shoppers remain cash-strapped and may be even more reluctant to spend than last year, according to consumer goods companies which posted worse-than-expected quarterly sales figures for the US.Companies behind products from Ariel detergent to Colgate toothpaste have reported results that highlight the damaging impact of rising fuel prices on consumption.Even though stronger growth in emerging markets has offset the effects of weaker US sales at many companies, they are also seeing profit margins squeezed by higher commodity costs and are agonising over how much to pass on to consumers.The results came as US government figures revealed slowing growth in the first three months of the year and a deceleration in consumer spending growth from the end of last year.Procter & Gamble, the maker of Ariel and the world’s biggest consumer goods company, said on Thursday that its sales across developed markets grew less than 1 per cent from a year ago, falling short of the 1-2 per cent it had expected.Bob McDonald, chief executive, said: “The consumer in developed markets is struggling – struggling with higher gas prices, and relatively fixed to modestly higher incomes, which is causing them to make choices.”Colgate-Palmolive, a smaller P&G rival, said its sales in North America, which account for 18 per cent of its revenue, dropped 4.5 per cent in the past quarter.Kimberly-Clark said this week that sales in its US personal care division, which includes Huggies nappies, were down 2 per cent in the past quarter, while sales were flat in consumer tissues, which includes the Kleenex brand.P&G and PepsiCo on Thursday joined Coca-Cola in saying one of their responses to high commodity prices would be to shrink the size of some product packages while maintaining prices – a move that risks a backlash from consumers.On Monday P&G said it would raise the wholesale prices of other products, including a 7 per cent rise for Pampers nappies and a 5 per cent increase for Bounty paper towels.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chief executive, said this week that falling US unemployment had not yet had a positive impact on spending, and that the pain of rising petrol prices would become severe this summer.PepsiCo, the snacks and drinks group, said it would not raise prices by as much as it would have in other circumstances given the “challenging” environment consumers face. It posted improving sales in its snacks and drinks businesses, but higher costs ate into its profits, which fell by 20 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter.It also said it has noticed consumers spending more at small convenience and dollar stores as soaring petrol prices deter them from driving to bigger retailers.Mike Duke, chief executive of Walmart, the “big box” retailer, was asked if his customers were feeling the effects of a recovery and replied: “Not yet.”Noting a pattern of sales falling throughout the month and then surging as soon as consumers cash pay cheques, he said: “Even compared with a year ago, it shows more pressure on consumers.” Walmart reports its quarterly results next month.
438;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-04-28T12:25:04Z;Emerging markets boost Pepsi sales;;PepsiCo on Thursday reported increased sales from its snacks and beverage businesses, with strength in emerging markets offsetting weaker demand in the US.Revenues at PepsiCo rose by 27 per cent to $11.93bn in the first quarter, up from $9.3bn in the same quarter a year ago and beating Wall Street analysts’ estimates.“Growth in emerging markets was strong, driving attractive gains in Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East,” Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, said in a statement.Net income at PepsiCo fell 20 per cent, to $1.14bn, or 71 cents a share, from $1.43bn, or 89 cents, in the first quarter of last year. The fall was in line with projections and was due to interest expenses from its recent bottler acquisitions.Sales of snacks grew by 3 per cent year-on-year, but growth was blunted by declines in North America and Brazil. Beverage volume, excluding the impact of acquisitions, grew by 12 per cent globally and by 2 per cent in North America.PepsiCo has been under pressure to revive its carbonated beverage business, but during the quarter its core Pepsi brand fell to third place behind Diet Coke in terms of its US market share, according to Beverage Digest data.Carbonated soft drinks sales volume in the US were flat compared with a year ago, with Mountain Dew growing in the mid-single digits, Sierra Mist growing in the low single digits and PepsiMax surging by 130 per cent from a year ago. Non-carbonated drinks, such as juices, were up 7 per cent.Hugh Johnston, chief financial officer, said that PepsiCo is dealing with “a high level of input cost inflation” and is using “prudent pricing actions and systematic hedging” to manage rising commodity prices.Shares in PepsiCo rose 0.32 per cent to $67.93 in pre-market trading in New York.

440;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-04-27T09:47:01Z;Rivalry at the top causes unease;;Mikhail Osokin, anchor of an opposition-oriented news programme on Russian television channel REN TV, says he can reliably tell an election is coming by the tone of the government’s calls to him and his editors following his shows.“It’s an atmosphere, like a feeling on your skin,” he says. “In an election year, there is a chill. Everyone is a little more nervous. And this year, everyone is a little more nervous than in most election years.”Russian journalists are like canaries in a coal mine – the first to feel a change in the political atmosphere. And what is making people jumpy this time is that, with less than a year before the 2012 presidential election, the outcome is not yet widely known – which is unsettling in a country that prizes predictability.The main question is no longer whether Dmitry Medvedev will stay for a second term, or whether Vladimir Putin will return to the presidency from his current role as prime minister – this has always been tempered by the widely held view that, whatever happens, it will be part of a well-rehearsed plan decided in the smoky back rooms of the Kremlin, a stitch-up between the two men.Now, however, the uncertainty is over whether there actually is a plan, or whether the outcome will be left to the personal ambitions and relative power of each man and his entourage.“I really don’t think they [Mr Putin and Mr Medvedev] know who is going to be president,” says Mr Osokin. “And no one else knows either.”Over the past month, Mr Medvedev has begun laying markers for his own presidential ambitions, to the obvious displeasure of his predecessor, sparking talk of a rift between the two.In March, Mr Medvedev chastised Mr Putin, calling his remarks on the Libyan war – which the latter had compared to a crusade – “unacceptable”.Then, in April, he forced one of Mr Putin’s most trusted lieutenants, Igor Sechin, a deputy prime minister, to step down from his post as chairman of Rosneft, the state oil company, with a decree prohibiting ministers from holding seats on the boards of state companies.On April 12, he issued his boldest statement yet, indicating that he could stay on. “I do not rule out that I will run for a new term as president. A decision will be made, moreover, in the fairly near future, because there is less than a year remaining,” Mr Medvedev told Chinese state TV on the eve of a visit to Beijing.Mr Putin, meanwhile, seems to be pushing back against Mr Medvedev’s pugilistic tone. The day after Mr Medvedev’s challenge, Mr Putin told journalists that either of them could still run in 2012, and it was too early to make any announcements about the election.Infighting in the Kremlin is nothing new – Winston Churchill famously compared Soviet politics to watching “bulldogs fight under a carpet”. And reading the tea leaves today is reminiscent of Cold War-style Kremlinology, when armies of CIA analysts, with little else to go on, pored over the seating arrangements of the May Day parade bandstand.One official close to Mr Putin cautions journalists about making too much of the recent squabbling – both the prime minister and the president have an interest in keeping everyone guessing, he says.The moment one of them becomes the candidate, the power of the other would be reduced. “Neither wants the other one to be a lame duck,” he points out.But there are signs that the uncertainty is having a real effect. Despite near-record prices for oil and a seemingly healthy economy, nervous Russians have taken a net $21bn out of the country in the first quarter, according to the central bankMeanwhile, when Mr Medvedev and Mr Putin publicly disagreed over the war in Libya, parliamentary deputies tried to avoid taking sides, perfecting the art of “sitting on two stools”, as the Russian saying goes.Most people still believe that the decision on the presidency rests with Mr Putin “but it’s not clear that he wants it”, according to the editor of a Moscow daily newspaper. “There is a view that he is just tired of the whole game.”There is more to Russian political life, though, than what happens inside the Kremlin. There are increasing signs that the electorate is fed up with the two choices on offer. A study by the Center for Strategic Research, a think-tank with close links to the United Russia political party, says focus groups have expressed increasing disapproval of the ruling duo.“The change in the political consciousness of Russians that has occurred in recent months is not only diminishing confidence in the Putin-Medvedev tandem, but fuelling demand for a new leader, a third leader,” the report says.The rise in discontent is a conundrum. The price of oil, the usual barometer of Russian economic health, is above $120 a barrel and climbing. Inflation is near its lowest in two decades, though rising. Bank credit is growing, and deposits have surged 30 per cent since the crisis two years ago, a sign of renewed confidence.Investment is also growing. Officials say their goal is to raise investment as a percentage of GDP from 20 per cent now to more than 30 per cent over the next decade, chiefly by attracting foreign investment.Recent deals have underlined this, such as PepsiCo’s acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann, and the announcement of a $10bn government fund to invest alongside foreigners in private equity-type deals.“We need to make progress in improving the investment climate,” says Arkady Dvorkovich, a Kremlin economic adviser, who calls a trend towards liberal economic reforms ”a very positive signal”.He recently met western bankers and economists to hear their views on what Russia can do to make itself more attractive to foreign investors, in an openness to foreign opinion not seen for years.However, one key indicator is doing badly – real wages, which doubled in less than a decade under Mr Putin until 2008, but have barely risen in the past two years.Yitzhak Brudny, a Russia specialist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says the rising discontent indicates that Mr Putin is a victim of his own success. In the Putin years, Russians became used to steadily improving living standards.“[Former President Boris] Yeltsin put expectations down, so it was easy for Mr Putin to meet them in his first years,” he says. “Now, expectations are much higher.”Much of Russia’s mood of protest is being funnelled into ethnic nationalism: in December, Moscow witnessed the largest violent disturbances since 1993, as skinheads rioted outside the Kremlin walls on Manezh Square. A poll in January by the Levada Center, a sociological research agency, showed that 58 per cent of Russians support the slogan “Russia for the Russians”, the highest number since data began to be collected in 1998.It is difficult to predict how the new protest mood will affect calculations in the Kremlin. Mr Medvedev has been positioning himself as the candidate for the disaffected, but his appeal is limited to a narrow liberal audience. Further disorder and a descent into nationalism would favour the return of Mr Putin.The Kremlin, long used to throwing money at problems – Mr Osokin calls the practice “stuffing people’s open mouths with cash” – has found that this approach may for the first time spawn more inflation and ultimately be counter-productive.“They can’t step into the same river twice,” says Mr Brudny. “There is a real sense that they have already tried everything, and are out of ideas.”
441;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-04-24T19:43:22Z;PepsiCo questions Fed inflation guide;;PepsiCo’s chief financial officer has criticised US policymakers’ focus on “core” inflation, arguing that it overlooks the impact of rising prices on consumer spending power.The Federal Reserve’s preference for the core price measure that excludes food and energy has stirred controversy as commodity price rises have accelerated and companies have had to judge how much they can pass on costs to hard-pressed consumers.“It’s a big exclusion,” Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s chief financial officer, said in an interview with the Financial Times. “The reality right now is that food and fuel are quite inflationary.”Food prices have climbed nearly 3 per cent in the past year and petrol prices have increased nearly 30 per cent, according to the labour department’s latest consumer price index.During the same period, “core prices” rose 1.2 per cent.PepsiCo, with its $60bn snacks and drinks portfolio, has a privileged insight into the state of consumer sentiment around the world.According to Mr Johnston, consumers who earn less than $70,000 per year are continuing to struggle and face the greatest threat from inflation.“The unemployment rate is inching down but disposable income is not growing much,” Mr Johnston said, explaining that efforts to inject liquidity into the US economy were not yet creating significant growth.The Fed argues that core prices are a better guide to underlying price pressures in the economy and therefore to future inflation – if it responded to headline prices, then it would have been forced to raise interest rates sharply in 2008 just as the economy was going into recession. But it has struggled to communicate this argument. During an event in Queens, New York, last month, William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was heckled when trying to explain the disconnect between food prices and other prices.One member of his audience questioned when he last visited a grocery store and another asked if an iPad – which he argued was getting more powerful for the same price – was edible.Restaurants are also feeling the commodity price crunch. Last week, McDonald’s said it raised prices in March and that it would continue to do so later this year as smaller cattle herds and a weak US dollar raised its beef costs.Although PepsiCo, whose food business includes Frito-Lay and Quaker, forecasts commodity inflation of 8 to 9.5 per cent this year, it has resisted passing most of this on to customers.“We don’t price to cover all of it because the sticker shock would be too significant,” Mr Johnston said.PepsiCo is due to release its first-quarter results on Thursday.
442;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-04-20T19:12:04Z;Lessons in mediating for dairy warriors;There appears to be a global drive to screen foreign investment based, write Peter Lichtenbaum and David Fagan;"Italian lawmakers are upset with the French – this time, for trying to buy some butter (in the form of dairy giant Parmalat). The Italians’ response? A proposed review mechanism for foreign investment in strategic industries reminiscent of France’s “Danone Law”, adopted in 2006 after PepsiCo’s aborted attempt to buy the French yogurt maker.The Italian-French food fight is emblematic of a global drive to screen foreign investment on purported national security concerns or national interests. Within the last few months, two European commissioners have proposed a European Union-level committee to vet foreign investment on strategic grounds; Brazil proposed a review for investment in the agricultural sector; and most prominently, China rolled out interim rules for a national security-based review of foreign mergers and acquisitions of Chinese enterprises.These proposals follow the adoption or amendment, within the past four years, of national security or national interest-based foreign investment review laws in the US, Russia, Germany, Canada and Australia, among others. This is a potentially worrisome trend. Countries need to resist the temptation to deploy such tests in a way that burdens the flow of international investment.The US debated the role for such laws following the 2006 Dubai Ports World controversy over the proposed sale of port management businesses in U.S. sea ports to the UAE company. The result was a strengthened review process steered by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius), that is focused on core security risks. This may not be perfect, but it upholds the principles of open investment and offers several lessons.First, the review process should encourage investment and be tailored to apply to transactions implicating true national security interests. Screening for other reasons, such as a “national interest” standard should require an exceptionally high standard for intervention. To support this principle, reviews should be led by a responsible agency able to assign appropriate weight to the interests of open investment while also fully protecting against national security risks. The review process should be protected from political interference.The risk with a “strategic” sector approach, such as that implemented by France, is that it in fact serves as a pretext for other objectives. No one could seriously debate a country’s right to promote domestic industrial growth. Yet it is one thing to utilise governmental tools to develop industries, but quite another to limit access to those industries. Allowing foreign investment tends to promote sectoral growth, not retard it.Also, the review mechanism should provide as much certainty as possible to investors. Little matters more to parties in a transaction than knowing what approvals they must obtain, the rules related to them and when they can expect to receive them. This requires quick ―time-frames for the review. Longer processes create uncertainty, which, in turn, can raise price tags for foreign investors or, worse, lead sellers to reject foreign bidders outright. Certainty also requires regulatory consistency so that investors can draw appropriate lessons for the future.Third, the government agencies conducting the review should be accountable. In the US, there is no judicial review of CFIUS decisions, but there is reporting to Congress. This may not be the ideal model but it is one that makes decisionmakers accountable while preserving limited timeframes for review. In all events, there should be mechanisms in place to ensure sound, objective decisions on foreign investment reviews.Finally, the regulatory process should preserve confidentiality to reassure investors and sellers that their information will not be compromised, whether by revelation to the public or to domestic competitors. These four principles are fundamental to ensuring that a review process encourages foreign investment. Italian lawmakers and others should bear them in mind.The writers are partners at Covington & Burling LLP, an international law firm. Mr Lichtenbaum was assistant secretary of the US Commerce Department from 2003-2006."
443;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Finding a home for orphan brands;;Eating Pringles is not a solitary activity. Tens of millions of shoppers spend a total of $1.4bn on the potato crisps every year, picking the trademark canisters off supermarket shelves in more than 140 countries, led by Americans and Brits.But in spite of the global sociability of Pringles consumption, for the brand’s US owner, Procter & Gamble, it has been a lonely outsider. Pringles is an orphan brand, out of place among P&G’s Pantene shampoos, Gillette razors and Ariel detergents.It will be an outlier no more, however, if P&G wins the necessary approvals to spin Pringles off to Diamond Foods from San Francisco in a $1.5bn stock deal.P&G is not alone in clearing its shelves of orphan brands. Consumer goods companies frequently have a long tail of brands, acquired over decades of mergers and acquisitions, some of which no longer sit comfortably in their portfolios. Charlie Mills, analyst at Credit Suisse in London, says jettisoning orphan brands is inevitable given the trend for “more sales under fewer labels, and making these labels themselves more powerful”.Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, has demonstrated the trend by leaving frozen foods in 2006 and selling its Italian frozen food business last year to Birds Eye Iglo, a private equity-owned group, for more than €800m.One banker says Kraft, the US owner of Cadbury’s, has a possible orphan in the form of Oscar Mayer, a $1bn-plus meat cuts producer, although the company refutes this.Similarly, some bankers point to Nestlé’s $1bn-plus Herta brand, which makes frankfurters. This business, they say, is at odds with Nestlé’s push into health and wellness – although the Swiss group says it is committed to the brand.Orphan brands can often be revitalised by a bit more attention and investment. Local brands especially tend to get lost inside mega corporations.P&G began sharpening its focus under former chairman and chief executive AG Lafley in 2000. It has been looking to dispose of Pringles since at least 2007. That is why Mr Lafley’s successor, Bob McDonald, could not hide his satisfaction last week at selling it for what analysts said was a respectable valuation.But if P&G is so eager to be rid of Pringles – a desire that analysts say can only have been heightened by rising potato prices and the continuing dominance of PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay in the snack food sector – why would anyone else want it?The answer is that what looks like a small and peripheral business to the world’s biggest consumer goods company looks like a large and essential one to little Diamond. To P&G, Pringles’ profit margin of 17 per cent was below par, but to Diamond that is better than its current 15 per cent.“This is a great strategic fit …This brand is a thoroughbred,” said Michael Mendes, chairman and chief executive of Diamond, even as analysts expressed concern about the practical difficulties of a deal that will triple Diamond’s size.Diamond will put Pringles under the same roof as its nut and popcorn products as well as Kettle chips – which it acquired for $615m last year from Lion Capital – and it will try to exploit cross-snack economies of scale in development, marketing and distribution. Although Diamond has limited experience in emerging markets, it wants to reinvest some of Pringles’ earnings in expanding its presence in Brazil and China.P&G’s sale marks its final withdrawal from the conventional food business following its $3.3bn spin off of Folgers coffee in 2008 to JM Smucker, a US food company that merged itself with P&G’s Jif peanut butter and Crisco cooking oil businesses in a $1bn deal 10 years ago. “It’s vital for us to be able to innovate and it’s very difficult for us to innovate in a category like food,” said a P&G spokesman. “Peanut butter is peanut butter.”Multinationals also want to have top-ranking brands in their portfolios to give them leverage with retailers. But Pringles are only the fourth-biggest global snack brand, with a 2.4 per cent market share after Lays, Doritos and Cheetos, all owned by Frito-Lay. Diamond and Pringles combined will still have a share of just 3.3 per cent share, but Diamond will be more willing than P&G to invest marketing money to win space higher up the supermarket shelf.Jack Russo, analyst at Edward Jones in St Louis, says: “Retailers want to do deals with manufacturers that can spend behind the brand, that can incentivise them.” Diamond will do that. Provided shareholders agree and antitrust regulators don’t stand in the way, Pringles will no longer be P&G’s orphan. The challenge will then be to take on Frito-Lay – and avoid simply turning Diamond into an even bigger orphan.
444;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-04-06T22:21:48Z;A market for local sourcing;;"It begins with Black Face, White Flower and Second Flower – and hundreds of millions of cows like them. Confronted with shortages of raw materials, long supply chains and growing concerns over food safety, milk producers in China are rolling up their sleeves and getting down to the farm.They are just some among many companies taking more direct control of supply chains across the globe. The aim is to ensure supply and quality, but also to remove some of the volatility from pricing. Hence PepsiCo’s decision to grow potatoes in China for its crisp brands and SABMiller’s farming of barley in Africa for its beer.As a fresh foodstuff with a short shelf life, however, milk presents companies with some of the biggest challenges. That was highlighted in the melamine scandal of 2008, when unscrupulous farmers and traders in China spiked milk to boost the protein content, leaving at least six babies dead and another 300,000 sick.China presents particular logistical challenges. Scale is one: farms mostly tend to be small, a legacy of the communist policy of parcelling out little-but-equal plots. Farming skills and technology are often outdated.Faced with these challenges, Nestlé led the way for multinationals two decades ago. The world’s biggest food group realised that the combination of small farms and dubious safety was a toxic one, and set about creating its own supply chain.“We realised there would be these risks,” says Roland Decorvet, the company’s new chief executive for China. “And that’s why we wanted full control of the supply chain.”That control sees milk pass from udder to factory in a matter of hours, virtually all under the eye of the multinational. The chain starts with some 25,000 individual farmers, whose milk is collected and vetted at 164 stations dotted around the eastern provinces of China.Few other companies have developed such a complex supply chain. France’s Danone and its erstwhile joint-venture partner Wahaha both import milk powder from overseas for the infant formula they sell in China. For yoghurt, Danone buys raw milk locally but only from large dairy farms.Local companies, by contrast, have trumped Nestlé by buying the farms themselves. Huge tracts of Inner Mongolia are now owned by Mengniu, China’s leading milk producer, which controls 14 large farms, each with more than 10,000 cows.Nestlé originally set up in Shuangcheng in north-eastern China, in 1987. From here, Robert Erhard, a Swiss agronomist and Nestlé’s corporate fresh milk and agriculture service manager for greater China, spends his days coaxing farmers and anyone else – from suppliers of antiseptic udder wipes to banks – who is able to make farming easier. “I want to make dairy farming more attractive than going to work in Harbin city,” he says, referring to the nearest big conurbation.One way to achieve this is to help fund the farmers’ expansion, by effectively guaranteeing loans and brokering lower repayment rates. “You have to be an executive to earn Rmb10,000 [$1,528] a month,” says Mr Erhard. If you can do that as a dairy farmer and in your lifetime double or triple that, you can pay back [loans to buy cows] in two to three years,” he says.Do it for 20 years, he continues, and a monthly income of Rmb20,000 or more is feasible. “It means growth for us and, for them, fantastic income.”Fantastic is not quite the adjective that farmer Cao Dadong, Black Face’s owner, uses to describe the Rmb4,500 a month he earns, but that does nothing to damp his picture-book rosy cheeks and twinkling eyes. Previously, as a white spirits salesman he “ended up with debts at the end of every week. Now, doing this, I get paid every month.”With his daily half a tonne of milk produced by a dozen cows, Mr Cao is hardly a key supplier. But he is not atypical: farms with fewer than 20 cows accounted for 57 per cent of Chinese milk production in 2008, according to Citigroup. Large-scale farms, with more than 1,000 cows, supply just 7 per cent of the total, compared with nearly half in the US.The fragmented nature of Chinese small dairy farms explains Nestlé’s milk collection stations, where farmers arrive at dawn, swinging their urns of still-warm milk. Inside each building – little more than an outhouse – the milk is subjected to a battery of quick-fire tests.That situation is unlikely to change dramatically. At first, says Mr Erhard, China wanted to go the US route. “But a big farm is a multi-million dollar business. This is like running a company,” he says. “Now the consensus is that it’s difficult to manage that in a good way so, a few hundred to 3,000 cows is seen as a good model.”The dairy industry torpedoed. Raw milk production, which had been growing at a compound annual rate of some 20 per cent between 2003 and 2007, basically flat-lined the following two years. The three biggest listed dairy producers lost an aggregate $430m in 2008.Even scrupulous multinationals saw sales drop, and none are taking any chances now.The technology inside the stations belies the humble surroundings. Data on the milk, including quantity and quality, is zapped on to farmers’ smart cards; handheld scanners attest to the milk’s purity in a matter of seconds, as does a chemical test carried out at the door.Once passed, farmers upend their urns into a huge metal trough. The milk is then pumped directly into a lorry outside that heads straight back to the plant. In a final belt-and-braces measure, trucks are fitted with GPS systems to monitor for any unscheduled detours or stops.At the plant, the challenges facing factory manager Eldert Heijkoop are not dissimilar to any other in the food industry. Expansion is more or less axiomatic when you are catering to a market of 1.3bn increasingly affluent customers who are developing a taste for milk.But that means increasing production, sourcing more raw milk – and, with ever more stringent government regulations on food and safety – boosting quality assurance teams: by the end of this year he will have doubled 2008 numbers to 100.The factory produces around 70,000 tonnes of finished milk products a year, using 390,000 tonnes of fresh milk to do so. Nestle has ambitious targets, which entail an almost doubling of infant formula for instance, and is already eyeing extensions to the plant.Mr Heijkoop frets about input inflation. Feed prices are up more than 30 per cent year on year, he says, and the milk price has risen by at least 50 per cent. “We pay our farmers Rmb4.5m [collectively]a day,” he says. “It will be much more this year.”But like Mr Erhard, his biggest concern is reserved for these same farmers: how to encourage them not only to stay on the farm, but to expand and build economies of scale.This is where Nestlé, like PepsiCo and SABMiller, is finding itself on new terrain. “Part of our work is creating supply chains for farmers,” says Mr Erhard. “Whatever we reduce in input costs is success for me because it takes pressure off the farmer and he grows faster.”In the past, this meant helping to source rubber mats, hoof-trimming platforms, antiseptic wipes and cut-price loans, while his current priority is feed, the farmers’ biggest input cost. Nestlé succeeded in cutting out the intermediaries in South America, where farmers now order feed online. Doing the same in China, while simultaneously eliminating the risk of default, Mr Erhard reckons, would substantially cut feed prices.So far, the intermediaries have fought a rearguard action, but that is unlikely to stop Mr Erhard for long.One plan envisages a collection system tied in to post offices whereby the feed is delivered only once it has been ascertained that the farmer’s payslip covers the cost, thereby eliminating the risk of default. Another proposal is to funnel more waste from other industries – pulp from sugar beet, say – into the feed mix.Whatever the cows end up eating, one thing is clear: Nestlé will have had a hand in what goes into the troughs. Supply chains, multinationals are discovering, need as much tender loving care as the animals on the land."
445;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-04-04T19:52:04Z;China consumer goods: Left on the shelf;Multinationals face growing problems in the world’s most sought-after consumer market;"Hair damp and skin aglow, women stream out of a nondescript Communist party-owned block in a drowsy Shanghai neighbourhood where the most colourful attraction appears to be the Disney-branded English lessons on offer on the building’s lower floors.But the women too are the object of a big multinational’s attentions: they have just been given a cosmetics pampering by Unilever. The diligent market research undertaken by the Anglo-Dutch consumer group is just one testament to changes in the way multinationals tackle the world’s most sought-after consumer market.Where once multinationals shipped out tubs of creams and potions invented in the US or Europe, they are now taking their cue from Chinese consumers – in some cases bringing the resultant products back to the west. From how Chinese make soup to the way they wash their hair is thus the stuff of increasing commercial scrutiny. Hence the mock-up salon the women had been invited to in central Shanghai.All these questions will only become more acute as multinationals embark, more or less en masse, on the next step of what Patrice Bula, until recently Nestlé’s top man in China, refers to as “the last big industrial adventure”.The hunt for new consumers is shifting west, away from the multinationals’ relative comfort zone of the big coastal cities and into areas where distribution, logistics and consumer behaviour are all less than certain. Nationwide, the question is whether the western groups’ juiced-up research and development budgets and consumer insight efforts are enough. Competition in China is escalating – and some of the strongest rivals are local companies that barely featured a few years ago.Domestic groups are eating into multinationals’ market share, in part by playing to national pride and claiming superior knowledge of local consumers – but partly also by taking a leaf out of the foreign rivals’ books, poaching their staff and ramping up their own research, development and marketing.Many of these local groups have deep (sometimes government-backed) pockets and equally big ambitions: witness Bright Food’s appearance as bidder for foreign food groups from United Biscuits of the UK to France’s Yoplait. Further proof of multinationals’ determination to make a go of China emerged last week when Unilever bowed to pressure from Beijing to rescind planned price rises in the interest of reining in inflation.“There’s a big change in the landscape,” says Mr Bula, now back at Nestlé’s Swiss headquarters as head of strategic business units. He points to the rise of “powerful” mainland companies such as Wahaha, the beverages group, and Taiwan’s noodle-maker Tingyi. “If we want to emulate [anyone] and rally the troops at Nestlé, we compare ourselves with these people, because they have some of the competences and skills we want to have,” he says.No wonder. A cursory glance around any supermarket is enough to show China is shaping up to be the world’s biggest grocery market within just three years. The choice, even by western standards, is staggering. At a hangar-proportioned Carrefour outlet in suburban Shanghai, there are enough soft drink varieties to allow a customer to try something new every day for a year – and still not have exhausted the different herbal teas, flavoured milks, fruit and vegetable concoctions or slimming beverages on the shelves.“Can Chinese companies innovate? The evidence is, sure they can. They are incredibly entrepreneurial,” says Mitch Barns, China president of Nielsen, the information and analytics group.They can also win the hearts and stomachs of Chinese consumers – throwing down the gauntlet to the likes of Alan Jope, Unilever’s ebullient chairman for China. Elsewhere in the world, he says, Unilever ranks number one or two in laundry. In China, however, both his group and Procter & Gamble, its US rival, play second fiddle to a brace of formerly state-owned domestic manufacturers. Nice Group and Guangzhou Liby Enterprise control a combined 35 per cent of a sector including powdered and liquid detergents, by Euromonitor’s numbers, while Unilever and P&G have around 8.5 per cent each.The story is similar in tea. Guangdong Strong’s kookily named U-loveit instant tea helped that group rack up tea sales of Rmb4.2bn ($642m) in 2009. The youthful group doubled its market share to just under 20 per cent in two years. Unilever, by contrast, has seen its share virtually halved since 2006 to below 4 per cent.“These locals are increasingly sophisticated, not at all cheap-and-cheerful,” says Mr Jope. In ice cream – another category where Unilever and Nestlé are outranked by locals – they are “highly innovative”, he says.…Unsurprisingly, the locals concur. Shanghai Jahwa United has had a chequered history but Ge Wenyao, its chairman, reckons the cosmetics maker’s time has come to knock foreign rivals off the shelves. “P&G entered China in the 1990s when consumers did not have much choice, so thought they liked the brand. But now there are multiple brands and they cannot tell whether another brand is good or not,” he says. “Now Chinese companies have grown and learnt a lot from foreign companies. They now have better marketing and feel much more confident. Look at our Herborist brand [of skincare]. It is priced higher than P&G’s brand and last year our sales revenues increased by 50 per cent.”There is other evidence. Multinationals are losing their allure for employees, suggesting citizens, too, increasingly see their future with local companies. The number of candidates preferring to work for foreign-owned companies dropped 10 percentage points in the past four years to 73 per cent of jobseekers, according to a survey by Manpower.This reflects narrowing pay differentials, as local companies enhance salaries and benefits. But there is also a sense of greater opportunity. Joseph Tcheng, managing director for greater China at Diageo, the UK drinks group, tells of how he recruited a marketing director from Nike of the US: one year later he was out of the door because a local sports company with big ambitions lured him away with the promise of equity in its planned initial public offering.“He said: ‘I love working for you but here’s an offer I cannot refuse: I get shares and to work with a local entrepreneur who wants to take his company global.’”Indeed, vibrant competition is putting pressure on virtually every link of the chain, beginning with the supply of raw materials. If commodity price inflation is a scourge across the globe, in China the issue is even more acute. In an effort to source inputs from potatoes to sugar in a country where agriculture is woefully inefficient and farming is far from a top career choice, multinationals are themselves turning to the land.PepsiCo’s Chinese farms supply roughly 40 per cent of the potatoes used in its Lay’s crisps. Nestlé counts 25,000 dairy farmers among its suppliers – all of whom the Swiss group deals with directly – and Associated British Foods’ Chinese operations are so focused on procuring sugar beet that Tony Cheung, managing director for the British Sugar unit, says he regards the farmer as his top priority. Poaching of suppliers is rampant as farmers jump ship for a bigger cheque.The scars of competition show through, too, in advertising, distribution and, ultimately, landing a place in shoppers’ baskets. Multinationals spend about 50 per cent more on advertising and promotion as a percentage of sales in China compared with the rest of the world. Unilever globally, for example, spends about 15 per cent of sales on advertising and promotion; in China it is half as much again. P&G, media analysts say, spends 25 per cent of sales. “It’s a land grab, right?” says Unilever’s Mr Jope. “Everyone’s investing today for share tomorrow and that’s what drives up media rates.” Media cost inflation, analysts say, is running at around 20 per cent.…All these dynamics are shifting, however, as multinationals embark on their next big step in China – taking them away from the relative comfort zone of big coastal cities such as Shanghai and Beijing and into mushrooming metropolises deeper in the country. That means tackling virtually virgin terrain where populations are big and getting richer but where the pipework – logistics, distribution and modern retail – lags behind.“Third- and fourth-tier cities are twice as big as the first- and second-tier ones in terms of population, and the growth rate [is] twice as fast. So that’s where the big opportunity is,” says Nielsen’s Mr Barns. “China is going to add more megacities in the central and western parts of the country and urbanise 200m more people.”L’Oréal of France is among those striving to sell more face potions and shampoos in these cities, which it plans to do in part by following the big international retailers including France’s Carrefour and Walmart of the US, as well as using smaller cosmetics stores and third-party distributors. Alexis Perakis-Valat, L’Oréal’s chief executive, enthuses about a recent trip to Anshan in the north-eastern province of Liaoning; in the week he was there, two huge department stores opened. “There was so much dynamism,” he says. “And there are 300 Anshans in China.”But access is tough beyond the top 30-40 cities, says Ted Hurley of Nielsen. “It’s a pure distribution game. Get your product on the shelf any way you can. But getting a foot on the ground takes a lot of time and money.” Otherwise it means an increasing reliance on third-party distributors – and thus an element of ceding control. Multinationals’ products turn up in the most unlikely mom-and-pop stores – in places where the usually ubiquitous cars are absent and children look goggle-eyed at foreigners. But it is also true that you can pick up a flat bottle of Coke or a chocolate bar well past its expiry date.It also requires new consumer insights: the Shanghai office worker with her swishing hair is a long way from the farmer in the north-east who has no more than a bucket of water – and probably substantially less time – to complete her ablutions.Besides, in fast-changing China, even the Shanghai consumer recruits for trying out cosmetics could prove an endangered species. Andrew Steel, director at Unilever’s consumer research institute – where 30,000 Chinese a year try everything from soup to shampoo and where staff include anthropologists, psychologists and sociologists – has his problems too. “Now people are living in condominiums, it’s much harder for agencies to go knocking on doors to find consumers for testing.”"
446;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;The fickle value of friendship;;In a glass box in the middle of a PepsiCo marketing department, five people are staring at a huge bank of screens showing a constantly updated river of tweets, “likes”, praise and damnation from consumers of Gatorade, the company’s sports drink.“Doing it in a glass room means every single person in the marketing organisation is seeing the insights brought to life in real time. It reminds them how important it is to know the heartbeat of the consumer,” says Bonin Bough, global director of digital and social media at PepsiCo. “I really feel like it is the future of marketing.”A similar scenario is playing out in marketing departments around the world. A survey of members of the World Federation of Advertisers, a grouping of multinational brands, by Millward Brown found that 96 per cent were spending more of their budgets managing Facebook pages, Twitter accounts and other social media, racing to accrue fans, retweets and that elusive but ubiquitous quality: engagement.However, the research also found that few knew why they were doing it – half were “unsure” of the returns they were getting from their efforts, while more than a quarter found the payback was “just average or poor”.It is only one indication that advertisers’ attitudes towards social media might be shifting. Brands are still flocking to Facebook and its share of display advertising spending is rising fast but finance directors are questioning the value of accruing thousands of fans and followers. Unlike search-engine advertising, where calculating the net gain or loss from each click is relatively straightforward, demonstrating the return on investment of many social media campaigns is proving a challenge.“The hype vessel is at full throttle, and largely without a rudder,” says Michael Maoz, an analyst at Gartner, the research company. “Social media is like the surgeon’s scalpel – a valuable tool in the right hands but potentially dangerous.”Social media gained ground rapidly in the past few years due in part to the shift in consumer behaviour – social networking is now the most popular online activity in the UK, ahead of search or entertainment, while Facebook overtook Google to be the most popular site in the US last year.It has also captured the imagination of marketers because it has been seen as cheap. Now that marketing budgets are rising again – advertising spending in the UK, for example, rose 6.9 per cent in 2010, according to the Advertising Association – more money is being poured in.It is not hard to find examples of social media having a positive impact on a brand. Starbucks, the coffee chain, says it boosted UK sales of Christmas drinks by 15 per cent last year by inviting its Facebook fans to choose seasonal flavours.But the Starbucks example also reveals that it is not having lots of Facebook friends that counts – it is what companies do with them and how they engage them that can translate into increased sales.“To be completely up front about it: there is no ROI for any social media programme,” says James Whatley, marketing director at 1000heads, the social media agency. “However, there is definitely provable ROI for social media programmes that are set up to do something. It’s all about setting a clear objective.”Attempts to pin a dollar value on a Facebook fan have largely been abandoned because it varies depending on whether the brand’s page is trying to sell coffee, cars or simply create a community to monitor for complaints and feedback. Estimates suggest 10-15 per cent of Facebook posts are seen by their intended recipients and click-through rates are little better than for traditional banner advertisements – fractions of a percentage point.Mr Bough talks about social media being useful for driving “experiences” for consumers, such as getting fans of Mountain Dew, the soft drink, to suggest new flavours and packaging design. “It’s about the experience you are creating that reaches the passion of your consumers,” he says. “Digital is today’s language. Now more than ever, this provides the opportunity to create deeper relationships with consumers than we were ever able to before …It’s not experimentation for experimentation sake or digital for digital’s sake.”He points to the Gatorade Mission Control room. Each of its five operatives represents a different part of the company, such as branding, PR and customer service, which means relevant comments are fed back to the right part of the company. “This is the largest unaided focus group you could ever ask for,” he says.Other companies, meanwhile, are yielding results with less effort. A recent ranking of “social brands” by Yomego, a social media agency, put Apple – which makes no effort to maintain a presence on Facebook or Twitter – in second place, finding it had the highest satisfaction score on the list.The real value of social media comes not when it is run in isolation by a crack team of supergeeks but when it forms part of a larger strategy, with broader goals than just fans and consumer engagement.According to Ankur Shah, co-founder of Techlightenment, a social media agency and technology provider, companies that run search engine advertising in parallel with social media campaigns are more cost-effective than social media on its own. His company is developing a tool to track how a newsfeed item propagates through Facebook by telling an advertiser when a friend of a friend buys something based on its advertising.Mr Shah admits it is still early days for such technology. “At the moment, putting that figure – what exactly is the value of a [Facebook] fan – is tricky, it’s vague and it’s fluffy,” he says. “If a brand tries to rationalise it, they will get in trouble because those attribution models are not developed yet.”Brendan Tansey, UK chief executive of Wunderman, a direct marketing agency, believes the wide range of uses for social media exempts it from the usual online measures of marketing success. “Traditional online ROI has always been focused on the ‘click to conversion’ as this is what online advertising and [pay per click] can achieve,” he says. “However, social media offer a much broader mix of online consumer interaction. Social media ROI, specifically the return, should therefore not be focused on the conversion alone.”Other advertising experts are not sure that is enough. “You are looking for the big ‘e’ word – engagement – and what that does, but also purchasing or signing up to be part of a loyalty scheme or whatever it happens to be,” says David Kershaw, chief executive of M&C Saatchi, the advertising agency. “One wants a bit of marriage rather than just engagement.”
447;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Sustainability: Technology has potential to retrofit the world;;"The bicycle is a quintessentially clean form of transport. But researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have made it cleaner still.The Copenhagen Wheel, developed by MIT’s SENSE­able City Lab, allows riders not only to save energy produced while cycling and braking for later use (on uphill journeys, for instance); a bike retrofitted with the wheel also collects data on local environmental conditions.This is just one example of how technology is providing information that can help us reduce our impact on the planet.As the Copenhagen Wheel demonstrates, anything connected to sensors and software can become an intelligent instrument, measuring everything from carbon emissions to water consumption.“Technology is going to be a game changer,” says Laura Ipsen, senior vice-president and general manager of Cisco Systems’ Connected Energy group.“The only way we can make smart changes to our planet is by using technology to manage, monitor and control …natural resources.”The energy sector is ripe for this kind of transformation. Smart meters enable companies and consumers to collect detailed data on energy use and reduce their consumption – as well as their carbon footprint.IT will also allow power utilities to operate demand-led energy management and offer flexible pricing mechanisms that will prompt greater efficiencies.Other business opportunities exist in creating products such as bundling different energy services.“With electric vehicles, you could have a maintenance agreement that would include cost of power, or a battery leasing agreement with the cost of power behind it,” says Darrin Hill, energy expert at PA Consulting Group.The question is whether IT can do all this fast enough.In the energy sector, industry is playing catch-up after decades in which power has been managed across infrastructure little changed in more than a century, delivering one-way flows of electricity that users cannot monitor or control.Meanwhile, companies face organisational obstacles, with departments responsible for paying electricity bills not necessarily communicating with the purchasing units that buy machines consuming the energy.“Until you have a centralisation of control and authority around energy management, you’re not going to be able to have strategic energy management,” says David Metcalfe, director of Verdantix, a research company.Mr Metcalfe believes IT provides an opportunity for companies to start centralising this control. “Technology enables a more global approach,” he says.IT is also an important tool in measuring corporate consumption of not only energy but also other resources.Software and databases mean companies no longer have to work in the dark when assessing their environmental impact, as well as their exposure to environmental risk.For large consumers of water, such as those in the drinks industry, remote sensors combined with flow meters help monitor leaks and establish a consumption baseline from which to set reduction goals.Meanwhile, advanced geospatial analytics aggregate data on global water consumption, allowing companies to assess their exposure to water shortages.For big multinationals, technology helps make sense of an otherwise unmanageable mass of data. This is important both for internal resource management and external reporting.David Walker, director of environmental sustainability at PepsiCo, says: “When you have this much data being collected from so many sites around the world, it presents a challenge to meet corporate audit requirements and financial-level requirements that sustainability is demanding.” The group has established a single database, so staff anywhere can upload data on energy, water, solid waste and other sustainability every month.The greater efficiencies IT facilitates also generate cost savings.Since the deployment of route planning technology in 2004, the CO2 reductions made by UPS, the logistics company, equate to taking 5,300 passenger cars off the road for a year – cutting fuel costs in the process, with savings of 10m gallons of petrol.Web technology helps save carbon emissions in another way, too – by matchmaking.An online transport marketplace called uShip helps logistics companies run fewer trucks partially full or empty after making their deliveries.It connects shipping customers with transporters that are making a trip and have extra space in their vehicles. The company’s software also allows users to offset the carbon emissions created by their deliveries.Of course, an even more fuel-efficient strategy would be not to make the trip at all. And while goods will always need delivering, technology is helping reduce the number of people that need to be moved around.As the usability of telepresence and other videoconferencing systems has improved, executives have found it easier to reduce the business trips they make.In a recent study from WWF, the conservation body, more than 60 per cent of respondents used videoconferencing regularly, with most saying this had an impact in cutting air travel.The reduction in flights because of videoconferencing – as opposed to measures such as corporate travel policies – was about 12 per cent.Of course, IT also has its own footprint. For a start, it generates large amounts of electrical waste.In Europe, rules govern management of this waste, with manufacturers and retailers required to organise collection and disposal of electronic equipment at the end of its life.Even so, implementation of the EU’s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive has proved challenging, as collection inefficiencies and inequities in the system persist.IT is also an energy consumer. Research indicates the industry contributes up to 3 per cent of global CO2 emissions through data centres, servers, mobile devices and desktop computers.Companies can make a dent in this by buying more efficient equipment, switching off machines when not in use, moving applications into the cloud and using virtualisation technology, which squeezes several applications on to a single server.Yet, compared with the buildings sector, the IT industry’s footprint is relatively small. Buildings are thought to contribute some 40 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.Here, modelling and design software has the potential to accelerate the move to more resource efficiency that makes greater use of renewable energy and natural light and ventilation.For new buildings, technology can produce remarkable efficiencies. The bigger challenge is retrofitting older buildings – the bulk of the world’s building stock. IT allows designers to model virtually a range of changes and assess which improvements would have the greatest impact on energy use.The role of software in retrofitting reflects the broader role for IT in promoting sustainability – the use of digital information to improve the management of existing global infrastructure.Take renewable energies such as solar and wind power, which are intermittent in their nature.“Technology is critical in integrating those renewable sources into a grid that wasn’t built for that power,” says Michael Valocchi, energy and utilities industry leader for IBM’s Global Business Services unit.Of course, with the aid of digital design systems, IT is also important in creating new products and services with smaller environmental footprints.However, whether mapping water leaks, integrating renewables into the grid, remodelling buildings to generate efficiencies, or fixing a smart wheel on to a bicycle, the challenge is not only to design products that are more resource-efficient – it is also to apply intelligence to existing systems.In short, IT has the potential to bring about a giant sustainability retrofit of the world."
448;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;AG Barr buoyed by range expansion;Sales improve for a second year;Strong sales growth helped AG Barr, the Scottish beverage maker behind the Irn Bru brand, narrowly exceed analysts’ full-year expectations.Roger White, chief executive, said the Lanarkshire-based company was benefiting from a second year of a general improvement in sales in soft drinks across the UK as consumers seek cheap treats while they continue to ride out economic uncertainty.Sales of Irn Bru, a carbonated soft drink and Scotland’s leading grocery brand, which outranks Coca-Cola and Pepsi in its traditional heartland, grew 4 per cent overall, but jumped 10 per cent in northern England where AG Barr has been concentrating its marketing power.However, the company benefited more from sales growth in other brands, which saw Irn Bru’s total contribution to group sales fall to 48 per cent.Its range of Barr-branded traditional carbonated drinks, which include drinks such as cherryade, cream soda, raspberryade and dandelion and burdock, jumped 22 per cent.The range claims to deliver a “cosy glow as you remember how pop used to taste” with packaging designed to appeal to the growing market of age 45-plus consumers.Sales of its Rubicon range of drinks based on exotic fruits such as papaya, lychee and mango, rose 22 per cent. AG Barr bought the Rubicon business for £60m in 2008 and has almost doubled its sales.However, the company took small writedowns on three brands, including its Taut sports drink and Vitsmart vitamin-enhanced water brands, as it stopped promoting some of the range.Turnover rose from £201.4m to £222.4m and pre-tax profits were up from £24.5m to £30.4m in the year to January 29.A recommended final dividend of 18.66p gives a total of 25.41p for the year, up 10 per cent and covered by earnings per share of 58.8p (46.5p).The shares, up 23 per cent over the past year, rose 46p to close at £12.01 on Monday.●FT commentCanny is the word for AG Barr. While many other companies exposed to UK consumer spending have lagged behind in sales growth and share-price performance, there is still plenty of fizz in a company with little debt, core category sales growth and the recent completion of a well-executed investment in its Cumbernauld plant. This should increase cost efficiencies across its brands. Larger UK-listed peer Britvic warned last month that rising commodity prices would impact upon margins, but Barr argues it is in a stronger position to mitigate some of these cost pressures. The shares look a steady bet but, trading on a full-looking prospective p/e of 19, are no bargain.
449;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-03-28T18:10:24Z;Lactalis fights back over Parmalat criticism;;Lactalis, the French dairy company, has sought to defend itself from political and populist criticism over its acquisition of a 29 per cent stake in Italian food group Parmalat.Antonio Sala, chairman of Lactalis in Italy and deputy general manager for the Lactalis Group, said Italy could not “change the rules halfway through the game”. He added that he feared the impact on foreign investment of government steps to ring-fence companies it considered strategic.“I am proud to be Italian, but it is embarrassing the effect this will have on foreign investors,” Mr Sala said.Mr Sala’s comments, made on behalf of the Besnier family, which owns Lactalis, come as Parmalat called a board meeting for April 1 to discuss whether to delay its shareholder meeting until the end of June.The government laid out the possibility of a board meeting delay last week, as part of a series of reforms aimed at ring-fencing Italian companies from unwanted takeovers.The law aims to copy French rules, drawn up in 2005 when Danone was being circled by PepsiCo, to define certain sectors including food, defence, telecoms and energy as “strategic”.Delaying Parmalat’s board meeting from the scheduled April 12 until the end of June would have given Italian investors more time to come up with a counter-offer for Parmalat.Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy’s largest retail bank, has said it would lend support to an “Italian solution” for Italy’s biggest dairy company. Ferrero, the chocolate maker, has said it could consider a tie-up with Parmalat under the right conditions. Lactalis briefly met with Ferrero last week, but nothing came of the discussions, according to two sources familiar with the talks.Mr Sala thought, before the meeting date was set, it was unlikely Parmalat would delay its board meeting until June amid concerns among some of its directors about Italy’s image to foreign investors. Italy has some of the lowest foreign direct investment in Europe. Independent studies often show concerns about the absence of a level playing field as among the reasons why foreigners decide to invest elsewhere.Mr Sala, who oversees the Italian business of Lactalis, which includes cheese maker Galbani, owner of the Bel Paese brand, said he also doubted Italian investors would come up with a counter-offer, given that they had failed to produce a bid for Parmalat in the past five years.Any takeover offer for Parmalat, which has a market capitalisation of about €4.2bn ($5.9bn), would need to be more than €5bn, which analysts consider expensive and an obstacle to any deal.One of the accusations against Lactalis in Italy is its failure to pay a takeover premium in spite of gaining control of the board through its 29 per cent shareholding. Mr Sala said the more than 10 per cent jump in the value of Parmalat shares on expectations of a takeover battle at the dairy group meant minority investors had already benefited.He denied speculation Lactalis intends to raid Parmalat’s €1.4bn in gross cash built up through winnings from lawsuits that Enrico Bondi, the dairy group’s chief executive, took out against investment banks as part of his restructuring in the wake of the €14bn fraud that brought the company to near-bankruptcy in 2003.Mr Sala said the cash would “only be used for the development” of Parmalat.Lactalis aimed to keep Parmalat’s headquarters in Italy and develop its distribution into more countries – along the same lines as Lactalis’ strategy for Galbani.
450;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-03-24T22:29:22Z;Italian industry must look beyond protectionism;Country needs vision more than patriotism, writes Paul Betts;Spring arrived this week, and as Ella Fitzgerald would have crooned, everybody seems to be doing it. The birds and bees, educated fleas, even lazy jellyfish are doing it. Europe’s politicians are doing it, too.But unlike the grand lady of jazz, this is no ballad celebrating springtime canoodling. Quite the opposite. Europe’s capitals are again trying to resist the advances of foreign groups seeking to take control of their corporate champions.France invented the term “economic patriotism” when rumours emerged some years ago that PepsiCo was stalking Danone, the yoghurt maker. Paris has never lived down its claim that yoghurt is a strategic sector alongside nuclear energy and defence.Now it is the turn of Italy to come out in a spring rash over the raid on Parmalat, the dairy group, by France’s Lactalis.After seeing well-known brands fall into French hands, Rome has rushed through rules making it harder for foreigners to acquire what the Berlusconi government considers strategic companies.Across the Channel, after Kraft’s takeover of Cadbury, the chocolate maker, the UK seems to be going continental. The Takeover Panel is proposing rules to give UK companies more protection from hostile bids. It is suggesting that employees of takeover targets be allowed to express their views.It shows that although France is regarded as the protectionist champion par excellence, these instincts have always been alive throughout Europe. The French may be simply suffering from an unfortunate image because of their penchant for gesticulating and making lots of noise in any big takeover battle.The Italians complain that France is hoovering up their corporate champions and that there has been no reciprocity for Italian companies in France. The truth is that many of the Italian groups acquired by the French were up for sale or agreed to be taken over. This was certainly the case with Bulgari, as well as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.A survey published this week by La Stampa, the Turin newspaper, shows that France is more open than many other European countries to foreign bids and that Italy is by far the least open.Only 4.1 per cent of Italian companies are controlled by foreigners holding at least half of their capital, according to “The Global Operations of European Firms”, a study sponsored by the European Commission.Spain, where an Italian group pulled off one of the biggest takeovers with Enel’s acquisition of Endesa, follows with 4.5 per cent.Germany, where rules were introduced after Vodafone’s takeover of Mannesmann, follows with 6.3 per cent.Next is France with 10.3 per cent. But that does not take into account the fact that foreign investors also hold about 50 per cent of the equity of French CAC 40 blue-chip companies.Then come the UK with 12.2 per cent, Austria with 12.8 per cent and Hungary with 19.8 per cent.In Parmalat’s defence, the approach of Lactalis was hostile. Nor has the French company been friendly to minority shareholders by acquiring a 29 per cent stake to gain effective control of Parmalat without having to make a full bid.But does that automatically mean the government should intervene?It looks as if the French group might be prepared to strike a deal with Ferrero, the Italian chocolate maker, to appease Rome. It depends on what the government considers industrial policy.If you talk to the French, they will tell you that the role of the state is to give guidance on what it believes are not only strategic sectors but the technologies of the future.It is creating and supporting French jobs, such as in the car industry.In the UK, they will tell you it is about a competitive fiscal environment for companies, leaving them to forge their destinies. But it is also about protecting domestic jobs, hence the anger over Kraft’s decision to shut Cadbury’s factory. Italy could learn from both.As Luca di Montezemolo, Ferrari chairman, puts it, the answer for Italy is not so much adopting protectionist tactics, as embracing a strategy that enhances the country’s export-led industrial sectors.Is it not time Mr Berlusconi paid a state visit to China or India, the sort of initiative French and UK leaders use to clinch big contracts?Why does a country such as Italy, with its talent in luxury goods and craftsmanship, not have a global luxury group to match LVMH and PPR in France, or Richemont in Switzerland?Italian industry needs vision more than patriotism.Paul Betts is a senior Financial Times correspondent based in Parispaul.betts@ft.com
451;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Tingyi raises its cup noodles prices;;Tingyi, one of the biggest food and beverage groups in China with more than half of the country’s instant-noodle market, plans to raise prices for its cup noodles next month as it struggles with rising commodity prices.The announcement that it would raise cup noodle prices by Rmb0.5 (7 cents) – a 14 per cent increase – comes after it had already increased prices last November.The Taiwan-owned, Tianjin-based company, whose Master Kong brand of noodles, bottled beverages, and pastries is a household name in China, last year saw its gross margins fall by nearly a fifth, to 28 per cent, as prices for raw materials from flour to plastic bottles registered at least double-digit increases.“Improving margins this year is a big focus for our company,” said Frank Lin, chief financial officer.Tingyi on Monday announced it had increased sales by nearly a third, to $6.7bn, last year. In spite the pressure on margins, after-tax profits rose by 22 per cent to $613m.Tingyi’s results, and its ability to raise prices in China, highlights how rising food inflation has a drastically different impact on companies in fast-growing emerging markets compared with those in mature, western markets. Pepsi, and Kraft both warned last month of a big financial impact from rising costs.By contrast, Wei Ing-chou, chairman and chief executive of Tingyi and a US dollar billionaire according to Forbes, said food inflation provided an opportunity for “healthy development of the food industry in China by providing an opportunity to raise prices” that would otherwise not be allowed by the government.“In a still-developing market, people should worry more about whether my total profit is increasing, rather than the profit margin,” he said. Still, Mr Wei outlined a number of strategies Tingyi would take to maintain profit growth, including investing nearly $1bn this year to upgrade its factories, and an aggressive campaign to take share in the bottled beverage market away from Coca-Cola.Tingyi last year overtook Coca-Cola in total beverage volume sold in China, Mr Wei said, and “the plan is to be double their volume in five years, but if I’m really lucky I can do it in three”.Tingyi is not the only company adjusting its China strategy in the face of rising prices. Alex Lo, general manager of Uni-President, another Taiwanese food and consumer goods group with a big presence in China, said last month that his company would review its product line-up to focus on higher-margin sectors, while exiting those with low margins.
452;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Pepsi chief faces challenge to revive fizz;;Nearly five years since taking the helm of PepsiCo, Indra Nooyi, its high-profile chief executive, is facing her rough stretch.Frustration over the company’s performance has become evident in recent dealings with analysts, and investors are beginning to wonder how she will generate growth during a challenging time of high commodity prices and wavering demand for sugary drinks.The latest setback came last week, when data from Beverage Digest showed for the first time that sales of Diet Coke overtook those of Pepsi’s core brand in the US.Although the shift was anticipated, it showed how entrenched Coca-Cola’s lead in the cola wars had become and put greater onus on Ms Nooyi to revive Pepsi’s carbonated beverage business.“It does put pressure on them because they’ve been really focused on health and wellness and trying to make their brands more healthy,” said Erin Smith, analyst at Argus Research. “Carbonated soft drinks are not an easy category to make healthy.”The sense of frustration came to a head last month during Pepsi’s earnings call with analysts who wanted to know why the company had slashed its full-year earnings forecast from double-digit growth to a gain of 7 or 8 per cent.When asked why significant capital investments and recent acquisitions were yielding slower growth, Ms Nooyi responded: “We look at our company and say, boy, if you could find other companies like us, you should go ahead and invest in them.”Analysts said that the tone of the reply was “testy” and sparked calls from investors about why Ms Nooyi was being defensive towards seemingly benign questions.“The frustration has been from both management and investors,” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst from Sanford Bernstein, noting disappointment with the company’s stock performance, with a share price fall of 5 per cent in the past year.Margarethe Wiersema, a management professor at the University of California, Irvine’s business school, said this was the first time in Ms Nooyi’s tenure that she had faced a setback that was specific to the company and that blaming macroeconomic factors was not sufficient.“She’s getting quite a bit of pushback,” Ms Wiersema said.“People want to know more than just that energy and commodity prices are going up, and they start to lack confidence about what’s really going on strategically.”When Ms Nooyi was named chief executive in 2006 she did so with great fanfare, making Pepsi the biggest company by stock market value with a female boss. She has been lauded as a strong leader and a shrewd manager, directing the successful acquisition of Pepsi’s two bottling companies in 2009 and last year taking a majority stake in Russia’s leading food and beverage company, Wimm-Bill-Dann.Ms Nooyi has also established warm relations with the Obama administration and has been the subject of speculation that she could be a future commerce secretary.In the near term, analysts suggest that Pepsi’s chief executive needs to focus on reviving the flagging carbonated drinks business to generate faster growth.As high commodity prices have the potential to weigh on its food and snacks business, carbonated drinks could once again be an important source of revenues.“Marketing spending on Pepsi and Diet Pepsi has really slacked off,” said David Silver, analyst at Wall Street Strategies. “They’ll have to concentrate on giving it a higher portion of marketing investment.”According to Mr Dibadj, the renewed focus is starting. Last year Pepsi had no advertisements for its namesake brand during the Super Bowl for the first time in 23 years, but in last month’s championship game, it returned to the airwaves with a new commercial for Pepsi Max.“They have to realise that at their core they are a sugary, fatty cola company and people like that,” Mr Dibadj said.“Health and wellness is a good focus, but you can’t be singularly focused on it.”

In 2005 the French deemed the stuff so important to their nation that Danone, the industry leader, was defended from a potential bid from Pepsico on the grounds of national interest. Fast forward six years and another US company, General Mills, with its eyes on another French yoghurt business, Yoplait, has encountered no such trouble. The former has won the right to exclusive talks to buy the half of the latter owned by private equity group PAI, plus an additional 1 per cent from Sodiaal, the French farmers’ co-operative that owns the other half, valuing the business at €1.6bn.General Mills will be relieved it won out of a reported nine candidates. The diversified food maker has held the rights to market Yoplait in the US for 34 years, but the relationship with Sodiaal has reportedly soured, to the point that their contract, which was written in perpetuity, is marked for renegotiation. But rather than use lawyers and negotiators to fix the problem, Kendall Powell, General Mills’ chief executive, has thrown a briefcase full of cash at it.Given the sale of PAI’s half of Yoplait needed Sodiaal’s approval, the French co-op and General Mills have presumably worked out their differences. The US group, though, may carry more risk than its controlling stake implies. Although it now owns 51 per cent of the operating business, control of the brand, which licenses the name and global franchises and contributes about three-quarters of Yoplait’s revenues, will be split evenly with Sodiaal. French farmers wield a disproportionate amount of political clout and Paris has previously shown its willingness to acquiesce to their demands. Mr Powell, who has global expansion plans for Yoplait, may find its new partnership throws him more than he bargained for.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
454;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-03-17T18:32:24Z;General Mills to buy half of Yoplait;;"General Mills, the US foods group, is understood to have won the hotly contested battle for Yoplait in a deal that gives the French yoghurt maker an enterprise value of €1.6bn ($2.2bn), according to bankers.The price is higher than expected and sharply above the €1.4bn-valuation bid by French private dairy company Lactalis, which was rejected as being too low.It marks a handsome return for PAI, the French private equity firm that was selling its 50 per cent stake in Yoplait. The remaining 50 per cent is held by Sodiaal, the French farmers’ co-operative.PAI bought its stake in Yoplait in 2002, when a crisis at Sodiaal, which created the brand in 1965, forced it to seek fresh funds. It paid €200m for its 50 per cent holding, with both parties then saying a stock market listing was the favoured exit strategy.At the time, Yoplait was generating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of €51m. This is forecast to triple to €153m in the year to June 2011.The race to acquire the number two yoghurt maker was intense, with bidders including Nestlé, the world’s biggest food company by sales, Bright Food of China, Grupo Lala of Mexico, and private equity bidders.Nestlé is understood to have been tripped up by its existing partnership with Lactalis. The two joined forces on chilled dairy products in 2005; Nestlé owns 40 per cent of the joint venture, while Lactalis holds the balance.Yoplait’s last year said it favoured a tie-up with Nestlé. Lucien Fa, chief executive since 2002, told Swiss daily Le Matin that “looking at company profiles, [Nestlé] is the ideal candidate. It has the money, the structures, the people. It is everywhere and shares our concern for healthy food.”However, the complex ownership structure meant several interests had to be taken into account – not least those of the French government, which kept an eye on proceedings. An earlier effort by a US company to acquire a French yoghurt maker – when PepsiCo was eyeing Danone in 2005 – prompted France to label yoghurt a strategic asset to stymie the deal.General Mills was eager to snare Yoplait in part to protect its large US franchise. It has held this for some 30 years and Yoplait, stirred into action by the low level of royalties the business generated, had sought to renegotiate the contract, sparking a legal battle.Adding to the complexity, PAI also had to find a buyer that met the approval of Sodiaal, as it will retain its 50 per cent stake. All three parties on the sell side – PAI, Yoplait and Sodiaal – appointed bankers to advise them on the deal. PAI was advised by Rothschilds, Sodiaal by HSBC and Yoplait by Morgan Stanley. All declined to comment."

But talking in detail for the first time about the PepsiCo sponsorship that will turn X Factor into a new front in the cola wars, Mr Cowell says he feels no awkwardness in switching sides.“I still appreciate everything [Coke] did for us and they’ve got an association with Idol that still works,” he says. To have the two leading cola companies sponsoring rival shows on News Corp’s Fox network “helps both brands because they’re both going to be successful shows”, he says.Coca-Cola, in turn, acknowledges that Mr Cowell’s departure from Idol created some uncertainty for its marketing, but says that Idol’s new judges have been well received.“We wish Simon well and wish him success with the show. There’s room for everybody,” a spokeswoman says, noting that X Factor and Idol will air at different times of year.Mr Cowell says he is unsurprised that Idol’s ratings have held up without him. “The last year it was uncomfortable because I was going to go and that’s not a healthy place to work in,” he says, “but they definitely got more competitive because they knew our show was coming.”Yet with unusual modesty, he adds that X Factor felt an affinity with Pepsi’s “underdog mentality,” because “we’ve never gone into America thinking we can be number one [overnight]. But we think we’re going to secure the number one position in time.”Pepsi’s chances of toppling Coke look more remote, because of Coke’s grip on fast food restaurants, which typically offer just one cola brand. But its executives believe that backing X Factor can strengthen Pepsi’s position where consumers have a choice.The campaign could be this year’s biggest gamble in US marketing. Pepsi’s ambition of breaking the mould of TV product placement means its campaign will be a closely watched experiment in what is now possible on TV, in stores and in the fast-evolving mobile, social and digital media environments.Mr Cowell says the fit is natural, “because I always thought of Pepsi as a young brand” and because he is “100 per cent” certain that X Factor can attract a younger audience than Idol.Pepsi executives say their partnership will create the deepest integration yet seen between a show and its sponsor.“The defection from the red guys to us was a big deal for Simon, both from a personal and a publicity standpoint, so both sides were cautious going in, but he’s been extremely involved in the creative side,” says Massimo D’Amore, head of its North American beverages business.Pepsi is tapping Mr Cowell’s Syco production company to break traditional barriers between the show and its commercial breaks.Ads will feature behind-the-scenes footage of contestants “to take commercial time and extend that back into the show,” says Frank Cooper, chief marketing officer for Pepsi’s sparkling beverages. “I know there’s awareness among consumers that Coke is the sponsor of Idol, but I don’t know what that gives you. The new standard is not whether the consumer is aware of your sponsorship. It’s whether the consumer believes you’re adding value to their experience,” he says.Mr Cowell adds: “Frank said to me, if we’re going to create a ‘Pepsi moment’, it should be organic within the show rather than something that looks out of place. Coming from someone who’s coughed up that much money, that indicated a lot of trust.”In return, he has told Syco staff that Pepsi “have to be brought into every conversation”.Mr Cowell says the nature of reality TV makes it impossible to know whether X Factor will succeed. “But we’re going to die trying,” he says.
456;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;X marks the spot for Pepsi in Cowell tie-up;;PepsiCo is planning a US TV and digital campaign of record cost and scope around its sponsorship of X Factor, as it seeks to use Simon Cowell’s new talent show to revive its core cola brand which has fallen to third place in the market.Pepsi now plans to spend $60m-$70m – more than expected – claiming it will feature the deepest product integration seen on TV and in digital media to date.The drinks and snacks group is bracing for figures this week from Beverage Digest, the soft drinks newsletter, which are expected to show that Pepsi’s US market share has fallen behind Coke and Diet Coke for the first time.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, is under pressure to prove she can buck a decline in sugary carbonated beverages after five years in which she has focused on juices, teas and sports drinks.“This is the biggest thing we’re doing in 2011,” said Frank Cooper, chief marketing officer for Pepsi’s sparkling beverages.Pepsi, which for decades used pop stars including Michael Jackson and Britney Spears to portray itself as “the choice of a new generation”, is pitting itself against American Idol , the Coca-Cola-sponsored show on which Mr Cowell was a judge.PepsiCo will now spend “easily 30 per cent more” on TV in North America this year, compared with the average of the past three years, said Massimo D’Amore, chief executive of PepsiCo Beverages Americas. “This is a big bet for us financially … It is a marketing renaissance for Pepsi.”Pepsi is working on apps for Apple’s iPad tablet and a digital “war room” to extend the campaign further into social networks.It will also devote much of its in-store promotions to the X Factor campaign, and will use Mr Cowell's Syco production company to create ads during commercial breaks in the show.Beverage Digest declined to comment.
457;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;PepsiCo to unveil green bottle;;PepsiCo will unveil a breakthrough in bottling technology on Tuesday when it announces the world’s first petroleum-free plastic bottle in an effort to further reduce its carbon footprint and answer criticism from environmentalists.The snacks and soft drinks company, whose food business includes Frito-Lay and Quaker, is using raw materials such as switch grass, pine bark and corn husks and converting them into polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, which is the plastic material used to make the majority of bottles.The race to create a petroleum-free bottled was triggered in 2009 when Pepsi’s rival Coca-Cola unveiled a bottle that was 30 per cent plant-based. Environmentalists have been critical of petroleum-based plastic because of high carbon emissions and for being slow to biodegrade.Traditional plastic bottles are produced using approximately 17m barrels of oil per year, excluding energy required for transporting them, according to a 2006 report from the Pacific Institute.Susan Collins, executive director of the Container Recycling Institute, said that Pepsi should be concentrating more of its energy on using recycled bottles rather than finding new materials to produce PET containers, which only have a 21 per cent recycling rate. She said that using recycled bottles could reduce its carbon footprint per bottle by 70 to 90 per cent.“I applaud the effort but they could be doing more,” Ms Collins said.Pepsi said it would begin a trial period with the new bottles, which look and feel exactly the same as its current ones, next year before launching a full roll-out. The company said that the cost of producing the plant-based bottles is similar to producing petroleum-based plastic and would not offer an estimate of how much the technology would reduce its carbon footprint.“The bottle itself has no carbon footprint,” said Rocco Papalia, senior vice president of advanced research at Pepsi.When Coca-Cola introduced its “Plant Bottle” in 2009 it said that the bottle’s carbon footprint was up to 19 per cent smaller than its regular bottle.Interest in plant-based bottle technology is growing and last month Heinz said it reached an agreement with Coca-Cola to produce ketchup bottles using its plastic. Some smaller water bottling companies, such as Green Planet, have created plant-based containers that use synthetic fibre from corn.Pepsi said the new bottle will eventually allow it to take by-products of its other businesses, including potato peels from its crisps and orange peels from its juices, and turn them into bottles.
458;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-03-14T04:22:32Z;Britvic makes global franchise plans;;Britvic, maker of Robinsons, Tango and Robinsons Fruit Shoot, is making plans to take its soft drinks global through franchisees.The company, which derives four-fifths of its revenues from the UK and Ireland, has begun testing the waters with its Fruit Shoot children’s drinks in Australia and in the south-east of the US.Other areas of the former British empire may prove fertile ground for Britvic brands, John Gibney, chief financial officer, told Evolution Securities’ investors’ conference in Edinburgh.“So the way we are thinking is how to capture that value …without laying down capital. And the best way is through franchising,” he said.A pilot was launched last November in Australia with Bickford’s, an Adelaide-based soft drinks company. Fruit Shoot is now available in Australia’s two dominant supermarkets, Woolworths and Coles.The drink is also distributed in Alabama, Florida and Georgia through Buffalo Rock, one of the largest independent Pepsi bottlers in the US. Alabama sales, from a small base, are up 20 per cent year on year, said Mr Gibney.Britvic’s overseas exposure is however largely limited to France, which accounts for the vast majority of non-UK and Ireland revenues. This leaves it vulnerable to crumbling consumer confidence and disposable income in Ireland and the competitive British market, where an estimated two-thirds of soft drinks are on promotion.UK-orientated food and drinks companies are pursuing divergent strategies. While some are considering overseas expansion, others, such as Premier Foods, are sticking with Britain and focusing on changing the product line-up.Andrew Holland, beverages analyst at Evolution Securities, said the plans to go overseas with an international partner, thereby requiring no capital deployment, made sense.“For a little UK company to have global ambitions, there is no way you could do that without an international partner,” he said.The downside is that profits must then be shared with the franchisee.Mr Gibney described the putative relationships as “almost a mirror image of what we do in the UK with Pepsi” as bottlers of the US cola drink. Britvic would provide the concentrate and the brand, while the bottler would package and distribute the drinks in its market.Such an arrangement, he added, limits Britvic’s exposure by requiring only a few staff on the ground and advertising and promotional spending.Britvic last month warned that rising commodity prices would have a greater impact on margins than initially thought.The company had forecast input cost inflation of 5-6 per cent for Britain and Ireland but revised this up to a 9-11 per cent increase a month later.
459;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-03-03T20:46:31Z;Brazil’s Ambev to invest $1.5bn in new factories;;Ambev, Brazil’s biggest brewer, promised to invest up to R$2.5bn in new factories and distribution centres this year in spite of concerns that the country’s slowing growth could hurt beer sales.The São Paulo-based company, a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev, posted a 26 per cent rise in net profits to R$7.56bn from R$5.99bn in 2009 on a 9 per cent rise in net revenue to R$25.23bn.However, volumes slowed in the fourth quarter and could continue to slow this year as a result of heavy rains and the effects of recent price increases, the company said on Thursday.João Castro Neves, chief executive, also expressed caution about efforts by Brazil’s government to tame inflation through more conservative spending.“There are some pros and cons (for 2011),” Mr Castro Neves told analysts and reporters on Thursday. “A clear pro for 2011 is the low unemployment figure – the lowest we’ve ever had in Brazil.”But he added that the government’s decision not to deliver any real increase to the minimum wage this year could put people off spending more on beer or the company’s other offerings, such as Pepsi and the popular Guaraná soft drink.
460;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-03-01T20:06:42Z;Bright Food highest bidder for Yoplait stake;;Bright Food of China has emerged as the highest bidder for the 50 per cent stake in Yoplait, the global yoghurt brand, that has been put up for sale by its private equity owner, according to people familiar with the deal.General Mills, the US food group that owns the Yoplait licence in the US, is also in the running, as is Nestlé of Switzerland.The Yoplait brand, the world’s second-biggest yoghurt brand by sales, is jointly owned by PAI, which is selling its 50 per cent stake, and Sodiaal, the French farmers’ co-operative.However, they say that the complexities of the sale mean the winner will have to show more than just cash.The structure of the company, along with the interest of the French government, which is keeping an eye on proceedings, means different interests are at play over the choice of buyer.While PAI’s aim is to maximise value for its shareholders, the farmers are more interested in a partner they can work with.The French government, having once labelled yoghurt a strategic asset when there was speculation in the media that PepsiCo of the US was eyeing Danone, has said its state-backed fund could come in as a shareholder.But Yoplait’s owners are understood to prefer an international company that would be able to help the brand develop in emerging markets.Late last year the joint owners of Yoplait rejected a €1.4bn ($1.8bn) takeover bid for the whole of Yoplait from French private dairy company Lactalis, saying it was too low.Bright Food’s high bid might reflect the hurdles it is up against, bankers said. It is neither French nor international.The Chinese dairy company has lost a degree of credibility by balking at deals at the last minute: it has abruptly walked away from United Biscuits, of the UK, and GNC, the US vitamin retail chain.“Bright wants to move up the value added curve and thinks this is a legitimate brand to do it with,” said one person familiar with the group.“Dairy is the highest priority …It is more about what international assets make sense to leverage their prospects in the Chinese market.”General Mills is eager to protect its franchise, currently the subject of legal proceedings, which further muddies the waters.The brand also has attractions for Nestlé. Analysts noted the Swiss foods group had over the years moved out of basic dairy products, selling fresh milk activities, divesting many powdered milk operations and putting its remaining fresh dairy business into a joint venture with France’s Lactalis.James Amoroso, an independent industry analyst said: “But fresh dairy has always been a special category for Peter Brabeck [Nestlé’s chairman]. It’s still very strategic for him.”Nestlé and General Mills declined to comment.Additional reporting by Haig Simonian in Zurich
461;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-02-28T20:25:12Z;Kaplan to leave BofA for hedge fund;;Steven Baronoff will again take control of the deals business at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, after the decision by Jeff Kaplan, the global head of mergers and acquisitions, to leave the bank for a hedge fund.Mr Kaplan, who joined Merrill Lynch in 1987, will become chief operating officer of Appaloosa Management, the hedge fund group founded by David Tepper, according to a message sent to Bank of America employees.BofA counts Appaloosa, which manages about $15bn in assets and focuses on distressed investing, among its clients, said the memo.Before taking the reins of the M&A operation in the aftermath of the merger between BofA and Merrill Lynch, Mr Kaplan ran the financial sponsors group at Merrill.He will help Mr Tepper with non-investment aspects of the business, including overseeing relationships with investors and Wall Street. Mr Kaplan is expected to join the fund in April.Large hedge funds are bulking up their staff and investing in systems and infrastructure as heightened regulatory oversight and pressure from large investors forces groups to become more institutional in nature.The hiring of Mr Kaplan does not signal any shift in Appaloosa’s investment strategy, said people familiar with the matter. The group has traditionally focused on investing in the debt of distressed companies as well as taking large equity stakes in potential turnround stories.In 2010, a year when many hedge funds struggled to match the returns available from the benchmark S&P 500 index, Appaloosa’s Thoroughbred fund returned 22 per cent.Mr Baronoff ran the M&A effort at Merrill Lynch from 2000 to 2009, before stepping up to the chairman role after BofA scooped up the investment bank for $50m at the height of the financial crisis in September 2008.He will add management of the deals department to his role, acting as a senior adviser to the regional heads running M&A for the bank, as well as to clients. Mr Baronoff, who will keep the same title, joined Merrill Lynch in 1986.Recently, he helped advise Sara Lee on approaches from a number of interested buyers and its ultimate decision to separate the food company’s meats and beverages business. He also advised PepsiCo on the acquisitions of its two bottling companies in 2009 and advised Procter & Gamble on its $54bn acquisition of Gillette.
462;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-02-20T18:42:44Z;Right ingredients for healthier profits;;"Justin King is known for his sunny ebullience. It matches his company’s orange logo. The chief executive of UK supermarket group J Sainsbury even looks sunny with a ready smile crammed with bright white teeth and a permanent tan. “It’s rust,” he quips. In fact, it is the remnant of a recent holiday.Archie Norman, former chief executive of rival supermarket Asda, which employed Mr King in the early 1990s, describes the 49-year-old as possessing “a twinkle in his eye” and the ability to “light up a room”. Confident and optimistic, Mr King never wastes time “worrying about things that are irrelevant”. Work anxieties do not keep him awake. “I go to bed, close my eyes and go to sleep,” he chirrups.So it is rather disconcerting to puncture Mr King’s legendary cheeriness. Asked what it is like to be permanently in the shadow of Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket chain by market share, Mr King becomes irritated. “I never think about it,” he snaps, leaning forward from a small leather sofa in the meeting room at J Sainsbury’s modern, airy headquarters – a cross between a vast airport lounge and a hypermarket – in Holborn, central London. A blue abstract painting, photos of his family and a large orange jumper that hangs on a coat-stand are the only personal touches in the otherwise bland room, which doubles as his private office.Being number one, he asserts, is not important. Surely he must have punched the air with joy when, in December, Sainsbury overtook Asda as the UK’s second-largest supermarket by market share, recapturing a position it last held in 2003? No, he says, his focus is solely on his own company. “What is important is where we can get to in a year’s time. That is how we define success. The [outcome], if others fail or do less well, might be that we overtake them, but it’s not the purpose.”The stocky supermarket chief, who is a keen jogger and as a child wanted to be Bobby Charlton (not for his “haircut but his football skills”), likens his strategy to that of former athlete Lord Coe who “tried to win by running faster than the other guy”.The metaphor is baffling. After all, Lord Coe, now the chairman of the London Organising Committee for the London 2012 Olympic Games, which Sainsbury sponsors, wanted to beat his competitors and win a gold medal. “When I say our success does not require anybody else’s failure, I really mean that,” he insists.That is not to say, Mr King concedes, that he does not monitor his rivals and occasionally copy their best ideas. “You cannot have a monopoly on great ideas,” he says. “So make sure you spot your competitors’ when they have them, interpret them for your business and your customers and your colleagues. But don’t be frightened of taking other people’s ideas and doing them better.”His strategy has worked. Since being brought in as chief executive from Marks and Spencer in 2004, he has turned round a supermarket that was in decline. On his appointment, employees told him they wanted to stop pretending they had jobs elsewhere and could be proud to say they worked at Sainsbury. His commitment to quality food, ensuring shelves are fully stocked with items customers want, as well as strong marketing, notably advertising campaigns fronted by television chef Jamie Oliver, has revived the group. It has enjoyed consistent sales growth for the past six years.Sainsbury’s buoyancy has confounded doom-mongers who prophesied the recession would see the mid-price supermarket lose customers to discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl. It didn’t. Mr King says the thesis missed two key points: Sainsbury’s transformation and that shoppers would stay true to their values, refusing to compromise on quality food, such as meat from animals raised to high welfare standards, in spite of the pressure on their finances.Nonetheless, Mr King, who sits on the government’s business advisory group, does not want to play down the continued difficulties facing consumers. “They are huge and accelerating, not decelerating.” With the rising price of petrol, the recent increase to value added tax and the prospect of public sector job losses, further tax rises and spending cuts. “It is only going to get worse,” he says.But some analysts are concerned that profit growth has not been as spectacular as Sainsbury’s sales acceleration. Its operating margin is a little more than half that of Tesco’s. Sainsbury is expanding its store estate aggressively, and there is a question mark over the returns this will generate – particularly as Tesco is equally zealous. Sainsbury has also suffered a setback in its ambitions in non-food, with the departures, late last year, of its directors of clothing and general merchandise, while its convenience store roll-out is behind schedule.And Sainsbury has yet to develop an overseas operation – unlike Tesco, which has a powerful international presence spanning central Europe, Asia and a nascent US business. Mr King will not be drawn on his plans, aside from saying: “At the moment, going international is neither necessary nor desirable.”A child of the 1970s, Mr King was raised in Solihull, in the West Midlands, by a stay-at-home mother and a petrochemical salesman father, from whom Mr King clearly inherited the gift of the gab and a pragmatic approach to money. “If you wanted a bike, you went and earned the money to have one.”He studied business at the University of Bath and was destined to work for his sponsor, Lucas Electrical, then the UK’s biggest component supplier to the motor industry. But he changed his mind when he realised it was a company “on the slide”. “I said: ‘Well, I’d like to be running [it] in 20 years’ time but [it won’t] exist in 20 years’ time. So I’ll have to go elsewhere.’”After graduation he joined Mars, the confectioner and breeding ground of many senior British bosses. “It was a fantastic training school; you were given opportunities very early that you would have spent years building up to in other organisations.” After spells at PepsiCo and Häagen-Dazs, he joined Asda. A company man, he never harboured any desire to set up his own business. “If you can be an agent for change in a big organisation it’s a much greater challenge than creating something yourself.”One of his earliest jobs at Mars, selling chocolate to corner shops in east London, taught him an important lesson: key to understanding a company is knowing what goes on at the front line. He describes his approach as “top and bottom management” – “I’m managing a board, they’re empowered to get on with running the business. But I also make sure I stay very close to the coalface” by making visits to suppliers and stores.Mr Norman, now chairman of ITV, the UK broadcaster, identifies this quality as integral to his protégé’s transformation of the business. “He really knows his company [and pays] attention to detail. People at Sainsbury feel his arm on their shoulder.”Mr King encourages employees to talk to him. “It’s one of the ironies of leadership that people don’t willingly equip you with the knowledge to make great decisions,” he says. “And yet they expect you to make great decisions and think you’re an imbecile if you don’t.” Not shooting messengers is a guiding principle, because, if you do “they stop coming”.He views family holidays as an opportunity to reflect on Sainsbury’s performance and goals. Isn’t that incredibly unrelaxing? “Oh no, I can do that in a very relaxing way …in shorts, unshaven, while jumping on an [inflatable] banana.”With a lot of change at the top of Britain’s big four supermarkets, Mr King looks set to take on the role of industry grandee. Sir Terry Leahy will step down as chief executive of Tesco at the end of February. Andy Bond left Asda in April, while Marc Bolland defected from Wm Morrison to lead M&S, thereby making Mr King the longest-serving chief of the big four supermarkets. “I don’t think of myself, and I hope I never do, as the grandee,” the boyish-looking chief executive insists.But with so many departing executives, attention has turned to whether Mr King will be next to hang up his grocer’s apron. “Do I look like someone who’s not enjoying the job that I’m doing?” he says, his white teeth flashing."
463;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-02-17T21:24:04Z;Pincer effect marks staples turning point;;"With a couple of notable exceptions, the consumer staples sector has had a tough reporting season.Inflation in raw materials, on which food producers spend about one-third of the value of their sales, is rising: PepsiCo, the US group, and UK-listed Unilever were among those flagging up higher bills.Consumers in much of the developed world are fragile, while the more resilient emerging markets are becoming more competitive. The pincer effect of these two trends is leading some analysts to ask whether the industry – which has consistently outperformed the broader market over the past 25 years – has reached a turning point.More costly raw materials may be here to stay, some analysts believe, while cost-cutting to offset the higher bills has a more finite life. So far, companies such as Danone, the French dairy group, and Nestlé, the world’s biggest food producer, both of which bucked the trend of disappointing results, reckon they can cover the higher costs as they did in the 2007-08 commodity spike.However – beyond the current bull run – Martin Deboo, food analyst at Investec, expects structural inflation in commodities to continue as demand surges and the conversion of food crops into biofuels curbs supply. “If we were to have 5-10 per cent structural cost inflation in commodities, then that would require annual price rises of 1.5-3 per cent merely to protect cash margins, which will have to be paid for by weak, highly taxed consumers in developed markets.”Diageo was among those showing exactly how price sensitive some of those consumers are. The maker of Johnnie Walker whisky saw European sales fall in the second half.The drinks maker, like its peers, has responded by beefing up its presence in emerging markets, where economic growth is robust and consumers are becoming richer rather than poorer. These markets now account for about 30-40 per cent of sales for European consumer goods companies – less for the US ones.But that has an impact on margins, as building up in a region requires more investment on infrastructure and advertising. In certain cases, such as that of beer, prices charged to customers are under pressure too. As a result, brewer SABMiller, for example, derives about one-fifth of its sales in China, but only 2 per cent of its profits, on analysts’ estimates.“For the past few years you’ve had boards saying to management: ‘Get as much emerging market exposure as you can’. And there’s been this mass scramble. That will affect the cost of doing business,” says Nik Modi, consumer goods analyst at UBS in New York.On top of input inflation, he cites three margin pressures: increased investment in innovation and marketing; more competition for labour, which sends wages higher; and rising media costs. Inflation on Chinese primetime TV is in double digits. “It’s this cocktail that [puts] pressure on emerging market margins.”While some companies boast superior margins in emerging markets – Nestlé, for example, benefits from the fact it sells more profitable items there and excludes bulky items like water – for others the current reporting season has already shown the cost of competition. Mr Deboo says: “We have seen [Unilever’s 52 per cent owned] Hindustan Unilever’s margins compress by hundreds of basis points as they mount an ‘unblinking defence’ against Procter & Gamble.”Julian Hardwick, analyst at RBS, says the pie will get bigger, allowing for plenty of top-line growth without resorting to price cutting.He cites Unilever: “They are supplying 1.8bn consumers [in emerging markets] and there’s another 4bn that don’t currently buy their products.”Best of all, we all need to eat and drink. Jamie Isenwater at Deutsche Bank points out: “Internet killed the CD. It’s difficult to imagine anything killing the food and beverage industry.”"
464;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Pepsi back on Sainsbury’s shelves;;Pepsi is back on Sainsbury’s shelves following a standoff over pricing, setting the tone for what promises to be a tough round of negotiations between suppliers and retailers.Sainsbury is understood to have caved in, at least partially, on the higher prices demanded by Britvic after the Pepsi bottler stopped supplies, leading to shortages in its stores during the past two weeks.Sainsbury and Britvic both declined to comment.Food and drink manufacturers are looking to pass at least some of the higher cost of raw materials on to retailers. Retailers, eager to protect their own margins and customers, are resisting.The Pepsi spat comes as supermarkets begin their annual negotiations with suppliers, many of whom are battling soaring inflation on inputs such as wheat, sugar and oil.Similar dynamics were at play in 2008, but analysts expect the current round of talks to be tougher given the fragile state of consumers in the UK.“It was a slightly different environment last time because the consumer was a bit more buoyant,” said Darren Shirley, analyst at Shore Capital. “Negotiations are likely to be a bit more tense this time, and maybe the magnitude of price increases they get through will not be as big.”Retailers, too, are playing tough. A seasoned supermarket watcher said while suppliers were putting through price rises to reflect higher input costs, supermarkets were asking for promotional discounts, enabling them to put on special offers.Premier Foods discovered retailers’ mettle in October last year, when Tesco delisted some of its Hovis breads rather than paying up. Soaring wheat prices forced Premier to raise its prices on loaves of bread by 5p-10p. Tesco responded by delisting 11 out of the 18 bread product lines that Premier produces.“This type of thing is just part and parcel of negotiations,” said Julian Hardwick, foods analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland. “Most of the time it happens behind closed doors. If you are a must-stock product, then if you want a price increase you will get a price increase. There will be some back-and-forth about the amount and so on but ultimately you will get it.”However, even that may not be the end of the story. If consumers respond by ditching the brand, manufacturers will be backed into offering more promotions again.
465;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-02-16T20:38:02Z;New twists on old favourites;;"Peek into a British store cupboard and the chances are that you will see a nation in thrall to nostalgia rather than fine dining. There sit jars of Branston pickle – chipped cauliflower and swede pieces pickled in sweet vinegar, a million miles from Japan’s piquant tsukemono. Tucked behind, you might find sachets of Smash dehydrated instant mashed potato and small tubs of Ambrosia rice pudding sit alongside bottles of Sarson’s, a brand of vinegar that predates the Napoleonic wars. Arrayed around these are cans of spring-yellow custard, tasteless carrots and slithery sliced mushrooms – all as nature never intended.But sweeping macro trends are forcing change on these long-standing brands, some of which have been around for centuries.Spurred by celebrity chefs and, to some extent, government diktat, Brits are eating both more healthily and more often on their own. Thanks to the break-up of the traditional family structure, four out of 10 meals are now consumed alone. Never have food manufacturers, which pride themselves on innovation, needed to adapt so much.According to Jon Goldstone, group marketing director of Premier Foods, UK manufacturer of 40 or so brands of larder foods – including Branston pickle and Smash the evolution kicked off in earnest six years ago. That was when chef Jamie Oliver launched a campaign to improve the quality of school dinners.Manufacturers rushed to switch gear. Walkers, the potato crisp maker owned by PepsiCo, replaced palm oil with sunflower oil and introduced a baked variety. Premier and scores of other companies started to zap artificial additives and ease back on salt and fats.Some were able to burnish two halos: environmental and health. To help stop depleting cod stocks, Birds Eye switched to pollock for its fish fingers – breaded strips of fish, another British speciality. It also relabelled the finished product Omega 3 fish fingers, stressing the fish’s dietary benefits.At same time, a parallel consumer preference for local produce has encouraged more domestic sourcing. Following three years of agricultural experimentation, Premier’s Hovis loaves are now made entirely from British wheat. “People are much more trusting if they can understand the provenance,” says Mr Goldstone. He rattles off the trio of benefits: a belief that local tastes better; helping the environment by cutting air miles; and “basic patriotism”, supporting the British farmer and creating jobs.Yet this marketing insight is not always evident among shoppers. “You know, I never noticed that,” laughs a mum of three when alerted to the “100 per cent British” mark during a shopping trip around a Tesco supermarket in Borehamwood, just north of London. “I’d have assumed it was all British wheat anyway.”Undeterred, Premier is promoting its British credentials, culminating in an advertising campaign timed to coincide with the forthcoming “flag-waving period”, encompassing the royal wedding on April 29, the Diamond Jubilee and 2012 Olympics.Ads, says Mr Goldstone, will play into this zeitgeist showing “in a gloriously British way celebrating what makes us great”.Yet the focus on what the British eat does not appear to have extended far into the kitchen, where time-pressed Brits are spending less time cooking than ever – in inverse proportion to the number of television hours devoted to the subject.Supper is now on the table in 34.5 minutes. The average repertoire is a mere 6.4 different meals, according to Premier’s research, repeated endlessly over fortnightly cycles.“Mums in particular say they love watching Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay, but nine out of 10 don’t actually do it because it’s too complicated or they don’t have the time or ingredients or want to take the risk of making it and the family don’t like it,” says Nick Rabin, Premier’s head of insights. “It’s the same with cookbooks. You go into a consumer’s house and they have lots of cookbooks but they don’t do anything from them.”Manufacturers are tapping into this with quick and easy “cook-in” sauces; Premier has its “great little ideas” campaign, which is more about add-ons (crumble an Oxo cube on your roast chicken) than recipes. As Mr Rabin says: “For mass producers like ourselves, it makes sense to do what the consumer is doing.”Consumers are also doing a significant amount of this cooking and eating on their own thanks to later marriages, more divorces and longer lives. Even when families live under one roof, they do not necessarily eat together. Children are fed first, teenagers eat on the hoof, and shift-working parents take their meals when they can.So Premier has decanted its Lloyd Grossman pasta sauces into single-size pouches. Ambrosia rice and prepared custard are sold in mini-sized plastic pots, ready for children to grab from the cupboard after dinner or stash in lunchboxes.“Lunchboxes have grown over the past couple of years, partly in reaction to school dinners becoming more healthy: bizarrely enough, kids are complaining they don’t like what is on offer so they want their mums to give them packed lunches,” says Mr Rabin.The number of lunchbox meals is up 6 per cent since 2007 to nearly 4bn last year, with the majority being taken to work rather than to school – a sign of the cash-strapped times.When a brand cannot be improved on – at least in Premier’s eyes – it opts for brand extension, described by Mr Goldstone as “a tough old game to play” where failures outweigh successes.But he claims the latter for Branston, the nearly century-old pickle that has segued into relishes and, in 2009, pickle-flavoured mayonnaises. As a result of these and other brand extensions, Branston sales have doubled over the past five years to £79m.So what of Smash? The instant mashed potato brand, whose 1970s groundbreaking “Martians” ads became part of the national consciousness, need not necessarily be consigned to the graveyard. “You think: can you do other root vegetables that could bring the brand up to date? Or find creative uses for it as an ingredient – for example, in fish cakes?” says Mr Rabin, pointing out that, at more than 97 per cent potato, the product is far from a cocktail of chemicals.He adds that Smash retains a following among older people, who find it more convenient than fresh potatoes. and among larger, less affluent families – that small packet feeds a lot of mouths.Likewise, Angel Delight, another peculiarly British confection, similar to an airy blancmange. Mr Rabin suggests that this instant powder, acquired as part of the Birds acquisition from Kraft of the US, still has potential because it could, for instance, be sold in readymade pots.Mr Kipling, purveyor of “exceedingly good” (if rather old-fashioned) cakes has also received an update with free-range eggs. There may be further opportunities to broaden the repertoire of cakes; Mr Rabin points to the emergence of a coffee-shop culture and the subsequent boom in muffins and cupcakes.“I suspect American muffins introduced by the likes of Starbucks have given people a taste for these, so having a good-quality version to have at home is the sort of thing we should be looking at,” says Mr Rabin.If so, give it a few more years and those British store cupboards could start to resemble American ones – albeit with smaller packs."
466;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-02-15T13:09:35Z;Danone sets bullish sales targets;;"Danone bucked the food sector’s trend for dismal results, beating analyst expectations to lift like-for-like sales 6.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter.While the consumer staples sector has consistently disappointed this reporting season, with companies from Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo in the US to Reckitt Benckiser in the UK missing analyst expectations, the French dairy products group surged ahead on the back of emerging markets demand.Danone, which last year bought Russian peer Unimilk, now boasts Russia as its biggest market – along with France – and garners half its revenues from emerging markets.This has encouraged the group to issue bullish guidance for this year, notwithstanding an expected 6-9 per cent increase in raw material costs this year and little change to current consumer spending patterns.It is targeting a 6-8 per cent rise in sales on a like-for-like basis in 2011 and also a 0.20 per cent lift on operating margins – much of which, however, will be driven by synergies from the Unimilk acquisition.The higher top-line target was surprising, said Andrew Wood, analyst at Bernstein Research, coming ahead of the old medium-term target of at least 5 per cent.“We are surprised by management’s confidence so early in the year, but the level of pricing plus including Unimilk certainly helps,” he wrote in a report.Danone said it would draw on its experience of 2010 to manage the rising costs of raw materials through high productivity. “The group will also continue to use pricing to maintain competitive edge, benefiting from increased room for manoeuvre thanks to repositioning in 2009,” it said in a statement.Consolidated sales rose 16.8 per cent to €4.3bn year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2010; stripping out the effect of foreign exchange rates and changes in the scope of consolidation the increase was 6.9 per cent.Volumes nudged up just 1 per cent in Europe, but jumped by 9.6 per cent in Asia and a similar amount in the rest of the world. The water business remained strong, increasing sales by 5.2 per cent on a like-for-like basis.Shares in Danone, which have lagged behind the broader French market in the past year, were 3.4 per cent higher at €45.45 in early trading Tuesday."
467;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-02-10T23:43:56Z;Pepsi faces steep input price inflation;;PepsiCo faces the highest levels of input price inflation in many years, underlining the broad pressures confronting global food companies amid steep rises in the price of oil and agricultural commodities.The snacks and soft drinks company, whose food business includes Frito-Lay and Quaker, expected an additional $1.4bn to $1.6bn in extra input costs in its 2011 financial year, equivalent to cost inflation of 8 to 9.5 per cent.“There aren’t many years in my 23 years at PepsiCo that I remember seeing that range,” said Hugh Johnson, chief financial officer, as the company issued its fourth-quarter results on Thursday. “That type of inflation has a pretty strong impact.”Inflation concerns contributed to a lowered forecast for earnings growth in its 2011 financial year in the range of 7 to 8 per cent, down from a previous forecast in March last year of low double-digit percentage growth.It also said it expected earnings growth in the lower range to continue after 2011, in spite of its $7.8bn investment acquiring its largest bottlers in 2010, and purchasing a controlling stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann, the Russian dairy company, for $3.8bn.Indra Nooyi, chief executive, defended the company’s strategy, telling Wall Street analysts that “had we not had the macroeconomic sluggishness and this extraordinary commodity inflation, we’re a solid double-digit [earnings growth] player.”She also emphasised the “considerable uncertainty” that had led to the decision to lower earnings guidance.“We have no idea what the commodity markets are going to look like in 2012 and beyond,” she said.“We have no idea what the developed market economic situation is going to be, whether it is going to improve robustly or whether the current sluggishness is going to continue.”Coca-Cola, Pepsi’s main rival, earlier this week reported sales growth across leading markets during the fourth quarter for the first time since 2003, supported by strengthening consumer demand and gains in market share from investments in marketing and distribution.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chief executive, said: “At best the recovery is still mixed around the world …But I think there’s more stability and less concern about a major upheaval.”Mr Kent said he believed Coca-Cola’s strong results reflected its own efforts to improve its global business performance.PepsiCo’s food brands account for over 50 per cent of its revenues. Several other leading global food companies have warned of the impact of commodity price inflation in the coming year. John Bryant, chief executive of Kellogg’s, the cereal company, said last week that he expected pressure on grain prices to continue “for several years to come”.PepsiCo has said it expects to pass on some of the price increases to consumers, but would seek to minimise sudden price moves.For the fourth quarter, PepsiCo reported core earnings per share – excluding the impact of its takeover of its two largest bottlers – of $1.05 per diluted share.Sales volumes rose 9 per cent across its worldwide business, while net income, lifted by the bottling deals, rose 37 per cent to $18.1bn. Net earnings fell 5 per cent to $1.36bn, again reflecting the costs of the bottling acquisitions.In North America, soft drinks sales volumes rose by 1 per cent against the same quarter last year, trailing the 3 per cent growth reported on Wednesday by Coca-Cola
468;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-02-10T23:09:39Z;Cisco results weigh on Wall Street;;Lacklustre quarterly earnings from Cisco Systems dragged on technology stocks but, in the wider markets, a stronger materials sector balanced out losses.The networking equipment maker tumbled 14.2 per cent to $18.92 after reporting that its profit margin had fallen because of its push into new markets.In spite of the decline in margins, Cisco’s overall revenue for the second quarter was $10.4bn, or 37 cents a share, above Wall Street’s expectations of $10.23bn, or 39 cents a share.Cisco has seen an average fall in price of 6.9 per cent in the past four quarters after releasing their earnings results, according to Whisper Numbers, an equity research firm.The weak results weighed on the technology sector, which was the worst performing in the session. The S&P technology index was down 2 per cent to 473.51.The S&P 500 closed fractionally up at 1,321.87 as losses among techs were balanced out by stronger materials stocks on reports that Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian president, might step down on Thursday evening.The S&P materials index was up 0.3 per cent. Among the winners was Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coalminer, which gained 2 per cent to $88.45.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent to 12,229.29, ending a eight session winning streak, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent at 2,790.45.Confidence on Wall Street was not helped by mixed earnings reports.PepsiCo reported core earnings per share of $1.05 per diluted share compared with Wall Street’s consensus forecast of $1.04, excluding the impact of its takeover of its two largest bottlers.Its shares fell 1.6 per cent to $63.36. The news weighed on related stocks. Dr Pepper Snapple was down 3.5 per cent to $33.96 while the S&P beverage sector lost 0.5 per cent.NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, softened slightly after jumping 14 per cent in the previous session on news that it was in advanced-stage merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.NYSE was down 0.8 per cent to $37.80 but the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s primary options-trading venue, rose 5.3 per cent to $26.87.
469;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-02-10T23:01:09Z;Diageo snubbed by investors;;"Shares in Diageo fell 4.6 per cent after the maker of Johnnie Walker whisky reported half-year results shy of expectations, delivering the latest in a long line of disappointments from the consumer sector.Reckitt Benckiser, the household and personal care company, this week suffered a battering after a marginal miss on fourth-quarter earnings – in spite of guiding for 4 per cent revenue growth this year in a stagnant market. In the US, shares in Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble have suffered similar fates.Investors’ disenchantment with the sector also speaks of a broader optimism about the global economy. Consumer staples are, like pharmaceuticals, a classic defensive holding when times are tough. Sniffing signs of recovery, investors are dumping the shares in favour of racier sectors.“People are keener to buy financials – people are flogging [consumer staples] on their results; if the results are bad, they doubly flog them,” said Charlie Mills, analyst at Credit Suisse.In the US, PepsiCo provided further illustration. The snacks and soft drinks company reported fourth-quarter earnings in line with expectations, but warned that commodity inflation of 8-9.5 per cent would temper growth this year. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent.Higher input prices are crimping margins across the sector, although many companies, having learnt from the commodity spike of 2007-08, are more adept at offsetting the bills.For example, Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group, expects to pay the equivalent of an additional 4 per cent of sales for raw materials this year, but reckons it will partly offset this by passing some costs on to customers.Analysts remain divided on the extent to which hard-hit consumers will be prepared to pay higher prices.This in turn is increasing multinationals’ focus on emerging markets.Bart Becht, Reckitt chief executive, spoke of a “two-speed world picture, where western Europe and North America, from a growth point of view, are not doing well, and eastern Europe and developing markets continue to do extremely well.”Diageo reported a 4 per cent increase in organic net sales to £5.3bn, while operating profit rose 12 per cent to £1.7bn.The drinks group, which increased both the dividend and its marketing budget, will divert the bulk of that additional spend to emerging markets."
470;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Coca-Cola sees broad global growth;;Coca-Cola saw sales growth across all its leading worldwide markets during the fourth quarter for the first time since 2003, supported by strengthening consumer demand and gains in market share from investments in marketing and distribution.The world’s largest soft drinks company by sales said its worldwide sales by unit case volume rose 5 per cent against the same quarter last year, with sales growth in the US, western Europe and Japan reinforcing continued strength in emerging markets.Muhtar Kent, chief executive, said Coca-Cola had seen positive volume sales growth in both regional markets and across its leading brands and categories.“For the first time in a long, long time, there’s no red,” he said of the regular executive summaries of the company’s global business. “Red is when its down, black is when all the percentages are up. And there’s no red.”Sales in emerging markets continued to grow, with volume sales in Russia up 31 per cent, India up 12 per cent, and Brazil and Mexico up 7 and 8 per cent respectively against the same quarter last year. Volume sales in China declined 3 per cent, largely reflecting a shift in timing of sales aimed at the lunar new year holidays.But Coca-Cola also saw sales of its Coke brand in North America increase by one per cent, while sales of still beverages rose 7 per cent. It also reported growth in Japan and in Germany, and recovering demand in Eastern Europe.Mr Kent told the Financial Times he believed the strong results reflected Coca-Cola’s own efforts to improve its global business performance, and its “continued investments . . . in creating further brand strength” during the global slump sparked by the Wall Street crash of September 2008.“At best the recovery is still mixed around the world . . . But I think there’s more stability and less concern about a major upheaval,” he said.Mr Kent has set Coca-Cola and its bottlers the objective of doubling its total revenues to $200bn by 2020, with 60 per cent of the growth coming from emerging markets.During the company’s 2010 fiscal year, the company said that 40 per cent of its sales growth came from China, Russia, India and Brazil. Mr Kent also noticed that China, India and Brazil accounted for over a third of the cold drink equipment it deployed during the year to drive sales.Net income at Coca-Cola more than doubled to $5.78bn, or $2.46 per share, against a year ago, boosted by its acquisition of the US assets of Coca-Cola Enterprises, its largest bottler, which closed in October.Excluding the acquisition, net income per share rose 9 per cent, to 72 cents per share, in line with Wall Street’s expectations. Overall revenues rose 40 per cent to $10.49bn.Coca-Cola’s shares closed slightly ahead in New York at $63.15.
471;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-02-07T21:47:08Z;Preserve your unique flavour;;"Willy Wonka had it easy. In order to preserve his highly individual, ethically sound chocolate – the dispatching of miscreant children being a clear precursor to fair trade – he threw a competition to find a pint-sized heir.Compare that with Green & Black’s. The organic chocolate maker, seeking funds for expansion, was obliged to sign what founder Craig Sams only half jokingly dubs a “Faustian contract” that led to its takeover by Cadbury in 2005.Tensions are inevitable when big corporations acquire companies with a quirky image. Multinationals are sprawling concerns, accustomed to gobbling up $1bn-plus acquisitions from which they cut costs and reap synergies by plugging the new products into existing infrastructure. Cult brands, by contrast, are all about devoted customers and staff, esoteric ways of doing business. They even look different: enter the Burlington, Vermont, offices of Ben & Jerry’s, the ice cream maker owned by Unilever, and you see a spiral slide, while at the London offices of Innocent, the fruit smoothie maker majority owned by Coca-Cola, the floors are carpeted with bright green AstroTurf.The biggest bone of contention is usually over common ground: a tussle for control. “We worked very well during that interim period (when Cadbury had a 5 per cent stake) while we were running the business,” says Mr Sams. But by 2005, he continues, when Cadbury took over the company, that had changed. “There were now shareholders who said: ‘Why are we selling that? This turnover is not enough!’ . . . They wanted Cadbury to be in the driving seat; understandably, it’s their business.”Challenges such as these can scupper relationships. Green & Black’s, although in some ways it feels better off now it is part of the still-larger Kraft, remains keenly aware that its chocolate is dwarfed by Kraft’s $1bn-plus brands. That also makes it harder to incentivise management, and is one reason why the chocolate maker last year sought to disentangle itself through a management buy-out.Other deals have self-combusted. PepsiCo was forced to write off PJ Smoothies, the UK’s number two smoothie maker at the time of the 2005 acquisition, a decision the US company delicately describes as “economic”. But the drink maker was in essence the casualty of a switch in focus as PepsiCo concentrated on its own chilled drinks, Tropicana and Copella.Successful mergers claim to have overcome such problems by focusing on commonalities in the workplaces and a light touch in the board room. Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s talk of shared values in terms of being close to the communities where they operate, treating employees fairly and caring about the environment. Jostein Solheim, chief executive of Ben & Jerry’s, says that Unilever’s aggressive pursuit of sustainability goals has strengthened the relationship. “I don’t think we have ever been as close as we are today,” says the former Unilever manager.These sentiments are echoed by Gü and Organix, respectively makers of upmarket desserts and organic baby foods. James Averdieck, who founded Gü in 2003, says of new owners Noble: “They are privately owned by two entrepreneurs and they understand how entrepreneurs think.”Equally important is knowing when to keep a distance. Richard Reed, co-founder and chief executive of Innocent, describes Coca-Cola – which owns 58 per cent of the smoothie maker – as a big brother: not always hanging around outside the school gates but ready to help when needed.Similarly, Anna Rosier, managing director of Organix, sees its parent company Hero of Switzerland as being like advisers. “What we wanted almost was a board of non-exec directors. They are taking our views and plans first and considering them and then saying: ‘Is there any expertise we can give to them?’ Rather than a set of managers saying: ‘We are going to do this.’ It was about us remaining kind of in control, I guess. But we also understand we are now part of a group and everyone contributes to that group …I feel like we are part of this cycle of investment rather than handing a pot of cash to shareholders.”Innocent’s Mr Reed gives the example of their search for premises. Coca-Cola offered space in its offices but Innocent declined.Keeping your own space, literally and metaphorically, is key. Ben & Jerry’s has its own board of largely independent directors. And while its activist campaigning does not always sit comfortably with the politically neutral Unilever, the quirky ice-cream maker has not stopped creating waves.Kevin Havelock, the group’s head of ice-cream, confesses to twinges of discomfort when Ben & Jerry’s decided to celebrate the legalisation of gay marriage in the US by rechristening its Chubby Hubby ice-cream Hubby Hubby. “But we say B&J are separate to take a view or stance,” he says.Politics can be easier to split out than commerce. Small brands want their acquirers’ dollars – Green & Black’s, Gü and Organix all reached the tipping point when sales were running at about £25m – but are sometimes less keen on the cost savings that are the flipside of the coin.Typically, buyers want distribution and procurement synergies: a bigger company placing mass orders pays less for its raw materials than a small one. But, because these small brands use premium, often organically sourced produce, they cannot always tap into group-wide purchasing. Organix continues to do its own advertising and distribution, and buys much of its own organic produce.For Mr Havelock, this offers the opportunity for the parent to learn from its smaller acquisition as the world moves towards fair trade and sustainability. Ben & Jerry’s was the first ice-cream company in the world to use Fairtrade-certified ingredients in 2005; Unilever has a broader target of sourcing all agricultural raw materials sustainably by 2020.James Quincey, Coca-Cola’s west European president, concurs: “We’ve been able to work together on sustainable agriculture.” He points to a mango initiative in Kenya, which, over five years, will enable small fruit farmers to increase their productivity – and sell more juice to both Coca-Cola and Innocent.While even those in happy marriages admit it is not plain sailing, unsurprisingly it is those who have remained independent that have more strident views.John McDonnell runs Patron, a purveyor of luxury tequilas that carry a distinctive bee logo. The company operates in an industry where premium brands are frequently snapped up by multinationals at big prices. But, he says: “Would you get the same focus if you went to a big company? We have six products. That is all we sleep, eat and breathe. We need sales people who have the time and patience to stand in front of the bar and talk to the bar manager about our brand. They stand there for half an hour and get an offer for three bottles, because we have to hand-sell our product.“A Pernod or a Diageo sales person has multiple products, so they can get a pallet order in 10 minutes.”"
472;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-02-04T18:54:34Z;Pass the carrots;;There’s no better day for the snack food industry than the one when 100m Americans sit in front of their televisions for five hours straight.Potato and corn chips are mainstays of the American Super Bowl party, but this year analysts expect football fans will be munching baby carrots and baked lentil chips as demand for “healthy” alternatives grows.“There’s a trend toward healthier snacks, no question,” said Harry Balzer, chief industry analyst for food research with the NPD Group. “One thing that will increase the most this Sunday will be the vegetable tray.”Americans’ interest in healthier snacks has grown steadily in recent years, particularly healthy versions of traditionally bad-for-you snacks. Manufacturers have responded by adding more baked potato chips, pretzel-based snacks and nuts to their product lines – all of which are claimed to be healthier than the traditional fried snack – said Dmitry Kopylovsky, a snack food analyst with research firm IBISWorld.Pepsi-owned Frito-Lay snacks, which accounts for about 50 percent of the US snack food market, vowed last month to use only natural ingredients in half of its snacks by the end of 2011.“One in four snacks has a label that says it’s a ‘better-for-you’ snack,” Mr Balzer said.Meanwhile, specialty food developers are pushing the trend even further with new potato and corn alternatives like lentil chips, falafel chips, hummus chips, adzuki bean chips and mung bean chips.Healthier snacks command higher prices, though, and consumers have not always been willing to pay more to satisfy their health conscience. While snack foods weathered the recession well in general, sales of healthier snacks grew more slowly than overall snacks.This year, analysts expect consumers will have more disposable income and reprioritize their health. And they expect marketers to use the Super Bowl as an opportunity to capture shoppers in the mood to splurge.“It’s a big event,” said Mr Kopylovsky. “Both the hosts and the attendees are going to be willing to class it up a bit and spend a few dollars on a premium snack rather than just the regular Doritos.”
473;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Tate & Lyle issues warning on corn prices;;Tate & Lyle, the food ingredients company, cautioned that higher corn prices could prompt a rise in its net debt position as it aimed to ensure supplies until the end of the harvest season in North America.Tighter supplies of corn had allowed Tate & Lyle to raise the price of its liquid sweetener to food and beverage customers that include Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Kraft and Nestle by up to 20 per cent as the FTSE 250 company attempted to recover corn costs, which have risen up 40 per cent over the year.With pricing negotiations for the current calendar year largely complete, Javed Ahmed, Tate & Lyle’s chief executive, said he expected to achieve slightly higher margins on the company’s annual fixed price corn sugar contracts in spite of the price rises.He added that trading during the third quarter to December 31 should keep the company on track to deliver its profit expectations for the full year to March 31.However, the higher cost of corn would strain Tate & Lyle’s working capital requirements as it maintained silo stocks at higher cost.The company, whose net debt during the quarter fell from £540m ($872m) to £462m following the disposal of its molasses business for £70m, now expects to finish the year with net debt back at £540m.During the first half of the year, Tate & Lyle also sold its sugar business to American Sugar Refining for £212m, which helped reduce net debt by £274m to £540m, as it committed itself to developing its speciality food ingredients business through investment in a research and development centre in Chicago and targeting emerging markets.Shares in the company, buoyed by recent speculation that it may become a takeover target for rival US food ingredients groups, slipped by up to 4 per cent on Tuesday before closing down 7½p or 1.3 per cent cent at 544p.Tate & Lyle, which owns the low-calorie sucralose sweetener brand Splenda whose production is centred in Singapore, added that it expected performance in Europe to be in line with expectations, in part as a result of a poor potato harvest, which had helped to firm up margins at its industrial starches business.On Tuesday broker Panmure Gordon edged up its target price from 540p to 570p though maintained a “hold” recommendation, saying it was sceptical about rumours that Cargill, its US food ingredients rival, could launch a bid for Tate.Fellow broker Evolution also held full-year profit forecasts at £252m, ahead of a consensus average of £235m, but argued the increase in net debt could “have some impact on management thinking of the full-year dividend”.Analysts are expecting a full-year dividend just ahead of last year’s 22.9p.
474;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

Agency: BBDO Argentina
Territory: Argentina
Verdict: ★★★★☆The “Braids” advertisement for H2Oh! flavoured water is the latest in a campaign that features families, underscoring the idea that this is a drink for all ages.The television commercial shows Laura introducing her boyfriend to her family. As he wins over each member of the family in turn, Laura looks on, doe-eyed, fiddling with her braids. “So he plays the guitar all day,” remarks grandma. “Yes, tango,” he replies. When the camera cuts back, she has acquired plaits like Laura’s, and twirls them, enraptured.“Tango-rock fusion,” he clarifies to a brother, who too sprouts a braid and unconsciously imitates his sister. Mum soon gets plaits and more hair twirling ensues after she is bowled over with a compliment on her risotto. Finally, dad thaws at the news that his potential son-in-law wants to be a brain surgeon, and he is soon playing with the braids that emerge from the back of his balding head.The ad is a playful take on an easily identifiable situation. The refreshing note is its lack of description of H2Oh! or a shot of anyone drinking it – the antithesis of most soft drinks commercials.The implication is that H2Oh! is one of the family and needs no introduction. It may seem a soft-sell, given the fiercely competitive nature of the market in soda-loving Argentina, but its gentle humour makes this a winner."
476;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-01-24T18:14:22Z;Lethal blow to Russian antiterror drive;;The deadly terrorist attack on Russia’s leading international airport is a severe setback to the country’s attempts to bring its domestic terrorist problems under control – and potentially to hopes of wooing more foreign investment.Domodedovo airport is for many travellers the gateway to Russia and, unlike in earlier attacks on the Moscow metro, many of the dead and injured were likely to be visitors.It came just after two of the largest business deals in recent years – PepsiCo’s purchase of the Wimm-Bill-Dann food company and BP’s share swap with Rosneft – had raised official hopes that efforts to attract investment were bearing fruit.The Moscow stock market, which had recently been at post-2008 highs, fell 2 per cent after the attack and the rouble weakened. Some market analysts, however, suggested that the impact on investor sentiment was likely to be short-lived.“This is a terrible situation that has been dragging on for nearly 20 years and this is a terrible new manifestation of that,” said Roland Nash, strategist at Verno Capital, a hedge fund. “Russia has a lot of risks and investors knew this risk was there. It is a human tragedy rather than an investment tragedy.”Analysts speculated that the blast pointed to the spread of radical Islam in Russia’s volatile North Caucasus. Attacks have spiralled over the past 12 months even though Russia declared the war against terrorism in the separatist region of Chechnya over in 2009.Worryingly for the Kremlin, analysts also suggested that the attack could be, in part, a response to rioting last month in Moscow by Russian far-right groups wielding knives and iron bars who lashed out at passers-by with a Caucasian appearance.Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian president, immediately ordered increased security at the capital’s transport hubs.He was also forced to postpone a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he was due to deliver the opening speech – an opportunity to showcase Russia’s economy – on Wednesday.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack and it could not officially be confirmed whether the explosion was the work of suicide bombers. But analysts quickly pointed the finger at terrorists from Russia’s vulnerable southern underbelly.“The attack is almost certainly the work of Islamist militants operating out of Russia’s North Caucasus region,” said Matthew Clement, Eurasia analyst at IHS Jane’s, an intelligence consultancy.It would not be the first time Domodedovo has been shown to be vulnerable to North Caucasus terrorists. Suicide bombers in 2004 bribed their way past security checks and managed to board two planes that they later brought down with bombs, killing 90 people.Russia has largely restored control over Chechnya, scene of two independence wars in the past 15 years, through its policy of “Chechenisation” – in effect contracting out leadership of the republic to a local warlord, Ramzan Kadyrov.But, as Mr Clement noted, remaining Chechen militants have joined forces with Islamists from neighbouring republics such as Dagestan, under the loose banner of the North Caucasus Emirate. This is a jihadist group calling for the creation of an Islamist caliphate across the North Caucasus.“It is senseless to discuss whether this was Dagestanis or Chechens,” said Alexei Malashenko of the Moscow Carnegie Centre think-tank. “It is an answer to the complete failure of Kremlin policy in the Caucasus.”Sergei Markov, a parliament member from the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, said the attack was a result of the Russian leadership’s “weak policy in the Caucasus”. The Kremlin had “lost”, he added, the moment the enemy switched from “separatists it was possible to fight with military methods”.“Now the enemy has been replaced with the rise of radical international Islam, which has been able to penetrate deep into the region and use the social situation where the youth is without work, without education and without a future,” Mr Markov said.
477;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Seabrook’s recipe for success;;John Tague, managing director, worked for Disney before joining Seabrook Crisps and there is a whiff of the Magic Kingdom about the Bradford-based company. The carpet design is of potatoes.“They were pebbles but I had eyes put on them,” says Ken Brook-Chrispin, chairman, chief executive and owner.Staff wander around their converted weaving shed crunching crisps and the first packets of a new range of unsalted crisps – jacket potato with Mediterranean tomato and herbs – has just arrived on Mr Tague’s desk. The pair tear into them declaring, “the packet’s brilliant” and “that flavour is nice”.The unlikely monickered Mr Brook-Chrispin, who married into the Brook family that founded the business in 1945 and adapted the name, lives, breathes and eats it. Sole owner since 2006, his latest product took two years to perfect. “For people who have a salt intolerance or high blood pressure, what do they have? Boring crisps. So we went to town and created four flavours.”Mr Tague says research has found there are consumers who would buy salt-free crisps. He believes the crisps, which have 1 per cent sodium that is naturally occurring, could make up 20 per cent of turnover within a year. “It is a unique product,” he says.That turnover is rising fast. It has grown from £12m in 2008 to £28m in 2010 and aims to hit £70m in next four or five years. Seabrook is fourth in the market behind Walkers, the PepsiCo brand that is market leader with 60 per cent share, United Biscuits-owned McCoys and Kettle Chips. It now has an average 4.5 per cent market share, with 10.7 per cent in its northern heartland.That has been thanks to Mr Brook-Chrispin’s £8.2m investment, increasing capacity to 2.5m packets a day. Volumes have risen from 250,000 to 1m packets a day, all crinkle cut and in bags of 31.8g and more.That was combined with faith in the product and “aggressive” sales tactics, pushing supermarkets such as Asda and also discounters such as TJ Morris to stock Seabrook. Next comes a £800,000 advertising campaign, its first.“Space, space, space in the supermarkets creates awareness of the brand and creates sales,” says Mr Tague. It is also exploiting an always profitable asset that the “old man”, Colin Brook, son of the founder, was content to use simply to provide work and buy the occasional Rolls-Royce.Mr Brook-Chrispin said: “The old man . . . was very set in his ways and his idea of MPD [manufacturing product design] was a new flavour.”Now Mr Brook-Chrispin, who is head taster, has produced two new ranges – a hot and spicy including curry and wasabi flavours aimed at pubs, and the low-salt variety – in as many years.And it is still employing 187 permanent staff and 150 contractors.

But the USDA said more than a third of oranges picked early in the season and nearly half of them now in harvest sustained some damage.Florida Citrus Mutual, a growers’ association, said: “We did not come out of the events unscathed, there is no doubt. As is normally the case, we won’t get a truly definitive picture on how much damage the industry sustained for weeks if not months.”Temperatures had sunk below 28°F (-2°C) for several nights in December – cold enough, typically, to damage crops.The USDA lowered its production forecast last week for the current Florida orange season to 140m boxes, down 4 per cent from an initial estimate, citing “several days of sub-freezing temperatures” last month. A box weighs 90lb.“The Florida crop keeps shrinking and inventories are low,” said Judy Ganes Chase, of soft commodities analyst J Ganes Consulting in New York.Orange juice, the smallest commodity market on the ICE Futures US exchange, attracts hedge funds and momentum traders because of its volatility.Money managers’ bullish bets outnumber bearish ones by a ratio of 62 to one.Prices also affect farmers in Florida and Brazil as well as processors, trading houses and bottlers such as PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.Jerry Neff, branch manager at brokers Allendale in Bradenton, Florida, said the market has rallied “on speculation there was more damage than had previously been traded on”.
480;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2011-01-06T20:05:19Z;Coke taps into taste for fresh alternative;;Almost a decade ago, Coca-Cola, the US beverages group, noticed that there was great potential for fruit juices in emerging markets.But there were two problems – undiluted 100 per cent drinks were too expensive for most customers and were difficult to distribute in countries where refrigerated delivery chains were not reliable.So, starting in 2003, Coke’s market experts and development engineers in Shanghai tried to devise a fruit drink suitable for the developing world.They established that customers could afford to buy drinks containing 10 per cent juice and no more. But the beverage failed in marketing tests because consumers said it “didn’t feel like a fruit drink”, says Joanna Lu, a Coke marketing director in Shanghai.Ms Lu says the company discovered that crucial to the “feel” of a fruit juice was its heavy weight on the tongue, compared to carbonated drinks. So developers added orange pulp to the mix to recreate the feel of 100 per cent juice. “Customers said it felt like fresh orange juice,” says Ms Lu.Launched in China in 2004, Minute Maid Pulpy, as the brand is called, proved an instant hit.Rivals followed suit, with PepsiCo, Coke’s big US rival, launching Tropicana Fresh Pulpy, and Wahaha, a leading local company producing Nutria Pulpy. But Coke says it retained its market lead, with Pulpy emerging as the number one juice brand in China.The company launched the product in India, Indonesia and Vietnam in 2007, and has followed up in a string of other Asian countries and in Mexico.Next on the list is eastern Europe and, possibly, Australia, which could be the first developed nation to see Pulpy on its shelves.Pulpy’s success helped persuade Coke to open a $90m research and development centre in Shanghai with 100 staff – Europeans and Americans working with colleagues from China and elsewhere in Asia.“We are committed to continuous innovation,” says Ms Lu.The newest variation of Pulpy is Minute Maid Pulpy Milk, a strawberry-flavoured milk drink launched last year in China and this year in Vietnam. “It is, globally, the first big scale added-value dairy product.”Paul French, chief representative of AccessAsia, a market research group, says it is no accident that Pulpy was developed in China. “The Chinese consumer is always in search of something new. The gloopiness [of this drink] appealed to the Chinese. They love this sort of thing.”In the second part of a series on innovation in emerging markets, FT writers look at three examples of multinationals developing products in an emerging economy and introducing them into other markets, including developed countries
481;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-12-20T01:43:45Z;PAI Partners to sell its stake in Yoplait;;The tussle for ownership of the French yoghurt maker Yoplait kicks off on Monday, when the 50 per cent stake in the company owned by PAI Partners, the private equity group, will formally be put up for sale.Suitors have been circling Yoplait for several months – in some cases even before the sellers had appointed bankers in September. The other partner in the ownership of Yoplait is Sodiaal, the French farmers’ co-operative.Last month, the two owners rejected a €1.4bn ($1.8bn) takeover bid for the whole of Yoplait from French private dairy company Lactalis. This month, France’s state-backed strategic investment fund indicated it could help bankroll a bid.There are also several international players in the wings. These include General Mills of the US, which owns the Yoplait franchise in North America, PepsiCo and Switzerland’s Nestlé.Two Chinese buyers are also understood to be interested: Bright Foods, which also looked at United Biscuits in the UK, and Mengniu Dairy, one of the country’s biggest milk producers.The French government, which famously declared yoghurt maker Danone a strategic asset in order to fend off a rumoured takeover bid by PepsiCo of the US in 2005, is keeping a close eye on the deal because farmers in France are a strong force politically. The government is keen not to see French influence in the company diluted and does not want to see farming interests weakened by a sale of PAI’s stake.Sodiaal has said it does not intend to sell its 50 per cent. When it made its approach, Lactalis had hoped to win the farmers’ group over by offering a share in the profits and management of the Yoplait franchise business, which accounts for 75 per cent of the brand’s total €4bn in sales.On top of this, a legal tussle with General Mills may deter buyers, analysts say, including the US food group itself. General Mills filed for arbitration after Sodima, the licensing arm of Sodiaal, said it planned to terminate the US group’s licensing agreement in 2012.“This could be a long process, whatever the French courts may think,” said one banker.However, the sellers are hoping for a speedier resolution to the sales process, with first bids in by the middle of next month and a deal stitched up by the end of March.
482;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-12-17T23:48:35Z;X Factor sponsorship deal for PepsiCo;;PepsiCo has clinched a lucrative sponsorship deal with the new US version of Simon Cowell’s hit show The X Factor, heralding a return of the cola wars that marked music and entertainment in the 1980s and 1990s to American television screens.Pepsi declined to comment but people familiar with the situation said the company had agreed a multi-year deal with the programme. The deal pits the brand against its arch-rival, Coca-Cola, which has enjoyed almost a decade of high-visibility product placement on Simon Fuller’s ratings-topping American Idol, the show that turned Mr Cowell into a star in the US.It is unclear how much Pepsi has agreed to pay for the product placement deal, although Coke pays as much as $35m a year to have its logo prominently displayed on American Idol.American Idol has become a mainstay of News Corporation’s Fox network but is jostling for sponsors with the new version of X Factor, which will launch on the same network in the autumn.The X Factor deal marks a significant increase in music and entertainment marketing for the Pepsi brand: it signed deals with some of the biggest stars of music in the 1980s, including Madonna and Michael Jackson, but more recently has shied away from big endorsements of particular stars.That will change when X Factor launches next year, an event that will be keenly followed by rival broadcasters and television networks – partly because of the show’s potential to emulate the success of Idol, which contributes $200m-$300m to News Corporation’s bottom line every year.The producers of Idol have shaken up the programme following Mr Cowell’s departure, bringing in new judges, including Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler. The producers have also struck a deal with Universal Music Group that will see Jimmy Iovine – the chairman of Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records, and the producer of albums by U2, Stevie Nicks and Patti Smith – “mentoring” finalists. UMG will also release albums recorded by Idol winners.X Factor is being backed by Sony and the company’s relationship with Mr Cowell. He enjoys a close relationship with Sir Howard Stringer, Sony’s chairman, and Sony Music will release albums recorded by X Factor winners, as it does with the show in the UK. The UK version of X Factor finished last week with the final programme in the series attracting an audience of almost 20m people.
483;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-12-17T11:22:56Z;Love sells – lessons from successful marketing;;When you love her, nothing else matters is a slogan that outsells major global cola brands.“There are only three markets in the world, where neither Pepsi, nor Coke are the best-selling cola drinks” said the chief executive officer of a major CEE producer at the beginning of his presentation in Vienna, where WU regularly organises a conference called “Growing East.”“Growing East means Grow Local” was the headline of the CEO’s presentation, which proved that important and authentic lessons from doing business in the emerging markets are best learned in the field and from managers doing business there.Vienna is well positioned for such a learning purpose, thanks to its proximity to the less saturated markets of the new eastern members of the EU, with a population of more than 90 million.When looking for challenging fast-growth opportunities, many MBAs might come across business hurdles in this region. The best ones to learn from are those who tackled these challenges best. That’s the case of the soft drink manufacturer that purchased an old, despised socialist product and revamped it into a flagship brand that drove its expansion into sales of almost E400m.Slovakia and the Czech Republic were presented as two of the three markets, where the best selling cola drink does not come from the two omnipresent leading global labels – the third is Canada. Is the story of the dwarf overcoming the giant just a fairy tale, or can it be a true business success story?To support his claim, the CEO showed how his market share had climbed from 16 per cent in 2002 to 29.4 per cent in 2009, overselling both global competitors. Was it the story of a superior product? Not really. The company had purchased both the brand and the recipe which was created 60 years ago – the drink based on herbal essences with a lower content of sugar, caffeine and phosphoric acid was created as communist replacement to the more widely known cola brands.However, the reality was less appealing than this description. The drink leaves a strong liquorish aftertaste, so after the fall of the Iron Curtain, when offered the choice, the population flocked en masse to the much-desired ubiquitous options.The brand was on the verge of extinction when it was purchased, together with a recipe that only five people in the company know (and even the CEO claims he does not know who they are).So how do you outsell the global giants? Out-spend them in advertising, might be the first thought of an eager MBA. But that’s not what this company did. Their media spending is usually a third of Coke’s.Besides, the product has strong aftertaste that polarises the population. The breakthrough in how to market it against mighty global competitors was shrewd: let’s turn the brand’s greatest weakness into its greatest strength.Whether you love it, or hate it, there are no conditions that influence the perception of taste. That’s why the company claimed “unconditional love” and the consistently applied slogan “When you love it, nothing else matters” emerged. It captured attention, made people talk about it and it gradually became a part of daily speech. Apart from consistent communication and local sympathy for a David fighting Goliath, the company also got ahead in terms of distribution and innovation.Although it might seem as a story difficult to imitate, the lessons of the presentation can be applied even beyond soft drinks. The CEO Jaroslav Bartak named them three Kofola rules:1. Focus on building strong brands from niches.2. Gain competitive edge through clever innovation.3. Be patient: be determined to think long-term, because “fast growth usually means even quicker decline”.
484;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-12-15T19:52:06Z;Weather puts squeeze on Florida oranges;Juice futures hit recent high over fears of hard freeze;The landscape along Florida’s State Highway 17 is magical: tens of thousands of orange trees line soft hills in groves punctuated by lakes. “This is the finest place in the whole world to grow juice oranges. It’s just perfect,” says Vic Story, a second-generation orange farmer here in the state’s midsection.But a couple of cold nights has demonstrated just how deceptive this picture-perfect landscape can be. Temperatures in Lake Wales, in Florida, plunged to 26 degrees Fahrenheit (-3 Celsius) overnight earlier this week. Fears that a hard freeze would damage this year’s Florida crop sent orange juice futures to a 3½-year high, above $1.70 a pound. Last week Charlie Crist, Florida governor, declared a state of emergency, saying the cold threatened a “major disaster”.Orange juice is a $20bn industry with prices affecting farmers in Florida and Brazil, processors, trading houses and bottlers such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.Now higher wholesale prices are poised to bite consumers. Coca-Cola, which owns the Minute Maid and Simply juice brands, said it was likely to increase prices next year by 4 to 8 per cent. “We are not immune to adverse impacts on our brands such as increasing commodity, fuel, packaging and fruit costs,” the company said.The price susceptibility comes after years of decline in Florida orange production through a combination of disease, encroachment by housing developers and lower demand. Florida is the world’s second-largest orange producer after São Paulo state in Brazil.After a severe freeze last January, Florida produced 134m boxes of oranges last season, down from estimates at the start of the harvest of 136m boxes. The final count was 18 per cent lower than in the prior year and the second smallest crop in two decades. A box weighs about 90lb.The US Department of Agriculture predicts that this season Florida will produce 143m boxes of oranges. The yield in Florida concentrated orange juice is expected to be 1.61 gallons per box.“Stocks are fairly low right now and so certainly if there is a weather problem this winter, it would be devastating. Brazil also saw a reduction from drought,” said Judy Ganes Chase of soft commodities analyst J Ganes Consulting in New York.Unlike some agricultural commodities that have rallied this year, however, orange juice has seen weak demand as consumers recoiled from rising prices and opted for a widening array of beverages. Orange-juice sales are down 10.5 per cent annually, according to the Florida Department of Citrus, while retail prices have risen 5.5 per cent.“Production is lower, but consumption is lower too. Some people see orange juice as a sort of luxury, not like bread and milk, and one has to provide basics first. Others just go for other [drink] options, to give them a try,” says Mr Story.The citrus department is set to begin an aggressive new marketing campaign to highlight the health benefits of Florida juice. “We are hoping that will help,” says Robert Norberg, a senior analyst at the department.The US is still the largest orange juice-consuming nation in the world. The Florida citrus industry accounts for 95 per cent of the nation’s orange juice production (and 40 per cent of the world’s supply). This represents a $9bn yearly influx into the country’s economy.So far, reports of damage to the crop this week have not been catastrophic. January frozen concentrated orange juice on Wednesday fell 2.1 per cent to $1.5620 a pound. The contract, launched in 1966, is the most thinly traded commodity on the New York’s ICE Futures US exchange, with a notional market value of less than $1bn.At his grove, Mr Story chews a fresh orange of the juicy Hamlin variety.“Look at this,” he says squeezing the orange, “these boys here in Florida are very juicy and tasty, like nowhere else.“Human beings have a natural instinct for the orange flavour. I hope consumers can think of that in the near future when thinking of going to the grocery store.”

We are bracing ourselves for it.”The US Department of Agriculture forecasts Florida orange production at 143m boxes this year, up 7 per cent from last season. A box weighs about 90lb.The market is also concerned about lower output in Brazil. Cutrale, the country’s leading orange juice producer, warned this year that Brazil’s citrus belt was set to harvest its lowest crop in seven years, driving prices higher.Elsewhere in commodities, copper reached a new record high as traders saw little to prevent the metal’s march higher after the weekend brought no rise in interest rates in China, the world’s largest consumer of the metal. Copper for delivery in three months’ time rose 2.4 per cent to a fresh all-time high of $9,235.25 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange.Oil prices jumped in the first full day of trading after the Opec oil cartel maintained its output quotas at the weekend.ICE January Brent rose 71 cents to $91.19 a barrel, having touched an intraday high of $92.30 a barrel, near to its highest level in 26 months.Nymex January West Texas Intermediate rose 82 cents to $88.61 a barrel.At Opec’s meeting in Quito, Ecuador, oil ministers highlighted risks to the world economy even as they left quotas unchanged.Ali Naimi, Saudi oil minister, said that he preferred prices between $70-$80 a barrel but emphasised that the market was “in balance”.With prices significantly higher than that range, Lawrence Eagles, head of global oil research at JPMorgan, said the market was focusing on Opec’s “lack of desire to add more oil to quash higher prices”.The cartel’s next meeting is scheduled for June, a departure from the traditional gathering in March.
486;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Obama to reset relations with business;;President Barack Obama will sit down with top chief executives on Wednesday for a full day of talks, in his first significant meeting with big business since admitting he had painted corporate America as “the bad guy” too often during his first two years in office.The meeting is expected to include some friendly faces, such as the chief executives of Google, American Express and PepsiCo. Leaders of IBM and Dow Chemicalhave also been invited.Indra Nooyi of Pepsico said of the meeting: “The president is engaged with business leaders, showing openness, which is fantastic. We will discuss all of the issues, getting jobs back, making America more competitive, bringing manufacturing back.”Business groups have had reason to be cheerful since Mr Obama’s “shellacking” in the November 2 Congressional elections, which handed Republicans control of the House of Representatives and reduced the size of the Democrats’ Senate majority.This month the White House announced a deal on revisions to a free-trade agreement with South Korea that could pave the way for Congressional approval. It agreed a compromise with Republicans to extend Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy and for rich estates, for which big business lobby groups argued.Mr Obama has also signalled that he is seeking to address long-term fiscal concerns by starting a “conversation” about the US tax code that could lower overall rates while closing tax loopholes that favour certain industries.Other less high-profile “wins” include a significant watering down of proposed broadband regulations at the Federal Communications Commission and a decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to stall issuance of new smog and toxic emission regulations until April 2012. The delay was praised by the oil industry.Bruce Josten, the chief congressional lobbyist for the US Chamber of Commerce, which has accused the White House of supporting a “job-killing” agenda, says he is “encouraged” by the developments. But he can still rattle off a list of areas he is seeking to address. They include more free trade deals, the repeal of a tax change in the healthcare law that companies have complained would flood them with paperwork, and immigration reform.Some business lobbyists, who do not wish to be named, say their gripes with the White House have less to do with actual policies and more to do with the perception that the administration had taken an antagonistic approach to business from day one. They cite new ethics rules, which were designed to cut business lobbyists off from the White House and presidential advisory panels, thereby eliminating an important avenue of communication. Many also complain about the lack of real-life business experience in the White House and the president’s cabinet.One lobbyist points to an example following passage of the landmark healthcare bill. Democratic lawmakers pounced after some companies – including Verizon and AT&T – announced that their earnings would be hit by the new law.Valerie Jarrett, the White House’s chief business envoy, insisted the charges were “nothing compared with the enormous financial benefits” of the bill. For the lobbyist, the incident demonstrates that the White House is “tone deaf” on accounting issues that companies face every day.One aide on Capitol Hill says the administration’s tough rhetoric has made it appear less business friendly than it actually is.In the past, the White House has argued that business is not grateful enough for the measures it took to rescue the economy, including the $800bn stimulus package and steps to shore up the financial sector. Democrats lost this year’s congressional elections in part because of populist anger over those measures.At a time when Mr Obama appears to be more vulnerable than ever, business may see more opportunities to influence the agenda, particularly in the rollback of environmental and other regulations. Any retreat by Mr Obama could help him curry favour with business ahead of the 2012 presidential election, but will create another political dilemma: how to convince Democrats on Capitol Hill to agree.
487;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-12-13T18:42:02Z;Walmart to close Moscow office;;Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales and profits, is closing an office in Moscow that it opened last year to pursue acquisitions in Russia.The move, announced on Monday, comes a week after X5, Russia’s biggest food retailer by sales, said it had struck a $1.65bn deal to acquire Kopeika, a rival that operates about 700 discount stores and was a potential partner for the US retailer.Walmart said it had been looking to expand in Russia through an acquisition rather than by starting its own retail chain. It said it was closing its representative office in Moscow because it had no potential partners in view in the near term.Doug McMillon, head of Walmart’s international business, said he believed that the Russian market remained “a compelling retail opportunity” and that Walmart would continue “to pursue market entry opportunities”.Some international retailers who have sought to enter the Russian market on their own have faced challenges. Carrefour, Walmart’s French rival, withdrew from Russia last year after opening just two of its large-format hypermarkets.Sweden’s Ikea, with 12 shopping centres in Russia, has complained of pervasive corruption and dismissed two senior managers this year for allowing a supplier to pay bribes to secure power for a shopping centre in St Petersburg. Germany’s Metro and France’s Auchan, both early entrants to the Russian market at the start of the decade, have about 45 stores each.Walmart continues to pursue an aggressive programme of overseas expansion, both through store openings in the 14 countries in which it already has a presence and in new markets. In November it announced a $2.3bn bid for Massmart, a South African retailer, following a $1.13bn deal in May to buy 193 small supermarkets in the UK from Denmark’s Netto.Its growth in existing markets has been focused this year on Brazil, China and Mexico, while it is also expanding a small chain of cash-and-carry warehouses in India.Mr McMillon said the retailer remained “excited about our international business, including markets where we already operate such as Brazil, China and India, where we have tremendous growth opportunity”. Russia’s developing consumer market has continued to attract attention from US retailers and consumer companies, with PepsiCo, the soft drink and snack company, announcing a $3.8bn deal last week for Wimm-Bill-Dann, the largest Russian dairy company.Russia has also attracted speciality fashion retailers, with Gap and Sweden’s H&M opening stores over the past two years. Their rival Zara, which opened its first Russian shop in 2003, now has more than 135 stores in the country.

489;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-12-07T17:27:12Z;Profits rise as emerging markets hit the bottle;;For an industry that prides itself on creativity and innovation, consumer goods’ companies are attracting attention for a rather more prosaic part of their portfolios: water.Bottled water was one of the star performers in food and drink groups’ latest quarterly earnings. It has also piqued the interest of would-be buyers: Japanese brewers, looking to expand beyond their declining home market, have been sniffing around the world’s largest bottled water business owned by France’s Danone.Danone, with its main Evian brand, and its biggest rival, Switzerland’s Nestlé, increased quarterly sales of water by 8.7 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively, in the third quarter, outpacing their overall group growth by two percentage points. Coca Cola, the third-biggest supplier of bottled water with brands such as Dasani and BonAqua, does not break out segment sales but flagged water sales as one of its drivers of growth.The latest data appear at odds with conventional wisdom that cash-strapped consumers would forgo expensive bottled water and turn on the tap instead. For Nestlé, with brands such as Pure Life and Aquarel, the latest sales numbers mark a sharp turnround after reporting an underlying fall in sales in 2009 and 2008.While an unusually hot summer in parts of Europe and Japan helped lift demand, and sales in the US bounced back after being depressed by the cool summer of 2009, producers point to more fundamental changes. Chief of these is emerging markets growth, which is running at 20 per cent year-on-year at Nestlé.Analysts concur. “On a long-term basis, bottled water will continue to grow, and most growth will be driven by emerging markets,” says Rick Haffner, head of global beverage research at Euromonitor.He estimates that long-term emerging market growth, driven by rising incomes and a desire for clean drinking water, should run at 5 to 7 per cent per annum in volume terms, compared with a meagre 1 per cent in the developed world. In the past five years, emerging markets growth has been running at roughly double the developed world’s 4 to 5 per cent.Developed markets are managing to maintain modest levels of volume growth because of the trend towards healthier lifestyles, which is depressing sales of fizzy drinks and pushing more people over to water.Nestlé, the market leader in the US, sees big potential from this trend in the carbonated drinks-guzzling North American market: while most of the world turns to bottled water to slake their thirsts, Americans still drink 1.7 litres of fizzy beverages for every litre of bottled water. Some analysts back Nestlé’s view that a resurgence in water sales is not a flash in the pan caused by hot weather. They also predict the value of sales in the developed world will climb through innovation.For now, however, the pricing trend is in the opposite direction. John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, says that while the volume of bottled water sold in the US increased by 10 per cent in the first nine months of 2010, “prices have dropped significantly”. At this point, Nestlé and private label brands account for most of the volume growth in the US, as Coke and PepsiCo are content to focus on higher margin sales through convenience stores and vending machines.Nestlé has increased its market leadership in the US to a 36 per cent share in the first nine months of the year, according to Beverage Digest, while Pepsi saw its share fall to 10.7 per cent and Coke’s Dasani dropped to 7.2 per cent. “Coke and Pepsi are losing share in part because they’re voluntarily walking away from that business” says Gerry Khermouch of Beverage Business Insights. “They’re not going to play in the lowest price case segment, where they sell their product for $2.99 a case.”The focus on pricing will see the North American market recover but it will lag far behind emerging markets. Euromonitor is projecting the North American market will grow 13 per cent in value terms, on a constant currency basis, to 2014, compared with 85 per cent for Latin America.While the outlook for bottled water sales globally might have brightened, the economics stack up slightly less favourably. Water because of its bulk and weight is a highly localised business. Local supply is key – more than 90 per cent of Nestlé and Danone’s sales are local and margin restraints put some markets out of bounds.Nestlé does not sell in India, for example, where the quality of tap water is poor but prices are too low. However, it does in the Middle East where high prices enable it to recoup extra costs in rain-free areas.However, the localised nature depresses profitability compared with other products. Danone’s water operating margins last year came in at 12.5 per cent against 15.3 per cent at group level. Nestlé’s waters have margins at the earnings before interest and tax level of 8.4 per cent, less than half the group’s 18.6 per cent.Still there are some economies of scale. Top-line growth in emerging markets – from its existing production and distribution network – helped Nestlé lift margins by 10 basis points in the first half. “The more they grow in emerging markets, the more they grow the margins,” says Andrew Wood, analyst at Bernstein Research.For developed markets, analysts say, the answer to growth is innovation. “It is not so much the mainstream still water driving growth, but more of the niche areas in functional bottled water, like sports waters or those with various additives for health benefits,” says Mr Haffner. Either way, it appears the business case behind bottling one of the most abundant substances on earth remains strong.
490;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-12-07T17:03:36Z;Gender pay gap endures as women climb the ranks;;Recent headlines across the Atlantic scream about a pay gap between men and women.In the US, women in managerial or executive positions make 81 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position, says the Government Accountability Office. According to the UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission, British women earn on average 28 per cent less than men.In the rarefied company of the world’s top 50 businesswomen – as ranked by the FT – any quirks in pay based on gender would be harder to get away with, not least because companies must report top executives’ earnings.Kraft, the US food group, declared compensation of $26.3m in 2009 for Irene Rosenfeld, its chief executive, up from $18.7m in 2008.The package paid to Ms Rosenfeld – who is at number four in the FT ranking – included a hefty reward for the successful takeover of Cadbury, the British chocolate maker. It was far richer than the $18.8m awarded to Muhtar Kent, the male chief executive of Coca-Cola, who in turn made more than the $15.8m paid to PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, who came top of the FT ranking.Higher average take-home pay for male chief executives appears to stem from the scarcity of female company heads, women’s relatively recent arrival at the top and the kind of companies they run, concludes a recent US survey.Data from 3,000 companies showed that while women at the median earned $40,000 more in base salary than men, the average male discretionary bonus in 2008 was more than 3.5 times larger than a woman’s.However, the Corporate Library, the governance and compensation research group that carried out the study, also found that “an examination of compensation policy at companies run by the 10 most highly compensated women chief executives suggests that certain features of poor compensation governance – including large discretionary bonuses and generous perquisite allocations – may be less prevalent at companies with female chief ­executives”.That would reinforce anecdotal evidence that more typically feminine behaviour can impede women’s progress – until they reach the top, when they not only get paid more but can also influence company policy.“For women, success is often about feeling fulfilled and being in control of their lives, so if they are asked to rank what is important, I suspect they would not put pay as high up the list as men,” says Kathryn Britten, a senior British accountant whose pay lagged behind that of her male peers for much of her career after she took six years off to look after her small children. “The downside [of such apparent indifference] is that it hurts as much if you discover you are not being paid as much as somebody doing the same job but not doing as well as you.”Ms Britten, who was headhunted by KPMG, one of the world’s largest accounting firms, to chair its UK forensic business, points to “an unconscious bias” that may sound familiar to other professional women. “‘She’s working, but so is her husband’ – I’ve been taken aback by suggestions that I’m there for fun and pay does not matter,” she says.Elisabeth Kelan, an academic at King’s College London, agrees: “The research shows that while most differences [in the pay of men and women] can be accounted for, there is an element that cannot be explained, which means you cannot rule out discrimination.”Having just watched the UK government retreat from plans to make companies publish data about differences in the pay of male and female staff, Ms Britten argues that it is in the interests of businesses to get this right. Otherwise “they are at risk of losing people they value if they don’t show them they are valued”, she says.

Moscow-based steelmaker NLMK gained 10.3 per cent to Rbs129 in afternoon trading while MMK was up 7.4 per cent to Rbs33.30Russia’s RTS index rose 1.1 per cent to 1,683.28, a two-year high. “The successful World Cup bid boosted Russian stocks, particularly ones related to the construction sector,” said Kingsmill Bond, strategist at Troika Dialog.Sentiment in Russia was also lifted after US food and drink maker PepsiCo revealed on Thursday that it was planning to buy a controlling stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann, the Russian juice and dairy company. Shares in Wimm-Bill-Dann jumped 21.4 per cent to Rbs119 in afternoon trading.Outside Russia, wider European indices were higher in early trading, still upbeat following news on Thursday that the European Central Bank had stepped up its intervention in the bond market.But non-farm payroll figures from the US released in the afternoon showed that many fewer jobs than expected had been created in November, suggesting the US economy might not be recovering as quickly as had been hoped.“The US payroll data certainly took the shine off what would have been a strong end to the week,” said Will Hedden, sales trader at IG Index. Some building materials stocks fell on the fear that the US economy was not recovering as quickly as hoped. Frankfurt-listed HeidelbergCement was the biggest loser on the Xetra Dax index, falling 2.9 per cent to €44.33.Overall, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,103.97 but gained 1.6 per cent on the week.The week began with sharp falls across the region as investors were left unimpressed by news that the European Union had agreed a bail-out package with Ireland. Peripheral bond yields rose sharply on Monday and Tuesday, hurting financial stocks particularly.The sell-off halted abruptly on Wednesday after European Central Bank hints of action to tackle the unfolding crisis. When the ECB stepped up its buying of Irish and Portuguese debt on Thursday, financial stocks jumped as bond yields came down.Financial stocks made strong gains overall in a volatile week. In Spain BBVA rose 6 per cent to €8.01 in the week while Santander was up 11.1 per cent to €8.36. France’s BNP Paribas rose 2.3 per cent over the week to €49.10 while Société Générale was up 2.7 per cent to €39.30.
492;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-12-02T22:52:18Z;Russia at the top of PepsiCo’s table;;PepsiCo has put its money where its mouth is. Just months after unveiling a drive into the field of nutritional food and drink– and many more years of chatter about emerging markets – the US beverages group looks set to pull off a $5.4bn deal that gives it both.The acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann, the largest food and beverage company in Russia by sales, takes PepsiCo closer to the goal of Indra Nooyi, chief executive, of expanding revenues from the company’s nutritional offerings from $10bn this year to $30bn by 2020.At the same time the deal, which is scheduled to close by the end of June 2011, would vault Russia ahead of Mexico as PepsiCo’s top international market, and far ahead of India and China.Consumer goods companies, virtually all of whom have teams of bankers scanning the so-called Bric countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China for potential deals – as well as smaller emerging markets – are looking on with some envy.The move would see PepsiCo leapfrog rival Coca-Cola in Russia. According to estimates from Sanford Bernstein, the research group, the US duo now dominate the Russian juice market with PepsiCo controlling more than half and Coca Cola 35 per cent.This partly reflects an undervalued market and a relatively straightforward takeover process, bankers say. As Ms Nooyi said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday: “The Russian government is very welcoming of foreign investments.”Compare this with other Bric markets. Assets in India, for example, are hotly contested by both international and local consumer goods players.Bankers point out that local buyers, whose own stock is trading at about 25 times earnings, can far more easily justify paying 30 times earnings for an asset than a European or US company whose stock trades about 10 times earnings.China has other issues. As one banker points out: “If you’ve got so much growth to come and are a young entrepreneur, why sell out [your business] to some foreigner now?”Regulatory hurdles are also high in the country, as Coca-Cola discovered when it tried to buy China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited, a Hong Kong listed company which owns the Huiyuan juice business throughout China, in 2008. That $2.4bn deal was blocked by antitrust regulators.Few have dared test the waters since. UK drinks group Diageo is awaiting approval in a bid to take control of Shui Jing Fang, a nationally known spirit brand.However, some analysts in Russia raise the possibility that PepsiCo’s 50 per cent plus share of the juice market could raise antitrust concerns.And, while stressing that Russia is still an attractive market for the consumer goods industry as a whole, Stephen Powers, analyst at Bernstein, notes that Russian assets lack some of the lustre of those in other emerging markets.“The Russian market is fundamentally less attractive than other Bric markets. There are different demographic trends (more ageing) that are arguably less promising, more economic volatility and, for a dollar-based company [such as Pepsi], more currency risk.”There are also geopolitical risks.Still, per capita incomes in Russia far exceed those in China and India. More-over, PepsiCo’s existing operations in Russia mean it is building economies of scale and will be better able to extract synergies from a purchase of Wimm-Bill-Dann. It expects total pre-tax annual synergies from the deal of about $100m by 2014.Mr Powers says the deal is “not inexpensive but certainly not unreasonable” at 16.3 times Pepsi’s 2010 ebitda. He says it is in line with what Coca-Cola paid for Nidan, the Russian drinks company it bought this year, and little more than PepsiCo’s then joint venture paid for Lebedyansky, a leading Russian juice company, two years ago.The deal will require approval from Russian authorities, but management expressed confidence it will be passed.Ms Nooyi can be sure other fast-moving consumer goods companies will be watching as they strive to stitch together their own plans to win emerging market consumers.
493;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-12-02T19:15:14Z;Pepsi;Food and beverage group hopes to milk Russian consumers;To Russia with love. Aside from news that a football tournament will be played there in 2018, PepsiCo announced on Thursday that it plans to stump up $5.4bn for Russian dairy and juicemaker Wimm-Bill-Dann, making Pepsi the largest food and beverage manufacturer in the country.Named Wimm-Bill-Dann to offer a touch of western glamour to post-Soviet consumers, Pepsi desires it as a head start on tripling sales in the the “nutrition” business – mostly oats, juice and sports drinks to $30bn by 2020. Investors though might ask at what cost this aim is to be achieved.Pepsi is buying a two-thirds stake now and will tender for the remainder once regulators approve – not guaranteed as the combined entity will control half the Russian fruit juice market. A valuation of $5.4bn for WBD, including net debt, is double the valuation at which competitor Danone sold its 18 per cent stake for in August, as it shifted to an alliance with OAO Unimilk. Admittedly that number was set by a formula agreed years in advance.Still a valuation approaching 16 times this year’s forecast for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation is full for an emerging market food business. Growth has typically been fast, with the Russian dairy market expanding by 22 per cent annually since 2006, according to Pepsi. Dairy consumption per head is also half that of developed markets, indicating plenty of room for expansion. But Russian food manufacturing is cyclical, with sales falling in 2009 due to the effects of recession. Operating margins for WBD, meanwhile, have been in the single-digits for the past decade.For Pepsi, which has a market capitalisation of $103bn, this counts as a small fill-in purchase. Yet investors should discourage a diet of richly priced food.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
494;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;PepsiCo to buy Russia’s Wimm-Bill-Dann;;PepsiCo is making a $5.4bn bet on the Russian food and drinks market with a planned acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann, the dairy and fruit juice company, in what could be the biggest foreign acquisition of a Russian company.The US food group is initially acquiring 66 per cent of Wimm-Bill-Dann’s stock from the company’s main shareholders and treasury stock for $3.8bn.It would make PepsiCo the largest food and drink business in Russia, and increase its presence in other eastern European markets and Central Asia.The deal ticks off several attributes sought by international consumer goods groups, including exposure to emerging markets and more nutritional products.It also takes PepsiCo into the dairy segment, which makes up 70 per cent of Wimm-Bill-Dann’s sales.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chairman and chief executive, said: “Dairy has a huge, untapped potential to bridge snacks and beverages. We see the emerging opportunity to ‘snackify’ beverages and ‘drinkify’ snacks as the next frontier in food and beverage convenience”. Subject to regulatory approval for the initial stake, PepsiCo will make a public offer to remaining shareholders. Priced at the same level as its initial two-thirds stake, that would value Wimm-Bill-Dann’s total equity at $5.8bn. Since Wimm-Bill-Dann has $400m net cash on its balance sheet, the enterprise value would be $5.4bn.The Wimm-Bill-Dann purchase shows multinationals are still prepared to make big acquisitions in Russia, in spite of a sharp fall in foreign direct investment, as the country’s economy contracted almost 8 per cent last year.Pepsi said the acquisition was part of its strategic plan to build a $30bn nutrition business by 2020.It follows a shift of focus away from carbonated soft drinks towards juices, teas and sports drinks, as well as healthy foods.Wimm-Bill-Dann said PepsiCo would market products from its plants in Asia and Europe, including both fruit juice concentrates and some products – such as chocolate-coated Russian cream cheese – until now known only in Russia.PepsiCo is paying $33 per ADR share, equivalent to $132 per ordinary Russian share, for its initial stake – a 32 per cent premium over the 30-day average trading price of Wimm-Bill-Dann’s ADR shares.It is paying an enterprise value of 12.6 times 2011 forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.That compares with its own EV/ebitda multiple of below 10 times and is also a 15-30 per cent premium to where food groups Nestlé and Danone are trading.PepsiCo expects the deal to produce annual pre-tax synergies of $100m by 2014, and to enhance earnings moderately in its first year.Additional reporting by Haig Simonian in Zurich
495;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-12-01T09:02:27Z;Mergers and acquisitions: the new dealmakers;;Most US merger agreements look the same – at least to the untrained eye. The same dour language outlines similar issues in broadly the same way. One mergers and acquisitions specialist says that even after the near-collapse of the financial system, dealmaking seems to have gone back to marking up the same documents that were used at the height of the credit boom.Legal innovation in this area, then, can be hard to pinpoint. Moreover, for a profession that concerns itself with how to get a deal done within the limits of the rules, reinventing those boundaries seems counterintuitive. “Innovation is really about doing things structurally that either haven’t been done before or have been used in other contexts to ensure a deal is going to close,” says Frank Aquila, a partner and M&A specialist at Sullivan & Cromwell. “Those situations don’t come along all that often.”Moments such as the first use of a reverse break-fee – paid to a target if a buyer backs out of a deal – or the invention of the poison pill may be rare, but dealmakers agree that the financial crisis has helped trigger greater creative thinking among M&A lawyers.“Thinking about innovation in the legal profession is slightly antithetical to the way the law has traditionally evolved through case law and precedent,” says Brian Duwe, M&A partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. “But especially with the challenges we have faced in the past few years, precedents do not always work when the circumstances change dramatically, and you have to be willing to think outside the box.”The fallout from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 created a challenging backdrop for all deals. According to Dealogic, the investment banking analyst, M&A volumes slumped 27 per cent in 2009 from the year before as funding for deals dried up, so M&A lawyers also had to find innovative ways to raise funds for beleaguered institutions.“What was scary about the financial crisis was that you had to invent things on the fly,” says George Bason, global head of Davis Polk & Wardwell’s M&A practice. “There were situations that just hadn’t been seen before.”In the $16bn sale by AIG of Alico, its foreign life insurance unit, to financial services provider MetLife, a team of Dewey & LeBoeuf lawyers had to unpick Alico’s business – spread across more than 50 countries – from its parent as the US insurer battled to raise funds.The crisis also complicated the work of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison for Citigroup, the financial conglomerate, in Japan – first buying and then selling Nikko Cordial, the Japanese brokerage. The purchase – which was the first to employ a newly adopted statute allowing the use of foreign company shares to buy a Japanese company – had to be renegotiated as Citigroup’s share price tumbled. Only months later, the bank was battling massive writedowns in its loan portfolio and had to raise capital. When a share offering of the business proved impossible, the law firm instead co-ordinated three separate sale processes and structured “drag along” rights that would ensure Citigroup’s sale could go through without restrictions from its co-investors.The need to deal with multiple legal systems, regulators and jurisdictions add complexity to a transaction. Managing and negotiating several processes simultaneously can also give rise to innovation simply by virtue of making a deal incredibly complex.“A multi-jurisdictional, multidisciplined deal requires innovative thinking simply to get the transaction done,” says Matthew Herman, head of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer’s US corporate practice. “The acquisition by K+S [the German salt and fertiliser producer] of Morton Salt required creating and implementing a complex structure, coordinating the sale of a business before closing for antitrust reasons and securing financing in the immediate wake of the 2008 crisis.”Mr Bason agrees, pointing to his firm’s role in helping PepsiCo acquire two bottling companies – thought to be the first time a company has bought two public companies in two deals on the same day. “It is unquestionably true that a lawyer’s job in a going-private transaction is very complex, and there is a lot of choreography that is important to get right,” he says.The international flavour of the most innovative lawyering – such as Simpson Thacher & Bartlett’s work to bring a wealthy Russian investor to help fund a new arena and development for the New Jersey Nets, the US basketball team – looks set to continue. Cross-border M&A is already up by more than 50 per cent this year on 2009, with emerging markets playing an ever-increasing role. And with year-to-date activity sluggish amid continued economic fears and a cautious approach to dramatic transactions, lawyers are finding new ways to protect their clients’ interests and get deals over the finish line – whether by speeding up private equity buy-outs or by developing structures to bridge the valuation gulf between sellers and buyers.“The distinction between good lawyering and just lawyering is that each deal has its own set of personalities and issues,” says Morton Pierce, co-chairman of M&A practice at Dewey & LeBoeuf. “You need innovative thinking that asks, ‘How can I get this done, notwithstanding these issues?’”“Innovative lawyers are the ones who can recognise and adapt to new ways of doing business,” says Mr Bason. “When working with them, you can be arguing vociferously, but you are arguing about the right things.”Alas, some innovation may be destined never to see the light of day. “It is ironic that some of the biggest successes are those that remain behind closed doors,” says one prominent dealmaker, pointing to furious wrangling over closing conditions or tax-saving wheezes.Merger agreements may seem formulaic, but dealmaking can be a messy business.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking.

Lactalis has presented its bid as the best way to ensure that Yoplait stays in French hands.Yoghurt has sometimes been described as a “strategic sector” in France after the government raced to fend off a rumoured bid by PepsiCo of the US for Yoplait’s bigger rival Danone in 2005.Lactalis had hoped to gain an advantage over rivals by making its offer for Yoplait – the world’s second-biggest yoghurt brand by sales – some two weeks before a formal tender process for PAI’s 50 per cent stake is launched next month.Other companies reported to have shown interest include General Mills of the US, which owns the Yoplait franchise in North America, Bright Food of China and Nestlé of Switzerland.Sodiaal wants to keep its 50 per cent in the vehicle that owns the Yoplait brand and controls its franchise business, which accounts for 75 per cent of the brand’s total €4bn ($5.4bn) in sales.The farmers’ co-operative is prepared to see its 50 per cent stake diluted in the vehicle that controls the operations of Yoplait but it intends to keep a significant minority stake.“Trying to break down the door is not really the best way to build a long-term partnership,” said a person familiar with the situation.The fight to win control of Yoplait promises to be fierce and the government is likely to take a close interest in its fate. France is the world’s third-biggest exporter of agricultural and food products and public opinion is highly sensitive to the fate of its agri-food industry. Apart from Lactalis, all other bidders are based outside France.Lactalis management hopes this will encourage the government to look favourably on its bid, after voicing its concern over the group’s attempt this year to buy Emmental cheesemaker Entremont, eventually acquired by Sodiaal. The government had been concerned about strengthening Lactalis’s hold on the dairy industry, with many farmers fearing they could lose milk supply contracts.A person familiar with the situation said PAI and Sodiaal were convinced that if the farmers’ co-operative kept most of its stake in the company it would be enough to convince the government to allow a foreign bidder to win the auction.Lactalis is the world’s third-biggest dairy group, with the high-volume brands President and Galbani in its portfolio.
498;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-11-17T15:00:15Z;Lactalis bids €1.3bn for yoghurt group Yoplait;;The battle for one of the world’s best known yoghurt brands has been launched in earnest after French private dairy company Lactalis tabled a bid of €1.3bn ($1.8bn) for Yoplait.Lactalis hopes to gain an advantage over rivals by making its offer for all of the world’s second-biggest yoghurt brand by sales some two weeks before a formal tender process for a 50 per cent stake is launched next month by the company’s owners.Others rumoured to be interested include General Mills of the US, which has the Yoplait franchise in North America, Bright Food of China and Nestlé of Switzerland.Yoplait is jointly owned by French private equity group PAI Partners, which recently said it wanted to sell its stake, and the farmers’ co-operative Sodiaal. Though the farmers group has said it does not intend to sell its 50 per cent, Lactalis is hoping to win Sodiaal over by offering it a share in the profits and management of the Yoplait franchise business – which accounts for 75 per cent of the brand’s total €4bn ($5.4bn) in sales.“Lactalis has always developed the companies it has bought and we have a long tradition of investing in and developing external growth,” the group said.However the farmers’ cooperative is unlikely to be convinced at this price, according to a person close to Sodiaal. “Lactalis is trying to rally support from all the French establishment, but it didn’t work. The price is too low and we’ll probably shove them off and start the (tender) process,” said the person.The fight to win control of Yoplait promises to be fierce and the government is likely to take a close interest in its fate. Yoghurt has sometimes been described as a “strategic sector” in France after the government raced to fend off a rumoured bid by PepsiCo of the US for Yoplait’s bigger rival Danone in 2005. France is the world’s third-biggest exporter of agricultural and food products and public opinion is highly sensitive to the fate of its agri-food industry.The Lactalis bid would have the advantage of keeping the Yoplait brand under French control, said one person close to the subject, while all the other interested parties are foreign. Lactalis “is a 100 per cent French project,” he said.Lactalis management is hoping this will encourage the government to look favourably on its bid, after voicing its concern over the group’s attempt this year to buy Emmental cheesemaker Entremont, eventually acquired by Sodiaal. The government had been concerned about strengthening Lactalis’s hold on the struggling dairy industry, with many farmers fearing they could lose milk supply contracts to Lactalis’s existing suppliers.Lactalis is the world’s third-biggest dairy group, with the high volume brands President and Galbani in its portfolio.
499;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-11-16T20:48:21Z;Lagarde embraces quotas at FT conference;;Christine Lagarde, France’s finance minister, says she has changed her mind and now welcomes quotas for women on company boards after a vote in the French Senate last month.“There was one bill that was just voted [on] about which I had trepidation and doubts,” Ms Lagarde said in a keynote address to the FT’s Women at the Top conference in London on Tuesday. The legislation goes to a final vote in January.Referring to a draft law requiring women in five years’ time to occupy 40 per cent of the seats of “any [French] company’s board”, she said: “I have now changed my mind about quotas . . . however offensive” they may seem to their detractors. Much of the debate at the conference – which unveiled the FT’s second annual global ranking of the top 50 women in business – was devoted to whether other countries should follow the quota example set by Norway, Spain and France, to increase the chronically low representation of women in boardrooms.In a video interview with FT.com, Ms Lagarde said that with the exception of Nordic companies, the percentage of women on boards worldwide was “way below the regular percentage that it should be”. She said it was important for change to be mandated from the top, as President Nicolas Sarkozy had done by demanding that half the candidates for the Legion d’Honneur be women.Ms Lagarde cited Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader released from house arrest at the weekend, as a model of feminine values that would help improve companies’ performance. These values included persistence and an ability to reach out to others – including the generals who had jailed her.The largest contingent in the FT ranking is made up of 19 female chief executives from North America, unchanged from 2009. Otherwise, big developed economies are under-represented, with only one female chief executive each from Japan, Italy, France and Germany, and four from the UK.By contrast, emerging nations are the fastest-growing group by nationality. Güler Sabanci, chairwoman of Turkey’s Sabanci Holding, is the new number three in the list. Indra Nooyi, the Indian chief executive of PepsiCo, who is ranked number one for the second year in a row, leads a group of six female Indian chief executives, equal to the number of Chinese women on the 2010 ranking. In all, 17 nationalities are represented.Candidates for the list are judged by a jury of top international business executives. At a dinner following the conference, Zaha Hadid, the Iraqi-born architect, was honoured for her work with the first FT Women at the Top Recognition of Excellence award.Cherie Blair, wife of Tony Blair and an eminent lawyer in her own right, was the keynote speaker at the dinner. ”Looking around this room, it might be easy to lull ourselves into thinking the fight for gender equality in business and our societies is, if not over, at least close to victory,” she said. “We would, of course, be kidding ourselves. There is no country in the world – and that includes the relative utopias of Scandinavia – where women have gained equality.”
500;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-11-16T20:48:20Z;1. Indra Nooyi;;"This profile is part of the FT’s 2010 Women at the Top ranking of 50 prominent businesswomen around the world.1. Indra Nooyi, 55Nationality: IndianCompany: PepsiCoSector: Food and beveragesLocation: USThree-year TSR: 2.1%Indra Nooyi is one of the most fêted corporate leaders in the world, never far from the top of any ranking of powerful women. She has been chief executive of PepsiCo since 2006, but has effectively been helping to drive its strategy since 2001, when she became president and chief financial officer for the group.Born in Chennai, Nooyi took an MBA at the Indian Institute of Management in Kolkata, and worked for two years for Johnson & Johnson in Mumbai, before crossing the Atlantic.“All I had was $500 and a scholarship from Yale,” she recalls. “I had the immigrant feeling, arriving in the US in 1978: I had to do an extra-good job – if it didn’t work out, where was I going to go?” Every day, Nooyi says, she asks herself: “Did I earn the right to be CEO of this company today?”Her paternal grandfather had a “huge” impact on her, she says, instilling two fundamental ideas: “First, if you are given a job to do, do it really well. You must consistently ask yourself, ‘Have I done it to the best of my ability?’“Second, he taught me to be a lifelong student. Don’t ever think you’ve arrived, and remember that what you don’t know is so much more than what you do.”After completing her masters in public and private management at Yale, Nooyi joined Boston Consulting Group.She was there for six years before joining Motorola, working as vice-president and director of corporate strategy and planning. She then spent four years with Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish electricity company, before joining Pepsi.The story goes that at the time, General Electric was also keen to attract Nooyi and that Roger Enrico, chief executive of Pepsi, told her that GE’s Jack Welch was the greatest chief executivein the world, but that PepsiCo really needed her. It was a watershed decision.Nooyi arrived at the soft drinks and snacks giant in 1994. Working with Enrico, “we drew a map of what PepsiCo should look like in 10 years’ time. We spun off our bottling companies,” she explains – a decision she has just reversed.“You have to be willing to change direction,” she says. “Now it makes sense to buy back our bottlers. We are working to the next blueprint, and that, too, will change.”Nooyi anticipated the shift towards healthier eating and started to position the brand accordingly. Contributing to the strategy that saw Pepsi buy Tropicana in 1998 and then Quaker Oats (for $13bn) in 2000, she has also spearheaded the market growth of Gatorade, Pepsi’s sports drink.The company has reduced sodium in Lay’s crisps (branded Walkers in the UK) by 25 per cent. Now “there’s less salt in a bag of Lay’s than a slice of bread”, she says.Nooyi has organised the Pepsi product portfolio into three sub-brands: fun for you (Pepsi, Doritos); better for you (Diet Pepsi, baked crisps); and good for you (Tropicana, Naked, Quaker Oats). “Lifestyles have changed and we have to modify our products,” she says. Nooyi adds that by 2011, Lay’s crisps will be made from 100 per cent natural ingredients. The company is also concerned with sustainable farming methods, looking, for example, to reduce the water used in growing potatoes.Reporting solid, improved results for the third quarter, Nooyi also announced a new unit responsible for developing innovative nutrition products using fruit, vegetables, grains and dairy.“The creation of this Global Nutrition Group is part of our long-term strategy to grow our nutrition businesses, from about $10bn in revenues today to $30bn by 2020,” Nooyi said in a statement at the time. And when she says: “We want our employees to be thrilled to come to work every day,” she means it.“We have an empowering culture that is constructively competitive,” she adds. “In the past, when you said, ‘Move,’ they moved. Now they say, ‘Let me do this.’”Ensuring positive diversity practice, Nooyi says, is critical to attracting the best. “We look at a 10-15-year development plan for our high-potential people. This looks at their children, their schools, their spouse’s job, ageing parents – anything that affects where they will be comfortable working. That way we can build opportunities to develop their careers in tandem with their personal lives.”In the battle of the colas, Pepsi is the underdog, and perhaps, to borrow the advertising line from Avis, as a result it tries harder. Nooyi, too, tries harder. She talks eloquently about her sense of gratitude to the US for giving her the chance, about wanting some day to “pay back” in public life.However, now she is firmly in the public eye, she can no longer do the household shopping or run errands, but must be accompanied by security guards. “I hate it,” she says. “I’m a normal person, a mum, a wife.”"

Ofra Strauss, 50Nationality: IsraeliCompany: Strauss GroupSector: Food and beveragesLocation: IsraelThree-year TSR: 29.7%What started as a smallholding with just two cows, in a quiet corner of Israel, is now a global enterprise, with operations in 20 countries and 20,000 staff.Ofra Strauss’s grandparents were German-Jewish émigrés, fleeing Germany in the mid-1930s. Excess milk from those two cows was made into cheese bearing an ostrich on its packaging (“Strauss” means “ostrich” in German).Ofra, the third generation to run the family business, witnessed the growth of this small dairy operation into a global brand as her father, Richard Strauss, developed the business. Now it has interests in dairy, pre-packed salads, convenience foods and snacks, coffee and water.Ofra read law at Tel Aviv university before going to New York to work as a marketing manager for Estée Lauder. She joined the family business in 1990, and held various management roles before becoming chairwoman in 2001. She has sealed partnerships with Danone and PepsiCo, and in 2008 sold 25 per cent of Strauss’s coffee business to TPG, the private equity group, for $288m.Strauss is Israel’s second-largest food and beverage company, with sales of $1.62bn in the 2009 fiscal year, 47 per cent derived from international activities.

503;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-11-15T18:13:47Z;PepsiCo shifts focus to non-carbonated drinks;;PepsiCo unveiled a hard-hitting TV commercial in the US a few months ago in an effort to reignite the so-called cola wars of the 1980s and 1990s. It was designed to show that its Pepsi Max soda tasted better than Coke Zero, the runaway hit of the calorie-free category.While Pepsico’s bottlers have supported the frontal assault on the company’s arch-rival, beyond that group, few people believe that “cola wars” exist anymore. Just the opposite: in terms of carbonated soft drinks, Coca-Cola has prevailed.For decades, the battle of Coke versus Pepsi in the US was fought on supermarket shelves, in fast-food restaurant fountains and everywhere soft drinks were sold.While Coke’s soft drinks always held a bigger market share in the US and beyond, Pepsi at times was ascendant, fuelled by smarter, more aggressive advertising.Under Indra Nooyi, who took over as PepsiCo chief executive in 2006, the game has changed and the battle lines have been redrawn.Rather than following her predecessors into battle against Coke, Ms Nooyi, a former management consultant, has sought to redefine the playing field in a way that allows PepsiCo to win.Consumption of carbonated soft drinks in the US has been in steady decline over the past decade, in part because of the profusion of alternative beverages available in the market, from still water to sports drinks, and in part out of health concerns in a nation with an obesity problem.Rather than buck this broad trend, Ms Nooyi has sought to change Pepsico’s focus away from carbonated soft drinks and towards juices, teas and sports drinks.The company is also placing a large bet on developing a line of healthy foods through its Quaker Oats division.“PepsiCo is currently focused on better-for-you” snacks and drinks, says Caroline Levy, an analyst at CLSA.To that end, Ms Nooyi has hired several well-known nutritionists to direct the company’s efforts at reducing the fat and sodium in its foods, and the sugar in its drinks.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chief executive, has followed a different path. A former Coke bottler, Mr Kent has maintained his company’s focus on selling soft drinks in the US and around the world since taking over from Neville Isdell in 2004.The result: Coke’s beverage volume in North America dropped only 2 per cent in 2009, a difficult year economically compounded by a cooler-than-average summer.Pepsi’s beverage volume in North America for 2009 plunged 8 per cent.According to Beverage Digest, brand Coca-Cola has locked in its US dominance over brand Pepsi.Through 2009, Coca-Cola held a 17 per cent share of the US soft drink market, while its rival was at 9.9 per cent. Both brands have been in decline, but Pepsi is declining at a slightly faster rate.As for all carbonated soft drinks, Coke brands commanded 41.9 per cent of the total market last year, compared with Pepsi’s 29.9 per cent share, according to Beverage Digest.While PepsiCo has conceded that the US market for carbonated soft drinks is declining, under Mr Kent, Coca-Cola keeps plugging away.Mr Kent has vowed to rebuild sales of brand Coca-Cola in the world’s biggest market for soft drinks and, in the second quarter of this year, he succeeded, as the company sold more brand Coca-Cola in its home market for the quarter than it had during the comparable period a year earlier.In its efforts to reverse the declining trends in the US, Coke hopes to replicate the success it has enjoyed in Mexico, where it refocused its energies on a market that was deemed mature and declining, and increased sales of carbonated soft drinks.
504;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-11-14T19:02:48Z;Kirin and Suntory want a taste of Danone;;Mmmmm Danone. Everyone wants a spoonful of the world’s biggest yoghurt maker.Five years ago, PepsiCo caused a political storm when it expressed a vague interest in bidding for the French company. Now, Japan’s biggest beverage companies, including Kirin and Suntory, are hoping to suck up Danone’s water business, which is valued at up to $7bn.Should Danone sell, and if so, what can it gain in return?Bankers say it is unlikely the French group will dispose of the water business – emerging markets account for more than 50 per cent of the division’s sales and provide an important distribution platform for other markets.Nor is it likely to let Evian – the heart and soul of the company – go.But there are other brands it could part with and use as leverage to grow in emerging markets where middle-classes are increasingly willing to pay for safe water. That would help the Japanese brewers satisfy their international expansion ambitions.In return, Danone would want some help with Yakult. The group owns just over 20 per cent of the shares of Yakult Honsha, the Japanese food products company that invented the fermented “bioactive” yoghurt drink.Danone would probably love to own more of Yakult, which has the potential to deliver bigger profits. A shareholding of 33 per cent would give it control but it has agreed not to increase its shareholding in the company until 2012.So it could offer this stake to one of the Japanese brewers in return for giving them one of its European brands.Such an agreement would avoid a replay of Danone’s long-running dispute with its Chinese joint venture partner the Wahaha Group, one of China’s largest beverage companies. Last year, the pair agreed to dissolve the 12-year partnership following accusations by Danone that Wahaha and Zong Qinghou, the Chinese company’s founder, had set up lucrative parallel businesses.In short, there are ways for Danone to turn Kirin, Suntory and Asahi’s interest to its benefit. But the outcome is likely to be achieved through small sips rather than one big gulp.
505;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-11-08T18:43:33Z;Wigmaker gets a grip on baldness;;Unihair of Japan, the world’s biggest wigmaker, is hoping for a big increase in sales through what might be regarded as the ultimate cutting-edge technology – a method to “grow” luxuriant displays of new hair on a person’s scalp.The method uses cell-generation processes derived from pharmaceuticals research. “We see a tremendous number of possibilities [from the new process],” said Tadao Otsuki, Unihair’s chief executive. “It adds up to a fundamental shift in how the world can combat problems of baldness.”With the help of the new techniques, based on ideas developed in the US and which are now undergoing clinical trials, Unihair is hoping to increase its annual sales roughly three-fold, from Y57.3bn ($706m) in the year to February 2010, to about Y150bn in 2017.Mr Otsuki was installed in May as chief executive of Unihair – which until September was called Aderans – after an acrimonious struggle last year in which the activist US fund manager Steel Partners took control of the company and forced management changes as a way to boost shareholder returns.Mr Otsuki was previously head of the Japanese operations of PepsiCo, the US beverages company, and has also worked for Kraft Foods, another US food and drink maker. “I want to bring some of the perspectives of the consumer goods industry into the hair loss sector,” Mr Otsuki said.Unihair has found it difficult to lift sales and profits in recent years as demand for its wigs in Japan has started to dip, partly because men appear to be less worried about going bald.Men have also started to experiment with other ways to counter the problem, for instance through conventional “hair transplant” procedures.In such methods, doctors remove thin strips of skin from a patient’s scalp with healthy hair roots and then install these skin pieces in areas of hair loss.The technique suffers from the drawback that there is no way to prompt more than one follicle to grow from a single root.With Unihair’s alternative “cell-generation” technique, however, scientists take follicle samples from a person and use them to replicate new hair cells in a laboratory, before later injecting the greatly multiplied number of cells into the person’s scalp.This procedure offers the promise of promulgating relatively bushy clumps of hair wherever people need them, Mr Otsuki claimed.If the procedure can be shown to work effectively, he hopes that Unihair may be able to sell it on a global basis, reducing the company’s dependence on sales in Japan.The only other company in the world regarded as having developed a similar cell-generation procedure for hair is Intercytex, a UK company owned by Regenerative Solutions, an investment group.The price of a spell of treatment for a person using the new ideas would probably be set somewhat above the roughly $10,000 cost of conventional hair- loss treatments based on transplant methods.The company registered a Y5.2bn operating loss in 2009-10, and expects another operating loss of Y3.9bn on sales of Y52bn in the current financial year, before returning to profit in 2012.Unihair also hopes to increase sales by opening a new chain of shops to sell wigs and hair-loss treatments in China, while branching out more to sell wigs to women – not just in Japan but around the world. Out of the Y150bn sales for Unihair which Mr Otsuki is projecting for 2017, a third would come from outside Japan, he says.Unihair says 400m people around the world – mainly men – have a problem with baldness. The total market for wigs, restoratives and medical treatments for combating this adds up to about $6bn a year, according to the company.
506;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-11-04T23:46:56Z;Coke debt sale ties record low rate;;Coca-Cola on Thursday became the latest of the large, brand name companies to test the limits of the rally in the US corporate bond market by selling debt with record low rates.In a $4.5bn multi-part deal, the iconic maker of soft drinks, will share the bragging rights with Walmart for the cheapest three-year debt.Coca-Cola matched the retailer with a 0.75 per cent coupon, or a spread of 32 basis points over comparable Treasuries, people familiar with the deal said.Walmart sold its record-setting bond deal last month.Coca-Cola’s sale, which is the company’s largest ever, underscores the relentless investor demand for corporate bonds in the post-crisis era and the attractiveness of borrowing in the market for companies.This combination has prompted heavy issuance of corporate bonds in the past two years and record amounts of inflows into mutual funds that specialise in this corner of the credit markets.In the past few months, companies have consecutively hit new lows for borrowing costs.“The market is very open for these big name companies to sell big deals at very low rates,” said Lon Erickson, managing director at Thornburg Investment Management.“It is pretty cheap money. We will probably see more.”In the aftermath of the financial crisis, low official rates have made cash investments unattractive while investors from individuals to pension funds have cut back on stocks in favour of corporate debt after being spooked by sharp equity declines during the downturn.Coca-Cola also sold five-year and 10-year bonds with coupons of 1.50 per cent and 3.15 per cent, respectively.The rates it achieved for these tranches were trumped, however, by other recent bond sales.Colgate-Palmolive has sold five year debt with a coupon of 1.375 per cent while Johnson & Johnson issued 10-year debt paying just 2.95 per cent, Thomson Reuters said.In the past few months, other household names like Coke rival PepsiCo, IBM, Microsoft and Ebay have sold bonds with coupons that are among the lowest ever for their maturities, according to Thomson Reuters.A tranche of 18-month floating rate notes sold by Coca-Cola will pay 5 basis points over three-month Libor.Coca-Cola will use the proceeds to restructure its debts after it acquired the North American business of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottler.Alongside the bond sale, Coca-Cola launched a tender offer for several existing debt securities with higher coupon payments.“It is a real cleaning up of their debt stack,” said Erich Mauff, co-head of debt dapital markets for North America at Deutsche Bank, which was a manager on the debt sale and tender. In a testament to the demand for Coca Cola’s bonds, Mr Mauff said there were orders for $10.5bn of bonds.
507;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;Case study: Pepsi;;"The challenge:
In 2006, Rajendra Gursahaney, the senior director of engineering at Pepsi Beverages Company, the bottling division of the drinks group, wanted to create a thinner, lighter and more environmentally friendly plastic beverage bottle that would contain a small dose of nitrogen to maintain firmness. The idea would either revolutionise the bottling industry or cost his company millions of dollars in delays.The story:
Non-carbonated drinks are vulnerable to bacteria if they are not bottled properly. So most companies heat beverages to a temperature that destroys micro-organisms. The hot liquid is then poured into a bottle until it is full, destroying any bacteria on its inner wall. Bottlers must use a thick plastic that will not deform, which means it is expensive, heavy and has a big environmental footprint. Mr Gursahaney, known as “Guru”, wondered if he could add a harmless gas, such as nitrogen, to the liquid that would expand as the bottle contracts upon cooling to mitigate the deformation. That way, there would be no more need to make a thick-walled bottle. The difficulty was that nitrogen could not be added to a hot drink, as it would instantly vaporise and the fluid would bubble out.Getting buy-in:
Pepsi encourages a degree of risk-taking, as long as it is based on a well-founded analysis. Guru knew the company was about to roll out a new product line in Russia with Lipton Tea and devised a plan to tackle the problem. He was upfront with management about the risks and answered a lot of hard questions, including how the new technology would be different from current systems, what was the last possible date a traditional bottling technology could still be implemented and what impact there would be if the idea failed. Guru set check-in dates and did the maths. If the idea worked, it would not only save millions per year per line in plastic costs, but could actually be good for the planet.The right people:
Guru then assembled a team that was not risk-averse. It included personnel from Pepsi, Lipton, the bottle maker, the nitrogen dosing company, the filling company and the Russian operations team. This team of six was based in Hamburg and worked for more than a year in the laboratory. On a bench they improvised an assembly line. At one station a bottle was filled with hot water. It then moved to the next station where a small dose of nitrogen was added. Next, the cap was attached and finally the bottle was dunked in a tub filled with ice. The team then studied the shape of the bottle, twisting it in the light, including pulling out callipers and measuring every square inch.Overcoming obstacles:
The team developed a bottle, but for the first few weeks of testing on a production line, 10 per cent of the bottles were not fit to put into the market. The team worked on the problem for six weeks – tinkering with fill levels and nitrogen doses in an attempt to get the system working properly. Finally, one team member suggested running a high-speed camera to see if a small amount of nitrogen was missing the bottles. “We couldn’t see it with the naked eye. But that helped us get the nitrogen to dose precisely each time with no spillage,” says Guru.The solution:
After 14 months, the team had discovered a process to keep nitrogen from evaporating and the hot tea from spilling, and they had created a significant reduction in weight from a thick-walled bottle. A traditional 1.5 litre bottle weighs 63g; Guru’s bottle weighed only 48g. Pepsi forecasts $7.5m in annual plastics savings in Russia alone. And the environmental benefit is also substantial. Pepsi has chosen not to patent this idea, but instead is willing to share the technology with other companies. In 2009, Guru was awarded Pepsi’s “best of the best” sustainability prize. He admitted that he couldn’t have created this breakthrough alone, so he shared the reward with the people on his team.The lesson:
While “risk” is not the most popular word in boardrooms right now, improvement and creation demand it. In the conversations we had with team members, a similar insight emerged time and again: individuals who create world-class results for their organisations know calculated risk is necessary and they understand the impact – both positive and negative – of taking one.The writers are co-authors of ‘The Orange Revolution: How one great team can transform an entire organization’.

508;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Fears over Bright Food’s appetite for deal;;The private equity owners of United Biscuits fear that Bright Food, the Chinese group in exclusive talks to buy the UK biscuit maker, may be distracted by other assets on the block.Bright Food, majority-owned by the Shanghai provincial government, last month entered into exclusive talks with Blackstone of the US and France’s PAI with a view to buying the $3.2bn (£2bn) maker of Jaffa Cakes and Twiglets.While those concerned insist that talks remain on track, there are jitters over Bright Food simultaneously eyeing a host of other assets. These include Yoplait, the yoghurt maker jointly owned by PAI and a French co-operative, and GNC, the retailer of nutritional products with which the Chinese group entered a joint venture this year.GNC last month filed for a $350m initial public offering, a move that could have prompted Bright Food to refocus its efforts in that direction.“Talks aren’t over, but we are not holding our breath,” said a person familiar with the auction, which is being run by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The person said that Bright Food’s interest in the British-based snack maker had faded as it became keen on GNC Holdings. “It has been looking at GNC, but I’m not sure if that means it won’t buy UB.”One banker says the list goes further. “It’s everywhere,” he said, referring to Bright Food’s penchant for appearing at every sale.The company’s first attempt at an international acquisition ended badly. It spent more than a year attempting to buy Sucrogen, the sugar and biofuels unit of Australia’s CSR, before losing to Singapore’s Wilmar International.Should the UB talks collapse by the time Bright Food’s exclusivity period expires in three weeks’ time, the private equity groups are expected to put the company back up for auction.There are other probable trade bidders for UB, including Indian and Chinese groups looking for global brands.Touted buyers include Kellogg, Kraft, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Campbell Soup. There may also be interest from Britannia Industries in India, Ulker in Turkey and Meiji in Japan.Blackstone and PAI, which bought UB for £1.6bn in 2006, are considering splitting the maker of McVitie’s and Penguin biscuits into two parts, snacks and biscuits, to make it more palatable for bidders.
509;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Treating the shock of the new name;;"As the recent Gap logo fiasco shows, rebrandings can go horribly wrong. Earlier this month, the US clothing retailer announced that a new logo design was to replace its well-known 20-year-old version. Customer reaction to the three black letters and a small blue square was swift and overwhelmingly negative, sweeping rapidly across the internet.A Facebook page, “I think the new GAP Logo Sucks”, appeared, as did a spoof Twitter account featuring the new logo tweeting about how ugly it felt. Another site offered people the opportunity to make their own logo; one of the most popular variants used a word that rhymed with Gap.Feeling the pressure, Gap made a U-turn. Marka Hansen, head of the Gap brand in North America, said: “We’ve been listening to and watching all of the comments …We heard them say over and over again they are passionate about our blue-box logo, and they want it back. So we’ve made the decision to do just that.” The company, she noted, “did not go about this the right way”.Rebrandings and renamings that repel the audience they are supposed to at­tract are a feature of business life; sometimes the company backtracks, while others tough it out.Pepsi stuck with the redesign of its roundel a couple of years ago, even though it was roundly deplored, while the SciFi channel decided to rise above the rash of syphilis jokes that greeted its decision to call itself SyFy in 2009. Less fortunate in outcome was the UK Post Office group’s decision at the start of the decade to move some of its operations under the label of Consignia, which attracted hoots of derision before it eventually and quietly renamed itself Royal Mail Holdings. Similarly, Tropicana, the fruit juice brand owned by PepsiCo, re­designed its logo in early 2009 only to revert quickly to the original after it was deluged with e-mails, phone calls and letters with such comments as: “The new cartons stink.”Other efforts attract less enmity but beg the question, why bother? Why, for instance, did AOL feel the need to insert a full stop into its new logo? Odder still was the US electronics retailer Radio Shack. Last year, it decided it wanted people to call it “The Shack”, but only as a kind of nickname, while it was still formally known as Radio Shack.Rebrandings are also often enormously expensive. Paul Veness, director of Endpoint, a brand implementation com­pany, says: “From our experience, the cost of [executing] a rebranding is 20 to 30 times the creative budget. It’s everything from signage to staff uniforms to the IT back end.”While he may be right that rebranding can be a good time to introduce best practice and achieve some streamlining, this is hardly the case if the company has to change it all back again.However, Wally Olins, chairman of Saffron Brand Consultants, says the widespread public outrage at the overhaul of the Gap logo does not mean rebranding is a bad idea, “I don’t think it goes wrong that often but, when it does go wrong, people notice it,” he says.When they like a new logo or name, he says, they usually say nothing rather than demanding that the company backtracks. Moreover, he adds, most brands “do need to change subtly and continuously if they are not to look anachronistic. If you look at BMW, the brand is continuously evolving.” Similarly, Nike, Apple and Shell all update their logos in a way that might be considered evolutionary.But there are times when revolution is called for. “There are often very compelling reasons to make a change,” says Rita Clifton, chairman of Interbrand. “It might be a regulatory change, part of the company might split off, it might be a merger such as Diageo [the result of combining GrandMet and Guinness] or it might be that you’re becoming more international.”Such was the case with Aviva, which until 2009 was known as Norwich Union, Commercial Union and Hibernian, as well as Aviva, in different markets, before becoming Aviva everywhere. In its home country, the UK, this meant dropping Norwich Union, a brand with more than 200 years of history, yet there was very little fuss. “Aviva rebranded in a very charming way,” says Ms Clifton.Amanda Mackenzie, Aviva’s group marketing director, says: “Before we did it, we really tried to understand what people wanted out of a financial services brand and to understand how important Britishness was to the brand. It was driven from the top but we talked to customers and staff throughout.”The company announced the change a year before it formally took place. It ran TV and poster campaigns featuring celebrities known for having changed their names, such as Bruce Willis, Elle Macpherson and Ringo Starr. It also listened to people, says Ms McKenzie. “We had an e-mail from the Bishop of Norwich’s office saying: ‘I do hope you’ll keep the cathedral in the logo.’ And we reassured him that yes, we would.” Ms Mackenzie even contacted some unhappy customers directly. “Someone wrote in and said: ‘Which balding, facetious, marketing twit did this?’ I phoned him and said: ‘Hi, it’s the balding and facetious marketing twit.’”When the company formally chang­ed its name in June last year, it also an­nounced it would sponsor Norwich City Football Club to reaffirm its local roots. There are no Facebook groups for people who hate the name Aviva.Ms Clifton points out that while new “invented” names – such as Diageo, Aviva, Altria or Accenture – are tempting targets, especially when they replace venerable brands, customers do get used to them. “It’s easy to mock but after a while it starts sounding normal.”It is worth remembering how, in 1958, Japanese consumers hated the idea of Tsushin Kogyo (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering) changing its name but the company explained it needed something foreigners could pronounce. It based its new name on the Latin word for sound, sonus, and became Sony.Not everything hangs on a name. Mr Olins points out that if the company is good enough, even brands that in theory should be dreadful can still work. He cites Volkswagen. “It’s a classic example of an appalling name. It’s unpronounceable and has horrible historical connotations [Hitler was one of its original supporters] but it’s a very successful brand.”His point is echoed by Ms Clifton. “The thing that really makes brands is the substance that lies beneath. If it’s not right, then a shiny new logo will just highlight this.”Even so, companies must manage the process carefully.Ms Clifton counsels against springing a new name on an unsuspecting public – Aviva gave people a lot of time to get used to the idea.It is worth remembering that customers can be very conservative. “People often hate anything new,” says Mr Olins. “Jaguar spent a lot of time listening to focus groups who told them they had a great brand, so it didn’t change. But then the same people went out and bought other brands that had changed.”The lesson may be that brands need to lead and not follow – and sometimes this can mean having the strength to weather initial criticism. The London 2012 Olympics logo was controversial at first but people now seem to have got used to it. Indeed, some observers have said Gap made two mistakes – the first was the new logo. But the second was to cave in to the online mob, which made it look weak and indecisive.Nevertheless, there are times when rebranders must throw in the towel. But even then, if handled well, disaster can be avoided.In 1998, Kellogg’s changed its UK breakfast cereal Coco Pops to Choco Krispies. It turned out that it had underestimated the UK public’s love of the name Coco Pops, including a catchy advertising jingle. But instead of quietly reintroducing Coco Pops, it managed to turn the outcry into a successful publicity campaign by setting up a phone vote line referendum for consumers. This at­tracted a great deal of media attention, culminating in the triumphant return of the original brand."
510;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-10-19T19:26:17Z;Coca-Cola;Steady progress in home market puts fizz into Coke;At least Coca-Cola should get a sales boost from global warming. The extremely hot summer in Russia had Muscovites reaching for cold drinks, pushing third-quarter volumes there up 30 per cent on the year before. The performance contributed to the fizzy drink company’s 12 per cent growth in Africa and Eurasia as a whole, part of the familiar picture of rapid emerging markets growth and a more pedestrian performance in the developed world. But the most encouraging signs in Tuesday’s results came from slow but steady improvement in the saturated west.In Europe, volumes were up marginally, reflecting a north-south divide: Great Britain, Germany and northern central Europe all grew, but economic weakness in the south and along the Adriatic held the region back.More important was the 2 per cent volume growth in North America, Coke’s largest market even before the businesses of its bottlers are integrated. Changing tastes have for several years reduced demand for carbonated soft drinks, so improving the performance of the whole system – marketing, production and distribution– is central to restoring the whole company’s vigour (and boosting its share price). Also, growth should still be available in North America. As Credit Suisse points out, the birth rate is relatively high and it is the third-largest teenage market globally.So far the evidence is encouraging. Coke appears to be holding steady on the sparkling side while growing in still beverages. There will be synergies from taking the bottlers in-house, and the new approach should make Coke better and faster at targeting more niche sales opportunities.With rival PepsiCo on a similar tack, competition will remain robust, but returns are improving at both. The beverage companies may regain their historic premium to US food manufacturers. No secret, but an attractive recipe nonetheless.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
511;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Green investment divides ministers;;Details of one of the government’s flagship green initiatives are likely to be left out of Wednesday’s comprehensive spending review, as ministers cannot agree on the policy.The green investment bank was championed by George Osborne, chancellor, while in opposition. He set up a commission to report on how such a bank would operate.However, the proposed bank has been mired in disagreements over how it should be funded and the powers it should have.On Wednesday, Mr Osborne is likely to announce that the bank – or corporation as it may be called – will be set up with £2bn in funding, to be spent on green infrastructure projects such as renewable energy and other forms of low-carbon technology.That sum is less than the £4bn to £6bn funding many companies and green groups have demanded.More controversial than the funding, however, is the role that the bank should play. The commission set up by Mr Osborne, and led by Bob Wigley, the former European head of Merrill Lynch, called for the bank to have powers to raise finance from the private sector, for instance by issuing bonds, green Isas, raising loans and other measures.However, Treasury officials have been wary of granting a government-backed institution such wide-ranging powers. They would prefer the bank to operate as a simpler fund, dispensing grants and loans in conjunction with the private sector but without the powers to generate its own self-sustaining financing mechanisms.A final decision on the way the bank should operate is not likely to be reached by Wednesday, when the comprehensive spending review is published. Instead, the government is likely to say that details will be laid out within a few weeks.During that time, many businesses are likely to lobby officials to grant the green investment bank the powers that were originally envisaged, arguing that a simple fund would not be able to leverage the private sector financing necessary to create the infrastructure needed.The idea of a green investment bank was received warmly by companies involved in building the UK’s low-carbon infrastructure.Last month a group of more than 20 companies wrote to ministers to call for the bank to be given £4bn to £6bn initial funding for the next four years, and wide-ranging authority to issue structured financial products.The group included Jaguar Land Rover, Microsoft, BT, PepsiCo and British Airways, as well as financial institutions such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Axa Investment Managers, F&C Investments and the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: “The renewables industry could provide tens of thousands of jobs. But without the right government backing in the form of an independent green bank, we’re going to miss this opportunity.”The future of other government-funded bodies that dispense funds to green industry, such as the Carbon Trust, which is charged with helping companies to reduce their emissions, is also under review.Some of the bodies could be merged, or their funding could be redirected to the green investment bank.

513;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-10-12T19:32:22Z;Gap abandons logo overhaul;;Gap has reinstated its established blue and white square logo on its main US website, just seven days after unveiling a much-criticised redesign, in an unusually rapid corporate reaction to internet criticism.The proposed new logo – three black letters and a small blue square – provoked a storm of online abuse from both customers of the global clothing brand and graphic designers on blogs after it was unveiled on the site a week ago.Marka Hansen, head of the Gap brand in North America, said in a statement that Gap had now “made the decision not to use the new logo on its e-commerce website any further”, adding: “All roads were leading us back to the blue box.”A company note on Gap’s Facebook page said more directly: “OK. We’ve heard loud and clear that you don’t like the new logo.”The company initially responded to the row by saying it would seek alternative ideas from its fans and critics through a “crowd sourcing” project, an idea it has now also abandoned.The new logo was developed by Laird & Partners, a New York creative agency, as part of a broad overhaul of Gap’s logo. This began about two years ago under Ms Hansen, who reports to Glenn Murphy, Gap’s chief executive.In addition to the new logo, the effort has included changing the design and some graphical elements of the e-commerce site, an effort that would eventually have extended across all its stores and advertising.Adding to Gap’s public discomfort, the climbdown came ahead of Thursday’s meeting with Wall Street investors and analysts, where the company expects to discuss new sales growth initiatives, including efforts to extend its e-commerce business in western Europe and China, and opening its first Chinese stores.A Gap spokeswoman argued that the logo redesign sought to reflect recent changes at the brand that have included taking a less centralised approach to design and store design.Ms Hansen said of the reversal in direction that Gap had “learnt a lot in this process”, including the challenges of trying to “crowd source” ideas for the logo. Crowd sourcing involves requesting ideas from the online community.“We are clear that we did not go about this in the right way. We recognise that we missed the opportunity to engage with the online community. This wasn’t the right project at the right time for crowd sourcing.“There may be a time to evolve our logo, but if and when that time comes, we’ll handle it in a different way,” she said.Designers have compared the turnround with PepsiCo’s decision last year to abandon a redesign of its Tropicana fruit juice brand. Unlike Gap’s rapid response, PepsiCo’s reversal took four weeks and came after evidence that the new design had led to falls in supermarket sales of its juices.
514;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-10-12T19:10:51Z;Food and pharma prove a rich mix;;"Food and drug industries have little in common: one is fast-moving and prolific in its output while the other toils for years to produce a handful of blockbusters.Both sectors are now converging on the same turf. Nestlé’s push, announced late last month, into the field of clinical nutrition or nutraceuticals– which cover foodstuffs aimed at slowing or even preventing illnesses and doctor-recommended non-prescription products – pits it firmly against the pharmaceuticals industry.Nutraceuticals are a step up from the fortified foods market, which is expected to be worth $175bn worldwide, according to Euromonitor.This more established market, which ballooned with the advent of energy drinks about five years ago and, shortly after, probiotic yoghurts, has also been attracting attention from food multinationals.Last week, Pepsi said it was setting up a global nutrition unit run by Dr Mehmood Khan, its chief scientist.Nestlé is aware what lies ahead as it pushes into a relatively new area, as Peter Brabeck, the Switzerland-based company’s chairman, acknowledges: “Our competitors are today and will increasingly be in the pharma industry. Most of the pharma companies are moving into this area from a different angle …It will be a different business which needs the understanding of people who are not necessarily experts of FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] companies.”That business covers everything from highly specialised research and development of products to combat diabetes, heart problems and Alzheimer’s disease, to distribution that is more dependant on doctors’ recommendation than bagging space on supermarket shelves.As a new market segment, size and forecasts are thin on the ground; Nestlé itself simply says it foresees sales of billions rather than millions of Swiss francs.But there are some indicators: Nestlé derives SFr1.6bn ($1.7bn) of sales from areas such as tube feeding and foods for the sick and convalescent. Danone of France is building on its health foods such as probiotic yoghurt.Demographic and health trends have encouraged the companies to believe demand will increase. The developed world is seeing a rise in heart disease, diabetes and obesity at the same time as life expectancy increases, while governments rein in spending on healthcare.Nestlé believes this phenomenon will spread to emerging markets too, where governments are also seeking to clamp down on spending.Nutraceuticals also hold out the promise of better profit margins, at about 20 to 25 per cent – reflecting the elimination of costly ad campaigns and more pricing power. Dealing with hospitals rather than aggressive retailers means less margin erosion, and the fact insurers reimburse many of these products means consumers are less worried about bloated price tags.Food companies should be able to make inroads into clinical healthcare, in part because they understand consumers and their needs better, says Warren Ackerman, analyst at Evolution Securities.Charles Mills of Credit Suisse agrees: “The drug industry has very strong R&D but the food companies have the marketing skills.”He points out that the pharma industry has already tripped up on the middle ground, in the area of over-the-counter medicines. Some drugmakers began leaving the business in the 1990s, viewing it as low-growth and generating relatively low margins. “Whereas it was an extremely dependable long-term earnings stream and they probably will now rather regret it,” he says.But the drugmakers now have good reason to move back in. Expiring patents and difficulties in finding replacement prescription drugs are pushing executives to diversify. A shift into consumer healthcare is one response, a strategy championed by companies including Abbott.One reason behind this February’s surprise promotion of Joe Jimenez to chief executive of Novartis, the Swiss drugs group, was his years of experience in the foods sector.Mr Jimenez, an American who spent a large part of his career at Heinz, has said one of his aims at Novartis is to improve marketing, streamline distribution and squeeze costs – all based on techniques he picked up in his consumer goods career.While the pharmaceuticals industry learns lessons from consumer food groups, it has a distinct advantage when it comes to designing rigorous clinical trials. These can be very costly, long term and uncertain. Drug companies spend an aggregate 17 per cent of sales on R&D, according to Bernstein Research, 10 times the proportion the European food industry spends.Pharma companies would also claim the upper hand when it comes to distribution and working through the regulatory process. GSK, for example, has 250 employees dedicated to securing regulatory approvals and almost half of its sales are made through pharmacies.The strategy is similar too, says John Clarke, president of GSK Consumer Healthcare: “We are working off macro trends. Smoking remains the biggest preventable killer and obesity is number two,” he says.The risk for drugmakers, which shy away from corporate marketing, is reputational: they could see their image further burnished if poor quality health studies come under attack.Mike Dennis, analyst at MF Global, says the use of scientific analysis to support the claims used for marketing products could prove the biggest hurdle for food manufacturers as they will have to secure approvals from the European Food Safety Authority and the Food and Drug Administration.Food companies have already come unstuck over the ability to substantiate claims in a smaller way. Some were forced pre-emptively to withdraw ads claiming health benefits on fortified foods, such as probiotic yoghurts, ahead of the EFSA’s protracted deliberations.“Food companies have to get the highest recognition for a human study which is extremely expensive to do and food companies just don’t have pharma companies’ operating margins or scale,” says Mr Dennis.“So it is catch 22. It is difficult for them to go out and spend millions of dollars on a four-year trial to get an end product that’s absolutely nailed it to allow them to say ‘this product works’.”Additional reporting by Haig Simonian in Zurich"
515;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-10-08T21:49:15Z;Criticism causes Gap to backtrack on logo;;Gap, the global clothing chain, has backtracked on a substantial relaunch of its renowned logo just days after it was unveiled.The new logo – three black letters and a small blue square – provoked a storm of online abuse from both customers and graphic designers on blogs after it was unveiled on Gap’s US website on Monday.Three days later the company used its Facebook page to announce that it was “thrilled to see passionate debates unfolding”, but was seeking alternative ideas from its fans and critics through a “crowd sourcing” project.“We love our version, but we’d like to …see other ideas,” the statement said.Marka Hansen, president of Gap’s North America business, followed up with commentary on the Huffington Post, the news and comment site, explaining that the new logo had been chosen as “more contemporary and current”.But she said the brand now wanted to take customers feedback “and work together as we move ahead”, promising that details of the new crowd sourcing effort would be released soon.The new logo was developed by Laird & Partners, a New York creative agency, as part of a brand overhaul at Gap that began two years ago under Ms Hansen, who reports to Glenn Murphy, Gap’s chief executive.In addition to the logo, the new typeface and imagery has been applied to its North American online site, although it has not been applied its recently launched European and UK online business.Designers have compared the turnround with PepsiCo’s decision last year to abandon a redesign of its Tropicana fruit juice brand. Unlike Gap’s rapid response, PepsiCo’s reversal took four weeks, and came after evidence that the new design had led to falls in supermarket sales of its juices.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods company, this year battled through a highly visible surge in internet comment from customers when it relaunched its Pampers nappies.Its executives argued that the volume of online criticism was consistent with reactions to previous evolutions in its products.Dorothy Wolden of Creative Intuition, an Arizona-based design company, said she initially “kept thinking it must be a joke”.“I guess we just don’t understand in the first place why they had to change what they already had,” she said.“The brand equity that they had with the old logo was just tremendous.”

BP’s attempt to co-opt environmental imagery as part of its branding was brutally exposed in the Gulf of Mexico, but that does not stop large companies trying to reverse perceptions. Chewing gum isn’t bad for your teeth, it helps whiten them. Swiss chocolate maker Nestlé is a health and wellness company. And now PepsiCo is in the nutrition business: hooray for sugary drinks and salty snacks.Reporting third-quarter results on Wednesday, Pepsi said it was creating a Global Nutrition Group to be run by Dr Mehmood Khan, its chief scientist. The aim is to take the $10bn of food and drink sales made annually in nutrition – mostly Quaker Oats, fruit juices and the Gatorade drinks marketed to sporty types – and triple it by 2020. But crucially, the company is not changing management or reporting structures, and Dr Kahn will still be researching and developing new types of chips and Pepsi flavours.Investors may not care if such doublethink serves a useful marketing purpose. Pepsi has been making noises about cutting salt levels for some time, and the move does indicate aspirations for long-term growth. However, the company also cut the top end of its guidance for earnings growth this year from 13 to 12 per cent. Increased investment – in nutrition but also in beverages and expanding capacity and distribution in China – is less palatable when it squeezes returns and may be a response to a more difficult competitive environment.Indeed, in its Americas Beverages division, responsible for a quarter of the $57bn in sales the group expects to make this year, Pepsi faces more aggression from Coca-Cola. In North America, where Pepsi is consolidating the acquisition of its bottlers, volumes were merely flat on last year.

517;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;PepsiCo cuts top end of growth forecast;;PepsiCo shares slumped almost 4 per cent on Thursday morning after the company warned investors that it was cutting the upper end of its earnings forecast for the year.The company attributed the change to its decision to fund further investments in its long-term growth plan.Although Pepsi’s third-quarter earnings were largely in line with analysts’ predictions, the scaling back of full-year forecasts raised questions among analysts as to whether the increased spending was in response to new growth opportunities, or merely a recognition that the food and beverage company had to spend aggressively to keep up with its competitors.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, blamed the tightening of the company’s guidance on macroeconomic conditions in the US and western Europe.“There is no doubt that economic uncertainty and high unemployment levels are keeping a consumer-led recovery at bay in many regions, especially in developed markets,” she said in a conference call with analysts. “We expect these conditions to persist.”Early in the year, PepsiCo had told analysts its earnings per share would rise between 11 to 13 per cent for 2010. Yesterday, the company said the number would be in the 11 to 12 per cent range.“All we’re doing now is tightening the guidance,” Ms Nooyi said in response to questions over whether the additional spending was being done from a postition of weakness or strength. “We feel very good about where we are. In today’s macro economic environment, to deliver 11-12 per cent earnings per share is a fantastic performance. We are managing the company for the long term”.She added that the “robust revenue growth” at PepsiCo was the “result of investments made last year”.Strong food sales in its Frito-Lay division and the acquisition of its bottling system helped PepsiCo to achieve growth of 40 per cent year-on-year in third-quarter revenues, with a 25 per cent operating margin. The company reported $15.5bn in sales for the quarter and net income of $1.9bn, a gain of 12 per cent over the third quarter last year.In its foods division, the strongest growth came in Latin America, while its Quaker Foods division in North America continued to struggle.In beverages, PepsiCo reported revenues of $10.3bn for the quarter, a 70 per cent increase from its sales last year, driven primarily by the consolidation of its bottling system. In its home market of North America, Pepsi’s beverage volume was flat, an improvement over its performance in the second quarter of 2010.

It’s a great analogy, and I wish it had been mine, but it belongs to Kathy Lette, the always irreverent and never dull Australian author, who used it when she MC’d the inaugural Women: Inspiration & Enterprise Symposium (WIE) late last month.Lette mentioned it when, later that day, we were seated next to each other at dinner. She laughed when I asked her how she thought that particular line had gone down with the Americans. For, although we both live in London, we were in New York, attending the Important Dinner for Women.Wendi Murdoch, along with co-hosts Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo, and Queen Rania of Jordan, had yet again pulled off a pretty spectacular coup, in the shape of the fifth Important Dinner for Women. These are held in support of Millennium Development Goal Five, which aims to reduce the numbers of women who die in childbirth annually. That seems to be harder than most people thought when it was set as a goal by the G20 in 2000. And it is the goal with which the least progress has been made.Changing the world is tough, even when you have considerable resources, as I am sure Melinda Gates, a keynote speaker at the symposium, would tell anyone who asked her. But Mrs Murdoch is undeterred. I should have thought it taxing enough working out where to seat Barbra Streisand at dinner (in between Donna Karan and Arianna Huffington, if you are interested). But no – she was going to make sure that each and every one of the 200-odd women there that night made a material commitment to the cause.I thought twice about hauling myself to New York for not much more than 24 hours. I had just come back from Singapore, where I had done my own Wonderbra bit by speaking at the annual RBS Coutts/FT Women in Asia Awards. Singapore is a lot smaller than New York, but there is no shortage of impressive women there. Doreen Liu, managing director of World Scientific Publishing, for instance, who won the Entrepreneur of the Year award, and Lim Ke Xin, senior tax consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who took the Rising Star award, would both have fitted in New York.But I am a veteran of these MDG dinners, having been at each of the five since the first, in Davos, in 2008. As there were only 40 of us at that inaugural one, there aren’t many with that record. They include Mrs Murdoch herself, her co-hosts, and Sarah Brown, the wife of our former prime minister.And it was last year, at the fourth dinner, when Mrs Brown, backed by the White Ribbon Alliance, committed to doing a conference dedicated to trying to stop maternal death in childbirth being the horribly real risk it is in many developing countries. Thus it was that WIE came about, hosted by Mrs Brown, Ms Karan and Ms Huffington. You could be dazzled by contributors, ranging from Nthabiseng Tshabalala, a 12-year-old South African activist, to designer Diane von Furstenberg, actor Ashley Judd and Jimmy Choo founder Tamara Mellon. But there were plenty of women present of whom you might never have heard, all supporting and uplifting each other. I shall be booking up for 2011.In my dash from Singapore to New York (via London to catch the 60th birthday of one of those annoying friends who can still wear sleeveless dresses and look fabulous) I arrived only just in time for Mrs Murdoch’s dinner. I wore a DvF blouse (with long sleeves), which was handy for meeting DvF.Ms Nooyi spoke and pointed out that although there were many prominent women in the room, not many were from the corporate world. So next year, you US-based female CEOs (and I know a lot of you read this column), we want you! Come and be each other’s Wonderbra.mrsmoneypenny@ft.com
519;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;MTV arm to focus on youth branding;;With hit shows such as Jersey Shore and 16 and Pregnant, MTV thinks it knows so-called “millennials” better than anyone.After a ratings slump in the past decade, the TV network, owned by Viacom, has again captured the zeitgeist of the world’s youth, with third-quarter ratings up 23 per cent over last year, according to Nielsen.MTV is seeking to capitalise on its cool factor with a new division that will work closely with big brands to design and target their products to viewers in the coveted millennial demographic – those aged between about 10 and 28.Called MTV Scratch, the unit will work with large companies to deliver market research, product development, design, branding and original content. Initial efforts have included work with Microsoft and Pepsi.The creative materials and advertising that result will be free to run on other networks, giving MTV’s creative team new leverage across the media industry.MTV executives said millennials were more receptive to advertising than the Generation-Xers that came before them. “They’re looking for transparency with brands, but they think brands can be additive,” said Stephen Friedman, general manager of MTV. “Brands don’t scare them, and that’s a good opportunity for us.”Media companies have long worked with brands to hone their advertising messages to suit an audience.But with a dedicated division that will work with other departments within the network as needed, MTV says Scratch is its most sophisticated offering to date and will allow brands to tap into its deep knowledge base about what makes teenagers tick.“They’re kind of reinventing the wheel,” said Albert Greco, professor of marketing at Fordham University’s Graduate School of Business.MTV made its name in the 1980s with its focus on music videos. Its current resurgence dates to 2008, when long-time staffer Van Toffler took over as president. He has moved away from celebrity-themed programming, towards “authentic” shows with millenials as the main characters.“MTV has had its ups and downs. Now they’re basically on track,” Mr Greco said.The retooled line-up has given MTV new confidence that it can help companies effectively conceive and market new products to today’s youth.”For decades, brands have depended on MTV to reach young people,” said Ross Martin, who will head the new unit. ”The birth of MTV Scratch represents a new breed of partners who summon MTV’s creative talent, consumer insights and unparalleled connection to youth to propel select brands.”The 2008 US Census had showed there were nearly 83m Americans aged between five and 24 – a cohort with an estimated $170bn per year in spending power, Mr Greco said.It could be a challenge, however, for the network and its new brand partners to contend with the fleeting tastes of teenagers. But Mr Greco was confident on the venture: “They may not be watching MTV when they’re 35, but they’ll be using the same products.”
520;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-09-28T21:45:33Z;Business pleads for green investment;;Concerns that the government might abandon proposals for a “green investment bank” have prompted businesses to voice their backing for the measure, arguing it could have far-reaching effects in stimulating economic growth.More than 20 companies have launched a fresh call for a bank that would invest £4bn to £6bn of public money over the next four years in projects to improve energy efficiency, cut greenhouse gas emissions and stimulate private sector investment in low-carbon goods and services.The Treasury is tussling with the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the business department over whether public funds should be poured into a prospective green investment bank that would use them to leverage private sector investment in low-carbon development.The idea had the backing of George Osborne as shadow chancellor. He set up a commission to draw a blueprint for the bank but Treasury mandarins have since cooled on the concept as the potential costs have become apparent.Suggestions that the bank could be funded by the sale of public assets have been dismissed, and the billions of pounds of taxpayer funds that were envisaged could be reduced to a few million in the comprehensive spending review.But the bank should be kept, argue companies incl­uding Jaguar Land Rover, Microsoft, BT, ­PepsiCo and British Airways, as well as several professional bodies and trade associations, including the City of London and the Institution of Civil Engineers. The group has written to officials who are meeting on Wednesday to discuss the bank.Several financial institutions have also signed up, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Axa Investment Managers, F&C Invest­ments and the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association.Peter Young, chairman of the Aldersgate Group, a business grouping that helped co-ordinate the companies, said: “The spending review cannot just be about budget cuts. We also need to restore growth and build a more resilient economy for the future. To achieve this, the green investment bank must be at the heart of the economic recovery, repowering the economy and creating valuable green jobs throughout the UK where they are most needed.”Bob Wigley, the former European head of Merrill Lynch who was appointed by Mr Osborne to draw up plans for the bank, has laid out several possible sources of funding, including an amalgamation of current government green funds and ways for the bank to sell green ISAs.These methods of funding, if combined with some sources from central government, could make the bank self-sustaining and allow it to invest in projects that are too complex or long term, or where the financial return is too dependent on public policy for private sector companies to be willing investors.In this view, if such investments were partly underwritten by a green investment bank, many more private sector investors would come forward.Ed Matthew, director of Transform UK, a campaigning group for business, said: “Low capitalisation will damage any chance of a low-carbon recovery.”
521;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Old roots tap new consumers;Multinationals find profits and efficiency in local sourcing;Javier Guerrera is perched on a steep slope 4,000m above sea level digging for an unlikely treasure. The dirty tubers he pulls from the ground are small and knobbly, and when he splits them open with his pocket knife, their flesh is marked by vibrant magenta and violet rings.Cceccorani and Sumac Saucco are two of more than 3,000 native varieties of potato that until now had no consumer market beyond the isolated villages that scatter the higher reaches of the Andes.“We used to grow these varieties for ourselves – we couldn’t sell them, even in local markets, because people don’t know them, or have forgotten they exist,” says Mr Guerrera.Yet today, the third-generation subsistence farmer is making a profit for the first time in his life, selling eight rare varieties to PepsiCo Foods for its high-end Frito-Lay’s “Andina” brand of crisps.Small farmers like Mr Guerrera are the norm in Peru, where 88 per cent of agriculture is in the hands of farmers with less than 5 hectares and of those, 40 per cent own fewer than 1ha.Antonio Escalona, South Andean general manager of PepsiCo Foods, says the degree of fragmentation poses “a clear challenge” to the company’s goal of producing 100 per cent of potatoes in-country. “You have many people, and not all of them have access to capital or the financing conditions to grow a business, or to survive in cases where [weather or market] conditions are not favourable. I see this not as a negative challenge but as a positive challenge because that’s how we can make a difference for agriculture and for society here.”Under the company’s agro-sustainability programme, which offers long-term contracts to small farmers in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, farmers have improved information sharing and access to technical expertise with on-site Columbia University students. Brazil is now the only country where PepsiCo has a guaranteed 365-day domestic supply of potatoes, and researchers and small farmers are working on a new sunflower seed that is very low in saturated fats.“Sometimes there’s not enough potatoes under contract in Peru so we have to buy them in the market, but that’s not the best-case scenario,” says Mr Escalona. “For the farmers and the company, having a contract system is a really win-win situation because it gives us stability in prices and a way to provide them with working capital.”As multinationals find their domestic markets in Europe and North America saturated, many are focusing on emerging markets for future growth. Part of this push involves trying to establish local sourcing arrangements to embed themselves more closely with the market, create products suited to local tastes and also to secure a more reliable and less expensive supply chain.In Africa, for example, SABMiller, the global drinks group, is investing heavily in local sourcing in less developed markets such as Angola, Mozambique, Sudan and Tanzania. It is also developing products tailored to local tastes, such as beer made from cassava, a root vegetable that is a staple in the region. Using the vegetable is much cheaper than importing maize. The company has had success with a similar strategy elsewhere in Africa. In Uganda, for example, Eagle, a beer made from sorghum, accounts for 50 per cent of SABMiller sales.For Mr Escalona, the immediate concern in Peru is to increase domestic supply to meet what he expects will be robust growth in demand. Since 2000, the domestic potato supply for Lay’s crisps has increased from 8 tonnes to 27 tonnes last year.“Peru has a great potential from an economic standpoint, but also from consumption levels, which are very low compared to most markets in South America,” he says. “We see the business growing very fast and strongly over the next few years. Therefore, one of our key priorities is to ensure a sustained source of raw materials, and potatoes is one of those raw materials.”PepsiCo is investing $3m over the next three years in founding the Agricultural Development Center of Peru, a research facility dedicated to developing varieties of potatoes and other tubers and roots to boost its product portfolio worldwide.It sees enormous potential in products to suit domestic tastes, such as NatuChips, made from cassava and yam grown by small farmers in Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Brazil.In Peru, it has also introduced flavours under the “Peruanisimas” brand – native yellow potatoes seasoned with Peru’s distinctive yellow and red chillies, and potato straws.“Peru is the birthplace of the potato, but five years ago we only had white potatoes in the portfolio, and we didn’t have any [local] flavours,” says Mr Escalona. “Whereas if you go to the UK, for example, our Walker’s portfolio is extensive. We saw that as a challenge.”While the premium Andina crisps are a niche product, Mr Escalona hopes the novelty appeal and taste of Mr Guerrera’s colourful, rare native varieties will one day be offered to European and North American consumers.“They are more expensive because of the way the farmers produce the potatoes . . . so as a result it’s not a massive product but we feel good with the results, we’re looking for ways to enhance the offering,” he says.The Andina crisps concept grew in part out of work by Peru’s International Potato Centre (CIP), where most of the world’s known potato genome is stored in anti-seismic, refrigerated vaultsThe centre, which is dedicated to reducing poverty and achieving food security in developing nations, develops high-yield, disease-resistant and vitamin-enhanced varieties of potatoes and tubers, notably “Co-operation 88”, which China will use to boost its potato production by 100m tonnes a year to reach its goal of producing 95 per cent of its own food.But the CIP also has a role in safeguarding biodiversity, and in Peru it saw the opportunity to both reduce poverty and preserve rare varietiesby linking small farmers to markets. PepsiCo gave the biggest boost to these efforts, but Chilean-owned supermarket group Wong and others are also making links.“When a big company like PepsiCo agrees to do that the smaller ones normally tend to copy, so we hope that in the future more companies will join that group,” says André Devaux, leader of the CIP’s Andean potato initiative.Inside the chilled vaults of the genome bank, rows and rows of test tubes preserve live miniature specimens of about 4,300 species, 70 per cent of which developed by natural selection in the Andes.Each test tube is bar-coded and labelled with names that offer glimpses into the Andean culture. “Weeping bride” is a heavily pitted variety – Andean fiancées traditionally must face a test of their ability to peel a potato in one long unbroken curl of skin.Holding up a test tube where some tiny black tubers have sprouted amid delicate green foliage, researcher Ana Panta jokes that this is Peru’s real “Inca treasure”. “In theory we can preserve these seeds forever,” she says.David Tay, head of the CIP’s genome bank, sounds a note of warning about commercial markets for native potato varieties, however, saying the interests of poor farmers can conflict with the scientific imperative to safeguard biodiversity. “The farmers only have a certain amount of land. If they grow a few breeds, they will forget about the rest and we will lose them.”For Mr Guerrera, the more salient point is that in the four years since he began growing potatoes for PepsiCo, he has increased his land holding from a third of a hectare to 20ha. “Before we did not have any opportunity economically to access education. Now our children go to school and we can at least buy clothes for them. We want more benefits for our children, we see an opportunity to develop our business,” he says.
522;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
523;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Obama pressed to look at CEOs to replace Summers;;Lawrence Summers’ looming departure as director of the National Economic Council will offer Barack Obama, US president, his biggest opportunity since taking office of reshaping the administration’s approach to economic policy.No sooner had the White House announced Mr Summers’ return to Harvard University on Wednesday night, speculation began swirling around Washington regarding possible candidates to be Mr Obama’s top adviser on the economy.Even though no selection or announcement is expected in the near future – and might not occur until after the midterm elections – White House staffers have for some time been working on a shortlist of possible replacements for Mr Summers as it became clear that the post would be vacant at the end of the year.Amid persistent criticism, particularly from Republicans and business lobbyists, that administration policies have been too harsh on corporate America, Mr Obama could select a top executive as his chief adviser.Some names have already surfaced, from Indra Nooyi, chair and chief executive of PepsiCo, to Anne Mulcahy, former chair and chief executive of Xerox. He might consider Penny Pritzker, a member of the Chicago family that founded the Hyatt hotels empire who backed his campaign for president and was considered for a cabinet post during the transition period.“There is something very legitimate about having run a business and created value and I think the administration could lean in that direction,” said Michael Greenstone, head of the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project, which is close to the Obama White House.But whether a business executive would be suited to the role of NEC director – which involves gathering policy proposals from different branches of the administration and selecting the best for presentation to the president – is a different matter. “It can be tough going from being chief executive to being staff, even if it is high-ranking staff, and not everyone can make that transition,” says Phillip Swagel, a senior Treasury department official during the Bush administration.Tony Fratto, deputy press secretary under Mr Bush, said a CEO as NEC director, would “most likely be a disaster”.“CEOs are used to leading and being followed. The NEC director’s job isn’t to lead. Instead, it’s to be the ‘honest broker’ on behalf of the president,” said Mr Fratto, now at Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington, in a blog for CNBC.One possible, though less high-profile, candidate with private sector and government experience is Diana Farrell, deputy director of the NEC who was instrumental in forging many of the Obama administration’s economic policies, including financial reform legislation. She was previously a top executive at McKinsey, the global consultancy.Other deputies have filled senior roles on the economic team, including Jack Lew, the proposed budget director, and Austan Gools-bee, the new chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. If Mr Obama decides to shy away from a business executive, he might choose Laura Tyson, an economist at Berkeley, or Gene Sperling, a senior Treasury official. Both held the position of NEC director during the Clinton administration.Robert Gibbs, White House press secretary, said the selection process was “ongoing”. “I think the po-tential candidates that the White House will look at will be a broad group of people representing a whole host of backgrounds,” he said.
524;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-09-21T21:18:10Z;Hurricane fears send orange juice higher;Speculators eye development of Caribbean storm;Orange juice futures hit a three-year high on Tuesday as speculators eyed the development of a Caribbean storm that meteorologists said had a chance of moving towards Florida.Orange juice is a $20bn industry with prices affecting farmers in Florida and Brazil, processors, trading houses and bottlers such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.The Commodity Weather Group, a consultancy, said it was “likely” that a storm would develop, with initial tracking forecasts suggesting a move “into the eastern Gulf toward the central Florida panhandle by mid- to late-next week”.Meteorologists said nonetheless that it was too early to predict if and when the storm will form and where it was heading. But speculators and traders bought orange juice as a precaution.ICE November frozen concentrate of orange juice rose briefly by the daily limit of 10 cents, or 6.6 per cent, to an intraday peak of 160.40 cents per pound, the highest since July 2007.The New York contract later pared gains, to trade at 158.75 cents, up 5.6 per cent. Jack Scoville, at Chicago-based brokerage The Prices Futures Group, said that commodities traders were keeping a “very close eye on weather in the tropics”. Until now, he explained, hurricanes have stayed north and east of Florida, the world’s second largest orange juice producer after São Paulo state in Brazil.“However, more systems keep forming and frozen concentrate of orange juice futures hold strong due to the potential for a hurricane to hit Florida,” Mr Scoville said.Bad weather can trigger wild price movements in the orange market. Hurricanes Charley, Frances and Jeanne in 2004 and Wilma in 2005 caused lasting damage to Florida’s citrus industry, helping to push the cost of orange juice futures to a record high of 209.50 cents per pound.The rally in orange juice prices could be shortlived if the tropical storm fails to develop or by-passes Florida as the market is braced for a rebound in production.The forthcoming orange crop in Florida will be more than 10 per cent larger than last season, two closely watched private sector forecasts said in August. Citrus Consulting International said that the southern US state would grow 154m boxes of oranges in the 2010-11 growing year, up 10 per cent from 2009-10.The forecasts of a rise in output have kept orange juice prices in check until now in spite of a rebound in demand as global economic growth slowly improves.Elsewhere in commodities markets on Tuesday, crude oil prices fell. The market was dragged down by the expiry of the Nymex October West Texas Intermediate contract, which in late trade slid $1.34 to $73.42 a barrel. The more active Nymex November WTI contract lost $1.22 to $74.97.ICE November Brent fell 90 cents to $78.42 a barrel. Brent prices have been supported lately by lower supplies from Russia and Iran into the Mediterranean basin, traders said.Base metals moved lower amid profit-taking and in spite of strong final imports data from China. On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months fell 0.7 per cent to $7,659.50 a tonne. Aluminium also dropped by 0.7 per cent to $2,184.75 a tonne.
525;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Master who plays his cards right;;Not many corporate chiefs would admit to having cleaned bathrooms as part of their training, but Ajay Banga, chief executive of MasterCard, is not your typical business leader. “Cleaning bathrooms,” which he did in the 1990s while opening Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut restaurants in India for PepsiCo, “made me very valuable to my wife”, he says. “I’m called the bathroom fairy at home.”That willingness to poke fun at himself extends to his appearance. As a Sikh, Mr Banga, 50, wears a turban and has a full beard, making for a striking contrast with Robert Selander, his predecessor and current vice-chairman. “Bob and I joke about it all the time,” Mr Banga says. “I know I look different from a lot of people around the world, but I don’t view that as something that defines me.”His affability is disarming, but it also masks a competitive streak that propelled Mr Banga from fast food to one of the top jobs at Citigroup, where he ran the global consumer bank, before joining MasterCard last year with a promise of quickly being promoted to chief executive.Since then, he has set about shaking up MasterCard’s sleepy culture. The company processes more than 22bn transactions a year, at the speed of 140 milliseconds each, faster than the blink of an eye. Its entire business depends on making sure each of those transactions clears without a hitch, a model that tends to reward reliability over risk-taking. “When somebody swipes a card in Guam and that card was issued in Bangalore, if it doesn’t go through, that’s the end of my so-called guarantee,” he says.To speed up decision-making, Mr Banga has given lower-level employees more authority to negotiate contracts and has created a new division to better compete with electronic payment systems such as PayPal. The urgency Mr Banga is trying to instil in employees also applies to him. Any request to which he does not respond within two weeks is automatically approved. “He operates on Ajay time, which is about 10 times faster than everyone else,” says Josh Peirez, the head of MasterCard’s business development unit.An extrovert, who encourages staffers to drop by his office to discuss everything from the quality of the coffee in the cafeteria to world affairs, Mr Banga can also be extremely blunt, a quality that has rubbed off on other executives. Mr Selander says that Mr Banga has taught him to be more direct in his feedback. “After two hours with Ajay, you know exactly what he thinks,” he says.At a leadership meeting in December, Mr Banga grew impatient when executives spouted too many platitudes. “I told them: ‘I’m not going to let this conversation end here. You’re not being as forthright as you need to be.’ ” So he had the executives anonymously write down on index cards the five things that bothered them most. Their answers led him to slash the company’s bureaucracy by improving the expenses policy, hiring process and procedures for signing on new clients. “A lot of what we did came from these touchy, feely meetings,” he says.Playing the role of corporate psychoanalyst is a world away from where Mr Banga started. As the son of a lieutenant-general in the Indian army, who was transferred from post to post every two years, Mr Banga had a nomadic childhood. “The moving around made me who I am,” he says. “I make friends easily. I adjust easily to new situations. I was always the new kid on the block, so I had to learn to break into established groups.”He believes it also made him more open to divergent points of view. “When you come to the US and hear people talking about diversity, well, I grew up with it,” he says.In spite of his globetrotting, he has not abandoned his Indian heritage. On the 30-minute drive from his Manhattan home to MasterCard’s I.M. Pei-designed headquarters in Purchase, New York, he tunes in to Sikh radio, which airs traditional hymns. Yet he is also thoroughly Americanised. He loves baseball (the Mets), listens to Quincy Jones and Lady Gaga and “owns practically every Elvis Presley album that you could think of”.After receiving a bachelor’s degree in economics from Delhi University and an MBA from the India Institute of Management, he joined Nestlé in 1981 as a management trainee. Thirteen years later, Mr Banga signed on as director of marketing for PepsiCo Restaurants in India. He was charged with doing everything from choosing the right-sized chickens – too big, and they do not fry properly – to working the register and, yes, cleaning those bathrooms.When he learnt that PepsiCo was planning to spin off its restaurant division, Mr Banga decided it was time for a career change. He wanted to work for a large global enterprise and, as a standalone business, PepsiCo’s restaurants would be a far smaller and less well-capitalised company. “I realised I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he says.He accepted a job with Citigroup, where he briefly served as a debt collector as part of his training before going on to become head of marketing for the consumer bank.Although banking was an entirely different industry, he saw similarities to the restaurant business. “One is share of throat, the other is share of wallet.” By the time he left in 2009, he had been promoted to chief executive of the Asia-Pacific division.With his 50th birthday looming, Mr Banga started to think seriously about what he wanted to do with the rest of his career. He considered teaching but couldn’t resist the urge to run a public company. So when a headhunter called him at his Hong Kong home late one night to talk about becoming the chief operating officer of MasterCard, he was intrigued. He flew to Connecticut in March 2009 and met Mr Selander at his home. The two talked for five hours. Mr Banga came away thinking that “this was a job that used all of my skills, yet wasn’t something I had done before”.The clincher: when the board offered Mr Banga the job, it promised to promote him to chief executive by June 30, when Mr Selander, who had run the company for 13 years, planned to retire from day-to-day management. Just to be sure, Mr Banga negotiated a $4.2m signing bonus that would have been his if MasterCard failed to make good on its promise.Mr Banga’s accomplishments have certainly been financially rewarding. At a time when compensation has come under scrutiny, his $13.5m pay package means he is earning more than the heads of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. And although success runs in the family – Mr Banga’s older brother Vindi was a former Unilever executive who now works for the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice – Mr Banga does not take it lightly. “To join Citi 14 years ago as a lower-level executive in India and end up as one of the top people at the company, that’s pretty good,” he says.
526;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-08-29T19:06:05Z;US consumers split into two camps;;Consumer spending in the US has turned into a tale of two cities in 2010, with an entire segment of consumers splurging confidently on the finer things in life, while another segment, concerned about unemployment and with little or no discretionary income, spends only on bare necessities.This bifurcation of the US consumer has become apparent across the spectrum, from restaurants and grocery stores to products such as coffee and beer.In each case, a consistent trend has emerged: people who have survived the worst of the economic downturn of 2008-2009 with secure jobs are spending the way that consumers normally spend at the tail end of a recession. But unlike the circumstances after previous US recessions, where spending rebounded across the board, an entire segment of American consumers has been left behind.Steven Burd, chief executive of the Safeway supermarket chain, described the situation in an earnings call with analysts last month.“There are some people that still feel challenged and there are others that don’t,” Mr Burd said in response to a question about consumer spending. “There’s an element of the economy [where people] haven’t been laid off, it’s been two-plus years, they’re comfortable it’s not going to happen [and there’s been] some recovery in their investment portfolio.“They feel safe. They’re starting to spend. And then you’ve got another chunk of the economy that isn’t quite in the same position. So I think really consumer behaviour is a bit bifurcated here”.Safeway’s same-store sales declined in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier results. Whole Foods, a pricier chain of grocery stores offering organic products, reported an 8.8 per cent increase in same-store sales for its most recent quarter compared with 2009.“At least over the past year asset prices have rebounded and that helps high income individuals that would seem to align with the gut instinct that the upper end is spending and the lower end isn’t,” says Michael Feroli, economist at JPMorgan.Sung Won Sohn, professor of economics at California State University and vice-chairman of Forever 21, the retailer, describes it as “barbell” shaped behaviour by consumers.“People with money are not accelerating spending but are spending probably at the same levels as they have in the past – Mercedes and BMW are still going well,” says Mr Sohn. “But the middle-income folks in America have become extremely value-conscious.”With the exception of McDonald’s, most low-priced fast-food restaurant chains have posted weak growth in the US in 2010. Large food companies, including Kraft and PepsiCo, have also struggled with domestic sales.By contrast, same-store sales at higher-end restaurant chains such as Starbucks, Panera and Chipotle – where prices are higher than at fast-food outlets – have grown this year.At the high end of the restaurant category, steak house chain Morton’s reported an increase in quarterly sales earlier this year.At a time when US unemployment is 9.5 per cent, and a similar-sized chunk of the workforce is underemployed or not showing up on the unemployment rolls, there’s a huge divide among consumers, says Al Moffatt, chief executive of Worldwide Partners, a network of owner-operated ad agencies.“You’ll be around employed people, and it’s like, what recession?” Mr Moffatt says. “It’s incredibly well disguised. There’s some conspicuous consumption, but people skimp in other areas”.Conventional wisdom holds that in a down economy, cash-strapped beer drinkers are likely to trade down for cheaper malt beverages, but that rule does not appear to be in effect in the US this year.“Selected brands are doing well, but the whole low end is doing poorly now,” says Bump Williams, a Connecticut-based beer industry consultant. So far this year, shipments of beer in the US are down 2.6 per cent, Mr Williams says.The exception is in the high end of the beer sector where selected imports and super-premium beers are growing. The craft brewing segment, which includes speciality beers that come in 750ml bottles, is growing at a 15 per cent clip in 2010, Mr Williams says.
527;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-08-22T21:08:35Z;The real market for fake brands;;The 2007 film Superbad showed some heavy underage drinking. But its makers were faced with a problem. “Obviously, no booze company in the world wants their products to be associated with that,” says Burbank-based graphic designer Ted Haigh. “So I had to come up with 500 labels for bottles that gave a sense of the real thing.Much of Mr Haigh’s work involves inventing fictitious brands for films and television. These might be anything from snack products that get a few seconds in the background to full-blown corporations that characters work for.These ersatz brands are surprisingly ubiquitous. For example, The Terminator film franchise gave us Cyberdyne Systems, while the television show Lost features Oceanic Airlines. Meanwhile, the cartoon show The Simpsons has an entire invented brandscape – ranging from the Kwik-E-Mart to Duff Beer to the Canyonero car.“If you can use something real, it’s great,” says Mr Haigh, “but that’s not always possible.”Indeed, although product placement is rife, there are any number of reasons why producers might want to use a fictional brand. For example, if you need to use a delivery truck for a heist, UPS is unlikely to want its logo on the side. Similarly, many companies do not take kindly to their products being lampooned.In many countries, there are strict rules covering product placement. The BBC, for example, is not allowed to give brands undue prominence, so the writers and script editors come up with names that are then checked to find out if they really exist. As the corporation says: “If you need an estate agent, you make it up.”In commercial television, producers may want to invent brands so that the products used in the show do not clash with the adverts. If the broadcaster is running commercials for Pepsi during the breaks, it might look odd if everyone is drinking Coca-Cola on the programme.Fictitious brands might also be needed if the programme or film is set in the past or future and requires period brands.Sometimes, however, it is simply more fun to make up a brand.Mike Judge’s 2006 satire Idiocracy features a sports performance drink that is used for everything from irrigating crops to nursing infants. It is called Brawndo, The Thirst Mutilator. The Simpsons has done similar things with the Krusty the Clown franchise, which is a sort of borderline credible parody of a children’s TV brand.When ideas for brands go through a vetting process to ensure that they do not exist in the real world, some products and services can be much harder than others. Mr Haigh says that telecommunications companies are especially difficult because virtually every permutation of “com” and “tel” has already been taken.With that cinematic mainstay, the large evil corporation, you may just want something that sounds generic – as many real corporations do. Usually, he says, you come up with several names and hope one will pass legal and creative muster. Then you design the graphics around them.“What makes these virtual brands work is that people believe them in the context they see them,” says Max Raison, director of brand strategy at Interbrand, the brand consultancy. In some ways, he adds, the effect you are aiming for is the opposite of the kind of glaring product placement in films such as Casino Royale. If you get it absolutely right, adds Mr Haigh, people may even remember it as a brand they have seen elsewhere.But while some people may believe fake brands are real, one man is doing his best to make fake brands really real. Pete Hottelet is the chief executive of Omni Consumer Products (the name comes from the fictional company in the film Robocop). In 2007, he launched Brawndo, The Thirst Mutilator, which had previously only existed on screen. “I contacted Fox, found the right person and put a proposal together,” he says. “Then I had to figure out how to make a beverage and have it canned and meet legal requirements – it took about a year.”He attributes its success to the fact that “you have a brand that comes with a ready-made market”. Since Brawndo, he has gone on to breath life into Tru Blood (a drink from the vampire series, True Blood, pictured above) and Sex Panther Cologne (from the film Anchorman). The company is shortly to launch Stay Puft Marshmallows, which first appeared in Ghostbusters in 1984.Mr Hottelet used to work in advertising but, he says “this is now what I spend 90 per cent of my time doing. We watch movies and TV shows and if we see a product we like, we make enquiries.” The result is a strange and decidedly 21st-century phenomenon: “We call it defictionalisation – it’s like product placement in reverse.”
528;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-08-17T21:22:25Z;Florida output forecast dents orange juice;;The forthcoming orange crop in Florida, the world’s second-largest producing region, will be more than 10 per cent larger than last season, according to two closely watched private sector forecasts.The new production outlook sent the price of frozen concentrated orange juice futures to a three-month low, but on Tuesday prices rebounded slightly.Orange juice is a $20bn industry with prices affecting farmers in Florida and Brazil, processors, trading houses and bottlers such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.Florida is the world’s second-largest orange growing area after São Paulo state in Brazil. But its orange crop has dwindled as disease and real estate development have taken their toll. The state’s most recent crop was 18 per cent lower than the previous season.“All that seems to have come to a halt, at least for now,” said Sterling Smith, analyst at brokers Country Hedging. “Now we’re looking at maybe crops improving.” Citrus Consulting International on Monday said that the southern US state would grow 154m boxes of oranges in the 2010-11 growing year.Louis Dreyfus, the French trading house that is among the largest citrus processors, pegged the harvest at 149m boxes, according to Reuters. Both forecasts are 10 per cent bigger than last year’s crop of 133.6m boxes. A box weighs 90lb, or 41kg.Elizabeth Steger, a closely followed analyst who is president of Citrus Consulting, told the Financial Times that she expected Florida’s groves to yield more oranges in 2010-11.“The number of fruit per tree is higher than last year. That’s the reason [for the optimistic forecast].”ICE September frozen concentrated orange juice rose 1.4 per cent to $1.3640 per pound.On Monday, prices had fallen below $1.33 a pound, the cheapest price since May. Futures have gained 10 per cent this year.The contract for delivery in January – well into next year’s growing season – rose 1.2 per cent to $1.40 per pound.Mr Smith warned that demand remained soft for orange juice as consumers shunned carbohydrates. The average American now consumes less than four gallons of orange juice a year, down from almost six gallons in the late-1990s, according to the USDA.In spite of warnings of an active Atlantic hurricane season, what storms have appeared have so far spared Florida’s citrus industry.Brazil’s citrus crop is seeing its worst harvest in seven years because of bad weather and disease, according to Cutrale of Brazil, the world’s largest orange juice producer.The weather in January prompted a brief price spike as market participants feared widespread crop damage. But Ms Steger said any long-term impact of the frost would be limited to “just a few areas in the east and the west” in Florida, and blossoms there will eventually recover.Base metals and oil rallied as investors recovered some risk appetite. Copper for delivery in three months’ time was up 1.85 per cent at $7,383 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. Nymex September West Texas Intermediate oil rose 53 cents to settle at $75.77 a barrel. Brent closed at $76.93, up $1.30.
529;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Ginseng for trams;North Korea makes the Czechs an offer they can refuse;"Parties to a barter deal usually want one of two things: goods they can readily consume; or goods they can readily sell. It is not immediately clear that 20 tonnes of North Korean ginseng meet either criterion for Czech citizens.There is, no doubt, much to recommend this invigorating root, said to improve memory, stamina and libido. But it would take the Czechs roughly 14 years to work their way through such a quantity, with imponderable consequences for the nation’s fertility rate. Meanwhile, the main international market for ginseng is in Taiwan. So North Korea, which has offered the Czechs the ginseng as payment for Soviet-era debts incurred buying heavy machinery, faces an uphill task in sealing the deal.It is easy to see why North Korea resorts to barter to pay off its debts. The Democratic People’s Republic is an enthusiastic printer of dollars; but it doesn’t have much money that would pass muster with its creditors. There are plenty of examples of cash-strapped states seeking to barter commodities rather than pay in cash. Cuba compensates Venezuela for oil by sending doctors to aid the Bolivarian revolution. In 2009, the Democratic Republic of Congo mortgaged a share of its natural resources for $6bn-worth of infrastructure from China.Bartering is not the preserve of states. PepsiCo dealt with the non-convertibility of the Soviet rouble by taking its profits out of Russia in the form of vodka. And in the UK, quick-thinking pubs seeking to redecorate offered to swap free pints for gewgaws such as cacti.There are limits to the magic of bartering: it requires a coincidence of need. Without this, one party must accept a discount in return for lumbering the counterparty with something he does not really want. Pricing can be arbitrary.However, this offers opportunities for the enterprising arbitrageur. In 14 trades in 2006, a Canadian transformed a paperclip into a house. Maybe there is hope for North Korea, after all."
530;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Sara Lee head steps down after stroke;;Brenda Barnes, chairman and chief executive of Sara Lee, the US food and household goods group, has left her job for health reasons.Ms Barnes, 56, became a symbol of the challenges facing working mothers in the late 1990s when she resigned from a senior position at PepsiCo to spend more time with her children. She has been on medical leave since May, when she suffered a stroke, according to the company.Sara Lee’s board of directors has begun the search for a new chief executive. Among possible internal candidates are Marcel Smits, the former chief financial officer who is serving as interim chief executive, and Christopher John Fraleigh, the chief executive of the company’s North American retail and food service divisions.James Crown, an independent director who took over Ms Barnes’ duties as chairman after she became ill, will continue in that role.“We fully support Brenda’s decision to step down as chairman and CEO so she can devote all of her time and energy toward improving her health,” said Mr Crown in a statement released by the company. “She is a remarkable leader who is admired by those inside and outside of the Sara Lee family.”Under the leadership of Ms Barnes, who became chief executive in 2005, Sara Lee sold a wide range of businesses and focused on food products and household goods, with an emphasis on personal hygiene products. Most of its revenues come from North America and Europe.The company’s share price fell from about $22 when Ms Barnes took over into the single-digits at the height of the recession in early 2009, before rebounding in 2010. Shares were flat in midday trading on Monday at $14.84Ms Barnes’ retirement from Sara Lee ends three months of speculation about her role. When she went on medical leave in May, the company did not provide any details about her condition. In mid-June, Sara Lee disclosed that Ms Barnes was recovering from a stroke.In 1997, Ms Barnes – who had been on a fast-track management career at PepsiCo – surprised her colleagues by announcing that she was quitting her job to spend more time with her children. The decision put Ms Barnes briefly in the national limelight.For seven years, she stayed in touch with the corporate world, serving as a board member and business school lecturer, before taking a senior executive position at Sara Lee in 2004 and becoming chief executive the following year.
531;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Venezuela: Bolivarian bravado;‘He will not leave power voluntarily. This is a president whose motto is “fatherland, socialism or death”’;"The giant Pepsi globe that once loomed above Plaza Venezuela in the traffic-clogged heart of Caracas had long been a landmark of the South American capital’s skyline. Now it is gone, dismantled piece by piece in June.Much like the demolition of a statue of Christopher Columbus in the same square six years earlier, its removal was a crude symbol of President Hugo Chávez’s self-appointed role as the region’s anti-US, anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist standard-bearer.It was also a reminder of faded hopes that relations would improve either with the US under President Barack Obama, following the mutual antagonism of the George W. Bush era; or with America’s closest ally in the region, neighbouring Colombia. If anything, Mr Chávez has raised the volume of his nationalist-Marxist rhetoric as his problems have grown both at home and abroad.In July, when Colombian leaders again accused Venezuela of sheltering Marxist guerrillas intent on destabilising their country, and were confident enough of their case to present it to the Organization of American States, Mr Chávez promptly called it an act of US-inspired “aggression” and broke off relations with Bogotá. Havana, which receives subsidised Venezuelan oil in return for medical services, lent Caracas rhetorical support: “We strive for peace and harmony,” said President Raúl Castro. “But …let no one have the least doubt on which side Cuba will stand.’’Meanwhile, with the country in recession, red-hued government propaganda in multiple media hails Mr Chávez’s “Bolivarian revolution”. The president has taken to expounding how it is “bad to be rich” – though one graffito snipes back from a grimy Caracas wall: “If it’s bad to be rich, it’s worse to be poor.”All this might otherwise be ignored as the bitter internal politics of a volatile tropical republic were it not for Venezuela’s strategic importance and fears that Mr Chávez might consolidate his grip on power at legislative elections next month.“Elections are of great importance for Chávez. They give him legitimacy both at home and abroad – they give him an air of respectability,” says Teodoro Petkoff, a garrulous former leftist guerrilla who now edits the Caracas-based newspaper Tal Cual.A clear victory for Mr Chávez’s United Socialist party of Venezuela at the September 26 polls would be likely to herald further radicalisation of his socialist project, ease the way for his election to a third six-year term in 2012 and thus boost worries elsewhere about regional tensions.Watching the results most closely will be neighbours in the Andes – a regional tinderbox, given the prevalence of clashing ideologies, well-equipped troops and armed guerrilla and paramilitary groups – and Cuba, as Venezuela’s closest ideological ally.A further geopolitical consideration stems from Venezuela’s role as transshipment point for what is said to be more than half the cocaine shipped across the Atlantic to Europe every year. The country’s trafficking situation is deteriorating, the UN warns in its latest World Drugs Report.Also watching the election closely will be those energy importers who ogle the country’s vast crude oil reserves, the largest outside the Middle East. As those reserves are easily accessible and use proved technologies, BP’s deep-water oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has heightened their strategic value still further. That is as true for the US, which remains Venezuela’s biggest single oil market, as for rising energy users such as China, which recently curried favour as well as securing future oil supplies with a $20bn soft loan to Caracas.With term limits abolished following a referendum last year, Mr Chávez has frequently expressed a wish to remain in office until 2021 – the 200th anniversary of independence from Spain – to see through his revolution. Yet, after 11 years in power, the extent to which he has succeeded in instilling in voters a mindset compatible with what he calls “21st century socialism” is debatable. (For example, he has condemned a widespread fondness for whiskey and Hummers.)The government has therefore been working to boost its chances of maintaining in September the two-thirds majority necessary to push legislation through the National Assembly.Changes to the electoral system this year mean rural areas will return more deputies than before, hindering the metropolitan-based opposition. State-owned media can meanwhile drench the country in pro-government propaganda. (While newspapers such as Mr Petkoff’s are highly critical, private sector broadcasters have been largely cowed into submission.)Most unsettling of all is the possibility that Mr Chávez’s party might lose the vote yet still maintain effective control. In 2008, for example, the president res­ponded to the election of an opposition candidate as Caracas mayor by inventing a more senior post and ap­pointing a candidate of his choosing.Another possibility, much discussed in the capital, is that he could rule by decree during the 100 days between the elections and the new deputies taking up their seats, changing irrevocably the legal landscape to his liking. A recent 40 per cent pay rise ensures the army’s loyalty.“Chávez will not leave power voluntarily,” says Diego Arria, a leading opposition figure and former governor of Caracas. “This is a president whose motto is: ‘fatherland, socialism or death’. When they say death they mean us, not themselves.”Such drastic outcomes may never come to pass. Despite the recession, crumbling public services, a series of damaging scandals and rampant violent crime, Mr Chávez still commands the support of about two in every five Venezuelans – roughly the same ap­proval rating as Mr Obama in the US.In large part, this is due to his emotional bond with the poor, who in 2008 made up 28 per cent of the population, according to the UN. “Even with hunger and unemployment, I’m sticking with Chávez,” runs one refrain popular in the capital’s slums.Gregory Wilpert, editor of pro-Chávez website Venezuelanalysis.com, emphasises that many have benefited from the government-run social programmes. “The process of devolving local governance to communities via the communal councils and other forms of participation also gives many people a real feeling of being a part of the political process,” he adds. Critics say such councils usurp the power of elected municipal governments.…Either way, to gain a decisive victory, Mr Chávez will need to win over undecided voters – the ni-nis, or neither-nors – who account for about one in three of the electorate, according to polls.In 2006, when he was re-elected at the peak of both his popularity and the oil price boom, that problem was partly solved by throwing money around. The trouble for “chavistas” today is that there is less to spend. This year, for example, while the rest of the region is expected to grow by 5.2 per cent, Venezuela’s economy is forecast to shrink by 3 per cent, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America estimates. Inflation, meanwhile, is running at about 30 per cent.Paradoxically, because oil prices are hovering around $80 a barrel, a healthy level historically, government finances are not in perilous shape. Rather, the main cause of the continuing recession is mismanagement – the biggest rock on which Mr Chávez’s revolution has floundered.PDVSA, the state-owned oil company that is the dynamo of the economy, has been leached to fund social projects with cash that otherwise would have been used for much-needed investment. The non-oil economy has been hobbled too.Capital flight has been propelled by the nationalisation drive Mr Chávez has launched in a range of sectors, including energy, finance and telecommunications. Attempts to prevent such flight have made matters worse. The rationing of foreign exchange has made importing harder, fuelling scarcity, inflation and a flourishing black market – dollars sell for about four times the cheapest official rate.The multinationals that once made the country their regional base, attracted by its relative stability and large internal market, have upped sticks. A web of regulations has tightened around those private companies that have remained – most publicly at Polar, the food and beverage company that is an emblem of Venezuelan popular culture, which Mr Chávez has threatened to nationalise against union wishes. Private investment has slumped amid the deteriorating business climate. As for nationalised companies, the state has been unable to pick up the slack.Since nationalisation in 2008, production in the cement sector has fallen 20 per cent, and in the steel sector by as much as 80 per cent, according to Caracas-based consultancy Ecoanalítica. Most embarrassing of all were the 100,000 tonnes of food found recently rotting in the warehouses of state-run food distribution network PDVAL. Mr Chávez blamed “US-backed fascist oligarchs”.The opposition has failed to capitalise on such problems. One reason is that much of the electorate remains distrustful following early at­tempts to unseat the president including a botched coup in 2002 and a national strike that paralysed the economy.The opposition has also made errors such as a boycott of the last legislative elections in 2005 that left the government in control of the National Assembly. A final factor is that many of its candidates are drawn from two discredited parties, Democratic Action and the Social Christians, which once dominated the country’s politics.Dissidents from Mr Chávez’s party and former personal allies pose a potential threat. But some of the most prominent opponents have been hounded out of the country or imprisoned. General Raúl Baduel, a former close friend who called the president a “traitor” has been controversially jailed for corruption.…All this has devalued Mr Chávez’s reputation abroad. He still enjoys occasional celebrity support, from Argentine footballer Diego Maradona and Hollywood film producer Oliver Stone, for example. Oil also ensures Caracas secures the odd multibillion-dollar deal – most notably an arms agreement with Moscow, after the US stopped selling weapons to Venezuela in 2006. Caracas and Havana remain locked in a symbiotic embrace. But the president’s vision retains little credence with the region’s leftwing, and many of the area’s leaders and diplomats are embarrassed by his virulent rhetoric and off-colour jokes.Mr Chávez has thus failed to bring closer to reality the Latin American union he espouses in evocations of his 19th century independence hero, Simón Bolívar. Sometimes, as when he closed the frontier with Colombia, he has worked against it.Yet his command of Venezuela – its economy, army and institutions, including the judiciary – has never been stronger. There is therefore every chance that Mr Chávez, whose political style tends towards confrontation rather than negotiation, will endure. ¡Venceremos! – “we will conquer” – as the former tank commander is fond of saying."
532;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-08-03T22:14:24Z;US food and drinks groups drawn to Russia;PepsiCo, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola to keep investing in country;The promise of the Russian consumer market has emerged as a big theme of earnings reports from US food and drinks companies, with PepsiCo, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola all singing its praises in their review of second-quarter results.The positive comments last week stand in contrast with the announcement by ConocoPhillips, the US energy group, that it was selling its stake in Lukoil, the Russian oil company.PepsiCo, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola all said they planned to keep investing in Russia.McDonald’s, for example, is planning to open 45 restaurants in Russia this year and add drive-through windows to many of its existing outlets.“Russia has been one of our top investment markets for capital expenditures,” McDonald’s said.PepsiCo also expressed optimism about a market where it has operated since 1959, when Russia was part of the Soviet Union.With sales of more than $2bn a year, PepsiCo is the largest multinational food and beverage company in Russia.“It’s the largest consumer goods market in Europe,” said Zein Abdalla, PepsiCo Europe chief executive. “You have 140m consumers with some of the world’s largest oil reserves. That’s a formula for success.”In 2008, PepsiCo acquired Lebedyansky, the leading Russian juice company. Mr Abdallah said Russia’s low per-capita consumption of ready-to-drink juices and teas as well as savoury snacks presents a tremendous upside.Sales of Coca-Cola’s flagship brand in Russia grew 19 per cent in the second quarter over the year-earlier period, although Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chief executive, told investors not to expect steady, predictable results.“My 30-plus years’ experience, at that time with the Soviet Union and then later in the last 20 years with Russia, has always been that it is very volatile,” he said. “It goes into deep economic issues . . . and it comes out very quickly.”Vladimir Pantyushin, Russia economist at Barclays Capital, said: “What will determine the continued success of the multinational is the fact that consumers have now put the [financial] crisis behind them and are ready to spend.“In the US and UK and every western country, there are heavy debt levels and consumers are concerned about cleaning up their balance sheet. This is not the case in Russia. The wallet is pretty much open.”

According to Bloomberg, she still holds 449,356 shares of company stock which, at Monday closing price of $65.27 per share, are worth $29.3m.The company’s most recent proxy statement indicates that Ms Nooyi has options to buy another 650,237 shares that are currently exercisable at prices below PepsiCo’s current share price. Ms Nooyi also has options to buy an additional 304,220 shares, but the strike price of that grant is $65 per share – the current market price. The expiration dates for all of these options are spread between January 2012 and January 2017.In addition to her option exercises, Ms Nooyi sold 62,842 “phantom stock units” last month at an average price of $64.21, for an additional $4m.Over the past seven years, PepsiCo insiders have sold more than $715m in stock, while purchasing less than $80,000, according to the website secform4.com. By contrast, over the same period, insiders at Coca-Cola have purchased $83.4m shares of company stock and sold $14.7m.

Verdict:PepsiCo is running a television commercial in the US that resurrects a popular ad from 1995, while trying to make it more relevant by adding a new ending for the digital age.Two truck drivers, a Coca-Cola Zero deliveryman and his Pepsi Max counterpart, happen to meet at a diner, where they bond over a song being played on the jukebox.In the 1995 version, the truck drivers are away from their families during the holidays and share the hardships of their jobs. We get to know and like both men. As a symbol of their bond, each takes a swig of the other one’s drink, but when the Coca-Cola driver refuses to give the Pepsi back, a fight breaks out.The message: Pepsi tastes better than Coke.In the remake, once again a Coke driver and his Pepsi counterpart strike up a conversation after hearing a song on the jukebox. But instead of the foreplay in which they get to know each other better, the new ad moves quickly to the part where they sample each other’s drinks and the Coke driver is smitten with his competitor’s product. After some brief dialogue about product benefits, the Pepsi driver whips out his smartphone, records the Coke driver guzzling a can of Pepsi Max and uploads it to YouTube.

Touted trade buyers include Kellogg, Kraft, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Campbell, which owns the Arnott’s biscuits business in the US. Further afield, there may be interest from Britannia in India, Ulker in Turkey and Meiji in Japan.UB, which has revenues of £1.3bn and net debt of £1.2bn, has continued to expand in spite of the UK recession, increasing operating profits to £223.4m last year.
536;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-07-23T21:40:19Z;Britvic bubbles along in third quarter;;UK soft drinks maker Britvic delivered solid third-quarter results on Friday, with strong marketing and a boost from its newly acquired French subsidiary Fruité keeping the company confident that it will meet full-year expectations on sales growth.Revenue in the quarter to July 4 grew by 16.2 per cent to £289.5m as trading was boosted by a £23.2m contribution from its French soft drinks Fruité business, bought for €237m in May. Revenues over nine months were up 8.5 per cent at £794.8m.Fizzy drinks showed stronger growth than stills during the quarter, with revenue from carbonates up 13.2 per cent on last year, compared with a fall in revenue from stills of 1.4 per cent.Promotion of its Pepsi brand, which it has the right to market and distribute in the UK and Ireland, helped sales of the fizzy cola drink.Britvic said the World Cup had little overall benefit to the company, whose beverages are targeted at consumers in pubs, eateries and retailers for home consumption.Paul Moody, chief executive, said Britvic’s branding skills would help it strengthen its new business in France, which was a strategically important addition to the Britvic group.However, he conceded that the company continues “to remain cautious about consumer sentiment in our trading territories”.The Irish market, which had struggled in previous quarters, managed a 15 per cent increase in volumes during the quarter. But Britvic said the Irish market “remains volatile”, as value continued to decline.The company added that it remained cautious overall that “the latest performance is not indicative of a sustained turnround in the soft drinks market”.Shares have performed well over the past 18 months, and analysts remain positive about the company. Most sentiment continues to be “buy”, although Altium, which recommends “hold”, said Ireland was “likely to remain challenging for the remainder of the year”.Altium said the company’s lack of presence in the smoothie and plain water market meant it was unable to take advantage of a resurgence in these drinks during the hot weather.Shares closed down 13p at 505p.
537;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Coke bucks North American soft drink woes;;Bucking a trend away from carbonated soft drinks in its home market, Coca-Cola reported a 1 per cent increase in sales of its flagship brand in North America for the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago, amid a 5 per cent increase in revenues worldwide.The growth in sales of brand Coca-Cola in the company’s home market arrests a multi-year slide, and distinguishes Coke from its arch-rival Pepsi-Cola which has also suffered declining sales in its home market. According to Beverage Digest, US sales of Coca-Cola dropped 4 per cent in 2009 from the previous year, while Pepsi-Cola sales dropped by 5.5 per cent.The uptick in sales in a market where carbonated full-calorie soft drinks are perceived by many consumers to be major contributors to childhood obesity vindicates the strategy of Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chief executive. For the past two years, Mr Kent has stated his goal of turning round sales of Coke in the US.“Our brands are getting healthier”, Mr Kent said in an interview with the Financial Times. “If you went around to our North American operations three years ago, and visited bottlers, the belief that Coca-Cola could ever grow in America was not there at all. Today, it’s a totally different picture”.Mr Kent credited the company’s focus on innovative packaging and smaller portions for the turnround. Coke’s 90-calorie cans, which are smaller than the normal 12-ounce size, have addressed the concerns among many Americans that kids are drinking too much soda pop.Overall, the Atlanta-based soft drinks company reported a 13 per cent increase in operating profit for the second quarter, to $2.8bn, from the second quarter of 2009. As has been the case in recent quarters, Coke enjoyed its strongest growth in the developing markets of Eurasia, Africa and Latin America.In its Pacific region, Coke had mixed results, with a 6 per cent increase in volume in China offset by a 3 per cent volume decline in Japan. After 26 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in China, tt was the first time since 2004 that Coca-Cola recorded a single-digit increase in the world’s most populous market.Unit case volume in North America rose 2 per cent in the quarter, while Europe lagged behind, with a 1 per cent decline.Net income for the quarter was $2.4bn, up 16 per cent from the prior year’s tally.Mr Kent warned that uncertain economic conditions showed no signs of abating. “The state of the global economy remains uncertain in many regions, affected by ongoing deficit concerns in Europe, recent downward revisions to China’s economy and weakened consumer confidence.”On Tuesday, rival PepsiCo said its quarterly net income had fallen 3 per cent to $1.6bn as sales of its flagship beverage slipped in North America.Shares of Coca-Cola rose by 1.43 per cent to $54 in pre-market trading in New York.
538;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Bottler acquisitions boost PepsiCo revenues;;One of the hottest Junes on record could not rescue sales of carbonated soft drinks in North America for PepsiCo, which announced a 1 per cent decline in sales of its flagship beverage and other drinks for the second quarter of 2010 from the comparable period a year ago, when the weather in its home market was much cooler.In a sign of the trend away from carbonated soft drinks in the US, PepsiCo reported strong growth in its Gatorade energy drinks and Lipton ready-to-drink teas but even those bright spots failed to make up for the continuing decline of fizzy soda pop in the US, a trend that is expected to be felt at Coca-Cola when it announces earnings on Wednesday.In spite of the flat beverage sales overall in North America, analysts considered Pepsi’s performance a success, given the 5.5 per cent decrease in overall beverage sales in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the prior year’s total.“Beverages did very well” for PepsiCo, says Jack Russo of Edward Jones. “Carbonated continues to struggle but Gatorade picked it up. Carbonated soft drinks have been declining for a while and consumers are trying to test other products, watch out for their health, and juices and waters tie in better with that.”Overall, net income at PepsiCo dropped 3 per cent in the second quarter to $1.6bn or 98 cents per share, in spite of a 12 per cent gain in operating profit over the comparable period in 2009 and new revenues from the acquisition of its biggest bottlers. The company absorbed $155m in integration costs associated with the merger in the quarter.Sales of its Frito-Lay snacks grew in North America by a single-digit margin, slightly off what had been expected. “Frito wasn’t the heavyweight fighter we’ve seen in previous quarters”, says Mr Russo.The company enjoyed strong growth in emerging markets, particularly India and China, but Pepsi’s quarterly earnings were hampered by the currency devaluation in Venezuela and currency fluctuations around the world.John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, says the decline of the carbonated soft drink market in the US is unlikely to be reversed unless the biggest players, Coca Cola and Pepsi, can figure out a way to use newly formulated sweeteners to enhance their flagship products’ taste while reducing calories.“Consumer headwinds are strong, but new sweeteners and new sweetener technology offer a promise of hope in this category”, he says.
539;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Cheer over earnings props up shares;But the euro retreats and 2-year Treasuries yields hit new low;"Tuesday 22:10 BST. Traders hold steady as investors are steeled by mostly positive earnings, though still veered away from taking on substantial risk by the fallout from European fiscal difficulties.The FTSE All-World equity index reversed its losses and was up 0.5 per cent, but the dollar bounced off near 10-week lows as its haven attraction trumps concerns about the US economy. The euro was also in retreat and US 2-year Treasury yields hit a new low.Gains appear likely to continue: After the close there was an anticipated agreement by BP to sell $7bn in assets to Apache; that will give backbone to those cheering a potential return of the bid premium to shares. And Apple, which has been going through a rare spell as a laggard, reported stronger-than-expected earnings on the back of brisk sales of iPads and iPhone 4 devices.But the trigger for the session’s early slide appeared to be news highlighting how the stretched budgets of many European nations, and the austerity drives designed to combat them, will place strains on financial systems and negatively affect the corporate sector.The UK’s fiscal situation came into focus following a profit warning from UK-listed telecoms group Cable & Wireless Worldwide. That brought home to investors how the slashing of government spending can hurt company earnings. News that the UK government’s borrowing in June was the highest on record for that month only serves to highlight the extent of cuts to come.In the US, the first substantially negative earnings report, from Goldman Sachs, knocked back sentiment early, as the S&P 500 opened nearly 1.5 per cent lower. However, growing revenues and earnings at IBM and Texas Instruments, plus earnings-forecast beating perormances by PepsiCo and UnitedHealth Group, attracted bargain seekers.Even Goldman Sachs, still the leading trading franchise on Wall Street, was higher later in the session as bargain hunters swooped in. The S&P 500 index was up 1.1 per cent.“The company reports we’ve had so far are inconsistent with the double dip concerns that the markets have been pricing in,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.Yet many of the earnings reports contained notes of caution – notably forecast cuts by Johnson & Johnson and Tupperware, plus below-expectation business sales growth at IBM – that did little to dispel fears that the economy was slowing. Such is the worry about the US and global economy potentially slipping backwards, that some analysts see the Federal Reserve needing to consider further monetary stimuli.Indeed, Mr Schweitzer cautioned: “The strength of corporate profits is what leads me to expect that business hiring and capital spending will improve in the coming months, but it’s not going to be an overnight recovery. There are just too many negatives out there.”In addition, a poorly-received auction of three-month bills by Hungary showed investors are getting increasingly nervous about the stand-off between Budapest and the IMF/EU over the extent of the austerity package relating to the receipt of a €20bn loan. That has hurt the region’s banking stocks, which are seen having significant exposures to eastern european debt.Sales today of debt by Ireland, Spain and Greece have gone fairly well, but then the ECB stands as a backstop for such “peripheral” sovereigns. A six-year UK gilt auction was more of a struggle. US Treasury bonds saw buying in spite of shares rallying after housing starts were said to slow 5 per cent in June (though permits for future potential building did offer some hope).This only highlights the difficulties investors – and governments– know they face in trying to assess a patchwork global economy and thus the markets’ prospects in the medium term.Just north of the border, the Canadian central bank raised interest rates for the second time in six weeks – from 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent – as it seeks to normalise policy as activity rebounds.The move shows that areas of strength persist, a point highlighted today by the Asian Development Bank which, while acknowledging that issues such as the sovereign debt crisis had made the environment more uncertain, raised growth forecasts for most economies in the region.At the same time, Australia and Brazil are struggling over whether to slow their growth or keep their foot on the accelerator. The Australian dollar was higher on speculation of another rate hike, while Brazil’s real was lower (and its stocks higher) after a report showing a more moderate pace of inflation growth led traders to conclude that another rate hike was not necessarily imminent.New US housing data were also received with confusion. New construction was down 5 per cent June, leading homebuilding shares to initially tumble. But shares later rallied as markets focussed on a sub-data point showing permits for future building to be on the rise.● Asia. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index added 0.2 per cent, shrugging off worries about US growth and the poorly-received results overnight from IBM and TI. S&P 500 futures had fallen nearly 1 per cent after the bell in New York following those results, but by the time the Asian session drew to a close the contract had pared losses as investors in the region took a more phlegmatic view of corporate prospects.Shanghai sported its second consecutive good advance, rising 2.2 per cent as traders welcomed signs of currency liberalisation by Beijing. Hong Kong climbed 0.9 per cent, though Tokyo fell 1.2 per cent as Japan played catch-up after being closed for a holiday on Monday.● Europe. Bourses initially responded to Wall Street’s rebound overnight and saw decent gains from the off. However, the austerity worries took their toll as the session progressed and falls accelerated after the Goldman earnings hit the wires.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was only fractionally higher even though miners did well. Banks, which were modestly higher as investors reasoned that the outcome of the eurozone stress tests due on Friday will restore confidence to the sector, faltered later on.The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.2 per cent, led lower by telecoms.● Forex. The dollar rebounded as equities slid. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its peers, was up 0.3 per cent.The euro had earlier reclaimed the $1.30 mark, but the renewed fiscal worries, profit taking and haven trades left the single currency down 0.4 per cent at $1.2891.Notably, the euro seemed to ignore early rumours, based on reports in Spanish media, that all of Spain’s caja savings banks passed the stress tests. That news, if true, could go either way with traders. Either it means that Spain’s troubled lenders are healthier than expected, or that the stress tests were not stressful enough.● Debt. The market faced a deluge of sales, with Spain, Ireland, Greece and the UK auctioning debt of various duration. Eurozone auctions had been considered pretty successful of late, so any disappointing sale could have hit sentiment.Spain, for example, sold €4.3bn of 12-month bills and €1.7bn of 18-month bills, and though the bid-to-cover ratios were slightly lower than seen for an auction last month, so were the yields demanded, a sign of easing investor stress. Spanish 10-year benchmark yields are down 7 basis points at 4.33 per cent.US Treasuries enjoyed demand as traders seek havens. The 10-year yield is down 1 basis point at 2.95 per cent, while the 2-year note earlier hit a new all-time low of 0.5764 per cent. In late trading it had flattened out to 0.5845 per cent.● Commodities. The complex managed a stoic performance given the bond market’s flight from risk. This may partly be the result of the complex’s correlation to sentiment emerging from China, where stocks had another good day. Copper was up 2.7 per cent at $3.01 a pound in New York trading. Oil reversed an early slide, rising 1.2 per cent to $77.44 a barrel, helping to push the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index up 0.1 per cent.Gold was up 0.8 per cent at $1,191 an ounce, having hit a fresh two-month intra-day low of $1,175."
540;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Will taking the long-term view hit shareholder value?;Short-term investing is seen as partly to blame for the financial crisis;"The dangers posed by the financial crisis have some business leaders rethinking the responsibilities of corporations.“Everybody is talking about the new rules of capitalism, [which] are, don’t just think about the company within the four walls of the company; think about your obligations to society,” PepsiCo chair and chief executive Indra Nooyi told the Financial Times at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year.At the heart of this self-reflection is the role of the board of directors and its duties to shareholders.The economic downturn, brought about at least in part by bad corporate decisions, not only destroyed shareholder value, but also hurt other stakeholders such as customers, employees, suppliers and creditors.Yet it is shareholder losses that lawmakers and regulators seem focused on as they write new rules and legislation to give investors more rights.The concern with this is that Washington is giving more power to shareholders who are holding stock for less time and thus demanding a more immediate return on their investment.This can lead to what some say was a major contributor to the recent economic upheaval: a focus on short-term value creation almost to the exclusion of other concerns.One former executive vice-president at a Fortune 500 company and director of three public companies, who requested anonymity, is concerned that corporations are focused on profits with little consideration for social responsibility and the greater good. He says his boardroom meetings are dominated by discussions about moving overseas to save money and he spent years battling with a chief executive over the treatment of employees.“We are privileged to have a capitalist system and legal system that for the most part works and is better than the rest of the world. It deserves some willingness to preserve it,” he says.Companies have already begun to experiment with ways to combat short-
termism, from eliminating quarterly earnings guidance to adopting advance notice bylaws that require activists to disclose more about their trading positions.At the same time, focusing on the short term can have its benefits. It can keep companies accountable, and quarterly earnings can prevent year-end surprises that could cause volatility in the stock market.The question for boards, however, is not so much whether they can encourage a longer-term strategy that takes into consideration the well-being of non-shareholders, but whether they can do so if it comes into conflict with what is best for shareholders. Legal scholars are divided over that question.There is a common perception that Delaware law says the board’s job is to maximise shareholder profit.That interpretation of state law is incorrect, says Lynn Stout, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.Shareholder primacy, the idea that a corporation’s role is to maximise shareholder wealth above all else, has its roots in a 1919 Michigan Supreme Court case, Dodge v. Ford Motor Co. The court ruled that Ford Motor had a responsibility to pay a special dividend rather than save profits to make cheaper cars and pay higher wages. But Ms Stout says the case is largely irrelevant. Delaware courts have cited it only once in the past 30 years.Shareholder primacy has mostly been dealt with by courts when it comes to M&A. Delaware law clearly states that the board must act in the best interests of shareholders when considering mergers and acquisitions, says Stephen Lamb, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and former vice-chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery.“The clearest case is when directors have made a decision to break up the firm or sell it. In that context the law is pretty clear,” he says. It is not that directors should not take into account the interest of stakeholders, but when the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders are in conflict, shareholders’ interests are most important, he says.One way around ambiguity with corporate law is to focus on the interests of long-term shareholders. Ms Stout says in most cases the interests of long-term investors align with what is in the best interests of stakeholders.But Ben Heineman, the former senior vice-president for law and public affairs at General Electric, says looking out for long-term shareholders is not a panacea for creating an ethical corporation. Institutional investors do not always act like owners of individual companies and instead respond to incentives to beat indexed benchmarks, he says.Many institutional investors also follow the voting recommendations of proxy advisory firms, which are sometimes criticised for using short-term metrics to come up with their recommendations.Some well-known business leaders have already taken a stand against short-termism in small but symbolic ways.When A.G. Lafley took over as chief executive of Procter & Gamble in 2000 (he retired this year) he banned television monitors that show ticker prices in public areas of the company’s buildings . However, the company still issues quarterly earnings, illustrating the difficulty companies have making changes to the current system. “Those are the requirements of the market,” a P&G spokesman says.Kristin Gribben is associate editor of Agenda, a Financial Times service"
541;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-07-07T20:14:42Z;Amazon to muscle in on Ocado’s territory;;Ocado’s flotation took a fresh twist on Wednesday when Amazon, the online retail group, said it would begin selling groceries in the UK.Amazon, which already sells groceries online in the US and recently launched in Germany, said it would carry a range of more than 22,000 lines from companies such as Kraft, Pepsi and Procter & Gamble.Ocado, which sells Waitrose food online, has launched an IPO that could value the business at up to £1.1bn ($1.7bn). It hopes to complete the float later this month.“Clearly it’s not helpful,” said Greg Lawless, analyst at Collins Stewart. “But from an initial view it appears more like Costco than Ocado.”Marks and Spencer uses Amazon to run its online shopping site. It has yet to develop a full food offering online, but this is expected to be one of the initiatives spearheaded by its new chief executive Marc Bolland.Analysts at Investec recently called on M&S to drop Amazon and team up with Ocado, but this has been scuppered by Ocado’s new and exclusive 10-year deal with Waitrose.Ocado on Wednesday declined to comment on Amazon’s move. But people close to the company shrugged off the potential threat, indicating that Amazon would not be able to provide a weekly shop, consolidated into one delivery, to be dispatched in a one-hour time slot, as Ocado does.They said Amazon’s move highlighted the attractiveness of the online grocery market. “It just shows that this is an exciting sector and they think it is worth going into,” said one person familiar with the situation.Amazon said customers would be able to order goods via the company from third-party vendors, which would be dispatched separately. However, customers ordering directly from Amazon could have items consolidated into one delivery.“It is early days for the grocery store, and we will continue to work on expanding selection for our customers,” Amazon said.Ocado said on Tuesday that it would press ahead with its initial public offering, which will see shares in the company priced at between 200p and 275p, valuing the equity at between £800m and £1.1bn.The float has divided opinion in the City because Ocado has yet to make an operating profit. In its prospectus published on Tuesday, Ocado highlighted competition from traditional supermarkets and other online grocers as a potential risk, but did not mention Amazon.

Reorganising the company’s portfolio as it looks for new revenue streams is also among the tasks the former GMG finance director faces, as he steers the group’s digital transformation.As finance director of Trader Media Group, Mr Miller played a significant role in the sale of a 49.9 per cent stake of TMG – which owns Auto Trader – to Apax, the private equity group, in 2007. Now as the head of GMG, he will need to consider a possible sale of the TMG business.A law graduate of Edinburgh University, Mr Miller joined PwC as a trainee accountant in 1988.During the 1990s, he worked in various consumer groups as finance director, including Procter & Gamble, Bass and PepsiCo.He joined TMG in 2002 before becoming GMG’s chief financial officer in 2009.Married with three children, he lives in Newbury and enjoys skiing and hillwalking.
543;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-06-22T03:08:18Z;Plea to stop using trans-fats;;Food manufacturers and restaurants should stop using trans-fats and sharply reduce the use of salt and saturated fats in their products to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, the government’s health advisory body said on Monday.The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) said tens of thousands of lives by dietary changes.The agency said that 6m adults suffer from cardiovascular disease in the UK with conditions including heart disease and strokes, and 40,000 die prematurely as a result each year, but simple changes to diet, smoking and physical activity could bring about significant reductions.The recommendations carry no force and would need new legislation to become obligatory, although a number of local authorities have already taken some action reflecting the findings.Such moves mirror action already taken in other parts of the world, such as Japan, Finland and the US, where New York City has banned trans-fats and launched aggressive public health measures to reduce the risks in food. Companies including Pepsi have also taken action in response to growing demand for healthier products.Alongside a ban on trans-fats, the Nice guidelines call for a maximum intake of salt of 6g per day for adults by 2015 and 3g daily by 2025, a “substantial” reduction in hidden saturated fat, and efforts to ensure that these healthier foods are sold more cheaply than the alternatives.It recommends restricting television advertisements for unhealthy foods until after 9pm to protect children, planning restrictions to limit fast-food outlets, and “traffic light” labelling to warn of less healthy food.Professor Klim McPherson from Oxford who chaired the Nice group developing the guidelines said: “Where food is concerned, we want the healthy choice to be the easy choice. Going even further, we want the healthy choice to be the less expensive, more attractive choice.”The Department of Health said: “It is not practical to implement certain proposals in this guidance, for example on the mandatory use of traffic lights alongside GDA in food labelling. It is extremely important that work by Nice is methodologically robust and includes fully workable proposals.”
544;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-06-16T21:54:18Z;Oil has become the new tobacco;Corporations’ reserves make them ‘deep pockets’;"When Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, testifies to the US Congress on Thursday about the company’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, he will be only the latest corporate leader in the Washington hot seat.A lot is made in the UK of the fact that Mr Hayward is British and runs a UK-listed company, as if it accounts for the political anger that has exploded at BP over its failure to cap the gusher left behind by the Deepwater Horizon rig. In reality, nationalism has little to do with it – the sound and fury would be just as intense had it been ExxonMobil.The heads of Goldman Sachs, Moody’s, Toyota and other corporate sinners have been paraded in Congress in recent months, with little sign that being a US company confers an advantage. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman was born in the Bronx but he was treated as contemptuously as if he had worn a monocle, top hat and tails.The contest on show on Thursday – also evident in President Barack Obama’s televised address to his nation from the Oval Office this week – will not be Americans against Brits but US politicians, channelling the mood of voters, versus big corporations.For a time, it looked as if public anger over the financial crisis of two years ago would be confined to Wall Street banks. But the gulf spill raises a broader threat to companies and shareholders. Oil is becoming the new tobacco and other industries could well be next.If chief executives were brought to Washington merely to be humiliated, investors would not care. But the pressure on BP to suspend dividends to shareholders and put $20bn into an escrow fund for compensation and clean-up before anyone knows what it will cost is ominous.It has echoes of the 1998 tobacco settlement in which the industry paid $246bn to states following legal action by their attorneys-general. Only 5 per cent of that money was spent on tobacco-related initiatives, with Virginia, for example, investing in higher education, fibreoptic cables and research into energy.Willie Sutton, the robber, sagely observed that he raided banks because that was where the money was, and US politicians know this lesson well. The voters do not have a lot since they are recovering from a loss of paper wealth in the housing bust and governments around the world (as well as US states) face yawning budget deficits.Who does have cash? Large, dividend-paying corporations such as BP. They include energy producers and utilities; consumer goods brands; food, drink and drugs companies – all of the mature businesses that cluster in indexes such as the FTSE 100 and the Standard and Poor’s 500.Adam Posen of the Bank of England monetary policy committee has pointed out that UK companies hold financial surpluses equal to 8 per cent of gross domestic product. Industrial companies in the S&P 500 had a record $836bn in cash in March, according to Howard Silverblatt, an S&P index analyst.Cash matters to investors. The S&P’s “Dividend Aristocrats” index of reliable dividend payers in the S&P 500 includes Exxon, McDonald’s, PepsiCo and Walmart, and S&P estimates that dividends have made up a third of total shareholder returns since 1926.These reserves also make corporations what lawyers call “deep pockets” – defendants that are worth suing because they can afford to pay large sums in compensation. The tactics of Congress and Mr Obama against BP are reminiscent of tort lawyers, who are big funders of the Democrats.It is now clear that BP not only took needless risks before the rig explosion, but was unprepared for the environmental disaster that followed. It is responsible for cleaning up the damage and for meeting fair compensation claims, as it has readily conceded.Instead of sticking with the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, passed after the Exxon Valdez disaster, Washington has moved to impose punitive damages. At one point, politicians were telling BP to pay wages to all oil workers laid off as a result of Mr Obama’s suspension of gulf drilling, including those employed by others.Meanwhile, in his address, Mr Obama proposed an effort to reverse decades of gulf coast environmental degradation that had nothing to do with BP. If the tobacco settlement is any guide, that will not stop states trying to raid the escrow fund – BP’s initial payouts to Alabama, Florida and Mississippi already have a pork-barrel flavour to them.Other companies may look at all this and believe that they and their investors are liability-free because they have not spilled oil in the gulf, sold cigarettes, made cars that do not brake or constructed synthetic collateralised debt obligations.That would be a mistake. Many of S&P’s dividend aristocrats rely on the goodwill of consumers and politicians to keep accumulating cash for payouts. The mood following the bail-out of Wall Street is now so hostile to corporations, and public budgets so strained, that any slip would make them vulnerable.Robert Reich, the former US labour secretary who wants the US government to put BP into temporary receivership although many of its investors are UK-based, defines the affair as a “contest between citizenship interests and shareholder interests”.That sounds good but most people are both. Investors and pensioners, both in the UK and the US, depend on BP and other dividend aristocrats for retirement. If politicians strip the aristocrats’ assets, the citizens will eventually pay for it.john.gapper@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/gapper"
545;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-06-14T20:54:19Z;The age of ‘Indovation’ dawns;;When Armin Bruck, managing director of Siemens in India, set out to convince the board of the German engineering company of the potential of Indian innovation, he gave them the keys to a Tata Nano. He wanted to convey the “smell and feel” of a revolutionary mass market product and to persuade his company that it should improve its pipeline of local inventions aimed at Indian consumers. So, in February, Peter Löscher, the company’s chief executive, and his colleagues Heinrich Heisinger and Joe Kaeser piled into the world’s cheapest car – priced at $2,000 (€1,630, £1,350) – and drove round New Delhi.The test drive fortified Siemens’ effort to reconfigure its strategy for developing its high-quality engineering technology for low-cost emerging markets. After all, if it could be achieved by an Indian company with a car, why couldn’t the same approach be taken by Europe’s biggest engineering company with iron and steel making equipment, electricity generators and rail carriages?The technological race for India and China’s growing markets among multinationals like Siemens and General Electric, and lesser known local companies like Larsen & Toubro, Bharat Heavy Electricals, Delta and Neusoft, is hotting up fast.Within three months of that February visit, Siemens had declared publicly its intention to develop more than 80 “base level” products – targeted at financially constrained mass markets – with an investment of €3bn ($3.7bn, £2.5bn) in India, China, Russia and Brazil over the next three years. The strategy was first agreed five years ago but has gained momentum under Mr Löscher’s leadership. Across a range of products, including wind power generators and medium voltage switchgear, invention and simplification in India is slashing product development costs by as much as 70 per cent.Siemens expects to raise its order book 10-fold in India from these redesigned products during the next decade to €1bn a year. It also foresees double-digit profitability from the low-cost, high-quality strategy – what in India is called “frugal engineering”.Siemens is concentrating its emerging market innovation efforts in India and China, the world’s fastest growing big economies. India alone is receiving a €1bn investment to develop and adapt products for the local market. Siemens’ Mumbai-based subsidiary, which employs 17,000 people, is working on 42 products that in time will be produced and sold in India and exported to other emerging markets.Among the prototypes, most of which remain secret, are solar powered X-ray machines, fetal heart monitors, steam turbines and road traffic management systems.Siemens’ top executives argue that the company has to be more dominant in emerging markets, which already account for a third of group revenues, to head off growing competition from Chinese and Indian rivals.“These products require a different kind of innovation,” says Mr Löscher. “What counts here is simplicity, not sophistication.”Other multinational companies operating in the power and healthcare sectors have drawn the same conclusions. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch fast-moving consumer goods company, was one of the first to adopt a successful localisation strategy in India. Others are now following.John Flannery, president of GE India, describes his company as having to make a 180-degree shift to understand what the local customer wants. GE’s focus is on what he calls “unstoppable industry trends” to address India’s chronic energy shortfall and healthcare, driven by rising consumption and a young demographic.Mr Flannery talks about “migrating processes” from the US so that products are designed and manufactured in India, with a view to introducing them to developed markets in what GE calls “reverse innovation”.In a 2009 paper for the Harvard Business Review, Jeffrey Immelt, GE’s chief executive, and Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, described two products – “a $1,000 handheld electrocardiogram device and a portable, PC-based ultrasound machine that sells for as little as $15,000” – as “revolutionary”. The devices were small and relatively inexpensive and they were originally “developed for markets in emerging economies (the ECG device for rural India and the ultrasound machine for rural China) and are now being sold in the US”.Some analysts warn that the manufacture of cheaper machines in India may eventually prove disruptive in developed markets, but Siemens insists its strategy makes cold-eyed business sense. The company’s strongest growth is among base-level products in fast-growing large economies.At the core of Siemens’ emerging markets strategy are two acknowledgements. First is the recognition that Siemens engineers in Germany are ill-equipped to understand the needs of the developing world consumer. Mr Bruck says that a German train engineer, familiar with the smooth tracks of his home country and the light demands of 1.9bn passengers a year on the Deutsche Bahn, can barely comprehend Indian conditions where tracks are bumpy and at least 20m people travel on the national rail network a day. He tells of how visiting German engineers, for example, have been aghast to discover that Mumbai’s overloaded commuter trains have no doors.Indian executives at Siemens spotted their opportunity, describing high-end European products as “over-engineered”. Hemant Usgaonkar, works manager of the Siemens X-ray plant in Goa, says the challenge for the headquarters in Munich is to get much closer to what is needed in India’s 600,000 villages, and understand how price sensitive that market is. “They don’t understand what the Indian village scenario is,” he says.Second is the cost advantage of engineering products in India, where engineering skills are 10 times cheaper than in Germany. Additional cost reductions are achieved by avoiding hefty import duties and shipping fees, and stripping out expensive materials and features. The result is that an X-ray machine produced for the Indian market is priced at $10,000 where its higher-end model in Germany costs four times that amount.Not everyone, however, is convinced by the appeal of Indian engineering skills. A survey by the Associated Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the business lobby group, shows that Indian manufacturing has a high defect rate and that about 20 per cent of Indian companies are unable to produce quality products. The use of obsolete machinery and equipment has also led to defects in the automobile and power equipment sector.The survey added that while India has the technical ability to achieve a high-level of precision, few manufacturers were able to produce quality products.Such research has not prevented others from declaring that the age of “ Indovation ” has dawned.“Innovation and ‘Indovation’ are really the key to taking us forward,” says Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “Electronics is going to be a really important driver of change. We will be able to produce more from less.”“Indovations” are springing up in solar power, mobile telephony, medical equipment and toilet technology. Indian engineers have also invented a battery-powered, ultra-low cost refrigerator resistant to power cuts, an automatic teller cash machine for rural areas and even a flour mill powered by scooter.Navi Radjou, the executive director of the Centre for India & Global Business at Cambridge University, says a wave of products is coming to market addressing India’s mass market. Describing India as a “living laboratory”, Mr Radjou identifies multinationals like Xerox, the Tata Group and PepsiCo as finding ways to address scarcity and low income on a grand scale.“Multinationals will have to rely on their next generation products and business models coming from emerging markets which deal a lot with scarcity,” he says. “They have to have the ability to source their ideas from India and scale them up globally.”Certainly, India’s needs are great, and market-based solutions not easy.Sahil Rais, who runs a chain of diagnostic medical centres in the Mumbai area, says an affordable X-ray machine able to work through power cuts could make a radical difference in an area that suffers seven hours of power cuts a day. Most of his customers are day-wage textile workers, suffering from tuberculosis. They pay Rs150 ($3.20, €2.60, £2.20) for a chest X-ray. But when the power is cut, so are the X-rays.“Once [companies] enter the darkness, they will know the importance of the small light,” Dr Rais says of business people seeking profits in India’s wider market. “It will help get private services into a part of the world where no-one wants to enter.”

He joined the board of WH Smith as a non-executive director in February and will become chairman in September after Robert Walker, the incumbent, steps down.Mr Walker joined the board of WH Smith in 2005, having previously worked at Procter & Gamble, McKinsey, and PepsiCo. He is chairman of Travis Perkins and a non-executive director of Tate and Lyle.“The board and I are delighted that Walker Boyd has agreed to become chairman of WH Smith,” said Kate Swann, chief executive.“Walker has extensive retail and finance experience which will serve the company and its shareholders well. On behalf of the board I would like to thank Robert for his valued contribution to WH Smith and, personally, for the support he has given me in his role as chairman of WH Smith. Robert leaves with our best wishes for the future.”The stationer also said that non-executive director Luke Mayhew would leave the board at the end of August and be replaced by Henry Staunton. Mr Staunton is a non-executive director of Merchants Trust, New Look, Legal & General, and Capital & Counties Properties, the demerged London property business of Liberty International.Separately, WH Smith said that total group sales in the 14 weeks to June 5 had fallen 3 per cent, with like-for-like sales down 4 per cent, although the company said this was in line with its expectations.The group’s high street locations saw like-for-like sales decline 4 per cent, as did the travel business, which has locations in airports and train stations.However, WH Smith said that had it not been for the interruption to flight schedules caused by the volcanic ash crisis earlier this year, like-for-like sales in the travel business would have been down 2 per cent.Shares in WH Smith closed down 18.6p to 435.4p on Tuesday.

549;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-06-03T17:43:04Z;Bank watchdogs try to prevent another seven-year hitch;;Seven years. That’s how long it took for anyone to notice that JPMorgan’s UK futures and options business was mixing client money with its own.During that period, the amount in question grew from $1.9bn to $23bn, as the financial crisis hit and hedge funds and pension funds fled to the perceived safety of JPMorgan. JPMorgan’s auditors, PwC, repeatedly certified that the bank was handling client money properly, and the Financial Services Authority never bothered to double-check.Even after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers revealed that that bank was commingling assets, alarm bells failed to ring. It took a routine conversation between two senior JPMorgan executives in July 2009 to uncover the problem. Somewhere during the 2002 integration of JPMorgan’s banking arm with that of Chase Manhattan, the futures and options business and the central treasury each got the impression that the other party was responsible for separating out customer money. Luckily, all of the client money was subsequently quickly separated.When the FSA took a wider look at the industry, the findings were downright ugly. The principle of segregating client assets has been in place since 2002, but the FSA found that many brokers, banks and insurance companies were either mingling money, failing to keep proper records, or both. All this occurred in spite of repeated certification from a variety of auditors that everything was hunky-dory.If this is how principles-based regulation works in practice, it is no wonder the FSA now says it is “outcomes based”. JPMorgan’s record £33m ($48m) fine should grab the City’s attention. The penalty is based on 1 per cent of the assets that were improperly held, so should concentrate the minds of the biggest players and more cases are expected shortly.The UK regulator has also begun requiring each bank to put someone specifically in charge of protecting client money, so that the issue can no longer slip through the cracks, and the Financial Reporting Council, which supervises auditors, is also taking a look. Even better, there is now a 22-person FSA unit devoted solely to checking up on client assets. As Ronald Reagan, the late US president, was so fond of saying, trust but verify.Drinks all roundWestern business groups can ill-afford to bear grudges with the Chinese, so alluring is the prospect of the country’s 1.3bn potential customer base.But it is still intriguing to see that Muhtar Kent, chief executive of Coca-Cola, has been elected as chairman of the US-China Business Council, a leading advocacy group.Mr Kent this week gushed about the honour of leading an organisation that, among other roles, works to “eliminate market barriers and to build commercial opportunities for American companies in China”.He is more aware than most of the market barriers that exist. Last year, China’s commerce ministry rejected Coca-Cola’s $2.4bn landmark acquisition of Huiyuan Juice, officially on antitrust grounds. But as the Financial Times reported at the time, the reality was that Beijing had caved in to shrill nationalist fears about foreigners taking over a leading home-grown drinks brand.Coca-Cola responded diplomatically. It has since focused on the organic expansion of its beverage range, runs 39 mainland production facilities, employs 40,000 staff and is bankrolling a pavilion at the Shanghai Expo.Mr Kent’s election will raise hopes that a deal over Huiyuan could somehow be resurrected, now that he will be mixing regularly with Chinese power-brokers as council chairman. The council is certainly not lacking in representatives of US beverage groups keen to expand in China. Among four new board members is Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive.A slick operatorBrazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva certainly knows how to make good use of a crowd. In his inaugural speech at Michelin’s Challenge Bibendum, he talked about sustainable mobility and everything else under the sun, including the west needing to take Brazil more seriously, Iran, capitalism and BP’s Gulf of Mexico disaster.“Imagine if this had happened in the bay of Rio,” he said. This was no throwaway line. After all, just a month before the Louisiana oil leak, BP splashed out $7bn to move into Brazil’s offshore, considered one of the world’s hottest new oil basins.No doubt this is why Brazil’s Petrobras oil group is also showing such interest in BP these days.world.view@ft.com
550;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-06-03T15:59:55Z;Consumers: Green issues are still a concern for food buyers;;"Just before the credit crunch, supermarket bosses were vying to out-green each other with promises to cut carbon emissions, packaging waste and food miles. But once the gloom of recession descended, the lexicon changed.No longer were supermarket chiefs intent on telling their customers how they could help them save the planet. It became all about ways of saving money, as they sought to stop their shoppers defecting to the discount chains such as Lidl and Aldi in the hunt for cheaper food bills.Organic food producers found that some supermarkets were removing their products from the shelves, as attention shifted to offering customers cheaper food. Organic food sales fell 9.7 per cent in 2009, according to Kantar, the grocery research company, from double-digit growth just a couple of years earlier.But as the storm clouds begin to recede, green is moving back up the agenda. “I don’t think consumers did stop caring,” says Richard Evans, President of PepsiCo in the UK. “But if you’ve got no money, you have to make tough choices.“So it is not that you don’t care; it is about what you can or can’t manage.”The evidence suggests that while customers may have been trading down during the recession, they still keep the environment and where food comes from in minds when shopping.Marks and Spencer, which has an entire programme – “Plan A” – dedicated to becoming a greener business, conducted research this year that showed that shoppers were still engaged in the issues.Nearly three-quarters of 2,000 people interviewed said the recession had not changed their level of concern, with one in two interviewees saying they would do more to help protect the environment if it was made easier for them to do so.IGD, the food and grocery analysis company, says research this year shows that the provenance of food is still important for many consumers, with demand for locally produced food and fairtrade products on the rise against three years ago.It found that 30 per cent of shoppers interviewed bought local produce in January, up from 15 per cent in 2006, while 27 per cent of shoppers had bought fairtrade products, against 9 per cent three years ago.“Shoppers are looking for both value and values,” says Joanne Denney-Finch, IGD chief executive. “They are not simply looking for cheaper food in tough times. They also expect the grocery industry to support their moral and ethical values.”Consumers are asking more of their supermarkets, says Lucy Neville-Rolfe, executive director of corporate and legal affairs at Tesco, the world’s third-biggest retailer by sales.She says: “Climate change is going to happen and that brings risks to business. Consumers want to know what they can do to help. I believe we have to work with suppliers and consumers and government, because we are interdependent when it comes to tackling these issues.”To this end, many of Britain’s biggest retailers stepped up their environmental commitments during the recession. Tesco, which pumps out 4.5m tonnes of carbons a year, last year promised to become a zero-carbon business by 2050, with a shorter-term pledge to cut emissions from existing stores and distribution centres in half by 2020.Marks and Spencer has been looking at ways to make being green easier for shoppers. One scheme has been to encourage customers to recycle clothes by offering them an M&S voucher when they take M&S clothes to an Oxfam charity shop.Tesco has worked with Oxford University’s environmental change institute to create an index to measure the carbon required to produce, transport, and consume every product it sells. The retailer has worked out the carbon footprint of 500 products while labelling more than 100 products.It has also provided £25m ($37m) of funding to the University of Manchester to set up a sustainable consumption institute that looks at how consumers can lead greener lives.Last October, Tesco teamed up with some of the world’s biggest consumer goods companies – including Coca-Cola and Unilever, with a combined turnover of $700bn – to work further on helping consumers limit emissions.If anything, the recession has invigorated the green consumer, says Ms Neville-Rolfe. “It became good to be green because it saves money. People were cooking from scratch, growing their own [vegetables].“It is interesting to see how consumers and businesses are coming together on the need to save money. People don’t want to be wasteful and, on the back of that sentiment, you can make progress on tackling climate change.”"
551;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-06-03T02:53:45Z;Rothschild to bolster US presence;;Rothschild, the investment bank, is bolstering its senior management in the US as the banking dynasty moves to take advantage of the growing demand for independent advice from companies globally.Jim Lawrence, co-founder of the LEK Partnership, a consulting firm, and most recently chief financial officer of Unilever, will become chief executive of Rothschild North America.He will also become co-head of global investment banking, the first time that role has been based in the US, alongside Nigel Higgins in London and Olivier Pecoux in Paris.Mr Higgins, who earlier this year became the first non-family member to lead the firm in Rothschild’s 212-year history, told the Financial Times that the time was right for a “step change” in the US after almost a decade of gradual expansion.“Over the last couple of years, the market globally has moved ever more towards recognising the benefits of truly independent, high-quality advice from an investment bank with a global footprint,” he said, highlighting the firm’s strength in emerging markets.Rothschild has close to 1,000 investment bankers globally, in more than 35 countries. The 140 bankers in North America currently generate about a fifth of the bank’s revenues.In appointing Mr Lawrence, Rothschild has plumped for a US chief executive with ample corporate experience rather than a traditional Wall Street resumé.After starting his career in management consulting, he held senior executive positions at PepsiCo, Northwest Airlines and General Mills.Mr Lawrence said on Wednesday of his background: “I’ve hired a lot of bankers and had the experience of working with a lot of bankers. I have some understanding of what the competition looks like out there.”He added that he saw a “tremendous opportunity” to leverage the Rothschild brand and build the business in the US.The dynasty traces its roots to 1798, when 21-year-old Nathan Mayer Rothschild arrived in England from Germany to start a textile business.Last year it ranked 14th in providing mergers and acquisitions advice in north America, according to Mergermarket, up from 24th in 2008.Rothschild advised various US government agencies on the bankruptcy of General Motors. It is reportedly advising a special committee of directors at AIG on repayment of the insurance company’s government debts.Other recent mandates include the acquisition of Volvo from Ford Motors by Geely, the Chinese carmaker, and CF Industries’ 14-month, hostile pursuit of Terra Industries.David de Rothschild remains executive chairman in North America and of the global bank. Christopher Lawrence and David Resnick, two of Rothschild’s most senior US bankers, will assume global, client-facing roles within the firm.
552;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-06-02T17:19:25Z;Be your own boss – how easy is it?;;How many times have we heard the phrase “I want to be my own boss”? If I had a penny for each time I have heard it, I wouldn’t need to do the MBA at the University of Miami as I would be rich by now. That’s what we all want isn’t it?Set your own times, be in control of your future, create something that’s yours. But how easy or hard is it to do this and how high should you aim?You see, I’m not saying that I, or someone reading this blog, won’t invent the next Facebook or Google but it certainly isn’t easy. So where should you aim? By now, there’s something for everyone out there and it’s definitely harder to create something brand new and unique.I went back and looked at brand management for a second. Brand associations must be strong, favourable and unique. So I sat down and started thinking about how to create a brand that exemplifies these three key attributes.As marketing teaches us, it’s imperative to create emotion between a brand and the consumers which relates, in part, to the “strong” and “favourable” aspects of it. But what about “unique”?At one point, I believed unique meant having something that doesn’t exist anywhere else. Is this true? I don’t think so. Coca-Cola and Pepsi have something unique about them, yet they both sell carbonated beverages. So when starting something new, I figured, you don’t have to have something that doesn’t exist anywhere else, but instead you have to create that “unique” emotion within the consumers’ minds.Returning to how high you should aim, I started thinking: must one only create something if it’s going to bring in a million dollars or can you carve out a small, but growing following and get your piece of the pie?No matter what your idea is, the chances are that someone out there has thought about it, unless you are a true inventor and will revolutionise the business world. It’s all about making your version of the idea better and more engaging than the competition.At the end of the day, it all depends on the passion you put into whatever you idea is and giving it everything you have and who knows, you might get something going. Believe that what you are doing is worth it and don’t do it poorly. Put in everything you’ve got and remember: it’s better to regret doing something than regret NOT doing something and taking your chance. (In the business world at least).What are your thoughts? Must your idea be so huge it will create a revolution or are you content with your piece of the big pie and growing from there?
553;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-05-20T22:40:53Z;Why are senior women so rare in finance;Why are senior women so rare in finance, write Abigail Hofman and Tracy Hofman;As the UK adjusts to its shiny new government, the recent parliamentary Treasury committee report, “Women In the City”, makes interesting reading. For those championing an increase in the number of women on British bank boards, David Cameron’s decision to appoint only four women to his cabinet only stokes the fire. You can almost hear them stamping their Ferragamos as they mount their soapboxes: “So what exactly is different about this ‘New Politics’?”It is a rum conundrum that in 21st-century Britain, senior corporate woman is as rare a species as senior political woman. According to the Treasury committee, which quotes the Female FTSE Board Report 2009 compiled by Cranfield School of Management, there are only four female chief executives of FTSE 100 companies. In banking it is bleak: only 9 per cent of board members of FTSE 100 banks are female and the proportion of women executive directors is 2 per cent.The City might look to Scandinavia for one possible solution. Norway introduced quotas for female directors of listed companies in 2005. “All-male boards do not represent the company very well – or the markets they serve,” says Elin Hurvenes, the founder of the country’s Professional Boards Forum, an advisory service that brings well-qualified women to the attention of company leaders. But does this suggest that board membership is a right rather than the culmination of a long career peppered with personal sacrifices? Indra Nooyi, chairwoman and chief executive of PepsiCo, has talked about the sheer hard work it took to become one of the highest ranking women in corporate America. Perhaps most women do not want to be so single-minded.To paraphrase the Treasury committee report: is the lack of senior women in finance a supply rather than a demand problem? Investment banker Nichola Pease’s evidence implied that the near invisibility of women on bank boards is a function of women’s choices. “I think the pyramid structure means that as you go up an organisation, because of women’s choices, there are fewer senior women to choose from.” This view is countered by the claim that there are few senior female financiers because male managers hire in their own image. In other words, there is no demand for feisty females who challenge the clubby atmosphere of cigar-perfumed boardrooms.While the Treasury report is a welcome catalyst for debate, it adds little insight. What comes across is a sense that banks must bend over backwards to elevate women.The key issue is whether it matters that women are under-represented on the boards of financial institutions. The committee believes that the lack of diversity on bank boards may have heightened the problems of “group-think” during the crisis and prevented effective challenge and scrutiny of decisions. It quotes research that “the emphasis of masculine culture encouraged and rewarded the taking of excessive risk”. But is this true? We must be wary of gender stereotypes. Some women like risk as much as any man. The fact that a woman was a key executive at Lehman Brothers does not seem to have resulted in less “group-think” as the company floundered. Erin Callan was the chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers for the first six months of 2008. Doubtless the “female entitlement lobby” will argue that a token senior woman is insufficient to change the dominant male culture of investment banks. Their perspective is that a cluster of, at least, three female board members is needed to provide a “tipping point”.British legislation supports women’s rights for equality of opportunity and pay. Yet in senior management: be it finance, industry or government, women are a minority. Might women’s choices and priorities limit their advancement? Or is it that managers must adopt more creative solutions because women often have “non-linear careers”? For example, women who leave finance to focus on their families should be welcomed back at a senior level rather than penalised as “slackers”. There are no easy answers. Seniority, especially in finance, is a long, hard, unglamorous slog.

554;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-05-18T16:11:01Z;Britvic plans £100m placing to buy French rival;;Britvic is to acquire the Fruité French soft drinks company for €237m (£202m) to provide a bridgehead into continental Europe in an all-cash deal part-funded by a £100m share placing.The news came as Britvic, which distributes Pepsi in the UK and owns the Robinsons range of soft drinks as well as Fruit Shoot, reported an increase in interim sales and pre-tax profits and raised its half-year dividend, following a strong performance from its international businesses.Britvic said that Fruité’s strong position in dilutable fruit syrups and pure juices complemented its own products and would give the group an entry point to the French soft drinks market, which was worth €12.5bn last year.Britvic estimates the deal will bring €10m in cost savings and €7m in revenue synergies by 2013.Paul Moody, Britvic chief executive said : “There’s probably two or three opportunities that we think exist, but the one I would touch on is Fruit Shoot.“We have over the last three years done a lot of research across a handful of continental European countries to understand the applicability of our brands in those markets and we’re confident that Fruit Shoot has the potential to work in the French market.”Fruité makes 91 per cent of its turnover in France, with smaller markets in Belgium and the Netherlands.Its main brands include the dilutable squash Teisseire, a sponsor of the Tour de France, and Pressade fruit juices.Last year, Fruité had revenues of €256.3m and reported earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of €24.8m.Britvic is paying an enterprise value to ebitda multiple of 9.6 times for the French group.The purchase will be paid for in cash, and part funded by a share placing of 21.7m new ordinary shares of 20p each, to the value just under 10 per cent of the group’s existing share capital, or about £95m to £100m. Britvic shares closed down 3.1 per cent, or 13½p, at 426p .Mr Moody said: We’ve taken the decision to make the binding offer for Fruité because we think that strategically it’s a very strong fit.“In and of itself, it wouldn’t prevent us looking at further [acquisition] opportunities as they came along. The means by which we’re funding this deal is a combination of existing debt facilities and a placing which means we will have further opportunities should the right strategic deal come along.”Mr Moody said the deal would bring Britvic’s net debt to ebitda ratio to 3 times, although within a year, net debt to ebitda would fall back down to 2.5 times.The group also plans to use the acquisition to introduce Britvic portfolio brands into the French market, which presents an especially propitious environment for Fruit Shoot, Britvic’s juvenile-focused fruit beverage.For the half-year to April 11, pre-tax profit more than trebled from £7.2m to £27.8m on revenues that rose 5 per cent to £505m.Excluding exceptional items (mostly tied to restructuring costs) of £12.8m last year, pre-tax profit rose 27.6 per cent to £40.7m.The interim dividend per share rose from 4.1p last year to 4.7p on basic earnings per share of 9.5p, up from 6.9p.
555;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Across the sectors: brand value rankings for 17 business categories;;Reflecting last year’s less volatile business environment when compared with 2008, the rises and falls in the aggregate brand values of the 17 categories covered by the 2010 BrandZ ranking are less marked.Whereas the biggest risers in the 2009 ranking were mobile operators, up 28 per cent, and soft drinks, up 24 per cent, the steepest rise this time is just 12 per cent for financial institutions, reversing the 11 per cent decline a year earlier.At the other end of the table, cars and insurance are still battling for the wooden spoon, but at least this time both sectors have stemmed the decline. After a whopping 48 per cent decline in brand value in last year’s ranking, insurance has fallen just 7 per cent this time, while cars are down 15 per cent, compared with 22 per cent a year ago.Financial Institutions12%Beer10%Technology6%Fast Food1%Retail-1%Soft Drinks-1%Mobile Networks-1%Bottled Water-2%Gaming Consoles-3%Spirits-3%Luxury-3%Apparel-4%Personal Care-4%Coffee-6%Insurance-7%Cars-15%Here are briefing notes on all the categories, with comments from Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor, Peter Walshe, MBO’s global BrandZ director, Nick Cooper, senior vice-president of MBO in the UK and Europe, and Cristiana Pearson, an MBO director. (NB: to produce the top 10s and in some cases top 20s, many brands are included that are too small for the Top 100. So, while all constituents of the financial services Top 20 are in the Top 100, none of the bottled water Top 10 are anywhere near big enough to get in. The Coffee and Games Consoles categories have only eight and six constituents respectively).ApparelPearson: “Not much movement but Nike has taken back its number one position from H&M”. Seddon: “People are no longer totally shopping at H&M, they’re not feeling quite as poor.” Pearson: “Next is a recovery brand, it was down 40 per cent last year so has recovered its value. It has tried to adopt the Zara/H&M model of quick turnround of trends and moving its products fast through the stores. It has also adopted a strategy of moving from the cities to larger spaces in retail parks, which has been quite successful.”BeerPearson: “As last year, light beer brands are growing faster. Corona, the Mexican brand is also doing well, helped by its “Corona tu espacio” concept of having a moment alone with your Corona. Skol is benefiting from the merger of Anheuser-Busch and InBev, and from its strong position in Brazil where it is very involved in cultural events, music festivals, things that young people really bond with.”Bottled waterPearson: “The only brand really going up is Evian, with its Roller Babies campaign which was very successful.” Nick: “Evian’s Live Young campaign suggests and communicates a benefit and that there is actually a point to drinking water, which I think has perhaps helped the brand.”CarsPearson: “Toyota is no longer top, as a corporation it has been affected by the recalls, so that has impacted on the financials [which form an element of the brand value formula]. Walshe: “Millward Brown did some research in the US in January, which said, not surprisingly, that people’s perception of Toyota as a reliable brand had slipped, and also it wasn’t to be trusted as much as their domestic brands. But when you split that out between users or owners, and non-owners, with the owners there was only a very slight slip, so there was an inherent loyalty there, which is to do with what the brand has done in the past. Toyota is trying quite hard now [to rebuild its reputation] with advertising, inviting owners to contact them, saying that all the cars have been checked, and guaranteeing it all. Now, I think it’s a brand that might have a greater chance of being believed simply because of its strength in the past.” Seddon: “All the brands are down except for Ford, VW and Audi in the top 10. Ford, apart from having the best social media campaign ever, has stepped into the hole left by GM. Ford dealt with the whole [crisis in the US car industry] beautifully from a brand and reputation point-of-view.”CoffeePearson: “The same story as last year, Nespresso is the big winner. It continues to do incredibly well for the same reasons as before – it’s affordable luxury. It continues to introduce new flavours and new machines.” Seddon: “Otherwise, everything’s down apart from Starbucks, and of course this brand now includes coffee sold at supermarkets.” Pearson: “Because of the recession Starbucks has introduced different packages which are more like value packs, so you pay less for bigger packs and this has worked quite well, especially in the US.”Fast foodSeddon: “Look how dominant McDonald’s is. It hasn’t particularly grown [brand value is actually down 1 per cent] but it’s a fabulous brand.” Pearson: “Last year was the fast food year, [the sector rose 16 per cent in the 2009 ranking, but only 1 per cent this time] and a lot of that was driven by McDonald’s.” Seddon: “Burger King is down quite sharply, it claims that the reason it is are not doing so well is because of the weather and swine flu.” Pearson: “Compared with McDonald’s Burger King is very much more exposed to the US, even though it is opening a lot of stores outside the US.” Seddon: “Subway is worth a mention – it has a really healthy reputation but it’s the $5 Footlong which has really benefited it. The Footlong was supposed to be temporary when Subway launched it and it has been incredibly successful and kind of turbocharged Subway’s performance.”Financial InstitutionsSee separate article.Games ConsolesPearson: “This is all about a technology switch as new generations of consoles come in. Nintendo’s Wii is still growing, as is PlayStation 3, but next year we’ll probably not see PlayStation 2 at all. Also the at-home consoles are doing better than the portable ones like Nintendo DS because the hardcore and serious gamers don’t really use handhelds.”InsuranceSeddon: “This category is all over the place [brand value changes range from a 19 per cent rise at State Farm to a 47 per cent fall at ING]. Pearson: “State farm has a top score of 5 in brand contribution so it is very trusted.” Seddon: “ING won’t be in business next year [last October ING unveiled a radical break-up forced on it by the European Commission that will see the Dutch financial services group sell off its insurance and investment management business following the state bail-out in 2008]. Walshe: Zurich Insurance have done a big branding campaign in Europe, which has been successful.LuxuryPearson: “This category is a bit of a mixed bag again. Louis Vuitton, Hermès and Gucci were the three brands that rose [apart from Tiffany] and these really are the traditional, staple luxury brands.” Seddon: “It was generally a bit of a dismal year for luxury but those three brands stuck to their knitting, they all said ‘We are the classic luxury brands, we’re not compromising. They are real, classic luxury brands. The other brands are not so classic. People have been drinking less champagne – all those investment bankers, there’s fewer of them.”Mobile operatorsSeddon: “Here we’ve got the modern, legal form of addiction in mature markets. All the top 10 mobile operators are in the top 100, and a lot of this is because of apps – it’s all that data flowing through, which increased the arpu (average revenue per user). Verizon Wireless has done a very good job, part of this is about the fact that AT&T had the iPhone and, big though their network was, the iPhone apps were too popular, leading to reception problems, and Verizon took that on, head on, and went with Google’s Android [mobile operating system]. The positioning is very different, it’s more techy and less fluffy and social, but Verizon have done very well. For AT&T the iPhone was too popular for its own good. Elsewhere, very few companies have two of their brands in the Top 100, but Spain’s Telefónica owns both Movistar and O2. Movistar has been doing very well – that is really about growth in Latin America. O2 has been very successful in monetising the brand through apps and use of the phone, so for example it has got a platform called O2 Money, which is enormously successful. It has also got one of the best music downloads. And it has successfully grown the brand outside the UK in Ireland, Germany and the Czech Republic. O2 has also gone into fixed line with ADSL [asymmetric digital subscriber line] quite recently. Finally, China Mobile’s brand value went down. It has been enormously successful, but now it has new competition in China, as China Telecom has been licensed to compete with it.”Oil and gas brandsSee separate article.Personal careColgate is the only brand to have achieved a rise of 10 per cent or more in this category, and across the Top 15 there are more fallers than risers. Dove, the Unilever brand which is outside the Top 100, also did well, while Avon and Nivea are the biggest fallers.RetailersSeddon: “Amazon is the top performer in this category. It continues to take business away from Ebay [the biggest faller in this category by a long chalk] and in fact is every retailer’s biggest competitor now. Amazon’s biggest competitor is Walmart, that’s who it is targeting. If you look at Amazon’s sales, it is general merchandise – the stuff that Walmart sells, that is rising fastest. So Amazon has really branched out from being just a book and media merchandiser to being Walmart on the internet. And don’t forget the Kindle [e-book] which has been enormously successful – I’ve seen people reading Kindles on public transport everywhere from the Moscow metro to New York.” Pearson: “The other important thing is that, a year ago, we were talking about people buying online to save money in the recession, but in fact I think there’s a long-term shift on the way people are shopping. Amazon is also constantly innovating, so last year it was Amazon Prime, in which you pay once a year and get free delivery. Now it is allowing individuals to sell their products online without charging a fee, and that is a direct challenge to Ebay.” Walshe: Best Buy [just outside the Top 10] is also doing well, it has benefited from the closure of some of its rivals.Soft drinksPearson: “There is still the theme that diet and light brands are doing better than staple products – we see that in Diet Pepsi. Although Diet Coke is down, there has been a big rise in Coke Zero’s brand value.” Seddon: “Coke Zero has been the most successful launch that Coca-Cola has had in 22 years – it’s ‘bloke Coke’.” Pepsi’s fall is for financial reasons although the brand contribution is relatively stable, while Gatorade’s brand contribution increased significantly, offsetting the slightly negative financial results. This brand is outside the Top 100.SpiritsPearson: “This is terribly unexciting, not much has happened at all. It has been a tough year in general for spirits brands, it is a difficult category to innovate in because it’s all about flavours and bottles and packaging.”TechnologyThis is one of the biggest categories, with huge variations in performance across the top 20. The three biggest risers, Samsung, Baidu and Hewlett-Packard, are covered in the Risers and Fallers article. Then come Apple and IBM with a 32 and 30 per cent rise respectively. Walshe: “All the brands in the Top 100 are either extremely trusted or highly recommended by their users, and a lot of them are both. Both companies’ brand values have risen by about $20bn, so they are the top actual value growers in the rankings. IBM is driven hugely by trust whereas for Apple it is recommendation.”Seddon: “IBM has done has done a very, very good job of buying up software companies. Whenever it sees there’s a need in the marketplace it finds a software company that’s doing it and then pumps it through its brand marketing machine with fabulous branding, fabulous marketing and that’s what you get. So, it’s very much a branded story, it was “e-business” now it’s “a smarter planet”. It’s a company that was turned around by Lou Gerstner, very much on the idea of brand. It’s also a global brand with global executions, it shows you the power that you can get from leveraging one brand globally across the world.” Seddon: “BlackBerry has been one of our enormous growers and over the past five years its brand value has more than doubled, but that has slowed off. It’s a great device and it’s become a great brand, but does it have as strong an emotional connection with the users as, say, Apple’s iPhone? Maybe not. It’s marketed more as a device than as an enabler of your life. And the growth of the iPhone has probably stopped BlackBerry growing as fast as it could, because consumers want the exciting apps [that the iPhone offers]. Seddon: “Another interesting one is Oracle. Oracle has bought Sun but its brand value doesn’t include Sun because it has not rebranded Sun, so they are separate. Oracle is famously aggressive, is ruthlessly controlled from the top, global and it’s in both business productivity, software as well as in databases. Oracle is also interesting because it comes back to one of our themes this year, the brand that is driven by the chief executive. SAP is Oracle’s biggest competitor, and since SAP’s founder retired it has been losing market share to Oracle.”Three of the four worst-performing brands in this year’s Top 100, Nokia, Intel and Siemens, are in this category and are covered in the Risers and Fallers article. Another poor performer this year was Dell, down 24 places at 66th after a 23 per cent fall in brand value. Seddon: “Dell was the biggest, number one in PC market share, but HP has come back from the dead and taken over that position. Also, Dell has traditionally only sold direct and there is a fundamental love that people have for wanting to twiddle with technology before they buy. [If you sell direct and focus on low prices], it’s not a sustainable positioning because the Chinese brands, the Acers of this world, will come out and underprice you. So, I think there’s a brand building story under way, hopefully.”Finally, scraping in at No. 20 in the Technology Top 10, but not yet in the Top 100, is Facebook, with brand value of $5.5bn. Walshe: “A few years ago Facebook would have been in the Top 100 with a value at that level.” Pearson: “The structure has changed because Facebook’s users were young people, originally, but there was a shift last year and older people and businesses are on it now. That is what happened with Twitter, too.”
556;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;How to avoid making a drama out of a crisis;;The brand careering off the road is Toyota’s. Chilling recordings of the phone calls made by distressed drivers to the emergency services – sometimes from people behind the wheel of an out-of-control car – have been repeated on TV programmes for months now. Proof, if any were needed, that there is such a thing as bad publicity.The Japanese carmaker has been strongly criticised for its response to this crisis, and the embarrassing recall of several Toyota models. “Speed of response, transparency of message and visibility are the three key principles to successful crisis management,” says Basil Towers, founding partner of Hesleden, a reputation management consultancy. “Toyota arguably failed on all three.”For a brand built on the key elements of quality and reliability, the events of the past few months have been disastrous. Worse, the at times slow and almost grudging response to that criticism the company displayed – at least initially – seems to have done it even more harm. US politicians leapt on to the opportunity to kick a foreign business when it was down.So if Toyota (brand value down 27 per cent to $21.8bn in the latest BrandZ Top 100 ranking) offers us a case study in how not to react to a crisis and protect your brand, which examples are more helpful? The gold standard in brand protection remains the 1982 case of Johnson & Johnson’s Tylenol painkiller.For once the scare stories put out by the media had some substance to them. Seven people living in the Chicago area died after taking Tylenol, the top-selling painkiller in the US, which had been contaminated with cyanide.Johnson & Johnson did not go into denial. Senior managers did not get into a non-communicative huddle and hope the problem would go away. Instead, the company quickly took the difficult and financially painful decision to recall more than 30m bottles of the drug. It kept up a regular flow of information – the “transparency and visibility” recommended by Hesleden above – and introduced new safety measures, including improved tamper-proof packages.When the new batches of safe Tylenol started reappearing on the pharmacy shelves, the company opted to take another financial hit by offering discount coupons. But the public was convinced. The Tylenol brand was intact, regaining 70 per cent of its market share within five months. It is still the number one brand today.Mattel, the US toymaker, had to own up to severe problems with its Chinese manufacturers in the summer of 2007. It went into hyper-communication mode. After a product recall announcement a team of 16 press officers contacted dozens of US media outlets. A conference call with senior executives was arranged.Robert Eckert, Mattel’s chief executive, did 14 TV interviews in one day, as well as conducting many phone calls with reporters. He got the tone of contrition and candour just right, apologising for his company’s recall of faulty toys.“I’m disappointed, I’m upset, but I can assure your viewers that we are doing everything we can about the situation,” Mr Eckert said on CNN. “Every production batch of toys is being tested, and we’ll continue to enforce the highest quality standards in the industry.” In one week, Mattel dealt with more than 300 media requests in the US alone. Their faith in the company intact, shoppers stuck with the brand.PepsiCo was also praised for its open and robust reaction to a crisis in 1993. It was claimed that syringes had been found in cans of diet Pepsi. When an arrest was made after a police investigation, the company was happy to publicise it. It also produced a video made at one of its factories showing how such tampering was impossible.The so-called syringe problem was in fact a hoax, carried out clumsily by various individuals around the country. There was nothing wrong with the company’s production procedures, as they were able to show. Pepsi reacted fast partly because it already had a plan of action in place ready to deal with a case of product tampering.Clearly it is possible to take action quickly and explain to a worried public that a perceived problem is being dealt with. But of course, wise managers try to make sure that, as far as possible, they avoid sudden, unexpected crises in the first place. This, too, is part of the business of protecting the brand and the corporate reputation.Hesleden’s Mr Towers raises a few questions about the Toyota debacle which, had they been answered sooner, might have prevented a lot of the subsequent damage:“Did/does Toyota engage in systematic scenario planning and simulation to stress test or benchmark its responses to crises?” he asks.“Did/does its business leaders recognise the importance of the broadest level of stakeholder engagement and transparency? To what extent is Toyota reviewing its approach to the crisis and the lessons it can learn?”Unexpected disasters can hit any company at any time. But as some have shown, the brand can still be protected and repaired. You do not have to make a drama out of a crisis.
557;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Tokyo’s streets provide real-world test for electric cabs;;A pilot scheme by Better Place, the electric-car services company, has begun in Tokyo, with four custom-built electric taxis introduced to the streets of the Japanese capital.The California start-up wants to convince Japanese carmakers to design electric vehicles with rechargeable batteries that can be popped out and replaced when depleted – a system for which it is developing switching stations and other infrastructure. So far only Renault of France and China’s Chery have committed to the format.The Japanese government is keen – it is funding the 90-day pilot. Of the Japanese carmakers, Nissan has chosen a plug-in design for its upcoming Leaf electric hatchback, while Toyota and Honda are busy promoting petrol-electric hybrids.Shai Agassi, Better Place’s founder, said he chose Tokyo to “wake up the car industry in Japan”. Taxis may be a good way to do it. Tokyo has 60,000 of them – more than London, New York and Paris combined. That is only 2 per cent of the cars on its roads, but, constantly in use, they account for one fifth of its transport-related greenhouse gas emissions.Toyota sells six in 10 Japanese taxis and the company’s Prius hybrid is popular.If Better Place is able to prove battery-swapping works in the real world, it could get a sizeable fleet of early electric adopters.Embattled LagardèreWhenever a French corporate champion comes under attack from a foreign predator, the government’s traditional knee-jerk reaction is to rush to its rescue in the name of what has become known as “economic patriotism”.The classic example remains Danone. Some years ago, rumours started swirling that PepsiCo was thinking of a bid for the French national yoghurt maker. The government warned the US multinational it was not wanted in France. PepsiCo never launched a bid and some suggest it never seriously intended on doing so.The government also preferred to take a blocking stake in Alstom rather than see Siemens acquire the French engineering group that was at the time facing collapse. Later, Paris sold its stake to the Bouygues construction and media conglomerate.In pharmaceuticals, the government engineered the merger between Sanofi and Aventis to create a new champion rather than allow the Swiss Novartis to swallow it up. It did everything it could to try to block Mittal’s hostile bid for Arcelor but ultimately failed. That did not stop Thierry Breton, France’s then-finance minister, accusing the Indian raider of shabby corporate behaviour.More recently, Paris made sure that the state-owned Areva nuclear group sold its transmission and distribution businesses to Alstom (now once again in good shape) and Schneider Electric rather than see these assets go to the US’s General Electric or Japan’s Toshiba.In recent weeks another CAC 40 heavyweight has come under siege, this time from Guy Wyser-Pratte, an American activist investor and former marine. He has launched a particularly aggressive campaign to win a seat on the Lagardère board as well as shake up the company’s existing structure. The battle will come to a head today when Lagardère shareholders vote on his controversial proposals.Lagardère certainly qualifies as a French champion. It controls a publishing empire with scattered media assets as well as being the French core industrial shareholder in the Franco-German EADS defence and aerospace group that in turn controls Airbus. Yet on this occasion the government has remained unusually silent.On the face of it, this seems a bit puzzling. All the more so given that Arnaud Lagardère, chairman of the embattled company, is reputed to be a close chum of Nicolas Sarkozy.One explanation is that the government feels it has no need to intervene given that the structure of the group provides Mr Lagardère as a general partner with bullet proof anti-takeover protection. For although he owns less than 10 per cent of his group, as a general partner he can veto any change in structure.That still does not prevent Mr Wyser-Pratte becoming a director as long as he wins a simple majority in today’s shareholders’ vote. Mr Lagardère clearly does not want him on the board, but that does not mean that either the minority shareholders or the government are allergic to the activist. Indeed, both probably welcome his decision to challenge current strategy and management. Many would be pleased if Mr Wyser-Pratte’s unsolicited incursion helps revive Lagardère’s underperforming share price.As for the government, putting a little pressure on Mr Lagardère might accelerate his group’s expansion as a true French media champion – particularly if he finally decides to sell his EADS stake to build up a war chest to buy new media businesses.world.view@ft.com

More so given that Arnaud Lagardère, chairman of the embattled company, is reputed to be a close chum of Nicolas Sarkozy. Some of his influential media outlets such as Paris Match, Le Journal du Dimanche, and the popular Europe 1 radio station provide reliable service for the president.One obvious explanation is that the government feels it has no need to intervene given that the structure of the group – a société en commandite par action or stock partnership – provides Mr Lagardère as a general partner with bullet proof anti-takeover protection.

So much so, that the company is already pressing ahead with the split that it claims will create not one but two new French champions.On Friday, it held a farewell party at its Paris headquarters for all the staff of the services and vouchers division moving that day to new offices. It might have been politically more tactful to wait for shareholders to vote formally on the split at the end of June before letting this division check out so early.european.view@ft.com
559;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-04-22T21:23:59Z;S&P in late recovery to reclaim positive territory;;US stock prices staged a late comeback on Thursday to end the session higher following a well-received speech by President Obama on financial reform.A benign producer price index, falling jobless claims figures and decent existing home sales gave some support. Growing worries about Greek debt woes and a number of disappointing earnings and forecast announcements, however, weighed on the market.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 1,208.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 per cent to 11,134.29 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,519.07.“The news has been pretty bullish overall [in this earnings season] but yesterday evening that changed and turned much more mixed, with high profile companies like Ebay and Qualcomm guiding the market down,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.Ebay an online retailer, was one of the session’s worst performers, down 5.7 per cent to $24.78 as it stood by its previous full-year earnings outlook, disappointing those who had expected it to be raised in the wake of improving e-commerce trends.Qualcomm lost 7.7 per cent to $39.35 as the chipmaker forecast lower-than-expected revenues for the full-year and said pricing was still “a challenging environment”.The pharmaceutical sector was the worst performer. “The market is very disappointed in the pharma sector. Several companies have said the healthcare bill is expected to hurt revenue growth and profits,” said Mr Kalivas.Abbott Laboratoriesfell 1.3 per cent to $51.12, Johnson & Johnson was 0.9 per cent lower at $64.78 and Eli Lilly lost 1.8 per cent to $35.38. All have said the bill will adversely affect their earnings.Verizon Communications declined 1 per cent to $29.28 on the back of weaker-than- expected first-quarter figures, with disappointing wir eless subscriber growth. Verizon’s first-quarter net income fell to $409m, or 14 cents per share, from $1.6bn, or 58 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.Soft drinks and snacks group PepsiCo slipped 1.9 per cent to $64.76 as its first quarter revenues missed estimates. However, earnings were better than Wall Street was expecting.Starbucks rallied 7.3 per cent to $27.25 as the world’s largest coffee shop operator posted strong revenues and lower costs in its first quarter results released after Wednesday’s close and raised its full-year guidance.Philip Morris tumbled 1.4 per cent to $51.24 as the tobacco group that sells Malboro cigarettes internationally reported first-quarter earnings that missed analysts’ average estimates.
560;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-04-22T12:37:43Z;Bottling acquisition boosts PepsiCo profits;;PepsiCo on Thursday reported a 13 per cent increase in revenues for the first quarter from the same period last year, while a gain associated with the acquisition of its bottling franchise boosted net income by a better-than-expected 26 per cent to $1.43bn or 83 cents per share, compared with $1.14bn or 72 cents last year.The bottler consolidation contributed to a 47 per cent decline in operating profit for the food and drinks company during the period.Sales from its Frito-Lay units in North America grew 2 per cent, while Quaker Foods revenues in the region declined. In Latin America, food revenues jumped 13 per cent. While PepsiCo’s beverage sales in the Americas grew 32 per cent for the quarter, the division’s operating profit dropped 83 per cent, a reflection of the costs associated with the consolidation of its bottling group.The company’s strongest gains in food and beverage sales came from its Asia, Middle East and Africa regions, which posted a 23 per cent gain in revenues, to $1.1bn, and a 17 per cent gain in operating profit, to $160m.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, said: “PepsiCo’s broad portfolio performed well in the quarter as our operating agility and solid marketplace execution enabled us to deliver strong financial and operational performance.“Our macrosnacks business gained share in key markets and we posted solid performance in beverages supported by the benefits of the acquisition of our two largest bottlers, growth in developing markets and improving top-line trends in North America,” she added.
561;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-04-21T01:38:48Z;Food companies braced for salt curb;;US food companies might be facing new regulations that could force them to cut drastically the level of salt in processed food.This follows the release of an influential report on Tuesday that found that voluntary approaches by companies had failed to curb the problem.Kraft, General Mills and other large manufacturers of processed food have been awaiting the report by the Institute of Medicine, a federal health panel, for clues on how federal regulators at the Food and Drug Administration might act.The report said that while a “patchwork of voluntary approaches” offered by companies to reduce salt in food were “laudable”, the effort was not enough to reduce the overall salt content in the US food supply. Over-consumption of salt has been linked to high blood pressure and cardio vascular disease.The report found that Americans on average consume 50 per cent more salt per day than levels recommended by federal dietary standards.Under current regulations, sodium is considered a product that is “generally regarded as safe” at the FDA.In effect, such a classification means that the federal government has never set a limit on what amount of salt in food is actually safe.The Institute of Medicine called on the FDA to modify that standard, and create a limit on the level of salt that is deemed safe.“This change, when carried out in a stepwise manner, will reduce the sodium content of food supply slowly, in a way that should avoid making food unpalatable to consumers,” the report found.The FDA said it was closely examining the report’s findings but had not yet decided on whether to pursue new regulations.Pepsi, Kraft and ConAgra, among others, have already taken steps to reduce the amount of salt in the foods they sell.Kraft said it was working towards reducing salt in its North American portfolio by 10 per cent over the next two years.The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a top food lobby group, said it looked forward to working with the FDA to develop a new “national sodium reduction strategy”.Salt serves as a preservative and important flavour additive.Food groups have expressed concern that consumers will lack the appetite for salt-free foods, given the national taste for salty snacks.Companies are likely to push back on any attempt at greater regulation.
562;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;US online advertisements in sharp rebound;;Spending on online advertising in the US rose sharply in the fourth quarter of 2009, suggesting that the worst of the downturn has passed as companies increased their digital marketing spend.The rebound in the last three months of the year was not enough to offset the drop in spending for the rest of 2009, leaving it down 3.4 per cent at $22.7bn on the year before.Companies spent $6.3bn on online advertising in the fourth quarter, a record amount for a three-month period, and up 14 per cent from the third quarter, according to data released on Wednesday by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PwC.“The record $6.3bn spent on internet advertising in the fourth quarter of 2009, while certainly aided by seasonal demand, is a strong indication that the worst of the economic impact on internet advertising is over and that the seeds of growth have been planted,” said David Silverman, a partner with PwC.The largest share of the spending – 47 per cent – was on search advertising, with Google benefiting in particular. The largest internet search engine earned $3.15bn during the fourth quarter in the US, mostly from search ads. It reports quarterly results next week.Display advertising, which had been expected to fall sharply by some analysts, also remained strong, accounting for 35 per cent of revenues last year, up 2 per cent from 2008.The strong uptick from the third to fourth quarters points to the increasing prominence of online advertising by big companies. Large brands, such as Pepsi, have launched elaborate online-only web campaigns in recent months, using a mix of search, display, video and social media ads. Online advertising revenues have nearly doubled in the past five years.“Digital media are now a core component of successful advertising and marketing campaigns,” said Randall Rothenberg, president of the IAB. “As consumers spend more time immersed in digital media, marketers are increasingly reaching them there, building brands online and making digital the central force in their cross-media strategies.”The figures “underscore the significant share shift taking place from traditional media to digital,” according to the IAB. Among the five key US ad-supported media – television, radio, newspapers, magazines and the internet – the web’s share of combined revenues has grown from 8 per cent to 17 per cent since 2005.Video advertising saw the highest growth rate, though it is still a small portion of overall revenues. Online video advertising grew 39 per cent year over year to just over $1bn.The biggest loser was classified advertising, down 23 per cent from last year.
563;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-04-02T22:00:18Z;Crunch time for crisps;;The Walkers Grab Bag, a permanent fixture of petrol forecourt shops across the land, could become a thing of the past after PepsiCo UK last month promised to limit the amount of calories in a single bag of crisps to 160 within five years.At between 230 and 240 calories a bag, the traditional Grab Bag looks under threat as PepsiCo tries to make its £500m-a-year Walkers brand more healthy as part of a 10 year plan to increase focus on healthier products.The maker of Pepsi cola, Walkers crisps and Tropicana drinks has promised that half of its savoury snacks will be baked rather than fried by 2015 – against 10 per cent today. It has already reduced saturated fat in Walkers crisps by 70 per cent and cut salt by between 25 and 55 per cent, as well as launching Walkers Baked – now a £37m brand – and Sunbites, which contain a third of an adult’s recommended daily amount of wholegrain.Richard Evans, UK president of PepsiCo, said the fate of the Grab Bag depended on how far the company could go in reducing the calorie count of crisps.On fizzy drinks, he said he was aiming to get two-thirds of all Pepsi soft drink sales sugar-free by 2015 against 61 per cent in 2008. He also said Pepsi would make 250ml servings of its sugary drinks more readily available – although PepsiCo has stopped short of promising to get rid of the 330ml can of Pepsi cola altogether.Tim Smith, head of the Food Standards Agency, said this week that he was keen for PepsiCo and its competitors to be bolder. He said: “We would know they were serious if they moved from a 330ml to a 300ml can in the mass market. They haven’t done it. But they might find they get good customer acceptance and get competitive advantage going forward.”At a group level, PepsiCo last month pledged to cut levels of salt, sugar and saturated fats in its top-selling products by a quarter over the coming decade.
564;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-04-02T22:00:18Z;Food agency declares war on dietary nasties;;Britons are set to munch their way through the equivalent of half-a-billion Cadbury creme eggs this bank holiday weekend if last year’s chocolate consumption is anything to go by.The nation snapped up £240m worth of chocolate – more than one-10th of the annual total – in the week before Easter 2009, according to Kantar Worldpanel, the industry research body.But as Britons indulge in Easter eggs and other sugary and fatty treats, the government is increasingly concerned about long-term health problems associated with over-eating.In a bid to tackle rising obesity and ill-health caused by poor diet, which costs the NHS £7bn a year, the Food Standards Agency has now issued a mandate for change.Food manufacturers are being told to reduce saturated fats in biscuits, cakes and chocolate and to make smaller pack sizes of indulgent foods, such as cans of sugary cola and chocolate, more widely available.It is the second assault on the food industry in recent years. The FSA has already run a salt reduction campaign, viewed by campaigners as a success after salt intake dropped by 10 per cent nationwide in 2008 – only two years after the campaign was launched.Now, Tim Smith, chief executive of the FSA, has other dietary nasties in his sights. Saturated fats are dangerous because they raise “bad” cholesterol and can block the arteries to the heart and increase the chance of developing heart disease, while too much sugar can lead to weight gain and tooth decay.In setting targets for a 10 per cent reduction of saturated fat levels in filled chocolate bars, biscuits and plain cakes – he does not set out a specific timeframe – Mr Smith acknowledges he is throwing down the gauntlet to the industry.“Salt came first and the reduction in salt is easier because you can do it by stealth,” he says. “You can also retrain taste buds to accept less salt. But saturated fats are much harder to do.”Sue Davies – chief policy adviser at Which?, the consumer group – says the difficulty with saturated fats is that they cannot be reduced gradually, but instead involve a complete reformulation – which can affect the taste of the product.But PepsiCo UK and Mars, who between them provide the nation with a trio of unhealthy treats – Walkers crisps, the Mars bar and cans of Pepsi cola – have already made strides toward saturated fat reductions by their products.In January, Mars said that after five years of effort, €10m of investment and 40,000 hours of manpower it had managed to reduce saturated fat by 15 per cent in its Mars, Snickers, Milky Way, Topic and Flyte bars – although the Mars bar still has 258 calories. PepsiCo, meanwhile, has reduced saturated fat in Walkers crisps by 70-80 per cent.“PepsiCo have done a U-turn trying to make themselves into a healthy company,” says Professor Graham MacGregor, who chairs Cash, the salt action group.“These companies don’t want to be blackballed and highlighted and shamed, so they do need to do something. The food industry has realised that [it] can’t get away with bad publicity and it has to act in the interests of consumers.”But if reformulation can only go some way, consumers are also going to have to begin to eat smaller portions of what they really like, whether Easter eggs or bags of crisps. Small inroads have been made: Nestlé has offered smaller bars of Breakaway and Blue Riband biscuit bars.“Portion size is …as important as reformulation,” says Mr Smith. He acknowledges that to win consumers over will be much harder than it was for salt reduction. The industry cannot hit the targets alone: consumers must accept a little less chocolate at this time of the year.
565;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-03-31T18:50:06Z;Bigger Kraft faces tough task ahead;;Irene Rosenfeld’s leap into the big league was underlined this week when the chief executive of Kraft Foods overtook her counterparts at PepsiCo and Coca-Cola to become one of the best-paid consumer goods chief executives in the US.Having spent recent months slogging it out to secure Cadbury, Ms Rosenfeld has been richly rewarded. She was awarded $26.3m last year for “exceptional” leadership during Kraft’s $19.1bn takeover of the British confectioner as well as for Kraft’s improved performance on completion of a three-year turnround plan.Now she has the potential to turn the maker of Oscar Mayer meats and Oreo cookies from the biggest US food producer into a “global powerhouse”.The company she has led since 2006 now boasts a 14.8 per cent share of the global confectionery market, just ahead of Mars with 14.6 per cent.More than half of its revenues now come from outside the US – the figure was 43 per cent before the Cadbury deal. Most crucially, a quarter of sales come from developing markets such as China, Brazil and India, against a fifth pre-Cadbury.A bigger Kraft is now bolder in ambition. Ms Rosenfeld has set her long-term revenue growth target at 5 per cent, against 4 per cent before the merger.She expects growth in earnings per share to reach 9-11 per cent, compared with 7-9 per cent before the deal, and has also promised $675m of annual cost synergies by the end of the third year after completion (although the deal also comes with $1.3bn of reorganisation costs).But in spite of Ms Rosenfeld’s enthusiasm over the tie-up, the unwieldy food group remains unloved.Kraft has lagged behind its peers during Ms Rosenfeld’s turnround, underperforming food products in the S&P 500 by 8.5 per cent from the beginning of 2006 to the middle of 2009. Since September, when Kraft announced the Cadbury deal (using a big tranche of its shares), it underperformed the S&P 500’s food producers by 5.4 per cent.“This is a very large company in a lot of different categories and geographies,” says David Driscoll, analyst at Citigroup. “Kraft wanted to achieve faster growth rates than it has been able to achieve so far. Are investors irritated that management thought they could do better than they did? Yes. Did they think they would get the franchise better than they did? Yes.”In spite of having made strides towards “rewiring” Kraft for growth by investing in marketing, new products and better ingredients, Ms Rosenfeld has struggled consistently to increase sales above its 4 per cent target while also hitting earnings-per-share targets.But she has delivered on sales, with a compound annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent in the three years to the end of 2009. Underlying growth in earnings per share has come in at just 2.3 per cent, according to Deutsche Bank estimates.On a diluted earnings-per-share measure, performance rose at 6.1 per cent over the three years – missing Ms Rosenfeld’s range of 7-9 per cent, though she did hit 7 per cent in 2009.It leaves many pondering how Ms Rosenfeld can now deliver more ambitious goals following the deal.“If you look at the company in total, the sales growth objective of 5 per cent plus [of the merged group] is too aggressive,” says Eric Katzman, analyst at Deutsche Bank.The execution risk of the deal is also increased because it was a hostile approach – very different from Ms Rosenfeld’s friendly $7.6bn acquisition of LU Biscuit from Danone in 2007.Missteps over Cadbury’s Somerdale plant near Bristol – which Kraft said it would keep open only to reverse its decision within days of doing the deal – have caused unnecessary upset in the UK.However, she has at least managed to get Cadbury’s operational heads to stay on in the enlarged company.As she integrates Kraft, Ms Rosenfeld may also face pressure from activist shareholders such as Nelson Peltz’s Trian Group to dispose of some of the slower growth businesses, possibly including the Kraft cheese brand itself.Shareholders will urge more focus on the high growth combination of chocolate and biscuits that has been strengthened by the Cadbury deal.She has already tested the patience of some, with Warren Buffett, Kraft’s biggest shareholder, critical of the deal. The billionaire investor is unhappy that Ms Rosenfeld sold Kraft’s successful DiGiorno pizza business to Nestlé for $3.7bn to help finance the bid, while he has also complained that undervalued Kraft stock was “a very expensive currency” to be used in an acquisition.But Mr Buffett also thinks Ms Rosenfeld is a “good operator”. Her supporters say investors should keep their eye on the bigger prize. With Cadbury under its arm, Kraft is becoming more focused on confectionery and snacks, with more than half of its turnover now in these areas.“She has transformed it into a niche company in emerging markets and it is going into chocolate that doesn’t have much private label competition so now the five-year and 10-year terms get better and better,” says Mr Driscoll.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall in New York.
566;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Kraft chief secures 41% pay rise;;Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft Foods chief executive, was given a 41 per cent pay rise last year to $26.3m for services that included “exceptional” leadership in the takeover of Cadbury, the UK chocolate maker, Kraft said in a filing on Tuesday.Kraft’s bid was criticised by Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway group is the foodmaker’s largest shareholder. He argued that Kraft overpaid in its $19.1bn deal for Cadbury.The Kraft board said it had “heavily weighted the significant effort and the ultimate acquisition of Cadbury in assessing individual performance” of Kraft’s senior executives.The company’s 2010 proxy filing said Ms Rosenfeld showed “exceptional” leadership in executing Kraft’s formal offer in November and closing the deal in January this year.It “specifically noted her commitment to financial discipline as evidenced by maintaining our investment grade rating, accretion to cash earnings in the second full year and our current dividend”.Mr Buffett also criticised Ms Rosenfeld’s decision to sell Kraft’s successful DiGiorno pizza business to Nestlé for $3.7bn, helping it to finance the Cadbury bid, arguing that the deal had reduced the value of the company.Kraft’s compensation committee cited the successful sale of the pizza business as one of the factors influencing its incentive award to Ms Rosenfeld, along with the company’s improved financial performance as it completed a three-year turnround plan.Ms Rosenfeld’s $26.3m in 2009 compensation compared with $18.7m in 2008. Her package included shares, a base salary of $1.47m and cash incentives of $10.86m, up from a cash incentive award of $4.07m for 2008.The package puts Ms Rosenfeld’s 2009 compensation more than 40 per cent higher than the $18.8m paid to Muhtar Kent, her counterpart at Coca-Cola, and two-thirds more than the $15.8m paid to Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo.
567;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-03-22T20:52:09Z;US healthcare stocks lead gains;;"US stocks rebounded after a weak opening on Monday following the passage of the healthcare bill. But traders cautioned that with an agreement on aid for Greece looking increasingly unlikely, the rally might not prove sustainable.US Democrats narrowly won enough votes in the House of Representatives to enact President Barack Obama’s historic legislation and expand healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured Americans.Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, said: “Within the healthcare sector, the impact is mixed: the HMO [healthcare insurance] industry is negatively impacted; while the hospital companies, along with other beneficiaries of increasing healthcare volumes, benefit. However, much of this impact has already been priced into the sector.”More broadly, he said, the healthcare bill may turn out to be a catalyst for a potential 5-10 per cent stock market decline due to the impact of higher taxation. “The potential negative outcome for the broader market stems from the tax and deficit impacts of the legislation.”The S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,165.81, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.4 per cent at 10,785.89 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.9 per cent at 2,395.40.Standard & Poor’s healthcare sector index outperformed the broader market, climbing 9.2 per cent. The legislative overhaul has been interpreted by some people as helping healthcare companies by adding more insured customers.Healthcare insurers were mixed after their rally last week. Aetna was up 0.5 per cent to $34.64, UnitedHealth Group lost 3.3 per cent to $33.25 and WellPoint fell 1.1 per cent to $64.39.Pharma stocks gained. Pfizer rallied 1.4 per cent to $17.15, Merck rose 0.6 per cent to $38.30; Eli Lilly added 1 per cent to $36.54.Generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals was up 2.2 per cent to $64.43 and peer Mylan rallied 1.7 per cent to $22.91. Hospital companies were some of the biggest gainers of the session. Health Management rose 11.3 per cent to $9.05 and Tenet Healthcare rallied 9 per cent to $6.27.Google was in focus, sending its stock 0.5 per cent lower to $557.50, as the search engine provider announced it is redirecting all search requests on its local Chinese service to its Hong Kong arm following its dispute with Beijing over censorship, saying it “will meaningfully increase access to information for people in China”.Tiffany & Co rose 0.3 per cent to $47.41, reversing earlier loses, as the luxury jeweller reported strong fourth-quarter results that nevertheless missed analyst estimates. Pay and other variable expenses rose.Boeing, the world’s largest aircraft manufacturer, was one of the Dow’s top risers on the back of two broker upgrades, climbing 1.7 per cent to $71.91.Barclays Capital raised its target price to $87 from $65, citing better-than-expected traffic and recently announced increases in
production. Oppenheimer raised it to “outperform” from “underperform”.Novell advanced 4.4 per cent to $5.89 after it said it was willing to consider being acquired. The maker of Linux-operating software rejected an unsolicited $5.75-per-share bid by Elliott Associates, a New York-based hedge fund, over the weekend, saying it undervalued the company. Elliott said it remained committed to buying Novell.Consol Energy, a coal and natural gas producer, lost 1.9 per cent to $44.69 after the company said it would offer to buy the remaining shares of CNX Gas that it did not already own for about $965m. The offer is for $38.25 per share, a 24 per cent premium from the CNX closing price last Friday. CNX jumped 22.9 per cent to $37.84.Gourmet cookware retailer Williams-Sonoma rose 12.3 per cent to $27.10 after posting strong fourth-quarter results that easily beat analyst estimates. It forecast net revenue growth of 3-6 per cent this year. It raised its dividend by 8.3 per cent.PepsiCo lost 0.4 per cent to $66.31 as it vowed to cut by a quarter levels of salt, sugar and saturated fats in its top-selling products over the coming decade as pressure grows for it to encourage healthier eating."
568;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Pepsi pledges healthier foods;;PepsiCo will on Monday pledge to cut levels of salt, sugar and saturated fats in its top-selling products by a quarter during the coming decade amid rising pressure from governments to encourage healthier eating.The US group – which in addition to Pepsi, owns the Frito-Lay and Quaker brands – plans a reduction of 25 per cent in sodium content from 2006 levels by 2015, and the same amount in sugar and 15 per cent in saturated fats by 2020, while increasing whole grain, fruit, vegetable, nut, seed and low-fat dairy content.Similar steps have been taken by other US food companies, including Con-Agra, Kraft and Campbell. Health officials have threatened regulation if action is not forthcoming on reducing levels of salt, sugar and saturated fats in products.The World Health Organisation has said that reductions in these ingredients could help tackle diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other conditions. It said this was of increasing importance in the developing as well as developed world.PepsiCo will not commit to absolute levels of sugar, fat and salt, but will by 2012 display calorie counts and key nutrients on its packaging and, as it announced last week, eliminate direct sales of full-sugar soft drinks to primary and secondary schools.Derek Yach, senior vice-president of global health policy, said: “This goes beyond many of the calls for action by governments . . . [which] have mostly lacked any competence to launch, implement and monitor reductions. The advantage of a self-regulatory system is it puts the costs of action and enforcement on industry.”PepsiCo will also shift from palm to sunflower oil to reduce saturated fat and substitute artificial sweeteners for sugar.It said it aimed to increase its “good for you” portfolio of healthier products to $30bn in annual sales in the coming decade, up from $10bn.In January, Michael Bloomberg, New York mayor, called for restaurants and food companies to lower the salt content of food by 25 per cent in five years, building on policies to ban trans-fats and require fast-food outlets to list calories on menus.A suit was filed last summer against Denny’s, calling for the restaurant’s menus to list the sodium content of each meal.In 2006 PepsiCo began advertising healthier products and experimenting with reduced sodium content. It says reductions of up to 80 per cent fat in its Walkers Sunseed brand removed 40,000 tonnes of saturates from the UK diet.
569;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-03-19T20:25:21Z;NY parents turn up heat on ‘bake sales’ ban;;New York’s standard-setting efforts to improve the health of its citizens have provoked resistance in the past from bar owners, fast food restaurants and global food and drink companies.But this week it was the turn of parents selling muffins, brownies and spinach empanadas on the steps of City Hall.About 300 people turned out to oppose new city regulations that, in effect, ban school “bake sales” – an all-American fundraising staple where students and parents sell homebaked cakes and cookies to fund museum trips and equip their sports teams.The sales, which can raise as much as $500 a time, have fallen foul of efforts by the Department of Education to improve the nutritional quality of foods available in schools as part of its battle against rising levels of childhood obesity.The new rules have provoked an additional backlash because they permit students instead to sell manufactured products that are approved for the city’s school vending machines. The 27 approved snacks include Kellogg’s whole-grain brown-sugar and cinnamon Pop Tarts, and PepsiCo’s cool ranch-flavoured reduced-fat Doritos.“You are sending a terrible message that these foods are better than the foods their parents prepare at home,” says Elizabeth Puccini, a mother with a daughter in a Manhattan school and one of the organisers of Thursday’s protest.“You are creating in these students the habit of thinking of these kinds of snack as acceptable food.”In an effort to respond to the criticism, the education department has allowed Parent Teacher Associations, rather than students, to organise one bake sale a month, saying it is trying to balance “the need to combat obesity and the desire of parents and students to engage in fundraising through food sales”.But Ms Puccini is still hopeful that the ban may be rescinded. Bill de Blasio, the city’s elected ombudsman, attended the protest bake-in, as did Gail Brewer, a city council member for Manhattan’s parent-rich Upper West Side, who is calling for a public hearing.New York’s school snack-vending machines have some of the strictest nutritional requirements of any big school district in the US, under a contract that is expected to bring the schools $28m over five years.However, Ms Puccini argues that instead of attacking homemade brownies, the city should ask itself whether the vending machines should be there at all.
570;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-03-16T15:05:22Z;A respite from classes with the football tournament;;"We face a gruelling two weeks as the first part of our spring semester comes to a close. Group assignments due, individual assignments due and exams to prepare for. All in all people are stressed; tempers are frayed and no-one wants to commit to anything… anything that is school related, that is.This last weekend saw the culmination of months of planning, preparation and hard work for the football club’s tournament committee in the form of the ‘inaugural Asian MBA football tournament’.Let me just say, it was all worth it. We managed to get sponsorship from Pepsi and Li Ning in the form of Gatorade, Mountain Dew and full kit from the latter.We had support from fellow MBA students and the atmosphere was fantastic. We even had our own emblem.We had two HKUST teams (with huge rivalry) our alumni brought along a team, Hong Kong University had a team and, to top it all, Insead and Ceibs flew in for the occasion. It was not the most beautiful day by any stretch of the imagination; it was foggy and quite miserable. Luckily though, the weather could not dampen anyone’s spirits and the day went down as one of the best events we have had so far as MBAs.The irony was that after a gripping semi final (which went to penalties for them against Insead) the final was played between HKUST ‘R’ and HKUST ‘S’. It was not a friendly match. Although, we had all been talking it up for weeks, we were not at all prepared to play each other in the final! Luckily my team pulled through and I now have bragging rights over Mr B (who played in the other team).The day came to an end with food and drinks shared in the ‘uni’ bar and the celebrations carried on for much longer in town with those who still had any energy left in them.Although the planning has taken chunks out of peoples lives and there are a few bumps and bruises to show for the day, I think everyone will agree that it was well worth it by the end of the tournament.We certainly hope the tradition will stick with the future MBA-ers."

Agency: BBDO Toronto
Territory: Canada
Verdict:Everyone knows orange juice is good for you, so another ad touting its health benefits held limited appeal for Tropicana Canada and BBDO Toronto, its ad agency. Instead, it has decided to reinforce the brand’s association with sunshine and its signature image of an orange with a straw sticking out of it, while retaining a distinctly Canadian flavour.In early January, the agency dispatched a documentary film-making team to Inuvik, a town of 3,450 located in Canada’s Northwest Territories, above the Arctic Circle, where the sun disappears for months in the winter. There, the filmmakers captured scenes from the village as the production crew inflated and raised a huge helium balloon filled with bright light.Not since The Prisoner, the 1960s television series, has a large inflatable white balloon had such a profound effect on a remote village. The commercial shows how even an artificial sun can energise a community stuck in a state of near-permanent darkness.In addition to a few days of artificial sunshine, Tropicana gave away a carton of orange juice to every household in the community and made contributions to local daycare centres, food banks and school breakfast programmes.But perhaps the most effective part of the campaign is the way Tropicana turned it into a media event, inviting a team from Breakfast Television, a popular morning programme in Canada, to cover the making of the ad, and sparking online enthusiasm.

The manufacturing component, however, fell 0.2 per cent.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent to 1,150.51 – importantly because 1,500 is a key technical level traders track.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 10,642.15. and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent off at 2,362.21.“We have seen the bottom of the abyss for the American consumer as measured by residential real estate prices, which have now bottomed out, and the worst it’s going to get with the unemployment situation,” said Len Blum, managing partner at Westwood Capital. “This is incredibly important as consumer spending accounts for about 70 per cent of US economic activity.”Phillips-Van Heusen, an apparel company that owns the Calvin Klein brand among others, climbed 9.8 per cent to $52.40 after it announced it was to buy Tommy Hilfiger from Apax Partners, a private equity fund, for about $3bn.Walmart gained 2.8 per cent to $55.42 as Citigroup upgraded the stock from “hold” to “buy” and raised its target price from $54 to $65.“Walmart realises that it must act now to keep the customer and we expect Walmart to invest aggressively in price,” said Deborah Weinswig, analyst at Citigroup.Consol Energy, a coal and natural gas producer, lost 10.1 per cent to $48.85 after the company said it has agreed to buy Dominion Resources’ natural gas and oil exploration and production business for $3.5bn.The deal includes rights to 491,000 acres in West Virginia and Pennsylvania that will increase Consol’s natural gas reserves by about 50 per cent to 3,000bn cubic feet.Boston Scientific lost 12.6 per cent to $6.80, making it one of the biggest laggards in the S&P 500 index, after analysts at Sanford Bernstein said the company had halted sales of heart-rhythm devices because of a documentation error with its US regulatory filings. The devices brought in $1.8bn last year or 22 per cent of the group’s revenue.PepsiCo shares gained 1.6 per cent to $66.15 on news that the soft drink company raised its dividend by 7 per cent and said it would repurchase up to $15bn of stock. It expects to repurchase about $4.4bn of common stock this year.About 70 companies in the S&P 500 have raised their dividends this year.Google was 2.8 per cent lower to $563.18. on reports that its advertisers in China are being advised to switch to rivals as speculation grows that the company will have to shut its Chinese website. Last week, Chinese government officials said Google’s plan to end censorship of the website was “irresponsible”.Shares in Baidu, China’s leading internet search engine, strengthened 4.8 per cent to $576.84.Banks stocks were lower across the board in advance of the finance reform bill that was set to be presented late in the session on Monday.Citigroup led the sector lower, falling 2 per cent to $3.89.

573;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-03-15T18:43:28Z;Paradise lost for unemployed Canarians;;"For a visitor admiring the Atlantic billows from a seafront promenade in Las Palmas, it is hard to believe that the so-called “Fortunate Isles” are in the grip of economic crisis. The sun still shines, the palm trees sway and the sea is blue.Yet the Canary Islands, the Spanish subtropical archipelago whose exports of bananas and tomatoes gave the name to London’s Canary Wharf, exemplify the fragility of Europe’s peripheral economies after nearly two years of slowdown and recession.Unemployment, in particular, has reached a level that would be regarded as catastrophic in other European Union countries: 27 per cent of the Canarian workforce is without a job, and the figure is nearly 50 per cent for those under 25.Carmen Ramírez, a cheerful, 46-year-old secretary, lost her job in November when the property developer that employed her could not sell its holiday apartments.Having worked for more than a decade, Ms Ramírez is eligible for a generous pay-off and two years of social security benefits. But she is not optimistic as she sips a Pepsi and explains her plight in an open-air hotel bar. “I think the bad year will be 2010,” she says, before adding the afterthought: “And 2011.”That view is shared by entrepreneurs, bankers and social workers on the island of Gran Canaria, of which Las Palmas is the capital.“People who no longer needed our help have come back,” says Josefina Martín of the Red Cross, which supports immigrants and other economically vulnerable groups. “We’re getting more Spaniards too. Even members of the Red Cross who gave us money in the past are now coming to us for help.”Even compared with the rest of Spain, let alone northern Europe, the Canaries were particularly exposed to the cyclical businesses of tourism and construction when the crisis struck.One reason for the high unemployment rate is that migrants from mainland Spain and abroad flocked to the islands to benefit from a building boom fuelled by bank credit and EU funds, pushing the population up by more than a quarter in a decade to more than 2m. Construction has now almost come to a stop.Business people on the island nevertheless warn visitors against reading too much into the grim statistics. “Look, if unemployment was really at 27 per cent there would be riots in the streets,” says a senior local banker. “And there aren’t.
It’s because of the underground economy.”A high street branch manager for another bank agrees that the situation is not as dire as the numbers suggest. “The Canaries is a bit like Andalucía [in southern Spain], where unemployment is also high. The climate is one reason. You’re comfortable, and one day just comes after another.”But the black economy – where people work for cash out of sight of the tax authorities while claiming social security benefits – has been hit almost as hard as the legitimate one. Canarians, furthermore, know their workforce is under-educated and vulnerable to further falls in tourism, especially among the Britons who may be affected by the decline of sterling.The regional government is doing its best to lure foreign investors to the islands with the help of the archipelago’s special regime of low taxes, and to promote biotechnology and other new industries to reduce dependence on the 10m tourists who visit each year.To the chagrin of employers, however, jobless Canarians, like other Spaniards, are more likely to covet safe and well rewarded jobs in the civil service than to launch their own businesses or to work in the private sector for lower pay.Ms Ramírez plans to sit the necessary civil service entrance exam this spring, but says she will be one of 4,000 contestants for only 78 vacancies. When the port in Las Palmas said it was looking for 15 reserve police officers – with no work guaranteed – it received 900 applications.With small shops closing for lack of custom, property companies defaulting on their debts and the unemployed staring out to sea from benches flanked by empty apartment blocks, there are few optimistic locals in Las Palmas these days.“Every month we see more clients who have lost their jobs,” says the bank manager, whose doleful manner suggests it will be a long time before he recognises his home as one of the “Fortunate Isles” of legend. “We are not euphoric at the best of times,” he says. “But I think the worst is still to come.”"
574;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-03-12T19:41:43Z;The inside story of the Cadbury takeover;;Todd Stitzer had been working for Cadbury Schweppes for nearly 20 years when he was called by its chief executive one day in February 2000 and handed a mission to complete. Harvard-educated and ambitious, the 47-year-old ­American, then based in Dallas, Texas, had won attention at Cadbury’s London headquarters for masterminding the acquisition of several soft drinks brands in the US, including 7UP and Dr Pepper. Now his boss, John Sunderland, wanted him to move to London to do the same thing for the confectionery side of the business: get out there and start buying companies.It had been three decades since a merger between a revered British confectionery group and a ­­­­soft drinks brand created by a German-Swiss watchmaker had formed Cadbury Schweppes, and Sunderland had made some decisions about the company’s future. Cadbury was number three in the global soft drinks market, but he knew it would never overtake the two leaders, Coca-Cola and Pepsi. On the other hand, the market for chocolate and other sweets was much more open, split among a big group of international companies including Mars, Wrigley, Kraft, Hershey, Ferrero and Nestlé. “We had a real opportunity to become the leading confectionery house,” Sunderland says.Two weeks after his discussions with Sunderland, Stitzer moved from New York to London to become the company’s chief strategy officer. He put together a team to evaluate possible acquisitions and got to work. After one more big soft-drinks deal – the purchase in late 2000 of Snapple for £986m from Triarc, an American restaurant chain – Stitzer’s team turned its attention to confectionery companies. “Forever Cadbury lusted after being the largest chocolate company in the world,” Stitzer says at Cadbury’s headquarters in an office park in west London. That’s where its roots were, after all – drinking chocolate. “But the fastest-growing, highest-margin part of the confectionery business was the gum business.” His team, with Sunderland’s approval, started chasing chewing-gum brands, picking up names such as Hollywood and Dandy.In December 2002, they made a bolder move, spending $4.2bn to buy a gum company called Adams that had been put up for sale by the US drugs company Pfizer. Adams was not the biggest gum group in the US – that title was held by Wrigley – but its products were desirable: Trident sugar-free gum, Dentyne Ice chewing gum and Halls cough lozenges. More important, the deal made Cadbury the biggest confectionery company in the world, albeit on the back of a wider range of products than simply chocolate and sweets.Nor was the deal just a gambit to gain prestige. Profit margins in Cadbury’s core confectionery business had been falling in the late 1990s and early 2000s, indicating its growth was in decline. “The performance of the company was not exciting,” says Roger Carr, who took over from Sunderland as chairman in July 2008. “There was slow growth, and people were not at all enamoured by the business model. Few institutions in the UK wanted to buy the stock. The only people who saw investment potential were the Americans.”…Acquisitions alone wouldn’t solve Cadbury’s problems, according to Stitzer. Its organic growth was weak because it was spending less than its peers on marketing, innovation and capital expenditure. “We agreed as a team,” he says, referring to Cadbury’s top executives, “that we would revitalise Cadbury around a revenue-growth model that would deliver financial benefits if managed or operated in the right way.”Analysts and investors, however, were sceptical about some of the purchases that were supposed to support that strategy, particularly the deal to buy Adams. Many believed Cadbury Schweppes had overpaid. Its share price, which had approached 600p on the London Stock Exchange in 2002, slid close to 400p in early 2003.In May 2003, the company’s board – undaunted by the market’s scepticism – asked Stitzer to take over from Sunderland as CEO, citing him as the best person to lead the company forward in its “continuing drive for growth and efficiency”. Sunderland moved up to become chairman. If anyone before had doubted the direction in which Stitzer wanted to take Cadbury, it became clear during a series of financial presentations he made to investors in London and New York that October. He outlined an ambitious restructuring programme, Fuel for Growth, which aimed to achieve substantial increases in sales and profits between 2004 and 2007. Stitzer also followed Sunderland’s thinking back in 2000 to its next logical step. Inside the company, a conversation began about getting out of soft drinks.Although the Adams acquisition had made Cadbury the world’s biggest confectionery group, its global market share was just 10 per cent – so it retained only a slim lead over its competitors. For decades, Cadbury’s management had fantasised about teaming up with Hershey. The American company had bought the licence to make and sell Cadbury-branded products in the US in the late 1980s and was considered an ideal partner. In 2002, Cadbury joined forces with Nestlé to try to buy Hershey (which also owns the US licence to Nestlé’s Kit Kat brand), while Wrigley also made an offer. But Hershey is run by a charitable trust reluctant to lose control of the company, and it backed away from a sale before any deal could be completed.Stitzer believed Cadbury could broaden its deal-making options if it had more firepower. If it sold the US drinks business – estimated to be worth up to $13bn – it could target other confectionery companies such as Italy’s Ferrero (which owned brands like Ferrero Rocher and Kinder) as well as the European arm of Kraft, which included brands such as Milka, Côte D’Or and Toblerone. “We had roughly a one-tenth share of the global confectionery market and felt there were opportunities that would allow us to get to 15 per cent or 16 per cent,” Stitzer recalls. “But we needed significant financial assets to get us there.”…While Stitzer and his management team were planning global domination of the confectionery world, Cadbury Schweppes investors were worrying about the company’s financial performance. In early 2006, the company decided to off-load its European soft drinks brands, which included Orangina and Oasis, for €1.85bn to private equity fund Lion Capital and hedge fund Blackstone. (Three years later, after increasing sales and profits, Lion and Blackstone sold Orangina Schweppes to Japan’s Suntory Group for €2.6bn.) The sale led to market speculation that Cadbury might also be on the verge of selling its US drinks brands and the company’s stock price rose. In public, however, Cadbury executives remained tight-lipped.The year 2006 was a bad one for Cadbury. Salmonella contamination in some of its British factories forced it to recall more than a million chocolate bars, a safety breach that earnt a £1m fine. Its profits were hit by an accounting scandal in Nigeria, and the Fuel for Growth plan missed its financial targets.What investors didn’t know was that in October 2006, Cadbury’s management had recommended to the board that it should get rid of the US brands. But nothing was said in public to that effect. In fact, at an investor conference in London that same month, Cadbury’s management indicated they had no plans to split the remaining soft drinks and confectionery businesses. They did, of course, but there was no agreement about how to do it. Sunderland, as chairman, was reluctant to sell without having lined up a confectionery deal on which to spend the proceeds, worrying that unless they did that, Cadbury would turn itself into a takeover target for a rival. It was a case of eat or be eaten.For his part, Stitzer now says he didn’t want to set rumours running in the market by hinting at a sale before Cadbury was ready to go ahead. “What you don’t want to do is create a speculative frenzy about a particular asset: it’s deleterious to the running of the business.” Equally, he and his fellow managers would have been unwise to try to force their board into agreeing to a sale by letting word of the idea leak out.…While management and the board debated what to do, a figure from Cadbury’s recent past reappeared on the scene. Nelson Peltz was the founder of a hedge fund called Trian Fund Management and the investor behind Triarc, the restaurant chain that had sold Snapple to Cadbury six years before. Now, he started taking an active interest in Cadbury once again.Peltz liked confectionery. He believed it had strong growth potential and was not hampered by competition from supermarket “own label” brands, as is the case with so many other products. He began buying shares in Cadbury Schweppes in late 2006 and arranged a meeting with Stitzer in London in February 2007. At that meeting, Peltz told Stitzer that Cadbury Schweppes should be achieving the same kind of profit margins as Wrigley and Hershey, and that he wanted to see its US soft drinks and confectionery businesses separated. His vision for Cadbury was similar to Stitzer’s.What Cadbury’s management didn’t realise was that Peltz wasn’t focused on Cadbury Schweppes alone. In 2007 he also started buying shares in the US food company Kraft, eventually building a 3 per cent stake. Peltz told Kraft it too could grow faster if it slimmed down. Get rid of brands such as Maxwell House coffee, he said. Get rid of Post Cereals. See what doors opened from there.Peltz’s attempts to agitate for change progressively gained support. In early 2007, around the time of his meeting with Stitzer, Cadbury Schweppes’ board learnt that one-third of its shareholder register, which was weighted towards US investors, was pushing for the split. This put the directors in a difficult position. They had been holding serious talks again with Hershey about some kind of merger, but as had happened so often in the past, there was a significant risk that the conversation would go nowhere.The board decided to allow management to go ahead with its plan to split the company, reasoning that they would rather try to control their own destiny than deal with a long-running “war of attrition” from shareholders who wanted to see the US soft drinks brands sold. “The risk of separation was that someone might come along and seek to buy Cadbury Schweppes,” says Carr, who had joined the Cadbury board in 2001 and became its deputy chairman and senior independent director in May 2003. “But the risk of staying as you were was to run the business inappropriately [by not maximising value for shareholders]. And boards can’t do that.”In early 2007, Cadbury Schweppes started discussions with private equity firms over a possible sale of the US drinks brands. Its timing could not have been worse. In August, the years of cheap borrowing that had funded ever larger deals came to an abrupt halt – the first hints of the credit crunch that would precede a global financial crisis. Suddenly, private equity companies were struggling to raise the money they needed to pay for the business. And without that cash, Cadbury’s hopes of pulling off a big acquisition of its own looked forlorn.The management did not completely abandon hope of selling the US drinks brands, but they started planning to separate confectionery and drinks into two companies and then to list the drinks business on the US stock market, issuing existing investors with shares in the newly formed Dr Pepper Snapple Group. As the credit crunch intensified and it became clear that a sale was impossible, the demerger went ahead in mid-2008.Cadbury dropped “Schweppes” from its name, and told investors it would “flourish” as an independent company – and thereby the world’s leading pure-play confectionery group. But its hold on that title was short-lived. In April 2008, just as shares in the new drinks company were to start trading in New York, Mars announced that it had agreed to buy Wrigley for £11.5bn ($23bn). Cadbury had been eclipsed.…At Kraft’s headquarters in Illinois, Irene Rosenfeld was watching developments in the confectionery world with keen interest. When Rosenfeld became chief executive of Kraft in June 2006, she immediately began trying to boost the company’s sluggish growth with a series of disposals and acquisitions. She sold Post Cereals, as Peltz had urged, and bought the LU biscuit brand from France’s Danone. She then turned her attention to confectionery. Kraft had been interested in Cadbury’s sweets brands for some time but as long as the UK company owned soft drinks as well, it was too big and unwieldy for Kraft to consider buying. Now, in 2008, things were changing. Although the demerger had fuelled press speculation that Cadbury had made itself a takeover target – because it was now a nice, simple business ripe for sale – its executives were too busy getting their house in order to worry much about potential suitors.In July 2008, Carr had replaced Sunderland as Cadbury’s chairman, and was pushing management to meet a tough new set of financial goals, including lifting profit margins into the “mid teens” by 2011 from around 10 per cent in 2007. The company was also undergoing extensive restructuring, closing factories and cutting jobs, as well as moving out of its headquarters in Berkeley Square in 2008 to cheaper office space near Heathrow. All the while, Peltz remained on the scene. He kept up the pressure on Cadbury, demanding that Colin Day, finance director of Reckitt Benckiser, a high-performing British household products company, be invited to join the board (Day became a board member in December 2008).Carr, meanwhile, was under pressure to prove himself at Cadbury. A well-known businessman with a reputation as a tough negotiator, Carr had helped to build the engineering group Williams Holdings into a conglomerate specialising in fire protection and security, with a series of deals during the 1980s and 1990s, and then broke it up in 2000. But his reputation was coming under pressure due to difficulties in his job at pub operator Mitchells & Butlers, the company where he had been chairman since 2003. M&B had lost hundreds of millions of pounds on hedges related to property investments, its finance director had left, and some investors were calling for a deeper boardroom overhaul. (Carr stepped down as chairman of M&B in mid-2008.)As Carr and Stitzer worked on improving Cadbury’s financial performance, Rosenfeld spotted an opportunity. She left Carr a message on his mobile in late August 2009, requesting a meeting. When the two met in central London on August 28, she made an unexpected proposal: Kraft wanted to buy Cadbury and was prepared to offer around £10.2bn or 745p a share in cash and stock – 31 per cent more than Cadbury’s share price a few days earlier. Carr rejected the offer without consulting Cadbury shareholders because he thought it was too low to take seriously. Ten days later, Rosenfeld went public with her proposal.Peltz, who still owned shares in Cadbury, didn’t know that Kraft was planning on making a bid for Cadbury, but he was not unhappy when he heard about it. To force Kraft’s hand – because Rosenfeld’s proposal did not constitute a formal offer for Cadbury – the British company’s management asked the Takeover Panel to issue a “put up or shut up ruling”. Kraft “put up”, going direct to Cadbury’s shareholders with a formal offer, and in effect turning its negotiations with Cadbury into a hostile bid.As the 60-day timetable that governs takeovers in the UK got under way, Carr led an independence campaign for Cadbury, telling shareholders not to let Kraft “steal” their company and urging them to reject this offer from a conglomerate with an “unappealing” business model. He claimed Cadbury could deliver more value for shareholders if it stayed independent. Carr refused to pander to nationalistic sentiments in his takeover defence, maintaining that he was committed to shareholder value. But the potential loss of one of Britain’s most famous brands to an American predator sparked concern in political circles, with business secretary Peter Mandelson warning Kraft in December that it would face opposition from the government as well as the local population if it intended to make “a fast buck”. But the government did not take any action to prevent the bid, or secure commitments from Kraft to protect British factories or jobs. As the bid proceeded, increasing numbers of Cadbury’s shares changed hands, as traditional investors sold and hedge funds bought them in order to take bets on whether Kraft would succeed.At times during the takeover process, it looked as if Cadbury had a real chance of seeing off Kraft. Its share price hovered around 800p – well above the value of Kraft’s initial offer – while Rosenfeld was criticised by her largest shareholder, billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Buffett made a public statement suggesting Kraft was using too many of its undervalued shares to buy Cadbury (Kraft’s initial offer was 60 per cent stock and 40 per cent cash) and that he wouldn’t vote in favour of Kraft’s proposal. He wasn’t against the idea of Kraft buying Cadbury, he just didn’t like the way Rosenfeld was going about it.But when Kraft eventually raised its offer to 850p in late January 2010, and switched the stock-cash ratio it was offering to 40 per cent stock and 60 per cent cash, Cadbury’s board did an about turn and agreed to recommend the offer to its shareholders. So it was, that in the early hours of January 19 2010, Cadbury’s 186 years of independence came to an end.…When Cadbury employees woke that morning to newspaper headlines announcing the impending sale of their employer, many were surprised and angry. Some descendants of Cadbury’s founders were, too. They claimed that hedge funds and other short-term investors – which owned close to one-third of the company’s stock as the bid battle drew to a close, up from just 5 per cent before Kraft went public with its offer in September 2009 – had sold Cadbury out.Institutional investors, meanwhile, were concerned that Cadbury had given in too easily. Cadbury’s second-largest shareholder, Legal & General, issued a statement saying the final price did not “fully reflect the long-term value of the company” and that it was “disappointed” management had recommended the offer for an “iconic and unique British company”.Some bankers involved in advising prospective counter-bidders for Cadbury claimed Cadbury’s board made no serious attempt to get an auction going for the company. Hershey and the family-run Italian group Ferrero seriously considered teaming up to try and trump Kraft’s offer, although they never came forward with a formal bid of their own. Akeel Sachak, global head of consumer banking at Rothschild and Ferrero’s financial adviser, says: “There is no doubt in my mind that Ferrero had the appetite and capacity to deliver with Hershey an offer that would have brought more value to Cadbury than Kraft’s offer. But they were defeated by the vagaries of UK public bid rules and the decision-making tempo of a deeply private family [the Ferrero owners] unfamiliar with public mergers and acquisitions.”Carr, for his part, points out that Ferrero and Hershey never put a serious counter-offer on the table, and argues that he obtained the best price possible for Cadbury in the circumstances. He believes that hedge funds would have sold their shares to Kraft at 830p and that only by negotiating with Rosenfeld had the company got as much as 850p. “Independence as an option had gone,” he says. “The cause was lost … the decision then was to negotiate for what I and the board felt was the recommendable price.”He claims the company’s Achilles heel was the large proportion of hedge funds on its shareholder register, as well as a historic lack of interest from UK institutions in the stock (in September 2009, UK institutions owned around 28 per cent of Cadbury while US institutions – less worried than their British counterparts about Cadbury falling to an American rival – owned nearly half of the stock). “The seeds of destruction for this company lay in its [shareholder] register,” Carr says. “If you’ve only got 28 per cent long domestic funds owning this company, then you know that in a bid the rest are likely to sell.”Carr says British regulators should consider changes to the country’s takeover rules to lift the acceptance threshold to 60 per cent (from 50 per cent today) so that long-term shareholders may have a larger sway in a bid situation. Sunderland is of a similar opinion. “I am a free trader but [the Cadbury takeover] has made me think deeply about this issue,” he says. “The Takeover Code was written at a time when the ownership model was very different and when a hostile bid didn’t automatically land one-third of the register in the hands of arbitrageurs …we need to think about making the British market a little less open, a little less permissive.”Still, neither government nor Britain’s opposition Conservative party has yet set out formal proposals to change the takeover rules. It is not yet certain whether Cadbury will prove to be some kind of tipping point following a long line of foreign takeovers of British companies, including steel group Corus, airports operator BAA and chemicals group ICI.Meanwhile, hedge funds take umbrage at the idea that they are to blame for Cadbury’s sale. “We’re kind of an easy target,” says one US-based hedge fund manager who bought shares in Cadbury during the takeover bid, pointing out that institutional investors also decided to sell their shares to Kraft. “Institutions aren’t in the business of losing money either.”Other investors agree that Cadbury’s takeover is not the fault of hedge funds. David Herro, chief investment officer at US group Harris Associates, says: “The reason Cadbury was sold was that it was under-managed … Good, well-run companies don’t just get taken out like that.”…Investors say that while Cadbury’s management was good at making deals, it was less skilled at running the business day to day. “There’s a difference between strategic management and operational management,” says one former Cadbury investor based in the US, noting that the company seemed constantly to be taking charges for restructuring. “They were good at the former and not at the latter.”Some say that if Cadbury had been better managed and more profitable – like Reckitt Benckiser, for instance – its stock price would have been higher, and it might have been too expensive for Kraft. People close to Kraft say the US food group would probably not have been able to afford 900p a share. Investors add that over the years Cadbury had disappointed its shareholders too often, so that even when its business started improving in 2008 and 2009, institutions were wary about placing much faith in its management. As a result, they were reluctant to buy the stock. “Investors have long memories,” says one fund manager. “They just couldn’t think that Cadbury was changing so they were unwilling to believe what the management team was saying.”Investors were particularly aggrieved by the company’s failure to tell them that it was thinking of selling its US drinks arm in 2006. Julian Hardwick, a financial analyst at the Royal Bank of Scotland, says: “A lot of people did feel that Cadbury had not communicated the way their thinking had evolved …that damaged management credibility.”Hardwick agrees that if Cadbury had found a way to improve its profits earlier, it would have been less vulnerable to a takeover. “The tragedy was that it all happened too late,” he says. “In an ideal world they would have made faster progress …and they would have commanded an earnings multiple that would have made them more impregnable to someone like Kraft.”Few people in the UK are happy that Cadbury ended up being sold to Kraft. Even Peltz believes there is a risk the company’s much-loved brands will not get the attention they deserve in a big food company that sells everything from instant coffee to hot dogs. “That’s a justifiable concern,” he says, adding that Kraft will however be successful if it makes confectionery and snacks the most important part of its business. “That’s what they will be judged on.”Stitzer, who resigned as chief executive a few days after Kraft sealed its deal, says: “I spent 27 years of my life at this company, I absolutely love what it stands for and what it has done …the whole idea that ‘doing good is good for business’, the intersection of principled capitalism, and commercial and financial performance, is what drives people at this company. They actually believe that not only are they great confectionery marketers or sellers or manufacturers but that it means something because the Cadbury Cocoa Partnership is investing in underdeveloped farming areas or because the chocolates have been certified by Fairtrade.”Carr says he feels a sense of sadness for “the loss of a business that was sound and the independence of something that was good”. “If the company had done a number of things earlier, then you wouldn’t have had the criticism from activist investors and you may not have had the relative disinterest from UK institutions in owning Cadbury.” Still, he maintains there is no point being nostalgic, despite Britain’s loss of household brands such as Roses chocolates and Bournville cocoa. “It hadn’t been a family company for 50 years, it hadn’t had a member of the family working in it for a decade. Fifty per cent of the company was purchased from an American drug company – it simply wasn’t the business people believed it to be.”Jenny Wiggins’ last piece for the magazine was about retrenchment at Starbucks.

The more stable trading conditions of recent months may have given investor relations teams a more upbeat message to sell. But they still have to battle for the attention of investors and analysts.Britvic, the soft drinks group that includes Pepsi and Tango in its range, has the advantage of a readily-recognisable consumer product but the company itself has to work at obtaining recognition outside the UK. McBride, a supplier of own-label household and personal care products to supermarkets, is probably in most homes but remains unknown to the majority of its customers.Mitie, a support services group, cleans the Tower of London and provides security at Eurostar’s London St Pancras terminal but attracts little attention to itself for these vital but humdrum activities. The green-and-white lorries of Stobart Group, the transport and logistics provider, are familiar to drivers on Britain’s motorways but the company was less well known in the City until its 2007 listing.Websites play an increasingly important role in investor communications. The best provide almost as a matter of routine masses of data on company performance, share price movements and brokers’ forecasts that would have required hours of patient searching only a few years ago.They are becoming more interactive, allowing investors to manipulate data, and providing webcasts that allow distant investors to participate in AGMs and results presentations. McBride, with 19 factories in seven countries, offers six languages on its website alongside English. But websites are only part of the picture and meetings with analysts, site visits and AGMs also play a big role.“We don’t have a brand presence with customers,” says Bob Beveridge, company secretary and head of strategy at McBride. “The challenge for us is to communicate with people who have never heard of us. We try to boil everything down to a clear simple message.”Part of that message is to convince investors that own-label products are not just a cheaper version of the branded competition but that they provide value for the customer and a higher margin for the supermarket. “We don’t keep the same product on the shelves for years; we develop a new one,” says Mr Beveridge. “We help our customers compete. The Sainsbury’s dishwasher tablets are different from Tesco’s.”The effectiveness of McBride’s communications is reflected in the arrival of new investors from the UK, continental Europe and the US in the past three years. The biggest shareholder is Invesco Perpetual with a 17 per cent holding. “We have broadened the pool of investors by communicating more clearly,” Mr Beveridge explains.For Mitie, the challenge is to ensure that investors and analysts have easy access to senior management without distracting managers from running the business. “Our website allows people to get the basic information but analysts want to get a feel for the management,” says Erica Lockhart, investor relations manager.“We did an overview of the strategy for our annual report and the website,” Ms Lockhart explains. “We looked at best practice and made sure we were at the top of our game.”The company puts on a road show twice a year but also arranges for investors to meet the investor relations team or senior managers on a monthly basis. In January it took analysts and investors to visit some of the 15 sites it manages in London.One aspect of the company’s business that it was keen to explain to investors was the move from providing a single service to a customer – for, say, cleaning – to integrated contracts that embrace all the facilities management services required for a site or a building. “It was important to communicate that the business had changed,” says Ms Lockhart.Stobart Group obtained its listing through a reverse takeover of Westbury Property Fund, a manoeuvre that left the company with a large number of investors focused on property rather than haulage. “We spent the first year engaging with the investors we inherited,” says Ben Whawell, finance director.“We got the support of the original investors but over the past year we have tried to diversify our investor base.” Among new investors in the company are Fidelity, BlackRock and Rathbones.As a private company Stobart had had no need to liaise with City investors so it started with a clean sheet after the listing, says Mr Whawell. It has continued the quirky, down-to-earth approach that marked its earlier years. Accessing the company’s website prompts a video of its operations accompanied by a thumping musical score. Forty people attended its last investors’ day, attracted in part by the chance to drive one of the company’s articulated lorries.Westbury had fewer than 1,000 investors before the reverse takeover but Stobart now has more than 3,000, including small investors from its 25,000-strong fan club. “Some of them are outside our depot now,” says Mr Whawell, “They are taking pictures of our trucks.”…………………Winner: A sparkling performance as Britvic adds juice to its links with investorsBritvic, the winner in this category, has a colourful and informative website but staying in touch with shareholders still requires old-fashioned footwork and an extensive round of face-to-face meetings with existing and potential investors.Craig Marks, head of investor relations, says he held 314 client meetings last year. This month he spent a week travelling round North America, meeting investors as far apart as Dallas, Denver, New York and Montreal.A long-term contract with PepsiCo helps raise the British company’s profile in the US but brands such as Robinsons and J2O are unfamiliar there. Nor is sharing a common language always a help, as Americans consider a squash to be a vegetable and not a concentrated fruit drink.Britvic has a long history – the name was first applied to its fruit juices in 1949 – but it was not until 2005 that it obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange. Initially investor relations were contracted out but they were brought in-house when Mr Marks became head of treasury three years ago.The company website has recently been improved and the investor relations section receives 6,000 hits a month. “We put a lot of effort and resources into upgrading the website,” says Mr Marks. “It represents a first port of call for investors.“We have a reputation for putting ourselves forward in terms of investor communications. We take a customer service approach so if an investor has a question we make sure we get back to them in 24 hours. We have a good story to tell.”The result has been an increase in “material shareholders” from 80 to 200 over the past two to three years while the total number of investors has doubled to 4,000 over the past year. A rise in the number of shareholders makes for a more liquid market in the shares.The number of analysts following Britvic has risen from seven to 22 over the past two years. “That is a good number given the size of our business,” says Mr Marks. The company is a member of the FTSE 250 – market capitalisation has been above £900m –but it hopes to be approaching the FTSE 100 in a few years.Britvic launched an American Depositary Receipt programme last month, making it easier for US investors to buy its shares. It has also diversified its sources of debt funding by means of a $250m private note placement in December. There are no immediate plans to spend the funds but “this puts our balance sheet in a good place”, says Mr Marks."
576;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-03-03T18:19:32Z;Football goal within Nike’s sight;;Football can become Nike’s biggest money-making sport, overtaking the long-established revenues achieved by basketball and running, the company’s brands president has said.Charlie Denson, in London to launch a range of World Cup shirts made by recycling plastic bottles, said football was in its top three categories, along with basketball and running, and that sales numbers between them were very close.“The assumption is it could definitely be number one. We dominate the basketball category, and our basketball footprint is an aspiration for all the other categories,” said Mr Denson, without giving a timescale.“We will grow faster in our overall business in football, because we don’t own as big a share [of the market]. But basketball as a sport may grow faster than football on a global basis, just because [football] is so omnipresent already.”Nike is sponsoring 10 teams in the World Cup, including Brazil, Portugal and the Netherlands but, as in the 2006 tournament in Germany, it must contend with rival Adidas’ ability to dominate the advertising space ahead of and during the tournament in South Africa this summer as an official Fifa sponsor.In addition, Adidas is sponsoring 12 teams, and providing match balls and kit for match officials. Independent research groups put Adidas as the market share leader in football-related products.It will continue as official sponsor for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.Nike, which in December reported a 4 per cent fall in second-quarter revenues, does not break out sales across sports categories. It purchased UK-based football kit manufacturer Umbro in 2008, and next year begins an eight-year deal with the French Football Federation as the official supplier of the national team, replacing Adidas.“We are in our teenage years as far as the maturity of our brand within the football community,” Mr Denson said.Football is Nike’s number one sport outside the US, and in the middle of the last decade Nike sales internationally overtook US sales. But football was also a big seller in the US.Mr Denson said Nike was comfortable with a strategy of sponsoring World Cup teams rather than the tournament. “[Tournament sponsorships] are very, very large commitments and we’re just not at the point where we’ve engaged in those at that level.”The 13m discarded plastic bottles being used for the recycled World Cup shirts come from landfill sites in Japan and Taiwan, and represents a 30 per cent saving on energy consumption and raw materials.Mr Denson said the new shirts may cost more for Nike to produce, but were financially sustainable because of savings in other parts of the production process. “The consumer won’t be penalised.”
577;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-03-02T12:55:40Z;Sorrell questions rush to social media;;Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the world’s largest marketing and communications group, has questioned advertisers’ rush into social media, citing concerns about Facebook’s handling of personal privacy.Sites such as Facebook, which now has more than 400m users, are trying to attract brand advertising from consumer goods companies who have traditionally held back from online marketing. Pepsi redirected its advertising budget for the Super Bowl online for the first time last month.But Sir Martin warned on Tuesday that social media sites are ”less commercial phenomena, they are more personal phenomena”, more similar to ”writing letters to our mothers” than watching television.”Invading these [social] media with commercial messages might not be the right thing,” Sir Martin told delegates at the Financial Times Digital Media and Broadcasting Conference in central London.This would make Facebook and other social media more of an opportunity for public relations agencies – a smaller part of WPP’s empire – than traditional advertising.Sir Martin said that the combination of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, the ex-Google executive who is the site’s operating chief, was ”professionally and commercially extremely strong”. But more than once, Facebook has ”screwed up royally” on privacy by trying to introduce intrusive advertising systems such as its aborted Beacon service.”My view is that [privacy] is still a social norm,” Sir Martin said. ”People are still concerned about it and the invasion of it.”Privacy concerns are already attracting regulatory scrutiny in Europe and the US.”As an industry, we can either self-regulate or risk having it regulated for us,” Sir Martin added.Along with many in the advertising industry, Sir Martin has welcomed the investigation of Google’s online advertising system and search rankings by the European Commission, although WPP has not complained to Brussels itself.”Google is a much more dangerous company as a competitor than it was 12 months ago,” he said. ”They are much slimmer. They are more focused on search and more focused on mobile search.”While WPP, whose JWT agency worked on the launch of Microsoft’s Bing search service, would like to see more balance in the search market, Sir Martin added: ”Smaller companies are more likely to sing out about this than bigger companies.”He also urged clients to address the ”disconnect” in the proportion of time consumers spend online and the share of advertising budgets dedicated to the web, blaming executives’ ”conservatism”.WPP, like other agency groups, is relying on growth from digital platforms and faster-growing economies such as China to counterbalance falling revenues from traditional media and developed markets, particularly in western Europe.WPP reports its 2009 full-year results on Friday.
578;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-03-01T23:00:43Z;Aerospace: A longer range;;"There are all sorts of ways to think about a map of the world. Britons of a certain age grew up in classrooms with maps showing much of the globe satisfyingly covered in empire pink. Children of the cold war saw a world divided between red communist nations and the rest. To an executive of Airbus, the European aircraft maker, countries on the map have meanwhile come to look much the same – except for one that has long been disconcertingly different.It is Japan – which, alone among the world’s wealthiest nations, is a Boeing country. Airbus now has 54 per cent of the world’s aircraft orders. In Japan it has less than 5 per cent.Japan’s biggest airline, the recently bankrupted JAL, has never bought a new Airbus jet. The handful it has were inherited in a merger. JAL and All Nippon Airways, the next biggest carrier, have barely 50 Airbus jets between them and more than 340 Boeings. “It’s an unnatural situation,” says Tom Enders, Airbus chief executive. “Japan is one of the largest markets in the world and there is almost no Airbus.”But Mr Enders, a forthright former paratrooper, is trying to tackle that. He headed to Japan last week for the second time this year, as part of a concerted push into one of Boeing’s last bastions.If successful, it could open up a new chapter in the story of one of the world’s greatest commercial rivalries. Some in Airbus hope it could even help reconfigure the global commercial aircraft industry by putting the European group permanently on top.Japan is not merely the world’s second largest economy; it sits in the Asia-Pacific, which both Airbus and Boeing expect to become a bigger market than either the US or Europe over the next 20 years, accounting for about one-third of their deliveries.China has already become the world’s fastest-growing aviation market. Airbus has more than 500 of its jets flying there, about half the number it has in the US. Ending Boeing’s pre-eminence in Japan would give the European group an important boost in the great game to be played out in this dynamic region.As with anything to do with Airbus and Boeing, however, nothing will happen without an intense and gripping struggle. Few other corporate opponents compete as ferociously as the world’s two biggest makers of passenger aircraft. Unlike other global duopolists – Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Microsoft and Apple, Visa and MasterCard – it is not the case that the two are both American. With one of the rivals based in France, a frisson of geopolitics overlays the usual commercial tensions.Moreover, Boeing spent decades thinking of itself as the natural superior in the arrangement. It dominated much of the market from the dawn of the jet age and built the 747 jumbo that became one of the icons of the era. Airbus did not even exist when the jumbo had its first test flight, in February 1969. The European company dates its birth to May of that year, when French and German ministers signed an agreement jointly to build a passenger jet.The move was a conscious effort to end US rule. But few gave the awkwardly conceived European group much chance of beating Boeing, even when it started producing aircraft to rival the trusty output of Boeing’s Seattle assembly plant.One senior executive from a leading aircraft leasing firm remembers taking a flight across the US just after Northwest Airlines bought some Airbuses. “I got chatting to the guy next to me who turned out to be a pilot at Northwest and he said, ‘Those French guys should stick to making wines because they sure as hell can’t make airplanes’.”As it turned out, Airbus had more staying power than Northwest, which was taken over by Delta in 2008. By then, Airbus had been delivering more aircraft than Boeing for five years in a row, a feat it repeated last year. But Boeing has still beaten Airbus in terms of the value of deliveries for seven out of the last 10 years, according to the Virginia-based Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy. And the value of each company’s order backlog – an important indicator of future relative strength – remained almost identical in 2009 at just under $258bn (€191bn, £172bn).But Airbus’s ascent has stung its older rival and driven the contest between the0 two to fresh heights: in 2004 the US filed a case with the World Trade Organisation alleging the EU had illegally subsidised Airbus; the EU promptly filed a case making similar allegations against the US and Boeing. Neither dispute has yet been resolved.The political dimension to the competition has also been felt over the years by various customer airlines. A little more than 10 years ago, Airbus thought it had finally clinched a deal with Israel’s El Al, long a loyal Boeing customer. But when in 1999 it announced it was going to buy some of the European group’s jets, the move did not go down well in Washington. Officials in the administration of Bill Clinton made it clear that Americans and Congress would not understand why El Al was not buying Boeing planes. To this day, El Al only has Boeings.Airbus also benefited from political help over the years, says Doug McVitie, an aerospace analyst who was director of sales intelligence at Airbus in the 1990s. European airlines that resisted exhortations to buy its products, such as British Airways, a Boeing stalwart for many years, were resented at its Toulouse headquarters.“Airbus executives would have their expenses questioned if they flew on BA, they hated each other so much,” says Mr McVitie. “If they couldn’t find another way of flying, the expenses would be paid but it was seriously frowned on.”Airbus did crack BA, but not until 1998. And politics, says Mr McVitie, is a large part of the reason Airbus is “hardly likely” to break into Japan, where Boeing’s strength has been evident ever since the US occupation that followed the second world war.But nearly five decades of almost uninterrupted rule by the Liberal Democratic party ended with last year’s general election, which brought a Democratic party-led government to power. Airbus is hoping this will create opportunities that previously did not exist. As Mr Enders diplomatically puts it: “I think the political environment is changing.”Boeing insists politics is largely irrelevant, at least compared with the commercial relationships it has carefully moulded in Japan. “We’ve been in Japan for more than 50 years and we have a very strong relationship with suppliers as well as customers and partners,” says Charlie Miller, a Boeing vice-president. “We estimate Boeing-related work in Japan supports nearly 13,000 jobs, which is more than 20 per cent of Japan’s total aerospace industry.”Boeing’s latest aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner, underlines the point: Japanese companies are making its wing boxes among other components. ANA is the aircraft’s launch customer.Airbus executives concede that Boeing’s deep web of relationships have made it a formidable presence in Japan. But it claims to have another weapon: its A380 superjumbo, the world’s largest passenger jet.The intense rivalry between Airbus and Boeing has seen each take big bets on aircraft they hope will pull them ahead. In Boeing’s case, it is the 787 Dreamliner, the first passenger jet to be built mostly of carbon fibre composites and the fastest selling jetliner ever built, with 876 orders from 57 customers around the world. For Airbus, it is the A380. Both were hit by delays, but the 787 has just had its first test flight and the A380 has been in service for more than two years.Airbus has long proclaimed the enormous A380 would put it on a whole new footing against Boeing. Finally, the company had a full range of aircraft to sell right across the market, from its 108-seat A318 to a superjumbo capable of carrying more than 800 people, more than Boeing’s 747.Japan, Airbus claims, is a country in need of the A380. Toulouse executives have drawn up charts showing how the A380 has helped Singapore Airlines, the first carrier to fly it, gain market share from JAL and ANA.On one chart, Airbus says SIA’s passenger volumes on the Singapore-Tokyo route rose 8 per cent between May and December 2008 compared with the same period the previous year, which was before the A380 entered service. Volumes on the same route sank 13 per cent for ANA, the chart says, and 19 per cent for JAL.John Leahy, Airbus’s top salesman, insists the “A380 effect” is even more pronounced when it comes to the premium traffic of business and first class passengers that are a significant source of international airlines’ revenue. “Singapore [Airlines] went from Singapore to Narita with the A380 and JAL lost almost all of their premium traffic going down to Singapore, because given a choice, people would take the 380,” he says. “And it takes an A380 to compete with an A380.”Not everyone agrees. Richard Aboulafia at Teal Group thinks Airbus will have a difficult time persuading the Japanese, or many other carriers, to sign up. “The A380 is not a plane people want to buy,” he says, noting more than half the 202 orders Airbus has had for the superjumbo came in the first three years since it started marketing it in 2001. The market clearly prefers the smaller and lighter A350 XWB jet that Airbus is now developing, he says, an aircraft that has attracted more than twice as many orders as the A380.“There’s something completely tone deaf about pitching the A380 in a market such as Japan, where the national flag carrier just went bankrupt because it was unable to cut capacity fast enough,” he adds.As for whether Airbus can permanently replace Boeing as the world’s leading aircraft maker, Mr Aboulafia says it comes down to the 787. “If the 787 works out as planned, or close to it, then Airbus will be lucky to regain 50 per cent of the market – and that would only happen if the A350XWB works out too,” he says. “But if something goes wrong with the 787 in terms of its operating economics and performance, then Airbus would certainly overtake Boeing.”So far, therefore, the jury is out. Mr Enders did not leave Tokyo last week with a bunch of orders for the A380, or for any other aircraft. A lot of people have underestimated his company over the years. But only the brave would count Boeing out just yet."
579;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Kettle sold for a crisp $615m;;Diamond Foods, the US-listed nuts and popcorn producer, has agreed to acquire Kettle Foods, the potato chip maker, from its UK-based private equity owner Lion Capital in a $615m deal.The deal is the latest sign of consolidation in the food industry, illustrated by Kraft’s recent takeover of Cadbury, as companies hunt for growth to cope with stagnating consumer spending in the US and Europe.Diamond, which produces Emerald nuts and Pop Secret microwave popcorn, is seeking to raise $600m of debt to finance the deal, which is being arranged by Bank of America and Barclays Capital.The Nasdaq-listed company saw off competition for Kettle from Pepsi, United Biscuits, Lance Snacks and Hain Celestial.The deal is expected to generate a 4.5-times return on Lion Capital’s initial equity investment when it bought Kettle for $270m in September 2006.Under Lion Capital’s ownership, Kettle has doubled its sales to $300m and increased earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation from $25m to $60m.The more than 50 per cent annual return on its investment in Kettle would be a big boost for Lion Capital’s push to raise €2bn for its next consumer goods buy-out fund.In the past 12 months, when the flow of cash back to investors from most private equity funds has dried up, Lion Capital has returned about €1.6bn to its investors.Last year it sold Russian Alcohol Group, the maker of Green Mark, the biggest-selling vodka brand in Russia, to Central European Distribution Corporation.Lion Capital also sold Orangina Schweppes Group, the maker of soft drinks it owned with buy-out rival Blackstone, to Suntory Holdingsof Japan.
580;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Coke buys bottling;Drinks maker brings North America bottling operations in-house;So red follows blue. Coca-Cola, like PepsiCo last year, is to bring its North America bottling operations in-house. Like its hated competitor, Coke is prepared to alter a long held strategy to fix deep rooted problems. The important thing is not the copycating, but that Coke can contemplate making changes to improve its overall business.These are needed because the system of split ownership – a combination of central recipe holder and marketeer, with a collection of companies bottling the fizzy drinks – provides weak incentives for bottlers to innovate and grow. Recent moves to provide longer term agreements over concentrate pricing have been a step in the right direction.But North America requires special attention due to its maturity (fizzy drink sales are not growing), and because Coke developed its soft drink, juice and fountain businesses separately from bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises. So adding CCE’s bottling and distribution should produce cost savings – $350m annually are targeted – and improve returns as part of Coke’s ambitious plan for doubling system revenues by 2020.But CCE gets the better end of the deal. Shareholders will receive $10 in cash, plus a new CCE share in exchange for their old one. Assuming a multiple of 7-8 times earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation for the new business, that suggests a price in the $28 to $32 per share range, versus the $20 it has traded at for the last month.Coke, however, raises North America’s contribution from 23 per cent of total sales to around half, diluting its emerging market exposure. The $12.6bn enterprise value it is effectively paying for the business – by surrendering its $3.4bn stake in CCE, and assuming net debt of $9.2bn – is over 8 times ebitda, more than what Pepsi is paying for its bottlers, where the cost saving opportunity is greater. Improving the system comes at a cost.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
581;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-02-25T01:57:37Z;Obama offers olive branch to big business;;"President Barack Obama on Wednesday extended an olive branch to big business, calling for their co-operation in getting the US economy back on its feet and rejecting criticism that his policies amounted to “socialism”.But the president underlined that he planned to press ahead with his plans to overhaul the healthcare and financial regulatory systems and introduce a cap for carbon emissions, all policies that business has criticised to varying degrees.”Contrary to the claims of some of my critics and some of the editorial pages, I am an ardent believer in the free market,” Mr Obama told about 100 chief executives of companies such as Verizon and Pepsi at a Business Roundtable meeting in Washington.“Government has a vital, if limited, role to play in fostering sustained economic growth,” Mr Obama said. “We need businesses to support these efforts,” he said, adding that it was “not about being anti-business or pro-government; it’s about being pro-growth and pro-jobs”.Mr Obama has been locked in something of a battle with big business, and especially with banks, as the economy – and their profits – recover while job creation lags.He has sought to strike a balance between asking for their help and venting the public anger at companies that had been bailed out by the federal government, such as Bank of America and General Motors.Business, for its part, has viewed many of Mr Obama’s economic policies warily, expressing concern at his calls for more regulation in particular.”We have arrived at a juncture in our politics where reasonable efforts to update our regulations, or make basic investments in our future, are too often greeted with cries of ’government takeover’ or even ’socialism,’” Mr Obama told the CEOs, who sat impassively throughout his 40-minute speech.But the president told the business leaders that he wanted their companies to succeed, because they were vital to keeping Americans employed and America ahead of the world’s other leading economies.”We need an economy where we borrow less and produce more. We need an economy where we generate more jobs here at home and send more products overseas,” he said.”I want your shareholders to do well, I want your workers to do well, I want you to do well. Because I firmly believe that America’s success in large part depends on your success.”The Business Roundtable was guarded in its response, saying in a statement that it was “pleased that [the president] recognises the critical role the private sector will need to play in continued economic growth and job creation”.“We are working together toward the same goals – to build a competitive workforce, to continue economic stabilisation and expansion, to create jobs – and we concur on many of the steps that will get us there,” the group, which said it collectively employs more than 12m workers, said in a statement.The contents of the wide-ranging speech were broadly similar to the points the president made in his State of the Union address last month, but the fact that he was speaking to such an influential association of business leaders was telling.Although Mr Obama concentrated mostly on healthcare reform during his first year in office, the stubbornly high unemployment rate has made job creation his top priority.In addition to visiting factories and talking to economists, Mr Obama has been regularly hosting business leaders at the White House, including the heads of banks both big and small, who he has urged to start lending to companies again.On Tuesday night Mr Obama hosted 17 chief executives for dinner at the White House, including Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Wal-Mart’s Michael Duke.The economy will be the key issue for voters for Mr Obama’s Democratic party during the mid-term Congressional elections to be held in November, where Republicans are hoping to erode the Democratic majorities in both the House and the Senate."
582;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-02-19T16:14:38Z;Lunch with the FT: Shah Rukh Khan;;"Shah Rukh Khan is the “Baadshah” or “king” of Bollywood. The 44-year-old star has ruled India’s film industry for nearly two decades, and Khan’s image is everywhere in India. He is on billboards and on television, advertising products from Pepsi Cola to skin-whitening cream.He also owns an Indian Premier League cricket team, the Kolkata Knight Riders. Shrines are dedicated to him. Fans send him letters written in blood. His ancestral home in Peshawar, now in Pakistan, is a tourist attraction. And after Khan was questioned by US immigration last August because of his Muslim name, some fans burned the American flag.I wait to meet Khan in the coffee shop at the Courthouse Hotel, off Regent Street in central London. A former magistrates’ court, its grey façade and quiet lobby feel too restrained for a Bollywood superstar.I had been warned earlier in the day that the star was feeling unwell and that lunch would be delayed. Eventually, after a three-hour wait, I am ushered up to the star’s suite on an upper floor, where Khan, looking tired, greets me warmly.He is wearing a slim-fitting black suit, a sky-blue shirt with open-necked white collar and shiny black shoes. He plays with his glasses as we talk.We go into the sitting room of Khan’s suite, a wood-floored, wood-panelled room with armchairs grouped around a coffee table and windows overlooking the street below. The hotel has set up a small buffet table, and a waiter puts rice and chicken curry on a plate for Khan, who normally spurns carbs to maintain his six-pack. He has made an exception for this lunch.I ask the waiter for chicken and rice with extra lentils and salad on the side. We eat with our plates in our laps, until Khan breaks off to light a cigarette.The star is in London to promote his new film My Name is Khan (which has gone on to break US and UK box-office records for a Bollywood film, taking nearly £1m in the UK in its first weekend on release).In the film, Khan plays an autistic Muslim man living in the US during the volatile period after 9/11. I remark on the fact that it might seem odd for him to have started naming his films after himself. He leans forward, flicking ash into an ashtray, and fixes me with his trademark charismatic smile. “As it is, people think I’m very arrogant, which I’m not. I was telling Karan [Johar – the film’s director and a great friend of Khan] when we were naming it that people will say now we’re suddenly naming films after me.”I assume they chose the name Khan because it is recognisably Muslim. But he sidesteps further probing, saying only that the name worked for the character. “He [the film’s protagonist] has an issue that most people, even his wife, can’t pronounce his name because Khan should be said from the epiglottis,” he says, demonstrating the sound from the back of his throat.While the movie, an emotionally charged love story, is classic Khan, the subject matter is unusually sensitive. Khan, a Muslim married to a Hindu in predominantly Hindu India, has rarely touched on issues of religious and ethnic tensions in his films. Is this film a sign of a trend in Bollywood towards tackling weightier themes?“I’ve never thought about film being society changing …I’m not being flippant but I do believe the prime objective of any cinema that I do and what I perform is to entertain as many people as possible,” he pauses, leaning over to stub out his cigarette. “But maybe when you reach a level of stardom or universal appeal that perhaps I have …you get a little more ambitious and say maybe I can just throw in a bit more of a point of view and garb it in entertainment.”Over the years Khan has portrayed a wide range of characters, from a slick mafia boss to a drunk lover and a reincarnated actor. He took over from fellow Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan as host of India’s version of the hugely successful quiz show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? But he remains best known for his roles in “masala” films – cheerful song-and-dance confections, filled with romance. “See, I like masala. I enjoy masala. I think it’s very important if you want to reach out to everybody. The country has a lot of real problems and you need someone to take you away for a few hours.”I remark on how Khan’s own life has been anything but a “masala”. Born in 1965, Khan and his older sister grew up in a middle-class family in New Delhi, where he attended St Columba’s, a school run by the Christian Brothers. His father, Meer Taj Mohammad, a former freedom fighter against British rule, was born in 1928 in Peshawar, then in British-ruled India, and ran a struggling transport business. In 1980, when Khan was just 14, Meer died from cancer. Khan’s mother brought the children up on her income as a magistrate and from running a restaurant and trading business. She died in 1991.After university – a degree in economics at Hans Raj College and an unfinished Masters in mass communications – Khan began winning parts in television serials in the late 1980s. I ask him whether he considers himself a serious actor. “I’m a fantastic actor, Joe,” he responds jokingly, putting down his cleared plate on a table before addressing the question more seriously.“There’s no point in me trying to explain the seriousness behind my acting,” he says. “I think artists should not say: ‘I’m very serious about my work’. My job should be that when you see my work, you should feel that this could be you. That is why you become a star – because 95 per cent of the boys and girls who see me think: ‘I can do this, he’s not extraordinarily good-looking.’ Michael Caine said, very beautifully, that: ‘When I perform in a film, I’m not trying to show you how well I act or what I do. I’m trying to show you a mirror, that this is what you guys do.’”Indian film may be popular among the diaspora, but what does Bollywood need to do to appeal to other western audiences? It might help, I suggest, if Bollywood looked beyond the musical in a bid to make it in the western mainsteam cinema.In fact, Khan has coined a term for this removal of song and dance – “uncabaret-ifying” Indian film. It’s a process that is underway, but Khan stresses that music will remain essential in mainstream Bollywood. “If I’m going to see a Jackie Chan film, I have to see kung fu …Hindi cinema’s like that – if it doesn’t have music it’s a little bit disappointing.”He lights another cigarette and one of the public relations people who pop in and out of the room pours him a coffee as I ask him how a superstar manages his home life. He and Gauri have been married since 1991 and have two children, 13-year-old son Aryan and 10-year-old daughter Suhana. He says he has invented an elaborate mental construct to manage stardom. He believes his appeal as a superstar stems from his persona as an “ordinary guy”. But if fame begins to swell the ego of the regular guy, the appeal will vanish. So he decided to think of himself, Shah Rukh Khan, the husband and father, as the employee of Shah Rukh Khan, the multi-million dollar superstar brand.“I think my connectivity to my audience is my being a middle-class guy. My being very simple and straightforward, not being enigmatic, not getting sold on the idea of stardom, is very important to this. But the temptation is there, how do I avoid it? So I thought: ‘You know what? I should think of myself as a servant to this master. I should be an employee and an employee who is doing a bloody good job.’” And what would a good job be? “Keep myself simple and straightforward and work like I did when I started 20 years ago, acting in every film as if it’s my first and maybe my last one.”He continues: “When I’m on stage, I feel like I’m so powerful, nothing can go wrong, I can do anything. One lakh [100,000] people, one lakh cameras follow me everywhere I go. It can make me feel infallible. But that’s not true. I just busted my shoulder, I’ve broken my knee [performing stunts for films], I’ve just failed to explain to my son the last mathematics problem that he had. How am I infallible? So, I’m really a nobody but yes, I’m working for a very important man.”The family live in a large bungalow called Mannat (meaning “wish”) in the wealthy Bandra neighbourhood, near Mumbai’s northern waterfront. Khan tells me that at the weekend he refuses to answer the phone. His secretary, who hovers around the house, tries to interrupt him for business-related decisions when he’s watching television with the children. “I have made some of the biggest business decisions, good or bad, while watching Hannah Montana,” he says.At this point, My Name is Khan’s director, Karan Johar, bursts into the hotel room. Khan introduces us before they begin debating the wisdom of an imminent plan by Khan to launch an underwear range. Johar thinks it unwise at the moment, as Khan had recently caused controversy in Mumbai by suggesting that more Pakistani cricketers should have been included in this year’s season of the glitzy, multi-billion dollar Indian Premier League.His off-the-cuff remarks ignited violent passions among Hindu nationalists, who threatened to destroy cinemas if Khan screened his new film (the film premiere in Mumbai did go ahead, albeit with a heavy police guard). It was a row that united all three of India’s national obsessions – cricket, Bollywood and politics.Johar urges Khan to scrap the press conference to launch the underwear line – or at the very least not to allow any questions mentioning the Pakistan issue. But Khan, sweeping his hand through his dense hair, looks completely unfazed. He says the launch will go ahead and he will address the cricket row there too, if necessary. “What do you think journalists are going to ask me about? My underwear?” he remarks wryly.Johar leaves the room and we return to the subject of Mumbai. The city is a cosmopolitan mix of all Indian ethnic groups, but local politicians have become increasingly hostile to outsiders – including those, like Khan, from other parts of India. Khan refuses to let these prejudices pigeonhole him. “I’m an actor, I’m an Indian. My father fought for the freedom of the country. And I truly believe when I say something about a nation or people that you cannot categorise people.”Warming to the theme, he mentions recent attacks on Indian students in my home city, Melbourne. “Someone has told me very vehemently that there’ve been racial attacks against Indians in Australia. So should I say you’re racist? The world is full of good and bad people, not good Australians or bad Australians, or good Christians and bad Muslims.”We wrap up the lunch. The PR has been hoping to wind up the interview for some time, but Khan has refused, telling the PR that I can have as much time as I want because I have been chasing this interview for a year, and have flown in from Mumbai.The underwear endorsement has reminded me to ask a final question. With his ubiquitous advertising presence in India – it is hard to imagine a Hollywood actor achieving anything like this – does he fear over-exposure? Apparently not.“I have a very clear-cut idea,” Khan says. “My films are not for sale. Films will only be done if I want to do them. For everything else, there’s a price to it.” Because Bollywood stars do not make nearly as much money from films as Hollywood actors do, it is the advertising and endorsements that allow Khan to choose which films he makes.I stand up to say goodbye, and I wonder which man I have had lunch with today – the servant of the superstar or his master? As I leave the warm Bollywood bubble, and the cold of the London winter hits me outside, I think I may have met them both.Joe Leahy is the FT’s Mumbai bureau chief…………………………………………..The Courthouse Hotel

His films are shown on televisions on buses, in cafés and in hotel bedrooms. He’s proof that in many parts of the world Bollywood is very big business – although it’s a minnow compared with Hollywood: Indian films generated revenues of Rs91.3bn ($2bn) in 2008 against Hollywood’s $28bn.According to estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers in Mumbai, Indian movies sold about 3.2bn tickets globally in 2008, against Hollywood’s 7.1bn admissions for the same year.However, admissions to Hollywood films are flat or declining, both domestically and overseas, while Bollywood is expanding. Currently only about 10 per cent of the Indian film industry’s revenue comes from abroad (compared with more than half for Hollywood) so there’s plenty of scope for expansion.In the west, Bollywood is popular among the 20m-strong Indian diaspora, but the Indian film industry wants to widen its reach. The success last year of Oscar-laden Slumdog Millionaire – a British film made with Indian actors in Mumbai, which made $377.4m globally – has encouraged Bollywood to try for a larger audience. It has new distribution deals with Hollywood studios: My Name is Khan is distributed by Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Searchlight, which also handled Slumdog Millionaire.In some markets, such as Germany, Bollywood is already catching on with a wider audience. At the Berlin International Film Festival this month, tickets for My Name is Khan sold out in five seconds. Some tickets were reportedly auctioned on Ebay for €1,000.Shah Rukh Khan attributes his popularity in Germany to the sentimentality of Bollywood films – a quality that has been lost from much cinema fare in the west. “I ask Germans why they like Bollywood,” Khan told me during our lunch. “They say, ‘We like it because you have provided an automatic button for crying for us. We have a button for everything else, for coffee, for escalators, in our cars but our life has become so mechanised that we don’t have a button for crying anymore.’”There’s still a long way to go before Bollywood rivals the US. India’s film industry produces nearly twice as many films as Hollywood but they make a pittance at the box office compared with US blockbusters. A huge 2008 hit, Ghajini, featuring another superstar, Aamir Khan, has made $38.3m worldwide compared $2.4bn for Hollywood’s Avatar, according to www.boxofficemojo.com."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 10,097.18 but the Nasdaq was 0.3 per cent higher at 2,183.53.The Vix index, tracking market volatility via option prices, ticked lower for the fourth successive session, falling 3.7 per cent.“The cross-current winds are coming from abroad,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “There’s a lot of fear out there that the excess money in the markets will be coming out.”Over the week, the S&P 500 recorded a 0.9 per cent gain, breaking its four-week losing streak. The Dow was also up 0.9 per cent and the Nasdaq up 2 per cent.Cal Dive International, a marine contractor to the offshore oil and natural gas industry, weighed on the market after warning its quarterly profit would be lower than previously forecast. The company blamed reduced demand and poor weather in the US Gulf of Mexico, which had hampered activity. The shares fell in early trading but ended unchanged at $7.05.Elsewhere in the sector, Ultra Petroleum initially rose after it beat quarterly estimates and gave an encouraging forecast for this year. But a drop in the oil price sent the shares down 1.6 per cent to $47.75.Shares in 3M fell 1.4 per cent to $79.18 after Bank of America Merrill Lynch reduced its rating on the diversified manufacturer to “underperform” from “neutral”, citing slower growth in the second half.During the week, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein had upgraded the group to “outperform” from “market-perform” and noted the prospect of better margins and the potential for growth in multi-industrial groups.PepsiAmericas, the second-largest Pepsi bottler, fell 0.3 per cent to $29.48 after posting a lower-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter.The group said it had been hit by unfavourable currency moves and the costs of restructuring its Caribbean business.On Thursday, PepsiCo said it had doubled its quarterly profit thanks to rising international sales.The previous day, Coca-Cola had said that strong demand from China, Brazil and India had helped the soft drinks maker to offset declines in North America.Over the week, PepsiCo gained 2.4 per cent to $60.92 and Coca-Cola was up 1.7 per cent at $53.98.In the technology sector, shares in SkillSoft climbed 13 per cent to $11.03 after a consortium of private equity firms agreed to buy the software maker for about $1.1bn.Motorola added 7.5 per cent to $7.15 after the company announced plans to split into two companies: one to sell mobile phones and television set-top boxes and the other to focus on wireless networking.The companies behind the market’s indices were also in focus this week as they reported their quarterly results.Nasdaq and NYSE Euronext both said they were losing market share and had suffered from falling trading volumes.Shares in NYSE rose more than 5 per cent after its results as cost-cutting helped the exchange operator to beat estimates.But Nasdaq’s results prompted a 4 per cent drop in its share price since the group only beat estimates by a narrow margin and it forecast higher operating costs for this year.

For the year, PepsiCo’s net income of $6bn was up 16 per cent from 2008.The company attributed most of its growth for the quarter and year to strong beverage sales internationally, compared with a relatively flat performance in North America. The company’s Frito-Lay snacks division also boosted the company’s overall numbers, with strong sales worldwide. “In 2009, strong execution of PepsiCo’s operational priorities enabled us to deliver healthy revenue and profit growth and generate strong cash flow, despite the macroeconomic challenges across much of the world”, said Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chief executive, in a statement.“Our teams demonstrated their agility in balancing innovation and value, which enabled us to maintain consumer momentum while driving margin expansion. In addition, we continued to invest in R&D, infrastructure and innovation to sustain our long-term growth.”For the year, Frito Lay sales in North America generated a 6 per cent increase in revenue, on a 1 per cent increase in volume.PepsiCo’s North American beverage saw volume and revenue decreases of 6 per cent for the year. Overseas, it was a different story, as PepsiCo International recorded an 11 per cent increase in revenue for the year.
586;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-02-05T18:52:49Z;Lower league advertisers seize on Super Bowl;;The underdogs are favoured to win the 44th Super Bowl this Sunday – in advertising terms, at least.The culmination of the US football season is an annual snapshot of the country’s advertising industry, where groups try to outdo each other with fresh ideas.Half the 100m-strong audience will tune in more to see what brands have come up with in the advertising breaks than to watch the battle between the Indianapolis Colts and the New Orleans Saints.This year, Detroit carmakers, which traditionally featured at the event, are lying low and PepsiCo, which defined Super Bowl celebrity endorsements with commercials featuring Ozzy Osbourne and Britney Spears, will be absent, for the first time in 23 years.Smaller brands have instead seized the chance to capture the buzz guaranteed by an event where the advertisements generate as much Monday morning analysis as the game itself.“A lot of challenger brands have come in,” says Antony Young, chief executive of Optimedia, the media agency.In place of General Motors and Toyota, Kia and Volkswagen are among newcomers hoping to benefit from the uniquely American event.Other lower league advertisers include TruTV – a network formerly known as Court TV – and Focus on the Family, a Christian advocacy organisation known for its anti-abortion stance.According to Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern university’s Kellogg management school, Super Bowl participants increasingly fall into two categories: those pushing big product launches, such as Unilever with a new Dove men’s skincare line, and those repositioning their brands, such as Levi Strauss, which wants to revitalise Dockers.Advertisers have been lured by prices lower than last year’s record $3m per 30 seconds. Then, many bookings were taken before the financial markets collapsed.The 60-plus spots on CBS, at $2.5m-$3m each, sold out faster than in recent years.It is still a big sum compared with the $30m annual marketing budget of Diamond Foods, which is pushing two challenger brands – Emerald Nuts and Pop Secret popcorn – in a single commercial featuring a flamboyant dolphin trainer.According to Michael Mendes, its chief executive, the expense is worthwhile because Super Bowl audiences pay attention to the advertisements, whereas “most of the time you’re an irritating break in their programming”.Diamond Foods signed up for its third Super Bowl as much to reach retailers as consumers.Being part of the event has given it a better story in order to secure prominent in-store displays and win over more distribution partners, Mr Mendes says.Even PepsiCo, which is advertising its Doritos snacks during the game but spending most of its $20m budget on digital marketing, is using interest in Super Bowl advertising to attract attention for its “refresh” campaign, which encourages consumers to nominate ideas that deserve funding online.Coca-Cola has pledged a $500,000 philanthropic donation as part of a campaign with Facebook but is planning two light-hearted commercials in sought-after parts of the game.Hamish McLennan, chief executive of Young & Rubicam Advertising, the WPP-owned agency, says that this year should see a return to the humour for which Super Bowl campaigns are known, with advertisers taking creative risks after last year’s focus on value, optimism and sympathy with consumers’ troubles.“You’ll see a more confident tone because consumers are a little more confident,” he says.“They’ve survived a near-death experience in the financial markets.”Mr Young says: “You can see why challenger brands are jumping into it.“Kia can’t compete with Toyota in marketing terms the rest of the year, Dr Pepper can’t compete with Pepsi the rest of the year and Denny can’t compete with McDonald’s the rest of the year.”This Sunday, at least, they will enjoy a level playing field.
587;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Pepsi push harnesses Facebook potential;;For the first time in 23 years, there will not be an advertisement for Pepsi during Super Bowl next weekend. Instead, PepsiCo, the soft drinks maker, which in previous years has wowed audiences with dazzling spots featuring Cindy Crawford and Britney Spears, is going online.With a major digital campaign that features its own website and a heavy presence on Facebook, PepsiCo is betting that a more interactive approach will resonate with consumers in the always-on age of social networking sites.“We’re living in a new age with consumers,” says Ralph Santana, vice-president of marketing for PepsiCo North America. “They are looking for more of a two-way dialogue, story-telling and word of mouth. Mediums like the digital space are much more conducive towards that.”PepsiCo’s decision highlights a shift among consumer goods advertisers, who have historically invested less than average in online marketing.By giving brands a direct line to customers through fan pages and applications, Facebook says it can foster lasting connections between brands and consumers, something banner and search ads – the dominant forms of online advertising – are hard pressed to do.Now, in spite of some misgivings, brands are starting to listen. A growing crop of companies, including Budweiser and Coca-Cola, are using Facebook as a platform for Super Bowl-specific campaigns. The soccer World Cup this year will also see global brands running prominent campaigns.“Instead of getting 30 seconds to connect with their customers, they’re getting 30 days,” says Mike Murphy, vice-president of global sales at Facebook. “They’re looking at this as a way to create longer-term value, and to help their customers better understand what Pepsi stands for.”Some analysts estimate that Facebook could increase advertising revenues to more than $1bn this year.“The experimentation phase is over. Companies, brands and marketers are feeling more comfortable about [Facebook] as a core part of their strategy,” says Mr Murphy.Many in the agency world agree. Rich Gagnon, chief media officer at DraftFCB, says that Facebook’s appeal lies in its huge scale – with more than 350m members – and its ability to finely target them based on age, demographic or interests.But he adds that the space given over to ads is “fairly limited”. “They are probably leaving ad money on the table,” he says.Agencies say Facebook is much better at working with them than Google was at a similar point in its evolution. But as with other Silicon Valley successes that experienced rapid growth, some advertising executives accuse Facebook of arrogance and inflexibility. “They are not easy to deal with,” says a senior digital executive at a large agency group. “They are too busy and they are focused on growing the business, not monetisation.”Christophe Cauvy, digital director for EMEA at McCann WorldGroup, says social media sites still need to prove they are a serious rival to television. “You really need to be passionate about the brand in question, and there is a limit to that. You can’t have your Facebook cluttered by a hundred brands.”Facebook is working with Nielsen, which measures advertising effectiveness on US television, to prove its worth. Nielsen says advertising recall is “very high” on Facebook and that its ads are “cutting through”.That is essential if Facebook is to avoid becoming a fad, says Tom Bedecarre, chief executive of digital agency AKQA. “Clients can be fickle. If they don’t get an immediate, huge payback they can pull back.”

Britvic’s Irish arm, which accounts for about a fifth of sales, remained its weakest performer with a 10 per cent decline in underlying euro-denominated sales over a broadly similar period.The company said the second quarter would show “a relative slowing of the rate of growth” due to comparisons with a strong period of trading in 2009 and cold weather early this year.It also remained cautious on the outlook for consumer confidence and spending in its current financial year, which runs until October 3.However, it said it was confident of meeting board expectations for full-year financial performance and its shares, which have doubled in value since March 2009, closed up 27.3p at 431.7p.Britvic trades on a price/earnings ratio of 11.7 times calendar 2010 earnings – a discount to the rest of the European beverages sector which trades on about 15 times earnings.

590;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-01-26T16:56:31Z;Obesity: Corporate sector backtracks on fat facts;;When policymakers realised a few years just how fast obesity rates were rising, food companies were caught off guard.Criticised for producing too much junk food, makers of fizzy drinks, chocolate and crisps claimed the obesity epidemic was not their fault. Lack of exercise, not diets, was the problem, food companies said.But early attempts to dodge responsibility backfired as the extent of the obesity problem became clear.The World Health Organisation considers obesity an epidemic. Adult obesity is now more common globally than under-nutrition and is the third-biggest cause of premature death and disability in the affluent world after smoking and high blood pressure, according to the International Association for the Study of Obesity (IASO).Meanwhile, a green paper on public health launched by the UK’s Conservative Party this month said Britain had the highest obesity rates in Europe, with a quarter of adults and a sixth of children now considered obese.Alarmed at how fast obesity rates were rising, governments put pressure on food companies to cut back on fats, salts and sugars.PepsiCo today claims its European business has “dramatically” changed the ingredients that go into its food products, with its Walkers crisp brand containing 70 per cent less saturated fat and up to 55 per cent less salt than it did five years ago.The snacks and soft drinks group says it is introducing a range of dry roasted nuts in the Netherlands with 30 per cent less fat and investing €20m ($28m) in a new European research and development centre to invent healthier snacks.Kraft, the US food group, says it has reformulated or launched more than 5,000 “healthier choices” since 2005, including reducing salt levels in its UK Dairylea cheese range by 30 per cent since 2002.Companies have also voluntarily cut back on the marketing of junk foods to children following government pressure.In the UK, the Conservatives’ green paper is calling for the food industry’s self regulatory marketing code to be extended across all media – including online – and an “an agreed form of robust evaluation”.Food companies are today more willing than they used to be to admit they need to share responsibility for tackling the obesity problem.Mella Frewen, the director general of the Confederation of the Food and Drink Industries of the European Union, says: “There’s no silver bullet … we’re aware we have an important role to play.”Despite concerns the recession would encourage companies to backtrack on commitments to provide healthier foods to save money, companies say they remain committed to removing fats, salts and sugars and developing healthier products – even as some continue to argue their products are not at fault.Kellogg’s claims breakfast cereals – which it says contain less sugar than a slice of buttered toast and jam – reduce weight.“People who eat breakfast cereals, regardless of sugar content, are slimmer than those who don’t,” says Tim Mobsby, president of Kellogg Europe.Many food companies are promoting programmes that encourage healthier lifestyles in schools.Nestlé, Mars and Ferrero have been supporting a French programme called EPODE (Ensemble prévenons l’obésité des enfants or Together let’s prevent childhood obesity) that is being extended from France to Spain, Belgium and Greece.The programme, which involves four European universities as well as the European Commission, claims to be “behaviour-centred” and gets families involved in discussions with dieticians over the food that children are being fed.Still, obesity specialists say the food industry’s efforts at reformulating products and reducing portion sizes are not enough to bring obesity rates down.Neville Rigby, an independent consultant on obesity and health policy, says: “The food industry has failed to make healthier products the mainstream offering …it must do more.”Mr Rigby criticises confectionery and snack foods makers for continuing to promote their products, such as offering three for the price of two, as well as introducing processed foods into emerging markets where people have traditionally had a healthier diet due to the absence of manufactured foods.Tim Lobstein, policy director for the IASO, argues that companies need to make fewer processed foods and switch to products made from fresh fruits, legumes and other vegetables.“There’s a fundamental contraction in the commercial work which is trying to sell us more food while the message should be to eat less,” Mr Lobstein adds.Obesity activists are, however, getting support from unexpected quarters.As makers of bottled water have come under attack for contributing to environmental problems by selling water packaged in plastic, they have fought back by arguing that water is a healthy alternative to soft drinks.Swiss food group Nestlé, which owns bottled water brands such as Perrier and Poland Spring, says: “Our product is probably the healthiest beverage when you consider the growing concern of obesity.”
591;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Alchemist of all garbage;;Tom Szaky has very ambitious goals for TerraCycle, the recycling company he founded just over five years ago. “I want TerraCycle to become a verb, like Google,” he says of the small company, based in an old factory building in the post-industrial wasteland of Trenton, New Jersey. “We hope to wake up one day and become the new version of recycling, where every waste stream has a solution within the TerraCycle system.”The 27-year-old Mr Szaky founded his company with just one waste stream – leftover food from the cafeteria at nearby Princeton University, where he was a student, which was fed to worms and turned into fertiliser and sold in discarded soda bottles.But after a rapid journey that few start-ups can claim to emulate, he is dealing with the waste flow of some of the US’s biggest consumer companies, including Kraft, Mars, PepsiCo, Kimberly-Clark and General Mills, al­though TerraCycle’s turnover was just $12.5m (€8.7m, £7.8m) last year.The recycling logo that Mr Szaky says he designed during an uninspiring lecture at Princeton now appears on an estimated 1.5bn familiar consumer packages in stores across the US, ranging from Capri-Sun juice drinks to M&M sweets. “It will be on 20bn to 30bn packages by the end of 2010, on a global basis,” he says.TerraCycle’s five warehouses across the US receive millions of items of wrapping and packaging, collected by more than 8m people, including schools and charities, who may get 2 or 3 cents per wrapper. Together with other items, such as flawed rolls of packaging material, the waste is ultimately recycled into products such as bins, backpacks and pencil cases.This year, TerraCycle expanded to open offices and recycling warehouses in Canada, Brazil, the UK, France and Germany – yet it has just 55 employees. The waste it collects is turned into more than 100 different products, including injected plastic made from old foil crisp packets, thanks to a recently developed process.After losing $4.5m in 2008, the company is now operating profitably, as it continues to double its turnover every year. This is in spite of tearing up the rule book on expanding a start-up: “Everything we do, you are not supposed to do,” says Mr Szaky. That included signing some early, almost overwhelming, contracts to sell its worm-waste product to Home Depot and Walmart Canada, as well as developing a big range of products, and expanding overseas (see panel).Mr Szaky’s original idea for the worm business grew out of a start-up business plan he entered for a competition at Princeton. But serendipity rather than MBA science seems to have shaped TerraCycle’s business, mixed with on-the-hoof inventiveness, occasional luck and plenty of ambition. “It’s how I like to do business. I am willing to take some risk, to put some capital down and test an idea,” says Mr Szaky. “I don’t want to sit and debate with anyone whether it’s a good or bad idea.”The business has undergone two big shifts. The worm-waste operation was bubbling along in 2007, and TerraCycle had begun paying “collection brig­ades” to send in used soda bottles for the packaging. That led to a deal with Danone’s Stonyfield Yoghurt to collect and reuse yoghurt pots.Then Mr Szaky was approached by Honest Tea, a small ethically focused start-up, which wanted a way to process foil and plastic children’s juice pouches, whose composite nature made them unsuited to regular recycling. Under the deal, Honest Tea’s packages were made into branded backpacks – and into a dress worn by Soyeon Lee, Mr Szaky’s Korean pianist wife, at her Carnegie Hall debut in New York in 2008. This was one example of his ability to win free publicity – which also includes writing a book, Revolution in a Bottle , that includes tales of gunfights between local gangs and fending off venture capitalists.But the far bigger transformation came later that year, after TerraCycle came into possession of piles of recycled juice pouches from Kraft’s Capri-Sun brand that had been collected in a state-run project in British Columbia. Mr Szaky proposed that Capri-Sun join the Honest Tea programme.“Tom found us, as opposed to us finding him” says Jeff Chahley, Kraft’s senior director for sustainability, who describes the decision to launch the scheme with a small start-up as “a calculated risk”.“Capri-Sun signed a million-dollar contract right off the bat, and they basically exploded the programme,” says Mr Szaky.Other Kraft brands followed, as did more consumer companies. But growth brought new challenges in meeting demand for new products, as TerraCycle was trying both to continue product development and oversee the manufacturing. “Kraft wanted more kids’ products, Aveeno [owned by Johnson & Johnson] wanted its brand around more cosmetic products,” he says. But the costs of developing products and handling the manufacture and merchandising to retailers was too much.“We could either completely scale back, and focus on a handful of products, which I really didn’t want to do. Or we come up with another solution,” says Mr Szaky.The solution, launched last year, was licensing, an idea Mr Szaky says occurred to him when he was in California discussing waste recycling with Hollywood studios, in what he calls “a totally random connection”.TerraCycle tested one licensed product, a billboard bag for Yak Pak, a small New York-based bag company. “It was just throwing an idea against a wall to see if it worked, and the moment it worked, we aggressively said: ‘We’re not making products any more, we’re licensing everything.’“The effect was phenomenal. We are now profitable, next year we will be high­ly profitable. The number of products we make exploded . . . and the sales of our products tripled overnight. And the risk disappeared.”But the shift also required an overhaul of TerraCycle’s model. “In 2008 we lost a tremendous amount of money. I went in a direction that many people thought was not a good direction. And the financials tanked, which made it even harder to justify it as the right move. What solved it was the transition to licensing.TerraCycle now has a head of licen­sing, who was formerly at Disney, to supervise a unique product licensing programme in which the licensor also supplies some raw material.Mr Szaky believes he has achieved through trial and error the model that will enable the company to become the “Google of recycling”, establishing itself as the global standard setter.“We’re taking the global expansion very aggressively . . . The gas pedal is pushed as deep as it can to continue growth. The big challenge at this point is managing that growth.”

594;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2010-01-10T17:15:41Z;Danone plans to retain its water brands;;Danone, the owner of the Evian and Volvic bottled water brands, plans to stick with its water business in developed markets amid calls to sell it as sales recover slowly from an environmental backlash.A sharp drop in bottled water sales in developed markets in 2008 and early 2009 led some financial analysts to argue that Danone should sell its bottled water brands – which account for about 18 per cent of total company sales – and focus on yoghurts and baby foods.But Franck Riboud, Danone’s chief executive, is understood to be committed to bottled water in developed markets because it fits with the French group’s strategy of owning products with health benefits.Water will also play an important part in Danone’s strategy of switching from sales growth to volume growth – a strategy other consumer goods companies such as Unilever are also pursuing as it becomes harder to push through price rises to retailers.Danone, along with other big bottled water producers such as Nestlé (owner of the Vittel, Perrier and Poland Spring brands) and PepsiCo (owner of the Acquafina brand), was hit hard by an environmental backlash against water bottled in plastic last year in the US and Europe. Consumers ditched branded bottled water brands for private label brands, soft drinks and tap water.However, companies have responded to consumers’ concerns by using more recycled plastic in their bottles – Nestlé has been trialling a brand in the US called Re-Source made with 25 per cent recycled plastic – leading sales to recover in some markets.After reporting quarterly declines in underlying water sales in late 2008 and the first half of 2009, Danone’s third-quarter underlying water sales rose 4.6 per cent, while volumes jumped 9.8 per cent. Danone is expected to produce underlying water sales growth of about 3 per cent in the fourth quarter.Although emerging markets such as Indonesia, Argentina and Mexico were the main drivers of growth, Danone’s volumes have shown signs of structural recovery in west European markets such as France, Germany and the UK.But in the US, where Evian competes with the Fiji brand in the premium end of the water category, Evian’s sales volumes and sales revenues remain in sharp decline, according to specialist soft drinks newsletter Beverage Digest. Evian’s volumes have dropped by 29 per cent this year, compared with a 10.5 per cent drop for Fiji and a 3 per cent drop for the overall water category.Just over half of Danone’s bottled water sales are in emerging markets.

Their every move will be streamed online, with the audience able to interact with them via video messages and social networking sites such as MySpace and Twitter.The debut of the programme online in early 2010 represents a departure from the way broadcasters have operated for decades. The four US networks – ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC – often cancel expensive series after only one or two episodes because of poor viewing figures.However, If I Can Dream will have time to build an audience on the web. If it suceeds, other producers are likely to follow Mr Fuller on to Hulu – owned by Fox, ABC and NBC.“We’re going to see a lot of experimentation going on where content creators use Hulu to mitigate the risk of the pilot process,” said Jason Kilar, chief executive of Hulu.The site has been growing rapidly since its launch two years ago and had 42m viewers during October.Mr Fuller said he was determined to “push the boundaries of mainstream entertainment”.“The next frontier is the video world of authentic real time interaction,” he added.The deal comes as media companies seek to make more content available online. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox all broadcast replays of their shows on the web but have yet to take the plunge by broadcasting original, prime-time programming online before it appears elsewhere.If I Can Dream has already attracted commercial backing from Ford and Pepsi before it has aired, in the latest sign that TV advertisers are warming to online video.Hulu, which is only available in the US, is in discussions with its broadcasting partners about launching the site in several new countries, including the UK. If I Can Dream will be screened globally via ificandream.com.Mr Fuller shot to fame as the pop music mogul who created the Spice Girls. He also represents David Beckham and master-minded his move from Real Madrid to the Los Angeles Galaxy.
596;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-12-12T01:52:31Z;Unilever and Coke vow to cut emissions;;Unilever and Coca-Cola, two of the world’s biggest companies, have launched a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the $1,000bn global consumer goods industry by changing the behaviour of customers and suppliers.Other multinationals, including PepsiCo, Kimberly Clark and Alcoa, are expected to join the initiative, according to one executive involved. It reflects the pressure on big companies to be seen to act responsibly in the face of climate change.Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, said: “I have brought all my suppliers together for a two-day meeting and told them: ‘This train is leaving the platform’.”Unilever also said it had stopped buying oil from an Indonesian company, PT Smart, amid Greenpeace allegations that its plantations destroyed forests.The consumer goods initiative was launched as businesses urged governments at the Copenhagen conference to provide a clear lead on controlling greenhouse gases to give them the stability they needed for investment.Coca-Cola and Unilever said they were taking a broader view of the environmental effect of their products, looking at the emissions from their suppliers and customers. Unilever estimates that for every tonne of greenhouse gas it emits, 10 are emitted by its suppliers and 30-60 by customers using its products.Unilever decided to stop buying palm oil from PT Smart after it was shown a Greenpeace report making claims against PT Smart’s environmental practices. “They showed us evidence we can’t ignore,” it said.Executives of PT Sinar Mas, PT Smart’s parent company, have regularly denied wrongdoing.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
598;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-11-11T23:08:59Z;Food companies put sustainability on the menu;;Global food companies are coming up with their own solutions to avoid a repetition of last year’s food shortages and record-high prices, in many cases moving ahead of government initiatives.“Last year’s food crisis was a wake-up call,” says Bill Lesher, of Global Harvest Initiative in Washington, a group involving some of the world’s biggest farming companies, such as Archer Daniels Midland, DuPont, John Deere and Monsanto. “Our members want to avoid a repetition.”Food companies were caught off guard in early 2008 when prices of staples such as wheat, milk and cocoa started to rise unexpectedly after almost 20 years of stability. Although the crisis has abated, agricultural commodities prices remain high and beyond companies’ comfort range, say executives.As a result companies including Nestlé, PepsiCo and Unilever are rethinking their strategies. The world’s largest traders of food commodities – Archer Daniel Midlands, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus – have also introduced initiatives.Some companies have begun to spend tens of millions of dollars a year investing in sustainable farming in developing countries to guarantee long-term supplies at low prices. They are building more processing plants and storage facilities to meet booming demand from Asia. More and more companies are also for the first time investing directly in farmland and irrigation projects.In a radical move, some agricultural trading houses have introduced a surcharge on commodities such as coffee and cocoa. They are then using the surcharge revenues to invest in farming operations to help secure long-term supplies.Other food companies and trading houses are taking much smaller steps, launching internal reviews of the long-term sustainability of their supply chains or holding public discussions on the future of food.Food executives agree, nonetheless, that business as usual is not an option.Geoff Lane, a partner in sustainability at PwC, the consultancy, says in the past big companies have been pretty fickle in terms of supply relationships as food was “a buyer’s market”. But today, he adds, “all the indicators are pointing in one direction: food scarcity”.The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation will bring some of the world’s biggest food companies to Milan from Thursday for a private sector forum ahead of next Monday’s World Summit on Food Security.The gathering is the largest ever organised for the private sector by the FAO, signalling a new consensus among food officials on the need to get ideas from the private sector.For all the companies’ initiatives, they are in most cases still fighting in Europe and the US to preserve agricultural subsidies, in spite of the fact many analysts blame these subsidies for exacerbating the food crisis.The FAO estimates that the world will need until 2050 to boost agricultural investment by $83bn (€56bn, £51bn) a year – a 50 per cent increase on the past decade’s average – to feed a growing population. Most of the money will come from the private sector, from small farmers to big agribusinesses.Nestlé is emblematic of the food companies’ new actions. The Swiss-based company is investing more than $100m over the next decade to provide farmers in Ivory Coast and Ghana, which together account for 60 per cent of the world’s cocoa output, with millions of disease-resistant plants to boost supply.Nestlé’s move to tackle the problem of demand outstripping supply in the cocoa industry comes after prices of the commodity shot up to a 30-year high earlier this year and the cocoa market endured its most persistent shortages since the late 1960s.Armajaro Trading, one of the world’s biggest cocoa suppliers, is to charge customers, including Lindt and Ferrero, an extra $30 per tonne for cocoa – equal to about 1 per cent of the price – to invest in cocoa farms and boost supplies.
599;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-11-04T16:29:54Z;Coconut water takes on the world;;"From cosmetics to rope and car seat covers, the diverse uses of coconut and its husk have made the fruit an indispensable commodity in the tropics.But it was only this year, when Madonna was rumoured to be knocking back coconut water on tour, that the world suddenly woke up to the fruit’s investment potential.Marketed as a healthy sports drink, coconut water has found an enthusiastic customer base in the US – and plenty of celebrities willing to endorse it.Technological advances have also made it possible to transport the water large distances without having to add preservatives.Pepsi made the first move in August when it bought Amacoco, Brazil’s largest maker of packaged coconut water drinks. Coca-Cola then bought a minority stake in Zico, the Californian coconut water producer, in September, followed three weeks later by Pepsi Bottling Group’s investment in One Natural Experience, a company set up by a Brazilian entrepreneur in the US.Beverage Marketing, a New York-based research and consulting firm, expects coconut water sales to almost double to $35m this year, while revenue from other drinks such as bottled water continues to fall.Bumping along the dirt track to his coconut farm near Rio de Janeiro, dodging turkeys and roaming dogs, Fábio Lewin says he has received supply enquiries mainly from Portugal, Germany and the US.But his company, Coco Legal, is struggling to meet demand given that it employs only 14 people.“Maybe our website is the problem; it makes us look bigger than we are,” he says, laughing.Brazil’s coconut water producers have been used to living in the shadow of Amacoco, which dominates the sector, but they have now become potential targets of multinational drinks companies.Fábio was in his early 20s in 2002 when he founded Coco Legal. ‘When I told my dad I was dropping out [of university], he almost had a heart attack,’ says Fábio. But his father soon quit his engineer job with the government and joined the company. Production has almost doubled every year since and is expected to exceed 20m litres a month by the end of 2009.One’s chief executive, Rodrigo Veloso, says he is convinced coconut water will become a multi-billion dollar global industry in the next 10 years and some analysts think it could match sales of niche drinks such as cranberry juice, which Ocean Spray estimates at about $2.3bn.“It hits a couple of sweet spots in terms of US consumer trends,” explains John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest in the US. “It’s natural, relatively low in calories and provides hydration.”Others are more sceptical and dismiss international interest in coconut water as a celebrity-inspired fad. Harry Balzer, vice-president of the NPD research group, says: “We love trying new things. But I’ve been down this path before. Lots of ‘healthy’ things have come on the market only to disappear again.”Dr Lilian Cheung, from the Harvard School of Public Health, also questions the medical benefits.The claims that coconut water could lower cancer risks and boost the immune system are “quantum leaps from solid scientific evidence”, she says, as there has been no research.Back in Brazil, where One says sales of coconut water have now exceeded those of orange juice, Fábio is still confident he will have to hire more people from the nearby village, even if Madonna does find something else to keep up her energy levels on the dance floor."
600;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-11-04T16:29:54Z;Irrigation helps the drylands bear fruit;;Petrolina and Juazeiro, formerly remote towns facing each other across the São Francisco river, deep in the dry backlands of north-eastern Brazil, have tripled their combined population in the past 30 years to about 600,000.The reason is fruit, grown for the domestic and international markets on irrigated farms that were previously large, dusty landholdings. Since grapes and mangoes began to be produced and packed here, Petrolina has sprouted high-rise office blocks and boasts an airport.The São Francisco, popularly known as the Velho Chico (Old Frankie), the longest river running entirely within Brazil, used to be where old Mississippi paddle steamers came to die. Once ambitiously dubbed the River of National Integration, it has had a series of hydroelectric dams built on it since the 1950s.The crucial change for Petrolina and Juazeiro came with completion of the Sobradinho dam in 1977, which flooded 4,000 sq km of caatinga scrubland and guaranteed the river’s flow even in the dry season, which usually lasts from April to November.Irrigated farming began with traditional crops such as beans, maize and rice, but there was more profit in grapes and tropical fruit. The range of crops includes guava and passion fruit, melons, water melons and fresh green coconuts.Two-thirds of the 120,000 hectares of irrigated land are taken up by fruit, accounting for an estimated 160,000 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs.There are about 4,000 producers of all sizes, with about 100 large companies, among them France’s Carrefour retail concern and Brazilian groups diversifying from other sectors.Alberto Galvão, manager of Valexport, the São Francisco valley’s fruit and vegetable exporters’ association, says the area has a competitive advantage with 3,000 hours of sun a year, reasonable land, low incidence of disease, and supplies of water channelled through canals, or in some cases taken by authorisation directly from the river.With these climate conditions, it is possible to obtain two harvests a year.“We are able to programme our production period so as to bring produce to the market when our competitors cannot,” says Mr Galvão. Mangoes, for instance, are dispatched to the US between August and November, when supplies from Mexico have finished and exports from Ecuador and Peru have not yet started. Most of the fruit is consumed on the domestic market, but exports bring in more revenue.Only a small portion is processed locally, although there is some production of wine as well as juices and dried fruit. In September, PepsiCo announced a deal to buy Amacoco, the leading Brazilian producer of coconut water in cartons, including a plant in Petrolina.Exports go mostly by container truck and ship for the European Union and US markets, but some are flown direct to Luxembourg. According to Mr Galvão, who is also an official in the economic development secretariat of Pernambuco state, the São Francisco valley accounted for $300m worth of fresh fruit exports last year, about 40 per cent of the total. Although the country ranks as the third biggest world fruit producer after China and India – including oranges and bananas – only a small fraction is exported fresh.The global downtown brought a sharp setback in exports in late 2008, and while Mr Galvão says the sector is recovering, business is not yet back to 2007 levels. The domestic market remained strong, but growers cannot sell all their production in Brazil.At the same time, a controversial project is under way to build two canals totalling 700km, diverting water from the São Francisco to supply 12m people in four states.Producers in Petrolina complain that their zone is being neglected, and fear they will lose competitiveness against new irrigated areas with better transport links.Petrolina’s mayor Julio Lóssio has warned of “a crisis in fruit-growing”, but government officials say the fears are unfounded.
601;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-10-29T15:42:20Z;Soft drinks bottlers;;In its quest for global domination, Coca-Cola achieved a remarkable feat – it created one of the best-known commodities in the world. While there may be slight differences in recipe, a child in Mumbai thirsts after the same sweet fizzy water as the son of a Manhattan millionaire.Yet the pursuit of ever-higher volumes has meant that in developed markets such as the US, soft drinks are ubiquitous and cheap, meaning the same product is served in a similar way in the swankiest bar and the cheapest burger joint. However, results from bottler Coca Cola Enterprises on Wednesday suggest that this approach may be starting to change.The group reported North American volume declines of 10 per cent compared with the year before. Part of that fall was related to the timing of the July 4 weekend holiday and promotions surrounding last year’s Olympic Games. But CCE also concentrated on cutting unprofitable bulk sales and focusing on more lucrative, individual servings for instant consumption. So while sales dropped (as they also did for PepsiAmericas), profits were higher than expected and the company raised its guidance for the full year.The question, though, remains the extent to which CCE can pursue greater profitability. Coke has moved in the right direction by tying the prices at which it sells concentrate to CCE to its bottler’s revenues, instead of volumes. But the acquisition by PepsiCo of two of its North American bottlers throws down a challenge to the red network. Attempting the sort of customer targeting that is routine for brewers and other consumer goods companies requires an incentive for risk-taking. Multi-year agreements on concentrate prices from Coke, and a dedication to profit growth, rather than piling on volumes, would be a logical next step.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
602;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-10-21T03:19:27Z;Coke chief in upbeat outlook;;Muhtar Kent, chief executive officer of Coca-Cola, on Tuesday welcomed what he called signs that a global consumer recovery was under way in emerging markets, as the regions helped Coke to offset falling sales in the US and Europe during its third quarter.Coke, the world’s largest soft drink company, reported a 2 per cent increase in sales volumes in the third quarter against the same period last year, with sales rising by 37 per cent in India, 15 per cent in China, 9 per cent in Mexico and 3 per cent in Brazil.“In emerging markets in general …we see a really pretty significant rebound in [consumer] psyche, spending and so forth,” Mr Kent said.In contrast, volume sales in North America and Japan were down 4 per cent against the same period last year, as consumers continued to cut back. European sales volumes were down 2 per cent.But Mr Kent highlighted single-digit volume sales growth in parts of western Europe, including France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries, which contrasted with the continued slumping demand in Spain, as well as in Russia, Ukraine and eastern and central Europe.“You see different kinds of consumer out there in terms of how they feel about their future, how they feel about their pocket book,” he said.“But I still believe the US is going to have to pull the general consumer sentiment up in the world.”In the US, Coke has responded to customers’ focus on frugality and a growing trend of consumption at home, rather than in restaurants, with new drinks packages, such as a 99-cent bottle containing a 16-ounce single-serving that was introduced this year.The drop in Coke’s North American sales partly reflected the shift of the July 4 Independence Day holiday into the second quarter. In the year to date, its US sales were down 2 per cent on a volume basis against the same period last year.In Europe, it has been shifting more marketing money into store promotions – including loyalty programmes and promotional gifts – as it tries to win sales.Coke reported earnings of $1.9bn, or 81 cents per diluted share, unchanged from the same quarter last year.Net revenues fell 4 per cent to $8.04bn. On a constant currency basis and excluding the impact of the sale of its stake in a bottler in Pakistan, its revenues rose 5 per cent, in line with its long-term targets.

Products carrying the mark include Kellogg’s Coco Pops and Froot Loops sugared breakfast cereals.The FDA warned Smart Choices’ managers this summer that it would be concerned if the green tick symbol “had the effect of encouraging consumers to choose highly processed foods and refined grains instead of fruits, vegetables and whole grains”.Dr Hamburg cited the experience of the UK’s “traffic light” system– showing levels of sodium, saturated fats, sugar and total calories – developed by the food industry according to government standards.The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents leading US food and beverage companies, said it “looked forward” to working on the initiative.“This initiative …can serve as another important step in improving the health and wellness of the American public,” it said.The Center for Science in the Public Interest welcomed the move, saying it hoped it would lead to “one national, mandatory system that will truly help consumers choose healthier diets”.
604;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-10-15T10:26:29Z;Why the European Court should find in favour of brand owners in Google AdWords case;;The Google AdWords service, which has revolutionised the online advertising sector, seemed to get a vote of confidence last month from the European Court of Justice’s advocate general.However, I don’t think the court itself will follow the advocate general’s guidance.Current Google AdWords policy allows any business to bid for a brand name or term that then triggers a sponsored link, or advertisement, to appear in Google search results.Louis Vuitton, Viaticum SA (Bourse des voyages) and the owners of the ”Eurochallenges” brand are suing Google because they object to this policy. Each argues that their trademark rights are infringed when other businesses use their names as triggers for adverts.Brand owners are certainly entitled to have their rights protected and as Google has become the dominant search service, brand rights on Google are incredibly important for consumers and brand owners alike.The dispute was referred to the European Court of Justice last year, causing great uncertainty about this controversial practice which is core to Google’s revenue stream.Google’s AdWords system displays a list of paid-for advertising links on the right-hand side of the “natural” search results generated every time a term is searched for. Advertisers pay to have their ads appear when their chosen search terms are entered.For example, Pepsi could pay to have its advertising links appear high in the right-hand list whenever a user searches for ”Coke” or ”Coca-Cola”.There is a distinction to be made here between a consumer looking for a type of product, a mortgage for example, and being presented with a range of options, and when a consumer searches for a particular brand and is then presented with another.As an advisor to the European Court, the advocate general offers his opinion before the court reaches a decision. His views are typically seen as the forerunner to the full judgment of the court – but it does not always follow his opinion.In this case, the advocate general has advised the court that Google’s behaviour is legal and does not infringe trademark rights.His opinion, and the eventual judgment, have to answer questions that have been put to the court. In this case, the questions were legalistic but, in essence, were: “If I have exclusive rights to a particular trademark, and Google ’sells’ that term in the context of the Google AdWords programme, is that trademark infringement?”The advocate general said “no”.But I believe this is the wrong approach: if followed by the court it could prolong the uncertainty and create further confusion about this controversial method of advertising.My argument is based on analysis of trademark law. The starting point is Article 5(1)(a) of the Trade Marks Directive (Directive 89/104), which states: ”The registered trade mark shall confer on the proprietor exclusive rights therein. The proprietor shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the course of trade:“(a) any sign which is identical with the trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the trade mark is registered…”This is generally recognised as a property right. A registered trademark can be bought, sold, and licensed. It has a value, although value tends to be described as the “brand” value, and it is an exclusive right.The starting point is that only the owner of the registered trademark can use the mark for the goods and services for which it is registered. So it would seem obvious that if Google uses the mark to generate adverts in relation to identical services, it is clearly a trademark infringement.Google and other search engine providers have argued in this and other cases that their use of the trademark was not “use” in a trade mark law sense. To date, that has been the hurdle at which those other cases have fallen.In this case, the advocate general was concerned that the scope of trademark protection was being expanded and there seems to have been a general nervousness about how the internet will develop.But enforcing trademark exclusivity against a trader (Google) which is using and letting other businesses use trademarks without the permission of the trademark owner does not expand the scope of trademark protection at all. It merely presents a great opportunity for the court to re-state established trademark law in the context of a new advertising model.In his finding, the advocate general has added an extra condition for trademark infringement: he said that to be infringing, use must ”affect or is liable to affect the essential function of the trademark – which is to guarantee to consumers the origin of the goods or services – by reason of a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.”Article 5(1)(a), however, carries no such requirement to prove confusion.The eventual decision of the European Court will be of tremendous significance. If Google prevails then it will be open season for counterfeiters, competitors and a new generation of businesses capitalising on this practice.To build a market presence, the easiest way will be to buy a link to the market leader’s brand name and consistently have an advert appearing alongside the “natural” results.It will also mean that search engine optimisation will become ever more important, as brands will need to make sure their name appears at the top of the natural search results if they can’t outbid their competitor through financial muscle.If Google loses, it will force changes to their successful revenue model. But those changes are not unworkable: until May 2008 UK policy had, for many years, allowed brand owners to veto anyone else bidding to use their brand names. Reinstate that policy and the brand owners will be adequately protected.The European Court may or may not follow the advocate general’s opinion. If it does, however, brand owners are likely to return time and time again to re-establish the exclusive rights that the Trade Marks Directive gives them.(Pinsent Masons is acting for Interflora in a dispute with Marks & Spencer over the use of Google AdWords – a case that is on hold pending the full judgment of the European Court of Justice in the French cases.)
605;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-10-14T21:35:38Z;Companies re-examine takeover defences;;Companies across the globe are re-examining their takeover defences in the face of an anticipated surge in unsolicited bids from predators while share prices remain low.Such reviews come at a time when the vulnerability of companies to hostile bids has increased over recent years in response to corporate governance activists who have criticised traditional takeover defences such as poison pills.“The rapid and significant decrease in the share prices for almost all companies from 2007 means that unsolicited bid concerns are greater than they have been in a decade, yet boards have less takeover protections to defend against these,” said Frank Aquila, mergers partner at international law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.Currently, just 18.2 per cent of the S&P 500, or 91 companies, have a shareholder rights plan in place, according to FactSet SharkRepellent, which tracks corporate takeover defences.Even more worrying, out of a total of 207 shareholder rights plans which were due to expire this year, just 34 per cent have so far been renewed.“Boards are reluctant to renew their shareholder rights plans unless the company is in play, since institutional shareholders oppose such provisions. Institutional shareholders want the ability to buy and sell their shares freely and view rights plans as potential impediments,” Mr Aquila added.Poison pills aim to deter a hostile bidder by making the proposed transaction prohibitively expensive.The pill, in the form of a shareholder rights plan, triggers the issuance of new shares or allows investors to sell at a premium.Their popularity as an anti-takeover measure increased in the early 1980s as traditional companies such as TWA, Unocal and USX moved to repel takeover bids from corporate raiders including T Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.However, such mechanisms are not designed to prevent hostile takeovers so much as give the target’s management time to evaluate alternatives and maximise value for shareholders.According to analysis by Citigroup into unsolicited and hostile M&A activity in the US, companies with a shareholder rights plan in place received an average final premium of 38.3 per cent to their share price.This was almost twice the average final premium of 21.5 per cent for companies without shareholder rights plans in place.When PepsiCo made an unsolicited $6bn cash-and-stock bid to acquire Pepsi Bottling and PepsiAmericas earlier this year, Pepsi Bottling quickly adopted a poison pill provision barring PepsiCo from acquiring any more shares. Three months later, PepsiCo reached an agreement to buy the outstanding shares of its two main bottlers for $7.8bn – representing a 24 per cent premium to Pepsi Bottling’s share price from the initial price it offered.Takeover defences for European companies, however, are much less clear-cut than in the US, largely because of the lack of common rules between the region’s countries.Despite the European Union’s efforts, the EU Takeover Directive is not unified and member states still have room for manoeuvre on crucial issues such as poison pills.“All the takeover practices in Europe create a prisoner’s dilemma in the minds of investors since the offers do not stay open for subsequent acceptance after they are declared unconditional,” said Carlo Calabria, head of European M&A at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.“This is contrary to the UK, which is much more democratic and where a hostile bid is effectively a referendum for share-holders.”Schaeffler’s €11.35bn ($16.9bn) hostile bid for rival Continental – one of the most daring Germany has seen – was facilitated by exploiting a legal loophole.The privately owned industrial group was able secretly to gain control of 36 per cent of Continental by using cash-settled equity swaps which did not have to be disclosed.“Relative to the US, Europe can be characterised by re-emerging nationalistic protectionism and less scope for company-specific defence measures, especially of a legal nature,” said Wilhelm Schulz, head of European M&A at Citigroup. “Once a company is under offer, effective defence measures are limited to traditional tools such as the search for a white knight or playing the value card unless shareholders have pre-approved more aggressive action.”The recent rise of hedge funds on share registers has also weakened company takeover defences.Historically, chief executives would spend their time with traditional long-term investors to convince them of the merits of a deal.Now, merger arbitrageurs, who simultaneously purchase stock in a target company and sell stock in its potential acquirer, are dominating share registers.They have become the decisive factor in takeover battles, which can make it harder for companies to control their own destiny when under siege.Takeover defences such as shareholder rights plans can clearly increase the price a target can get from a bidder.But as Mr Aquila points out: “Ultimately the best defence has to be a strong share price.”
606;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-10-14T18:58:35Z;PepsiCo and Anheuser in landmark pact;;An unusual deal between PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch, the US subsidiary of the world’s largest brewer, has highlighted a developing global alliance that could eventually threaten Coca-Cola’s position as the world’s largest beverage company by sales.PepsiCo and Anheuser said late on Tuesday that they had agreed to work together to cut costs by combining their purchasing of items such as office supplies and computers.The companies gave no details of the expected cost savings. But industry analysts say the arrangement reflects the growing strategic relationship between PepsiCo’s soft drinks and snack business and Anheuser-Busch InBev, the global brewer created by InBev in a $52bn takeover.Matthew Webb of Caze-nove Securities said any savings were likely to be “helpful” rather than “material”. The deal “may lead to further suggestions that the two companies may ultimately merge, or at least develop closer links”, he said.Before the InBev takeover last year, PepsiCo had separate relationships with both InBev, whose Ambev subsidiary distributes its soft drinks in Latin America, and Anheuser.A number of local independent US distributors handle PepsiCo’s soft drinks and juices and Anheuser’s Budweiser and Michelob brands. PepsiCo’s bottling system is an important client of Metal Container, a subsidiary of the brewing company that makes and recycles aluminium cans.PepsiCo’s increasingly close relationship with the world’s largest brewer contrasts with Coca-Cola’s strategic view that it should focus only on soft drinks.Carlos Laboy, the drinks analyst at Credit Suisse who expects growing consolidation of soft drinks and beer, says the PepsiCo-ABI procurement deal “should give Coke another reason to pause and ponder the wisdom of distancing the red [Coke] system further from beer”.“Coke’s legacy of objection to beer and soft drink integration is obsolete. It defies the reality of the marketplace, logic and the fact that PepsiCo and ABI keep getting closer together,” he said.Credit Suisse analysts have highlighted the strategic challenge posed to Coke in Mexico, where its main Latin American distribution partner, Femsa, has discussed a sale of its beer business with both SABMiller and Heineken. This creates a potential opportunity for Coke to establish a counterbalancing alliance with SABMiller, the second-largest global brewer.SABMiller has had a joint venture in Australia with Coca-Cola Amatil, one of Coke’s largest global bottlers, since 2006.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chief executive, is familiar with the brewing business, having spent six years as president of Efes Beverages, the Turkish beer and soft drinks group.
607;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-10-09T17:10:49Z;Juice jumps on Florida production fears;;Orange juice prices jumped more than 10 per cent on Friday after the US government said production in Florida would fall sharply this season after the citrus crop was hit by bad weather and diseases.Orange juice is a $10bn industry in the US with prices affecting farmers in Florida, global trading houses and companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.The market for futures, traded on the New York Board of Trade, owned by Atlanta-based ICE, was popularised by the 1983 film Trading Places with Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd.The US Department of Agriculture said Florida’s citrus crop would fall to 136m boxes in 2009/10, down 16 per cent from last season’s 162.4m boxes. Each box weighs 90 pounds.The USDA also lowered its estimate for orange juice yields to 1.63 gallons per box, down 2 per cent from last season’s 1.66.“Weather conditions in Florida’s citrus growing regions during early 2009 were characterised by a series of cold fronts, freezing temperatures, and below average rainfall,” said the USDA in its first report on the 2009-10 crop.Analysts said the spread of so-called “greening” disease, which forces farmers to uproot trees, was also behind the drop in production in Florida.Growers have been spraying in an attempt to reduce the population of the citrus psyllid, the insect that spreads greening.New York’s frozen concentrated orange juice futures for delivery in November rose to $1.0865 a pound, near the highest level in a year.Orange juice prices have rallied 17 per cent this week as some traders anticipated the USDA’s forecast.Orange juice futures for delivery in 2010 are higher than spot prices, suggesting that traders anticipate further price increases.The price rise in frozen concentrated orange juice could mark a turnaround for Florida’s citrus industry – the world’s second-largest behind Brazil’s São Paulo state – following seven successive years of falling US juice retail sales. The declines pushed orange juice prices to a 4½-year low in February.In March 2007, orange juice prices hit a record high of $2.095 a pound after two years of smaller crops owing to hurricane damage. The rally in 2005-07 forced Coca-Cola, which owns the popular Minute Maid orange juice brand, and PepsiCo’s unit Tropicana to raise retail prices. Those increases hit demand just as production was recovering, setting in motion a fall in prices that is only now starting to reverse.Gold prices eased after enjoying a record breaking run this week, helped by the dollar’s trade weighted index sinking to a 14-month low on Thursday.Gold hit a record $1,061.20 a troy ounce on Thursday but retreated to $1,050 on Friday, up 4.8 per cent this week.James Steel, precious metals analyst at HSBC, said the dollar’s latest retreat was having a particularly powerful impact on gold because it was accompanied by questions over the US currency’s long-term sustainability as the world’s principal reserve currency.HSBC said that even though long-term dollar weakness was likely to support gold, the near-relentless rise in bullion prices increased the possibility of a price correction.The net long position (bets on prices rising) held by speculators in gold stands at near record levels and this extended market positioning continues to concern analysts.“A dollar rally, even if only temporary, could provide a reason for gold longs to take profits,” said Mr Steel.In energy markets, the International Energy Agency warned that rising commodity prices, notably oil, could still “easily derail” global economic recovery.The energy watchdog of the developed world upgraded its consumption forecasts for 2009 and 2010 by 200,000b/d and 350,000b/d respectively.Global oil demand is expected to average 84.6m b/d in 2009, down 1.9 per cent on the previous year. In 2010, demand is expected to reach 86.1m b/d, up 1.7 per cent on this year.

Industry insiders said that growers had used aerial and ground spraying in a desperate attempt to reduce the population of the citrus psyllid, the insect that spreads greening.New York’s frozen concentrated orange juice futures for delivery in December rose on Friday to $1.0865 per pound, near the highest level in a year.

The market was popularised by the 1983 film Trading Places, with Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd.As in the movie, the market is now focused on the new crop forecast, with bulls encouraged by the USDA’s forecast of a sharp fall in citrus production. The USDA’s figures are sharply lower than forecast from influential forecaster Elizabeth Steger, of Citrus Consulting International, and leading trading house Louis Dreyfus, which predicted earlier this year a crop of 154m and 141m boxes, respectively.
609;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-10-08T22:58:36Z;PepsiCo expects ‘age of thrift’ to continue;;"Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo, said on Thursday that the soft drinks and snack company expected “the age of thrift that we are seeing in consumers and western Europe” to continue into next year, partially offset by demand from emerging markets.“Consumers in the developed world are adjusting to a changing macroeconomic environment by placing value at the top of their agendas,” she said.Ms Nooyi said value was becoming “an increasingly complex equation”, including the issue of the timing of promotional offers in the US.“When we deliver value is also becoming important; the first part of the month versus the second, on pay-days versus normal days.”She said the company’s research and development effort included a focus on producing lower price products, combined with an increasing effort centred on new products aimed at meeting growing concerns about health and wellbeing.“Clearly one part of the effort has to be on launching lower price options,” she said.Consumers “are placing an increased emphasis on prevention rather than cure”, she said, which created “challenges” but opportunities to meet demand for food and drink “that tastes great, but is good for you”.Ms Nooyi said that in 2010 PepsiCo would be reinvesting revenues in innovation, market expansion, “tuck-in” acquisitions and hiring and training management talent.“We are beginning to see that we can invest more cost effectively now than in perhaps two or three years from now.”Richard Goodman, chief financial officer, said PepsiCo would make “additional strategic broad-based investments” in its business should it perform ahead of its forecasts.PepsiCo said net income in its third quarter rose from $1.58bn to $1.72bn, or $1.09 per share, year-on-year although revenue fell 1.5 per cent to $11.08bn.The company’s snack sales in volume terms rose 2 per cent both in the Americas and internationally.Its soft drinks business reported a 0.5 per cent increase in volume sales, with a 9 per cent increase internationally offset by a 6 per cent fall in the Americas.The company forecast 2010 earnings-per-share growth of 11 to 13 per cent on a constant currency basis, compared with an expected increase of about 8 per cent this year.It said the forecast included a “modest” gain from its planned $7.8bn acquisitions of its two largest bottlers."
610;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-10-08T20:26:22Z;Wall St lifted by earnings and jobs data;;US stocks pushed higher on Thursday after encouraging jobs data and positive results from Alcoa, the country’s biggest aluminium producer, raised investors’ hopes about the pace of economic recovery.The number of Americans filing fresh claims for unemployment benefits dropped to 521,000 from a revised 554,000 in the previous week. Analysts had been expecting initial jobless claims to only drop to 540,000 last week.The S&P 500 closed 0.8 per cent higher at 1,065.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 9,786.87 and the Nasdaq gained 0.6 per cent to 2,123.93.After the market close on Wednesday, Alcoa kicked off the third-quarter earnings season by posting a surprise profit, following three consecutive quarterly losses.The Pennsylvania-based group said cost-cutting and higher aluminium prices had helped lift earnings. The shares gained 1.1 per cent to $14.35.Alcoa also said there were signs that key markets were stabilising and forecast that global aluminium consumption would rise by 11 per cent in the second half of this year. The optimism spread throughout the materials and industrial sectors, helping to lift United States Steel 3.6 per cent to $44.12.“There’s been some concern about this earnings season and whether revenues would come in strong enough,” said Ryan Detrick, a senior strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.But he said the positive results from Alcoa boded well for the next few weeks. “The earnings season tends to pick a direction relatively early and then it does tend to keep going: the market continues to go higher and defy all sceptics.”Positive surprises from retailers’ September sales figures also helped to lift the mood on Wall Street. “Everybody knows all the issues that the consumer has had so it’s a relief to see that the early numbers look good,” Mr Detrick added.Retailers catering to teenagers and children reported the steepest monthly declines but their results also came as the biggest surprise to analysts, who had been predicting even larger losses.American Eagle Outfitters posted flat sales but analysts had predicted a decline of more than 4 per cent. The shares rose 8.9 per cent to $18.14.Macy’s added 5.1 per cent to $19.53 after the department store chain reported a smaller sales decline than had been expected.Gap sales were below estimates but the shares still rose 2.4 per cent to $22.21 after the retailer said margins had improved.However, Saks, the luxury department store chain, said sales at stores open for more than a year were down 11.6 per cent after analysts had predicted a decline of 11.1 per cent. The shares fell 4.5 per cent to $6.20.Elsewhere in the sector, Liz Claibornesoared 30.1 per cent to $6.81 after the company said JC Penny had agreed to sell its clothing and merchandise in its stores.PepsiCo also beat analyst expectations when it posted its third-quarter results. The maker of Pepsi Cola reaffirmed its 2009 outlook. However, in North America, volumes fell 6 per cent as consumers cut back on spending in supermarkets and restaurants.After an early surge, the shares were down 1.3 per cent at $60.39.IBM trailed the market after the US Justice Department announced late on Wednesday that it was investigating allegations that the software company had abused its dominance of the mainframe business. The shares dropped 0.4 per cent to $122.29.Targacept, the pharmaceutical company which specialises in diseases of the nervous system, lost 8.6 per cent to $20.56 after it announced a 2.2m share offering of common stock.Marriott International, the hotel chain, also weighed on the market after reporting a $466m third-quarter loss, mainly on a charge linked to its timeshare segment and restructuring costs.Even though profits were higher than expectations, the shares fell 0.6 per cent to $26.80.The group also warned that pricing pressures would continue to erode margins next year.
611;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-10-06T22:52:30Z;Pizza Hut sales drop as consumers heat at home;;Pizza Hut, one of the largest US pizza restaurant and home delivery chains, has been hit by a sharp slump in orders as competitors tout the lower cost of their frozen, heat-at-home alternatives.Yum Brands, owner of the Pizza Hut brand, said on Tuesday that comparable sales at its more than 6,000 US franchised and company owned locations had dropped 13 per cent during its third quarter, compared with the same period last year.The poor performance at Pizza Hut contributed to a 6 per cent fall in comparable US sales at Yum Brands’ more than 17,000 US locations, which also include KFC, Taco Bell and other brands.Pizza Hut’s comparable US sales started falling in the first quarter of this year, putting pressure on the company’s overall comparable sales after six previous quarters of growth. Its sales were down 8 per cent in the second quarter on an annual basis.Kraft, the largest US food company, has reported strong growth of its DiGiorno frozen pizza since the start of the consumer slump. Walmart, the largest US retailer, has also been promoting its “take and bake” pizza, which it has claimed could save a family that ordered pizza deliveries once a week about $312 a year.The fate of pizza in the recession has contrasted with the stronger performance of McDonald’s, the largest US hamburger chain, whose sales have been supported by its low-cost, value meals.In spite of the US pizza slump, Yum Brands reported third-quarter earnings that were ahead of Wall Street expectations, and raised its full-year earnings per share guidance from $2.10 to $2.14, citing stronger than expected business in China, and a lower tax rate.Yum Brands earnings rose 18 per cent to $334m, or 69 cents per share. Total revenue fell 2 per cent to $2.78bn.●Pepsi Bottling Group, Pepsi-Cola’s largest US bottler, underlined the changing habits of the US consumer as it reported third-quarter results on Tuesday. It said it was continuing to see more strength in supermarket and discount store sales than in restaurants.PBG, which is in the process of being acquired by PepsiCo, its largest shareholder, reported a 10 per cent increase in earnings to $254m, or diluted earnings per share of $1.14, while revenues fell 5 per cent to $3.6bn.
612;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-10-06T22:12:12Z;Coke in US family doctors alliance;;Coca-Cola has formed a venture with the leading US family doctors’ group to promote healthier diets, as it fights back against pressure for a federal tax on sugared drinks.The American Academy of Family Physicians said yesterday that the world’s largest soft drink company would be the first corporate partner in a new “consumer alliance” that would work “to educate consumers about the role their products can play in a healthy, active lifestyle”.Lori Heim, president-elect of the AAFP, said the group would receive an annual payment from Coca-Cola to fund its work under the partnership. She declined to specify how much the AAFP would receive, saying only that it was a “strong six-figure number”.The announcement is part of a raft of measures being taken by Coke amid increasing calls from some health policy makers for a federal tax on sugared drinks, an idea that has received some support from the White House.Both Coke and its rival Pepsi are supporting an anti-food tax coalition led by the American Beverage Association, which is leading the campaign against the idea of a soda-tax.Michael Jacobsen, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which is actively supporting the idea of a federal “soda-tax”, criticised the AAFP move.“Coca-Cola will be able to brag publicly that it is involved in a health education effort with one of America’s most respected medical groups,” he said.Coke is providing AAFP with a grant to develop educational content on soft drinks and sweeteners for the group’s popular familydoctor.org health website. Ms Heim said the group would give Coke “appropriate recognition” in the material produced, but that the AAFP retained editorial control, including over whether or not to use Coca-Cola’s logo.She said the AAFP had approached Coke and other companies over the idea of sponsorship, after previous co-operation on health issues.New York city’s health department is also running advertising on the city’s subway aimed at discouraging consumption of sugared sodas and juices. In San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, the city’s mayor, has said he would shortly propose a tax on retailers that sold sugared soda.Coke said last week it would put calorie-serving counts on the front of soft-drink packaging in the US, following a policy already adopted in Australia, Mexico and Europe.It has also launched advertising in leading US markets highlighting the new labelling step and its plans to introduce smaller 90-calorie cans of Coke next year.Coca-Cola announced a similar partnership in 2003 with the American Academy of Pediatric Dentists, and currently funds research into xylitol, a sugar substitute.

RBS added the pair to its “buy” list based on expectations of a wave of Chinese investment.“As we move towards recovery, the next predators of mining assets may not be the corporates or institutional funds, but rather the sovereign funds,” said the broker.It forecast China would spend between $8bn and $25bn on international mining assets for each of the next five years and predicted a “shotgun approach” of multiple targets and strategies in many regions.RBS also raised earnings expectations across the sector by 45 per cent to reflect Chinese restocking and increased risk appetite among commodity investors.Shares in Antofagasta were up 3.7 per cent to 746½p and Vedanta gained 1.9 per cent to £19.12. RBS also moved from “hold” to “buy” on BHP Billiton, up 2 per cent to £16.59, and Rio Tinto , ahead 2.3 per cent to £25.64.Anglo American was up 4 per cent to £19.51 following talk that Baosteel, China’s state-owned steelmaker, was bidding for a stake in its Minas-Rio Brazilian iron ore project.Baosteel was also linked with Petropavlovsk, the gold miner formerly known as Peter Hambro.The stock rose 3.4 per cent to 887p amid talk of interest from China in its iron ore project in eastern Russia. The site was previously being developed by Aricom, a Peter Hambro spin-off that the group re-acquired earlier this year.The FTSE 100 closed up 0.7 per cent, or 35.63 points, at 5,024.33 after a relatively quiet session, with volumes down about a sixth on the recent daily average.RSA Insurance was among the top performers following an upgrade from Cazenove, which cited an attractive valuation versus overseas peers. A report that RSA had abandoned plans for a rights issue also helped the stock, which closed up 4.3 per cent at 133¼p.Profit-taking followed Aviva ’s confirmation that it would next month sell a minority stake in Delta Lloyd , its Dutch division. The shares were down 0.3 per cent to 451p for their first decline in seven days.Among the lenders, Royal Bank of Scotland added 4.2 per cent to 48½p on talk it may finalise a share issue this week.Vodafone moved 1.3 per cent higher to 140½p amid continued speculation about the telecommunication group’s US joint venture, Verizon Wireless.Bernstein Research argued that Verizon was running out of options to ringfence cash from the venture and needed to offer Vodafone a solution soon, possibly by buying part of its minority stake. “We think it is increasingly likely that this relationship changes in the near, rather than the distant, future, and that this should result in an upwards re-rating of Vodafone shares,” analyst Robin Bienenstock said.SABMiller eased 0.2 per cent to £15.13, having outperformed on Friday in reaction to news that Mexico’s Femsa was prepared to sell its beer division.“Femsa’s beer unit is a mess,” said Credit Suisse, which worried that capturing the division might require an offer for the entire group. Only SAB and Coca-Cola could afford such a deal, it said.Fellow drinks maker Britvic rose 3.3 per cent to 368¼p on continued talk that it might be a target for PepsiCo, its key partner and 5 per cent shareholder.Pepsi’s move this year to buy its two main US bottlers triggered speculation it might also look to consolidate European franchisees, which are highly fragmented. However, analysts have argued Britvic was more likely to act as the consolidator than a target.Chemring led the risers, up 9 per cent to £26.17, on news of a contract to supply decoy flares to the US Department of Defense.Housebuilder Persimmon closed flat at 441p as Morgan Stanley looked to sell 6m shares at between 428p and 435p each.Wellstream, the oilfield pipe maker, fell 1.1 per cent to 650p after takeover hopes faded.FuturaGene was in focus on Monday, rising 4.7 per cent to 50p after Evolution Securities said the plant cell modification specialist could be the “trade of the decade”, write Neil Hume and Bryce Elder.“Wide adoption of FuturaGene’s technology could add billions of dollars to the annual output of the forestry and biofuel industries,” said analyst Philip Sparks, adding that potential profits could dwarf the company’s current market value of £25m.FuturaGene claims its genetic technology can boost crop yields by 25 to 300 per cent, as well as increasing the stress tolerance of plants, allowing them to grow in hostile environments.Bateman Litwin slumped 60 per cent to 3.8p after its 58 per cent shareholder Bateman BV requisitioned a meeting where it will put forward a plan to have the contractor, which designs and builds facilities for the oil and gas industry, delisted from Aim.Gulf Keystone, the oil exploration group focused on Kurdistan, jumped 28 per cent to 105½p on rumours of predatory interest from China. However, some traders were sceptical, noting that China had just bought into the region.Eros International, the Indian movie distributor, added 4 per cent to 196p after announcing plans to list its Indian subsidiary on the Bombay stock exchange. “The move is also aimed to exploit the higher valuations currently being enjoyed in Bombay relative to London. As a consequence, we have raised our target price from 200p to 250p,” said broker Evolution Securities.Supercart, a developer of environmentally friendly plastic shopping trolleys, jumped 36.8 per cent to 19½p on news of contract wins with US retailers including Target.Corin Group, the manufacturer of orthopaedic devices, was marked 17.3 per cent higher at 83½p after being tipped as a recovery play.
614;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-27T22:11:11Z;How to be a top female boss;;"On Saturday, the FT published a list of the top 50 women chief executives in the world and, loving such lists, I settled down over breakfast to study it. First, I admired the double string of pearls worn by the CEO of Avon; the pearly white teeth of the Sara Lee chief and the spookily perfect skin of Yoshiko Shinohara, founder of Tempstaff in Japan – who looks younger than I do but turns out to be 74.Next I read the secrets of their success. The number one woman, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, says you must work hard and have fun. Irene Rosenfeld of Kraft says you must follow your passion. The others talk about the importance of having a mentor, of being yourself, of work-life balance, of teamwork and of being humble.Reading this, I felt I was sinking into a low-slung foam chair from which I couldn’t get out. It wasn’t that there was anything in particular to disagree with. It was that these women, all of whom have achieved exceptional things, mindlessly repeat the caring, sharing views that every modern CEO – male and female – is now required to have.There was only one discordant note. This was sounded by Dong Mingzhu, who runs a Chinese manufacturer of air conditioners and is rated the ninth most important businesswoman in the world. “I never miss,” she says. “I never admit mistakes and I am always correct.”I read this and laughed. It was so bracing, so shocking, so out of line that I thought it a joke. This is the management equivalent of saying one is into incest or has a lot of respect for paedophiles.Yet Sister Dong, as she is sometimes known, has achieved results. Gree Electric Appliances has achieved total shareholder returns in the past three years of 529.5 per cent. Compare this with Avon, say, where Andrea Jung boasts that her biggest inspiration is the 6m strong sales force. Alas, it seems that listening to 6m ideas may have distracted her from the bottom line. Her return over the same period is a poor -10.5 per cent.One might argue that the Sister-Dong-never-wrong school of management is something that only works in China, where the fondness for autocracy is considerable and theory of management is still about making money and hasn’t evolved to include such soppy practices as mentoring or 360-degree feedback.Yet last week I went to see The September Issue, a documentary about life at American Vogue, and can confirm that the Sister-Dong-never-wrong approach can work quite brilliantly in the most highly evolved and most competitive of industries: fashion.Anna Wintour, the magazine’s editor, is Sister Dong’s Manhattan soulmate. In the course of the film, one of her staff comments that working for the magazine is “like belonging to a church”. Does that mean Wintour is the high priestess, she is asked. “No,” she replies. “More like the Pope.”For 90 minutes, we see a not very personable, deeply repressed woman who never praises anyone and hardly ever smiles, getting into or out of chauffeur-driven cars and telling her underlings their work is ugly or boring. Yet for 20 years, this woman has hung on at the top of her business, while most CEOs – male and female – last four or five years before they are spat out or squashed.Alas, Wintour did nothing as vulgar in the film as to reflect on her own success as a dictator. So I’m going to attempt to do it for her and explain how a tyrant can rule in the west.Step one. Have a genius as number two who dares to purse their lips disapprovingly when you get out of line. Wintour’s greatest asset is Grace Coddington, her flame-haired creative director, who has lasted 20 years too.Step two. Make decisions. Most CEOs consult, dither, look over their shoulders, fret about upsetting people and change their minds. Wintour simply decides. And when she’s decided, that’s it.Step three. Command respect. Watching the film makes one realise what an enormous deal respect is and how it is not won by being nicey-nicey. One luckless underling who had been given a frosty bollocking said to the camera: “I am going to kill myself.” But the next time we saw her she was still alive and had redoubled her efforts to do better next time. Praise, it seems, is far less effective as a motivational tool than the desire to please the Pope.Step four. Be right. Like Dong, Wintour thinks she is never wrong. But in Wintour’s case the extraordinary thing is that she almost never is wrong. Partly this is because she is very clever, very experienced, very hard-working and minds more than seems reasonable. But it is also because she has been so right for so long that she is now right by definition. If Anna says fur is in, it’s in. If she says Sienna Miller’s hair is lacklustre, then it’s lacklustre.Pulling off the same feat with air conditioning must be harder. For Sister Dong, and for all the other CEOs who run complicated, global businesses, it is terribly hard to tell if they are actually wrong or not. And in the meantime they have a choice. Either rule by fear – which still works in China and in fashion – or rule by banging on about passion and mentors and hoping that if you are wrong, no one will notice.lucy.kellaway@ft.comRead and post comments at www.ft.com/kellaway"
615;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Areva chief in U-turn on female quotas;;Anne Lauvergeon, chief executive of Areva, has switched course on gender quotas and ruled that a minimum of 20 per cent of women must hold an executive role in the French nuclear engineering company.Ms Lauvergeon, number three in the Financial Times’s new ranking of the Top 50 Women in World Business, had previously described quotas as “humiliating”.In the male-dominated nuclear industry, 35 per cent of Areva’s engineers are already women. But, to move more of them into the executive ranks, Ms Lauvergeon told the Financial Times that she had “defined an internal rule” that women would make up a fifth of “every committee in the company.”The issue of whether to set quotas to advance women in the workforce is highly divisive. Ms Lauvergeon has said in the past that she prefers close monitoring of the balance of recruitment and a policy of promoting the woman if male and female candidates are equally competent.The FT’s top woman in world business for 2009 is Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo. She attributes her success to her many mentors.Andrea Jung, Avon Products’ chief executive and number two in the ranking, said she was wary of government intervention to promote women.The FT ranking was produced in collaboration with Egon Zehnder International, the executive recruitment consultancy and selected by a jury of experts – including Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of Pearson (publisher of the FT). It is based on a combination of tenure, the complexity and geographical scope of the executives’ companies, and their corporate performance. Women not running the top company in any group were excluded.The inaugural global ranking showed a wide geographical spread of female executives, but chief executives of North American companies – and Americans running non-US companies – were more heavily represented than women or companies from other regions.Only one executive from each of France and Germany appears on the list, although the UK and Scandinavia are well represented.Dong Mingzhu, head of Gree Electric Appliances, is the highest ranked Chinese woman, at number nine on the list. Fourteen of the executives head companies from Asia and Australia.
616;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-25T17:37:15Z;Expert advice for those making the climb;;"Nominee
Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo“I would tell the young Indra to work hard because, at the end of the day, success does not come to people who don’t work hard, who don’t pay their dues. I would say: work very hard, focus on the assignment at hand, don’t focus on the next job, focus on the job you’ve got and nail it. Be aware of the politics but don’t play the politics. Most importantly, make sure the people around you know that you are the most trustworthy, reliable and high-integrity person. On the personal side, I would say: while you do all of this, have some fun – and don’t forget that there should also be time to stop and smell the roses”Nominee
Güler Sabanci, Sabanci Holding“First, have mentors. Second, use those mentors to figure out what you want. And third, don’t focus on the rewards and titles – you should be working. To enjoy what you’re doing, you need to focus on what you’re doing. Take what you are doing more seriously than you take yourself”Nominee
Jacob Wallenberg, chairman, Investor“No degree or training can prepare you for the challenges and crises that are inevitably part of the job of running companies. I wish I had known how different it is to have the ultimate responsibility for a company”Nominee
Anne Lauvergeon, Areva“Be yourself, don’t let anyone mould you, don’t force yourself to fit in any system. I believe what we accomplish as individuals is more important than what we achieve through our professional responsibilities. Your job is important, but you have to keep your own private life, your own values, your own friends”Panellist
Sari Baldauf, former executive VP, Nokia“The most efficient way to learn is on the job; don’t hesitate to take on challenges, even risky ones. Build a good team with strong team members – make sure they are better than you, at least in their own areas of expertise”Nominee
Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft Foods“First, follow your passion. Pick something about which you are passionate because you’re going to spend a lot of time doing it. Second, follow the Golden Rule – treat others as you’d have them treat you. It’s essential to being a good leader, and it’s essential to being a good person. Third, make a difference. Whatever you choose to do, the situation needs to be better for your having been there”Panellist
Andrea Jung, Avon Products“As soon as you think you don’t have much more to learn, that’s the beginning of the end. You can’t reinvent a company or turn around a company if you don’t do that to yourself”"
617;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-25T17:37:14Z;FT top 50 women in world business;;"This inaugural ranking comes as the global crisis has turned a spotlight on male domination of the corporate world: would we be better off if more women were in charge? Some prominent people think so. Helen Alexander, first female president of the CBI, the UK employers’ body, says diversity is needed to prevent “groupthink” by white male boards. And 17 leading businessmen, including the chairmen of Anglo American, BP and Tesco, recently called for faster progress in appointing women to senior positions, saying the economy needed the best talent more than ever. They equated the urgency of the issue to that of climate change and poverty.Our report celebrates women business leaders around the world. The fact is that their numbers remain tiny. Just 3 per cent of Fortune 500 chief executives are women. Across Europe, only 10 per cent of board directors of the largest companies are female (quotas have made Norway the exception, with more than 40 per cent) and the numbers are even lower in Asia. This is all the more surprising given the substantial evidence that better gender balance has a positive impact on performance. Studies by Catalyst and McKinsey in the US and Europe have found a correlation between the number of women in a company’s leadership and the company’s profitability. Financial outperformance is most significant when there is a “critical mass” of women – 30 per cent or more. And Nick Wilson of Leeds University Business School has found that having women on the board can reduce a company’s risk of bankruptcy by 20 per cent.Should we expect the handful of female chief executives to lead the charge on gender? Some do preside over deep cultural change. Take Xerox, where one-third of the management team are women and where Anne Mulcahy recently handed over to Ursula Burns, the first black woman to lead a Fortune 500 company. But a small group of women chief executives – or women on boards – cannot be asked to carry all the weight. Change requires willing leadership from the male majority. The financial crisis has, at least, made the business and moral case for change more apparent than ever.What about better governance? The collapse of some of the world’s biggest banks has been blamed partly on directors’ failure to ask tough questions. A study by The Conference Board of Canada found that boards with women directors paid greater attention than all-male boards to audit and risk controls. And a US study showed that boards with more women directors recorded better attendance and were more assiduous at monitoring areas such as CEO performance.Alison Maitland is an FT contributor and co-author of ‘Why Women Mean Business’, published this month in paperback……………………………………………………First among equals1Name: Indra Nooyi

3-year TSR*: -1.5%Indra Nooyi, chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo, puts much of her success down to place: “Where I am has a lot to do with the United States. I think the United States represents the greatest meritocracy in the world.” It’s the US, of course, where PepsiCo started, with the flagship cola brand, before growing into a global leader in the food and drink sector. Its portfolio includes such snack standards as Lay’s (Walkers in the UK) and Doritos, as well as the kitchen staples made by Tropicana and Quaker Oats.Nooyi is credited with putting the fizz into profits at the company, which has seen annual revenue increase during her tenure. But she’s quick to dispel any notion that she did it on her own. “So many people here mentored me … the US is a country that likes to see others succeed. That’s been my experience in the last 30 years.”Nooyi was born in southern India and held managerial positions at Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical group, and Mettur Beardsell, a textile company, before heading to the US to earn a master’s degree in private and public management from Yale. The move led to a profound shift in her thinking. “You come from India off the boat, you go to business school and you realise that you come from a fairly sheltered life,” she says. “I learnt everything over again.”On graduating in 1980, she took key marketing and strategy roles at Asea Brown Boveri, Boston Consulting Group and Motorola before joining PepsiCo in 1994. She rose quickly, becoming the chief financial officer in 2001 and chief executive in 2006. En route to the boardroom, Nooyi spearheaded the acquisition of Tropicana and the merger with Quaker Oats.According to Hindu tradition, Indra means “god of war”, and Nooyi has had to battle adversity to lead PepsiCo through the downturn. She says people look for three things at times like this: realism hand-in-hand with optimism, visibility (“CEOs in terms of downturns should never hide”) and a sense that the organisation will take whatever actions are necessary in good time – “as opposed to after you hit a wall”.Along the way, Nooyi has laid off 3,300 employees and offered $6bn to buy PepsiCo’s two biggest bottlers. She is also championing a move to healthier products and is overseeing a push into philanthropy: PepsiCo is working with the British government to develop a programme to bring “highly nutritious snacks to the undernourished”, a project already in early development in Nigeria, Mexico and India.As for life after PepsiCo, she is quick to dismiss reports that she might go into politics. “In the future I would like to give back to the [US, but] I have been very clear in saying I am not in the politics arena at all.” She credits her family as being integral to her success – and she remains integral to their lives. “At the weekends, I’m cooking at home in the kitchen,” she says. “I’m doing everything that normal people do.”*3-year TSR = total shareholder return from June 30 2006 to June 30 2009. 1-year TSR measured from June 30 20082Name: Andrea Jung

3-year TSR: -10.5%“Ding-Dong! Avon calling” rang the advertising slogan of the cosmetics and perfume giant in the 1960s. Fast-forward to 2009 and the brand is running commercials around the Super Bowl and sending forth actress Reese Witherspoon as its “global ambassador”.This is part of chairman and chief executive Andrea Jung’s idea of “self-reinvention”, which she believes is crucial to her future plans for Avon. “I think that whatever made me successful in the last few years may not be enough to make me successful in the next few years,” she says.The downturn has been kind to Avon, where revenues have topped $10bn and sales force recruitment has picked up significantly as people look to supplement their income. But Jung, a Canadian who succeeded Charles R. Perrin in 1999, has not always enjoyed such buoyant times. Four years ago, she steered Avon out of one of its most difficult periods on her watch.She recalls: “2005 was a challenging year for the total company. We really put forth a very aggressive and bold sustainable growth plan that involved some significant cost-cutting and transformational initiatives to be reinvested back into the brand.” Since then, Jung has “incrementally” invested an additional $700m into brand and recruitment advertising and modernising the direct-selling business model. She had taken a similar approach in the late 1990s when Avon’s business in Russia was severely affected by the devaluation of the ruble.Her ability to persevere is a testament, she says, to her upbringing. “Early in my career, I was in a job that wasn’t very interesting and I said to my parents: ‘I don’t love this, I think I might quit.’ And they said: ‘Are you kidding, you can’t quit! You’ve got to start at the bottom and move your way up.’”Jung says her biggest source of inspiration comes from Avon’s six million sales representatives worldwide. “These are businesswomen who really started in many cases with nothing, and some of them have become really admirable entrepreneurs.” Although Avon is billed as the “Company for Women”, its diverse portfolio encompasses male grooming ranges, and a small portion of the sales associates are men.As for women in leadership, Jung, a graduate of Princeton, says the glass ceiling is beginning to “shatter”. But she’s wary of government intervention in this area. Looking to the next generation of executives, she encourages them to be passionate and bold. “I think this is not a time to hunker down and be defensive, I think it’s a time to be offensive if you want to win market share and strengthen your company.”Jung sits on the boards of Apple and GE. On a philanthropic and personal note, Avon supports Breast Cancer Care, which has raised $160m since its inception. Jung’s mother was diagnosed with cancer at a hospital that had received donations from the charity; she is now cancer-free. “That is when you realise, wow, this is not a job,” Jung says. “My decade of life’s work has repaid me 1,000 times over.”3Name: Anne Lauvergeon

3-year TSR: -13%A female executive in an industry dominated by hazard signs, Geiger counters and safety-goggled men has always been an unusual sight. But this has never bothered Anne Lauvergeon, nicknamed “Atomic Anne”. She says she “created” Areva, overseeing the 2001 merger of Cogema and Framatome into a nuclear engineering group in which the French government owns a stake of more than 90 per cent.A physics graduate, Lauvergeon started her career in 1983 at the French steelmaker Usinor before joining the French atomic energy body, the CEA. In 1988, she became deputy director of the General Mining Council, a move that led to her working on international economic issues for President François Mitterrand. A short stint in the financial services industry followed when she became a partner of Lazard Frères in Paris in 1995, before moving on to Alcatel in 1997 to oversee its energy and nuclear interests. Within a couple of years, she had changed portfolios again, after being chosen by the French government to run the nuclear fuel group Cogema.As chief executive of Areva, which reported a turnover of €13.2bn last year, she is responsible for 75,000 staff, spanning five continents. “You cannot drive 75,000 people without a sense of leadership,” she says, adding that her management style is direct and transparent. “For instance, we take all the decisions in an executive committee after presentations, so it means that there is no hidden agenda.”From next year, gender quotas will be introduced. Currently 35 per cent of engineers in Areva are female but this level of representation does not extend to executive ranks. “We have defined an internal rule so it means in 2010 we are going to have a minimum of 20 per cent of every committee in the company with women.”Her agenda for inclusiveness does not stop at gender, however. Lauvergeon wants Areva to become a diverse company on all levels because, by definition, her “customers are diverse”.Lauvergeon says she sees nuclear energy as the “future” and intends to convert the sceptics. “For a long time the nuclear industry has not listened to the critics, to the fears of the opponents,” she says. “I think you have no sustainable development without deep dialogue with the stakeholders.”In 2009, the group researched new commercial opportunities in Britain, South Africa and the US as well as ventures in other countries. Recently, it announced the sale of a 15 per cent stake to strategic partners to help fund investment.Next year, Lauvergeon aims to continue Areva’s 10 per cent annual growth in turnover (after a drop in 2008 net income due to the construction of a nuclear reactor in Finland) as well as to maintain recruitment levels and manage the development of Areva’s portfolio.Despite sometimes wishing for a clone of herself to help cope with the workload, Lauvergeon still finds time to get her six-year-old child ready for school: “I started my morning with my son at 8am,” she says.4Name: Irene Rosenfeld

Age: 56
Company: Kraft Foods
Sector: Food producers
Location: US
3-year TSR: -8.7%When asked to explain her success, Irene Rosenfeld cites her childhood experience as a school basketball captain, when she regularly led her team to victory. The chief executive of Kraft since 2006, she became chairman after Altria Group spun off the food maker in March 2007.In an industry that is prone to fluctuations, Rosenfeld’s marketing acumen has kept her ahead of rivals. Ninety-nine per cent of US homes stock Kraft products, which include such global brands as Oreo, Philadelphia, Dairylea and Toblerone. “Our brands are typically staples of the pantry and favourites of the family,” she says. According to Kraft, during the downturn, consumers are becoming more financially discerning and opting to eat at home, a trend that has helped bolster the company’s revenues, which reached $42bn in 2008.A veteran of the food industry, Rosenfeld has led the expansion of Kraft into emerging markets such as Argentina, Brazil and China. And this month, she made a daring $10.2bn bid for Cadbury. Although the British confectioner snubbed Kraft, Rosenfeld has not ruled out a hostile takeover.When she joined the company in 2006, Rosenfeld says she handed more power to local managers, helping the group’s turnaround. “Prior to that, a lot of the decisions were being made out of HQ, so we missed opportunities to understand local tastes.” Her biggest achievement to date, she says, was mobilising her 98,000 “very talented” employees by giving them a “road map” to follow.Next year she plans to invest in the brand portfolio, keep costs down, recruit and train staff and look for opportunities to expand the company’s “footprint in developing markets”. “Three years ago we set out to create new Kraft foods … despite a very challenging macro environment, I think we are well positioned as we look to the future.”5Name: Güler Sabanci

3-year TSR: 11.6%Güler Sabanci is Turkey’s queen of finance. Her family-owned company, the Sabanci Group, is a conglomerate with interests ranging from banking to food to tyre manufacture.The company was founded by her grandfather, Haci Omer, in the early 1940s, then passed on to Sakip, her uncle. Güler became chief executive in 2004. In the course of its history, the business has transformed itself from a small cotton company to a billion-dollar conglomerate, with operations across Europe, the Middle East and Africa and in north and south America. Consolidated revenue in 2008 was $15.3bn.When faced with challenging situations, Sabanci often relies on “search conferences”, a methodology used in business schools to generate ideas, find flaws in strategies and ways to fix them. “I don’t have all the answers, but together we can have all the answers,” she says.She used this approach when founding the Sabanci University in 1994, calling a search conference of academics and businessmen from around the world. For four days, the 52 delegates discussed the challenges of creating a modern university for the next generation.Sabanci has this advice for aspiring executives: “It is important what you are doing but it is much more important with whom you are doing it.” And she challenges the perception of Turkey as a country that holds back women. “The issue of gender in business, it’s not only in my country, it’s all around the world. If we don’t focus on gender but focus on the results, on the targets, on the projects, on the achievements, we will see it is less of an issue.”6Name: Gail Kelly

3-year TSR: 12.2%A few years ago, Gail Kelly described to a Melbourne newspaper the moment she realised the career for which she’d studied – teaching – was not for her. She had snapped at a young boy over a small matter and afterward “stood there and watched him go and felt so ashamed of myself. I was allowing my unhappiness to affect who I was. I remember sitting at the bus stop that afternoon in Johannesburg thinking, ‘This has got to change, I’m 22 years old, I’m one-year married, how can I be so unhappy?’ But it was quite a seminal moment for me. And I mention it quite a lot to my own people when I try to make a point about how you need to do work that you love.”Kelly left the job and started work as a teller at Nedcor Bank. Her talent for figures was quickly spotted and she was selected to embark upon an accelerated training programme.In 1997, the family moved to Australia, where Kelly progressed through several senior management roles at Commonwealth Bank before being headhunted by St George Bank, where she became managing director. In 2008, she was appointed chief executive of Westpac. Later that year, she announced that Westpac would buy St George, in a deal that created Australia’s largest mortgage lender and its biggest bank by market value.7Name: Annika Falkengren

Between 30 and 40 I did not have any children [she had a daughter in 2005] … People don’t really talk about it in Sweden, but you cannot do it all and you cannot get it all.”She is now focused on steering the bank through the recession. It had to write down the value of its eastern European assets this summer, but is cushioned by a robust tier one capital ratio.8Name: Yoshiko Shinohara

3-year TSR: N/AWhen Yoshiko Shinohara launched Tempstaff in her native Japan in 1973, she wasn’t worried about the possible humiliation of failure: “Most of my female friends were housewives, and they wouldn’t have cared a bit even if I failed in business,” she told BusinessWeek in 2004. The idea of a temporary staffing agency was a novelty in Japan at the time; Shinohara had first learnt of the concept while working in Australia and decided to try her hand at it upon returning home and realising that “without any special qualification, I … would end up by serving tea or just being a clerical assistant. My prospects looked extremely gloomy.”At times, Shinohara has had to deal with ingrained attitudes to women – one businessman compared Tempstaff to the work of an okiya, an agent who dispatches geishas – but she’s taken it in her stride. In October last year, Tempstaff merged with another Japanese group, People Staff, to create Temp Holdings.9Name: Dong Mingzhu

But her methods have met with success: Dong has transformed the state-owned enterprise into a global player; in 2008, turnover reached £3.5bn. She said last month that “this financial crisis is a moment for Gree to reorientate itself. The crisis is helping the world to better understand China and the Chinese people at a time when Chinese products have been viewed as low-price and low-quality.“It is a golden chance for overseas customers to recognise that they can pay less for the best quality machines.”10Name: Ho Ching

As the wife of Singapore’s prime minister, Ho has weathered speculation that the job offer had more to do with family ties than her own qualifications. Still, the company chairman said at the time that she was the best woman for the job, and cited her appetite for risk.Under Ho, who holds a masters degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Temasek has bought stakes in China Construction Bank Corporation and Bank of China. Its ventures into western banks such as Merrill Lynch – in which it became the largest shareholder – and Barclays have yielded losses due to the recession. But this has not deterred Ho, who has said Temasek is open to new opportunities with western financial groups – if, she told the FT, “the opportunity comes and it looks attractive”.Her plans to retire this year had to be put on hold when US businessman Chip Goodyear withdrew his candidacy as her successor.11Name: Patricia Ann Woertz

Not exactly a welcoming question, but then again, the century-old agribusiness was not accustomed to outsiders taking executive roles. A certified accountant by training, the unapologetically ambitious Woertz was hired after retiring from an executive vice-president position at Chevron. Still, she wasn’t offended. “I thought that was an honest question,” she told Fortune magazine later that year.During her tenure, which began in 2006, sales at the group have swelled. Her successes there have borne out her decision to step down from Chevron, partly in pursuit of a CEO post. “I decided to join a board or two so it kind of came up that way,” she told the FT. “I was immediately intrigued.”Woertz told Fortune that it was thanks to her husband, a logistics consultant, that she was able to put so much energy into her career. The couple have three children.12Name: Ofra Strauss

In the subsequent decades, Strauss watched her father develop the Strauss Group into a global entity, including tie-ups with Danone and Unilever.By the time Ofra took over, in 1996, the company was Israel’s second biggest food and beverage group, thanks in part to the purchase of Elite, a coffee and chocolate giant. Looking to strengthen further the group’s portfolio, Strauss has acquired several brands and expanded abroad, while managing to integrate Elite. Sales in 2008 topped NIS6.2bn (£1bn). And its product lines are expanding, with moves into packaged salads and salty snacks.13Name: Antonia Ax:son Johnson

They brought an international dimension, with discussions that took the business out into other countries.”Today, with Johnson at the helm, the company is a global operation in its core industries of coal, steel, shipping, retailing, information technology and real estate.

It was as much a surprise to the corporate world as her return, seven years later, when she was hired by Sara Lee, the food and household-goods manufacturer, as its chief operating officer; she became chairman and chief executive a year after that.Barnes’s stint at home inspired her idea of “returnships”, paid internships at Sara Lee for those looking to return to employment after prolonged periods out of work.Interviewed about women entering the workplace, she said: “Women run this society. They’re running the schools. They’re running the communities. They’re running charities. They’re doing PTAs. They’re doing all kinds of things that keep society going. That should not be undervalued by them or anybody they’re going to interview with.“From a professional side,” she said of her own time out, “I felt like I went to graduate school.”15Name: Angela Ahrendts

Before taking over at Burberry from Rose Marie Bravo in 2006, Ahrendts worked at Donna Karan and Liz Claiborne, reviving the fortunes of the fashion houses through diversification.While at Liz Claiborne, Ahrendts had been told that she could not expect to be a candidate to replace Paul Charron, the then chief executive. She left. As one insider noted at the time, “Liz Claiborne’s loss is Burberry’s gain.”Though demand has slowed in some markets, the 153-year-old Burberry brand this autumn entered the FTSE 100 (following Thomson Reuters’ delisting in London). In 2007, the company courted controversy when it shut its Yorkshire and Wales factories in favour of cheaper production in China, despite protests from the Prince of Wales. Still, this summer Ahrendts told the FT that cost-cutting in the recession would have to be borne by the back end of the business: “We’ve told investors [that we’ll] not aggressively cut anything that’s consumer-facing.”16Name: Nancy McKinstry

And yet she said soon after: “To me, personal wealth doesn’t mean anything more than if it’s sufficient for my daily use – that will be good enough.” The eldest of eight children raised in modest circumstances in north-eastern China, Cheung’s big break came with a move to Hong Kong in 1985. Over the subsequent two decades, she built her waste-paper trading business from a $4,000 investment into a multi-billion-dollar concern. When it listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in 2006, her wealth was estimated at £2bn.In 2007, after a move to Los Angeles, Cheung told CNN’s Talk Asia that her gender hadn’t held her back – or promoted her unduly: “In any business transaction, it’s not sex that makes the difference. It’s actually that you should use your intelligence to win. Whoever has the intelligence will win the game. For the past 20 years, I have been very pleased that I was able to build this success and it was not just because I was a woman.”20Name: Carol Meyrowitz

In the 1980s and 1990s, she shuttled between Cadbury and Coca-Cola, occupying key marketing roles in India, the UK, South Africa and across South America.

618;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-24T02:50:25Z;PureCircle increases sweetener capacity;;PureCircle, the Malaysian sweetener company that has signed deals with PepsiCo and Cargill, has lifted refined production capacity for its rebaudioside-A to 500 tonnes a year as part of a $64m (£39m, €43m) investment. The company more than doubled sales of Reb-A to 266 tonnes for the year to June 30.William Mitchell, chief financial officer, said that sources for the stevia leaf from which Reb-A is extracted had been extended from just one country a year ago to seven countries on three continents.Reb-A was already being widely used for beverages, but he predicted increasing incursions into other sectors, such as dairy and confectionery. In January Merisant, maker of Canderel, launched PureVia, another table top sweetener, in the US.Group revenues rose from $34m to $60m last year, and pre-tax profits from $2.3m to $11.4m. Earnings per share jumped from $1.60 to $8.49.The group ended the year with net debt of $48m compared with net cash of $17m previously. The shares, which were priced at 170p on joining Aim at the end of 2007 and hit a peak of 296½p earlier this month, were down 12p at 269½p by mid-afternoon trading on Wednesday.
619;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-21T18:37:50Z;Stevia sweetener bites into sugar-free market;;Natural sweeteners made from extract of the stevia plant have taken about 10 per cent of the US consumer market for table-top sugar substitutes, only nine months after being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.The rapid growth of products produced by Cargill and Merisant underlines the potential for natural sweeteners in a market that could amount to $700m in five years, according to a report by New York-based analysts at Rabobank.Table-top sweeteners account for only about 10 per cent of the $435m market for sugar substitutes. But Stephen Rannekleiv, co-author of the Rabobank report, said that table-top use was “critical in terms of developing brand recognition, and that drives your consumer acceptance and supports the application elsewhere”.Cargill’s Truvia and Merisant’s PureVia natural sweetener brands are made with rebaudioside-A (Reb-A), an extract of the stevia plant that was approved for public consumption by the US FDA last year.Cargill, the agrobusiness conglomerate, developed Truvia in a joint venture with Coca-Cola, the soft drinks company, but decided to expand beyond its traditional food ingredients business to sell the sweetener directly to ­consumers.PureVia was developed by Merisant with PepsiCo in partnership with Pure­Circle, an AIM-listed processor that is the world’s largest processor of stevia.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have this year launched ­stevia-sweetened versions of their Vitamin Water and SoBe enhanced water drinks, as well as other products. Kraft, the largest US food company, and Hansen, the beverage company, have also launched Truvia-sweetened drink products. Beverage companies have also been combining stevia with sugar in low-calorie products, such as PepsiCo’s Trop 50 orange juice, Coke’s Sprite Green and Kraft’s Nature’s Splash powdered drinksFrance approved the use of Reb-A in food and drink products for a two-year period this month, becoming the first European Union country to do so. Cargill and Merisant said they would begin distribution of their products in the country soon.Zanna McFerson, who heads Truvia at Cargill, said demand for natural sweeteners in the US was being driven by concern over calories and obesity, and the growing demand for natural products.Reb-A is more than twice as expensive as the high fructose corn syrup used in most mainstream sodas, although the price is expected to fall with expanded production.
620;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-15T18:34:23Z;Danone hails HIV trial breakthrough;;Danone, the French food company, on Tuesday claimed a breakthrough in a medical nutrition trial targeting the immune system of HIV patients, in the latest effort by consumer food businesses to diversify into the lucrative niche of health-related products.Danone said that the trial could lead in several years to the development of a nutritional product aimed at improving the immune system of the stomach of people with HIV.Danone’s other potential products include a drink aimed at those with Alzheimer’s disease for which it launched a trial last year.The initiatives reflect a growing desire to target high-margin, quasi-medicinal products without the extensive clinical trials required by regulators from pharmaceuticals companies.However, the European Food Safety Authority is gearing up to publish reviews on whether the evidence justifies the health claims made on hundreds of products.Flemming Morgan, president of Nutricia, the medical nutrition division of Danone, said: “The evidence is now building that medical nutrition may be able to make a difference in the lives of patients not only in HIV but across a broad spectrum of immune-related conditions.”The company’s medical nutrition division, acquired as part of the acquisition of Numico in 2007, accounts for just 6 per cent of group sales. But unlike Danone’s core yoghurt and waters business, it has proved relatively safe from the economic downturn.“It is easily the business within their portfolio with the best long-term potential,” said Warren Ackerman, analyst at Evolution Securities. “We think this unit has the potential to deliver 15 per cent underlying growth with margins in the region of 25-30 per cent.”He said that Danone’s success in this area may encourage PepsiCo to try to acquire the French company again.Although food companies make all kinds of products claiming to have broader health benefits such as lowering cholesterol or easing digestion, few have directly targeted serious medical conditions like HIV. Unilever last year dropped plans to use a slimming extract based on the southern African Hoodia plant in a range of diet drinks.
621;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
622;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-11T19:26:39Z;Woman in the News: Irene Rosenfeld;;"When Irene Rosenfeld goes out on her Rollerblades, the 56-year-old chief executive of Kraft Foods does not hold back. “You don’t want to get in her way,” says one person who has witnessed the in-line skating skills of the woman who this week unveiled a £10.2bn ($17bn, €11.7bn) approach for Cadbury, the British confectioner.Ms Rosenfeld clearly likes to move quickly. When she took over at the helm of Kraft in June 2006, she embarked upon what she described as a “rewiring” of the venerable food company, whose middle-of-the-road brands range from Oreos biscuits to Jell-O desserts and Kraft cheese slices.Within two months, she had removed half the top executive team. After nine, Kraft made a successful $7.2bn bid for the biscuit business of France’s Danone, and then sold off Kraft’s cereal business for $1.7bn. In an interview with Forbes magazine this year, she described patience as her “most challenged virtue”. This week she returned to the theme. “I have been repeatedly asked: ‘Why now?” she said of the approach to Cadbury. “The answer is simple: Why wait?”“She is very decisive,” says James Kilts, a Kraft veteran who left to lead Nabisco and Gillette through successful turnrounds. “What makes her so effective is that she understands all aspects of the business: consumers, customers, competition, the manufacturers and the technology,” he says. “She is not one-dimensional.”Ms Rosenfeld displayed her varied dimensions at a very young age. In speeches on leadership themes, she tells audiences that she is still proud of her first public role as treasurer of her local Brownie patrol in Westbury on New York’s Long Island, where she claims to have been a “diligent” collector of dues.At high school she continued to outperform, becoming president of the student council, delivering strong academic results and playing on “a dozen” sports teams. Her enthusiasm for sport shaped her decision to choose Cornell University, which has strong women’s athletic programmes. She describes her high school sports teacher, Joan Case, as one of her most important influences. (Ms Case went on to become the first female administrator in New York state’s then male-dominated school sports system.) Ms Rosenfeld describes Martina Navratilova, the tennis star, as a “tremendous inspiration”.At Cornell, Ms Rosenfeld completed an undergraduate degree in psychology, followed by a masters in business administration and a PhD in marketing and statistics. After a spell in advertising, she began her food industry career in 1981 at General Foods – later combined with Kraft after both companies were bought by Philip Morris in the 1980s. Her research work at Cornell, on consumer behaviour, shaped her approach to an industry that at the time seemed to focus more on itself than on its customers.“She believes in understanding consumers, she loves consumers, she has tremendous consumer insights,” says Mr Kilts, who met Ms Rosenfeld in the 1980s when he was a product category manager and she was working in her first job in consumer research. After seeing her presentation – which he described as “disciplined, analytical, fact-based” – he had her promoted to his own team “and she rose through the ranks”.In 2000 Ms Rosenfeld, now married and with her own two girls, led the team overseeing Kraft’s integration of its Nabisco purchase. She was also involved in plans by Philip Morris to spin off the food company as an independent entity. Her steady progress hit a speed bump in December 2003, when Roger Deromedi was named as chief executive of Kraft. She subsequently left to head PepsiCo’s FritoLay.But Mr Deromedi faltered and, less than two years later, she was back at Kraft as chief executive, now describing herself “as an insider with an outsider’s perspective”. Her mission was to revitalise the tired brands of a company that she said, with characteristic candour, “had lost its heart and soul” amid waves of cost-cutting that had affected quality. This had even led to a reduction in the cheese content of its famous Macaroni & Cheese packaged dinners – a move quickly reversed.She urged innovation and decentralised decision-making, giving more power to brand general managers and going outside the company for new executive talent to drive its increasingly global business. Five out of the 10 other members of the executive committee now came from outside the company, including Sanjay Khosla, the Indian-born head of its developing markets and global product categories; Mike Clarke, the South African head of Kraft in Europe who joined the company from Coca-Cola this year; and Tony Vernon, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, who took over the core North American business last month.New lines such as Oreo’s Cakesters – a soft cake version of the chocolate and cream cookie – or “live active” versions of Kraft cheese, have helped boost sales, as has increased demand for Kraft’s affordable basics. The company has a new, multi-coloured flower logo, instead of the old red, white and blue badge.In person, Ms Rosenfeld is direct and forthright, a ready listener whose apparent lack of interest in small-talk is offset by a readiness to laugh that is not immediately obvious. Colleagues say that at work she is approachable and accessible, having had the security lock on the main executive suite door removed soon after she arrived.“She will tell you when she is happy with something, and when she is not happy,” says one person who has worked with her. “With Irene it is like she says: what you see is what you get.”Given her evident determination, Ms Rosenfeld is unlikely to be put off by Cadbury’s rejection of Kraft’s initial cash and shares proposal – or by suggestions of a potential culture clash between a US corporate giant and Cadbury’s “British” history and culture. Similar comments came from France after the deal for Danone’s biscuit unit, maker of the LU Petit Ecolier and other “iconic” French biscuits.“If you look at the results of our LU integration, it has been quite seamless,” she said this week. “And that is essentially the playbook we are looking at here.”"
623;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-10T19:51:06Z;Orangina;;"First Cadbury, now Orangina; two consumer companies targeted by buyers with a sweet tooth. Suntory, the Japanese food and beverage maker, has its sights on the fizzy drinks maker, whose portfolio includes the rights to Schweppes in much of Europe. The relatively stable nature of such businesses makes them appealing and relatively safe targets for strategic buyers. For Orangina, the sale may also finally give it a stable home after having spent most of the decade as a brand-on-the-road. Bought by Cadbury from Pernod-Ricard in 2000 for €700m, it was sold to private equity firms Blackstone and Lion Capital for €1.85bn in 2006.For Suntory, acquiring Orangina is the latest stage in its plans to expand outside Japan, and comes after February’s €600m purchase of Australasian beverage maker Frucor. It also provides European distribution channels for its other soft drinks, such as Oolong tea, a big ticket in Japan. Curiously though, Suntory is simultaneously going through its own corporate reorganisation; a merger with larger peer Kirin. When the deal completes by the year end, the combined group will be one of the world’s largest food and beverage companies. With revenues of about Y3,800bn, it will be on a par with the likes of AB InBev, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.Blackstone and Lion Capital will be pleased too. While many other buy-out houses look to public markets for exit opportunities, Orangina’s sale to a strategic buyer spares them the time and expense of a public listing. Estimating returns are difficult, but the two companies bought Orangina at about two times sales. If Orangina now sold to Suntory at the same multiple, they would almost double their money. That is equivalent to a 16 per cent internal rate of return; enviable profits for a battered industry.Suntory Holdings on Thursday confirmed it was in talks to acquire Orangina, the French soft drinks manufacturer, highlighting the privately-held Japanese drinks group’s ambitions to expand abroad. The group is believed to be close to agreeing the deal, likely to be worth at least $3bn, with private equity firm Blackstone and its partner Lion Capital – which acquired Orangina from Cadbury in 2006.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter"
624;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-09T21:44:49Z;Why Twitter is embraced by business;;"BOOK REVIEWTwittervilleHow Businesses Can Thrive in the New Global NeighborhoodsBy Shel IsraelPortfolio, $23.95Each internet fad is followed by a wave of books seeking to explain, analyse and capitalise on the trend of the moment. Self-proclaimed experts churn out guides, surveys and instruction manuals for search, e-commerce and blogs. So it was inevitable that Twitter, the messaging service that has exploded in popularity, would receive similar treatment.Several books with Twitter in the title have already appeared: now comes Twitterville by Shel Israel. As a self-styled social media expert, Israel might look the type to write meandering assessments of the latest web craze. In fact, this is his second book on how Web 2.0 technologies are changing business, and he is a thorough researcher and lucid writer.There is an irony in publishing a book about a service that limits messages to no more than 140 characters. If the supposed value of Twitter is brevity, how can anyone justify a tome on the subject? Yet Twitterville manages to be an engaging read, full of meaningful anecdotes and useful analysis. It makes a convincing case that Twitter’s worth is not just the ability to broadcast short messages, but the ongoing and transformative conversations that these tweets ignite.In three years, Twitter has emerged as one of the most compelling technology companies operating today. Its more than 40m users have made it a public forum for the discussion of politics, business, celebrity gossip and idle chatter.Indeed, it has been successful across so many industries that the company still seems to be deciding what it wants to be. It has yet to roll out moneymaking products and has been slow to innovate in recent months as its small staff works to keep the sometimes fragile site online.The author does not shy away from surveying the widely varying landscape. “Much of the time, Twitter is just about everyday people discussing everyday things. Increasingly, it has become a highly effective tool of business communication,” he writes. “People tweet to raise money for causes; to make government more responsive; to find and distribute news; to build personal or business networks; or just to kill a little time with people you enjoy.”Despite this breadth, Twitter had proved most influential in business. Companies use it to sell products. Dell has generated more than $2m in sales through alerts posted to Twitter, while local food carts lure business by broadcasting their location.Twitter has also proved invaluable to companies who want to pacify riled customers, as Israel illustrates with two contrasting examples. Motrin, the pain reliever, and Pepsi both rolled out ad campaigns that offended their audiences, and talk of both quickly took off on Twitter. Motrin was not monitoring mentions of its brand on the service, but Pepsi had a director of social media, B Bonin Bough, who picked up on the controversy, responded publicly and in a personal manner, and defused the upset caused by the Pepsi Max niche ad.The media focus on Twitter, not to mention its chipper name, has made the phenomenon a bit annoying, and the book is at times no different. The author’s attempt to turn “Twitterville” into a commonly accepted proper noun smacks of pretension. The author discusses the goings-on in Twitterville as if it is an exotic, unexplored society.Twitterville is, however, quickly transforming from a quaint community into an unruly megalopolis. “As it grows it suffers from an ongoing assault of a steadily increasing flock of spammers, scammers, stalkers, phishers and plain old-fashioned flimflam artists,” Israel admits.Besides hucksters and spammers, there is another, more fundamental problem with Twitterville. As millions more join the party each month, the signal-to-noise ratio diminishes. Everybody and every business is setting up an account, even if they have no real plans to tweet.Flimflam aside, Twitter remains, for now, an invaluable resource for anyone using it to find new links, stay in touch with colleagues or communicate with companies. And among the books trying to make sense out of the way Twitter is changing business, politics and culture, Twitterville is the best.There is one way, however, that Twitterville is fundamentally out of synch with the service it seeks to explain: the book costs $23.95; Twitter is free."
625;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-09T19:49:47Z;Cadbury investors press Kraft for higher bid;;Cadbury investors are putting pressure on Kraft to raise its putative offer for the UK confectionery group quickly, even as the value of the possible deal falls.Some shareholders accept the strategic logic for a Kraft takeover of Cadbury, and are ready to sell to the US food group at the right price. They fear that the prospect of a deal might become more uncertain if there is time for a counter-bidder to emerge.Daniel O’Keefe, portfolio manager of international value funds at US group Artisan Partners, one of Cadbury’s biggest shareholders, said: “The longer Kraft dithers, the more chance of [a counter-bid] happening.Mr O’Keefe said he thought the proposed deal was “a fantastic transaction” but the price was too low. “A price with a nine in front of it would get the deal done.”Although investors believe there is only a small chance of a competing offer, with a combined bid from Nestlé/Hershey or a PepsiCo approach seen as possible, they said Kraft should not stall on raising its indicative offer of 745p.Kraft’s shares traded up 1 per cent to $26.73 in morning trading while Cadbury’s were flat at 785p. But the fall in Kraft’s share price on Tuesday as investors digested the news following a public holiday, combined with a weakening dollar, mean the move is now worth £9.8bn compared with £10.2bn on Monday.Another US fund manager, which has held Cadbury stock for several years and currently owns less than 1 per cent, said it would accept a bid of about 900p if it was at least half cash.Analysts at Credit Suisse say a realistic price for Cadbury is 850p to 875p.Cadbury’s investors have accused Kraft of trying to pick it up on the cheap and say it is undervaluing potential synergies as well as the strength of its brand.Cadbury’s biggest shareholder, the UK’s Legal & General, this week made the unusual move of going public to support the company’s rejection of Kraft’s offer.Nick Train, co-founder of fund manager Lindsell Train, a longtime Cadbury shareholder, said: “This is not just another crappy manufacturing company that deserves to be taken out and shot.” He added it was rare to find a company that had the kind of legacy that Cadbury did with its brandsBut Mr O’Keefe said he believed Kraft would be a good steward of Cadbury’s brands. “Any concern over Cadbury’s brands or heritage as part of Kraft is completely misplaced …Kraft is attracted to Cadbury because of those brands.”If Cadbury is bought by Kraft, some of its institutional shareholders may have to sell the Kraft shares they receive because they are not allowed to own US-listed shares.This so-called ”flowback” is not a significant immediate issue, because selling pressure on Kraft’s shares would not come until a deal became legally binding and shareholders of Cadbury received Kraft shares as payment currency.Advisers to both Cadbury and Kraft, however, have evaluated the issue. Even before a deal closed, the likelihood that Kraft’s shares would come under pressure could create an overhang on the stock. If Cadbury agreed to negotiate with Kraft over a deal, it might decide to push for some sort of protection for its shareholders who receive Kraft stock.Around two-thirds of Cadbury’s shareholder register is outside the UK, and UK investors say US investors will determine the outcome of a deal.Additional reporting by Kate Burgess
626;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-09T17:13:50Z;Desert dairy farm is cream of the crop;;Arid, sun-scorched Saudi Arabia may not seem the most suitable environment for a dairy company, but the conservative country’s Almarai is an unusual success story in the Arab world’s largest economy.Almarai was set up by Prince Sultan bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Kabeer in the late 1970s during the first oil boom, when the authorities began a drive to make the desert kingdom self-sufficient in certain crucial foods.While the Saudi government has recently begun scaling back its expensive food autarky programme, Almarai has solidified its position as a leading food company in the Gulf.Amid Saudi Arabia’s vast desert tracts, Almarai extracts 674m litres of milk a year from about 55,000 mottled, black-and-white Holstein cows, which are kept comfortable in the often sweltering Middle East heat by mist coolers.In addition to the dairy farms, Almarai manages a production, packaging and a vast distribution network that delivers food and fresh dairy products – including yoghurt, cheeses, pastries and a range of fruit juices – to 42,000 retailers throughout the six Gulf Arab states.“Saudi Arabia has some disadvantages, but also a lot of advantages, such as low energy and labour costs, and a large domestic population,” says Georges Schorderet, Almarai’s chief financial officer. “This gives us a good base to grow.”Healthy regional demand for dairy products and juices has helped Almarai shrug off the global economic downturn. Consolidated net profits increased to SR287m ($76.6m) in the second quarter, a 22 per cent increase over the same period last year, and a 45 per cent rise from the first quarter. “Sales have held up remarkably well in what has been a challenging year for many operators,” Banc of America Securities-Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a recent research report.Almarai is “a highly-organised and effective integrated food producer that has built up a dominant position in the fast-growing consumer markets of the Gulf”, the bank’s analysts said. The company has averaged a 28 per cent compound annual growth over the past five years, helping it to become the darling of the regional analyst and investment community.“Almarai is a very good, very solid company – one of my favourites in the Gulf,” says Emad Mostaque, a London-based fund manager at Pictet Asset Management. “It’s one of the companies all fund managers own.”Buoyed by its dominant position in the Gulf, and aiming to double turnover and profit by 2013, the company has started to expand into new product areas and markets.While companies and governments across the Gulf are delaying or scaling back projects and investments, Almarai plans to invest SR6bn ($1.6bn) on expansion in the next five years. It also recently formed a joint venture with PepsiCo to produce and sell dairy products and fruit juices across the Middle East, Africa and Asia.Initially, any extra-Gulf expansion will be done through the joint venture, in which Almarai has a 48 per cent stake, says Mr Schorderet. “In the longer term we might go outside the Gulf as well, but we still have some markets to penetrate here, and room to grow.”The company recently bought a 75 per cent stake in Teeba, a Jordanian food and dairy company, which has been transferred to the Pepsi joint venture. It is also in the process of acquiring Beyti, an Egyptian dairy company, for $115m and Hadco, a Saudi poultry and animal feed company, in a deal worth $253m. Two years ago it acquired a bakery, and earlier this year Almarai announced plans to invest SR650m ($173.5m) to launch a baby food division, which it expects to be fully operational by 2011.Almarai’s only immediate challenge is how to manage its growth spurt, according to Mr Schorderet, particularly on the recruitment side. The company plans to increase its work force from 12,000 at the start of the year to 14,000 by the end of 2009, and the “challenge is to find the right people – people who can add something to the company”, says Mr Schorderet.
627;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Cadbury;;As a trophy brand, Cadbury should have many suitors. Look closer and the field narrows. Mars is still in hock after buying Wrigley and the competition hurdles are too high. PepsiCo might fancy adding chocolates to its salty snacks but seems an outside prospect. That leaves Nestlé and Hershey. Most likely, neither could bid alone but they could team up.The Swiss food giant faces becoming a distant third in global confectionery if a Kraft-Cadbury merger creates a challenger to mighty Mars-Wrigley. That alone might stir Nestlé into action. Antitrust concerns would probably prevent it from buying Cadbury’s chocolate business but it could target the fast-growing gum division. It could present that as consistent with its wellness and nutrition focus, touting gum’s “functional” possibilities as a dental product and carrier of drugs. With a put option enabling it to offload to Novartis its remaining 52 per cent stake in its Alcon eyecare subsidiary from January 1, Nestlé could also afford it.Cadbury’s chocolate operation could represent the last big chance for Hershey to escape its reliance on the US market. The drawback is that at half Cadbury’s (bid-inflated) market value, and controlled by a conservative trust, Hershey might struggle to finance a bid even for chocolate alone. Hershey could ease the situation by selling back US rights to the Kit-Kat brand, which it owns, to Nestlé for $1bn-plus. Or it could attempt a nil-premium merger with Cadbury chocolate – though the merits for Cadbury shareholders would be dubious.Such pitfalls make a Nestlé-Hershey approach – and hence a Cadbury bidding war – seem at best a 50/50 possibility. Cadbury’s shareholders might expect Kraft ultimately to stump up as much as £9 a share. For now, valuations being bandied about of £10 or £11 look too sugary by far.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
628;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-09-07T20:34:47Z;Cadbury’s Carr can’t let sentiment trump value;;"Twenty years ago, Roger Carr could have harnessed Patriotism, evident on the streets of Bournville on Monday, attached the flags of History and Philanthropy to its bridle and steered a chariot labelled British Corporate Icon straight through Kraft Foods’ move for Cadbury.Since Nestlé’s bid for Rowntree Mackintosh in 1988 – which mobilised politicians, charities and workers in protests centred on the confectioner’s home town of York – Britain has given itself over completely to globalisation. In Cadbury’s case, this looks a one-way street: it can’t take over ringfenced chocolatiers such as trust-controlled Hershey or the family-owned Ferrero but it is itself wide open to bids. However, it would still be risky and illogical for the suave and experienced Mr Carr to harp on about Cadbury’s Britishness. More than 40 per cent of Cadbury’s stock is owned by US institutions and it has an American chief executive and global ambitions.The Kraft bid could end with Hershey, PepsiCo or even Nestlé itself riding to Cadbury’s rescue. Almost all possible white knights are foreign. Even if the Cadbury chairman would prefer to go it alone, he can’t afford to rule any out.That doesn’t mean Mr Carr should give up Cadbury’s heritage and manufacturing roots cheaply. Kraft has nodded to local sensitivities by suggesting it will reverse Cadbury’s decision to close the Somerdale plant and invest further in Bournville. The assumption must be that it has the axe ready for less productive facilities elsewhere.That is an assumption worth testing, if only because it was Kraft that closed Terry’s factory in York in 2005, shifting Chocolate Orange production abroad – the second most notorious crime against British sweet-manufacture in recent history.So, yes, the remains of George Cadbury will be disinterred and inspected for signs of post-mortem rotation. But in the end, Mr Carr must look at the value of any approach – not yet sufficient – and not let sentiment distract him. Even Rowntree of York gave battle in vain.But for Mr Carr – and for Cadbury’s shareholders – the important lesson is not that Rowntree was eventually forced to concede, but that it did so at more than double the confectioner’s undisturbed share price.Socially useful adviceDrop a multibillion-dollar bid into a quiet market for deals and you’re bound to create a feeding frenzy. Apart from Lazard as lead financial adviser, Kraft will be paying Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, Centerview Partners and no fewer than four law firms. Cadbury has sucked up much of the rest of the available advisory talent, including Goldman Sachs, UBS and Morgan Stanley. Who says the investment banking sector is larger than is socially optimal? It’s clearly not large enough.andrew.hill@ft.comEve, apples and orangesHow many surveys does it take to tell us men earn more than women? The latest, from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, shows an 80 per cent differential in performance-related pay in the finance sector.Women have probably been underpaid since Eve bit into the apple. Little has changed recently. Data from the Office for National Statistics show the gap, as measured by the median hourly pay of full-time staff, widened between 2007 and 2008 – a result, the ONS says, of more women moving into lowly paid full-time jobs. That’s the problem with many such surveys: the comparison is often more apples and oranges than men and women, reflecting the jobs women do as much as the amount they earn. Comparing like jobs with like would provide valuable clarity – but add bureaucracy and foment inter-office bickering. It could even push bonuses up across the board – contrary to what the doctor is now ordering for the City – as workers discover peers are pocketing a bigger share of the spoils.Transparency can promote change but there are no guarantees: plenty of workers are well aware of the extent of gender pay discrepancies but still have to suffer them. The latest recommendations follow the tradition of sounding noble but being sufficiently fluffy to leave a large margin for error. Appointing a board member to set the tone, champion the issues and drive change sounds like a nicety too far in these straitened times; an easier fudge is fingering an existing executive to keep an eye on equality of pay. But it’s asking a lot to change the habits of a lifetime. Just as internet content providers are finding it tough to change the rules mid-game – sorry, we want to charge you after all – so companies are reluctant to pay more for labour they are used to getting at a discount.louise.lucas@ft.com"
629;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;CBS and Pepsi bring video ads to printed page;;"When some readers of Entertainment Weekly open their magazines next month, they will discover characters from US television programmes speaking to them from a wafer-thin video screen built into the page.The marketing experiment – which is being conducted by CBS, the US broadcaster, and Pepsi, the soft drinks maker – recalls the fantasy newspapers of the Harry Potter films and works much like a singing greetings card, with the video starting once a reader turns the appropriate page.The cost of the full-motion video ad was not disclosed, but it will be far more expensive than traditional print ads, according to executives familiar with the technology, developed by a US company called Americhip.The willingness to spend on such a promotion highlights the radical means marketers are employing to reach consumers at a time when a growing number of people are using new technologies such as digital video recorders to avoid ads.“It’s part of the future – a way to engage consumers in new and surprising ways,” said George Schweitzer, president of CBS marketing group. “How do you sample a drink? You give them a taste.”In the Harry Potter films, the “Daily Prophet” newspaper has pictures that move. The ad in Entertainment Weekly will feature characters from several Monday night offerings on CBS, as well as a video promoting a Pepsi diet cola for men.The video, which will play on a screen about the size of those found on mobile telephones, will appear in copies of the Time Warner magazine sent to subscribers in the New York and Los Angeles areas.Entertainment Weekly has a circulation of 1.8m, but it had not been decided how
many copies will contain the video ad.One magazine industry executive with knowledge of the technology estimated that running one video ad in 100,000 copies would cost in the low seven-figure range. That would translate into a cost of several dollars per copy. By contrast, a full-page colour ad in Entertainment Weekly costs about 9 cents a page per copy.The goal of CBS, the US broadcaster, and Pepsi, the soft drink maker, which are paying for the promotion jointly, is that the ads will generate sufficient “buzz” about their products to justify the high costs of the high-tech advertisement.Esquire, a men’s magazine published by Hearst, last year created a cover for its 75th anniversary issue built with an E Ink screen, the same technology used in Amazon.com’s Kindle reader, which generated significant attention in a currently moribund sector."

He complained he felt “angry and humiliated.”US customs authorities dispute the star’s account, saying he was questioned for little more than an hour as part of routine screening, and released after his papers were found to be in order. They also said the loss of his baggage by the airline had also created delays.Timothy Roemer, the new US ambassador to India, issued a statement pledging to investigate what happened and calling Mr Khan “a global icon” and “a very welcome guest in the United States.”The incident has touched a nerve among Indians and American Muslims already resentful at perceived harassment by US security officials, with some likening the affair to the outpouring to the anger among African-Americans over the recent arrest of prominent Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates at his home.Ambika Soni, India’s tourism minister, told television reporters the treatment of Mr Khan had “hurt every Indian” and suggested a tit-for-tat in which US citizens visiting India were also subjected to greater security procedures.“Wow, even Shah Rukh Khan gets the typical Muslim American experience in US airports,” wrote NabiaS on Twitter. Markatique, another Twitterer, wrote, “I don’t know whether to laugh or cry.”Some Indian law enforcement officials, however, expressed appreciation for the power of US security officials, contrasting it to India, where officers are routinely subjected to political interference in carrying out their work, especially where it concerns VIPs.The furore comes soon after a controversy centring on the frisking of APJ Abdul Kalam, India’s former president, at New Delhi’s airport by ground staff of Continental Airlines.
631;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-08-09T14:59:11Z;How a Magellan fund got to be best of its kind;;"In what has been a tough time for the funds industry, some managers have still delivered.One of those is Australian boutique Magellan Asset Management, whose global flagship fund has just been named in a Mercer survey as the best of its kind in the world over the last year.The Magellan Global fund, founded in July 2007 with a modest A$15m (£7.5m, €8.8m, $12.6m) and marketed to retail investors in Australia and New Zealand, returned 8.2 per cent gross during 2008-2009, according to Mercer.The net result, minus fees and other charges, was 7.2 per cent for the year, representing a strong rebound for the fund – now up to more than A$90m – which, like so many others, had a tough 2007-2008.Despite a good last 12 months, A$10,000 invested at inception in July 2007 was worth A$9,123 as of June 30 this year, according to data from research group Morningstar.The global fund is heavily weighted towards consumer sector stocks, such as Nestlé, Danone, McDonalds, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo and service stocks such as eBay and Google. About 70 per cent of the fund is weighted to North American stocks.Morningstar describes the strategy as one of identifying stocks with a “sustainable competitive advantage”.“Magellan then scrutinises companies on four key tenets – a wide economic moat bestowing a sustainable competitive advantage, lucrative reinvestment potential, low agency risk, and low business risk to facilitate predictable cashflows and opportunities in other sectors,” the Morningstar report says.The research house praises Magellan’s “disciplined long-term philosophy” and its “competent high conviction strategy,” although it said it would like to see how the fund performed across “multiple stages of the business cycle”.Magellan co-founder Hamish Douglass, who is managing director and chief executive of the listed asset management house as well as portfolio manager for the global fund, disagrees with Morningstar’s doubts about the durability of his investment strategy across economic cycles.Mr Douglass, a veteran of Deutsche Bank, teamed up with long-time friend Chris Mackay, a former local head of UBS, to form
Magellan.“We want to focus on businesses that genuinely have a long-term sustainable structural competitive advantage in what they do, but importantly they must also earn very attractive economic returns,” says Mr Douglass.“We believe the businesses with long-term competitive advantages will be able to maintain their excess returns on capital for a long period of time.”The result is that about 50 per cent of the fund is invested in global multinational consumer franchises, but ones that “have a very significant proportions of their current earnings coming out of the major emerging markets”.“We believe that economic growth in the coming years is going to be very subdued in the developed economies like the UK, US, Japan, Germany, Australia and Spain, but we are strong believers that there is going to be very strong growth out of the emerging markets,” says Mr Douglass.“This will be driven largely led by urbanisation of those societies over the next 10 to 15 years and we want to, in a very low risk way, invest with businesses that have very entrenched competitive advantages not just in the developed world but also the developing world.”An element of the Magellan strategy that has paid off was the decision, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in late 2008, to sell out of financial stocks entirely, with the result that holdings in three North American banks were sold at historic highs. The fund has subsequently bought back into two of those stocks.Reflecting a view that even though the global economy has not recovered, it has shown signs of stability, Mr Douglass says the fund is now reducing its cash weighting. Over the last year or so the cash component has been as high as 30 per cent, but this was down to 12 per cent at the end of June.“We don’t think we have seen any green shoots at a consumer level,” says Mr Douglass of the current outlook.“What we’ve seen is a restocking but that’s around a stabilisation story but we don’t see an Armageddon scenario any more so we take the view that it’s a great time to be investing.“But we are not anticipating any sharp economic recovery around the world.“We think there’s a slight misreading of the data at the moment but we are encouraged by a
stabilisation.”"
632;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-08-04T21:07:08Z;Wall St extends gains on upbeat economic data;;US stocks extended their recent run of gains on Tuesday as encouraging housing data offset concerns that the market’s rally may run out of steam.After brief selling pressure during the afternoon, stocks rallied back in late trade and the S&P 500 closed at a fresh high for the year. That kept the broad benchmark above the 1,000 threshold, which it finally rose above on Monday for the first time since last November.The S&P closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,005.65, near its intra-day high of 1,007.12.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to close at 9,320.19, while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.1 per cent to 2,011.31.“A pullback would be healthy, there have been lots of positives to take from the earnings we have seen,” said Neil Massa, senior trader at MFC Global Investment Management.Meanwhile, growing momentum by the Securities and Exchange Commission to ban the use of flash trading orders on exchanges sparked volatility in the shares of NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.Shares in NYSE Euronext surged nearly 4 per cent in early afternoon trade, before easing to stand 2.4 per cent higher at $27.40. Nasdaq OMX, which, unlike NYSE Euronext, allows flash orders, fell 0.3 per cent to $21.39 having plumbed an earlier low of $20.78.Financial stocks fell in early trade, knocked in part by data showing that personal income fell more sharply than analysts expected in June.But figures showing that pending home sales jumped much more than predicted during the month saw them rise into positive territory by midday.John Canally, economist for LPL Financial, said the fifth straight month of rises for pending home sales was very encouraging.“After housing starts and moderating prices, the pending home sales figures are the latest sign that the housing market has stabilised.”Citigroup rose 2.2 per cent to $3.25 while Wells Fargo was up 2.9 per cent at $26.55 and Bank of Americapicked up 2.1 per cent to $15.64.Homebuilders saw mixed fortunes as the data lifted some of the sector’s biggest companies following early losses on the back of some disappointing quarterly results.Pulte Homes fell to a heavier loss than expected, with falling land values and weak sales continuing to take their toll. Its shares dropped 0.7 per cent to $11.68.The negative outlook briefly weighed on Centex, which Pulte has agreed to buy, and after early losses, its shares rose 0.1 per cent to $11.33 as the company made a quarterly profit.Rival DR Horton also suffered as a result of record foreclosures and rising unemployment. Its results were worse than expected.But its shares picked up following early falls and it gained 4.9 per cent to close at $12.32.“People are selling the homebuilders after their recent run-up but I would pay more attention to these economic data,” said Mr Canally.The utilities sector was the heaviest faller on the S&P, led lower by Allegheny Energy, which lost 4.9 per cent to $24.50 after the company reported slightly lower profit than expected.The results exacerbated pre-market falls that came on the back of an announcement on Monday evening that the company had filed a universal shelf register with the SEC, which would enable it to sell fresh stock.Meanwhile, Duke Energy announced second-quarter profit 21 per cent below their level at the same time last year – its shares edged up 0.1 per cent to $15.58.There was weakness in the agricultural sector as Archer Daniels Midland fell 5.2 per cent to $28.81 after it reported falling revenues and profit, with demand for its oilseed and other commodities remaining low. Monsanto lost 2.6 per cent to $84.02.Shares in PepsiCo rose 5.1 per cent to $59.06 after the company agreed the purchase of its two large bottling companies.Pepsi increased its offer to $36.50 a share for Pepsi Bottling and $28.50 a share for Pepsi-Americas. Pepsi Bottling rose 8.5 per cent to $36.49 and PepsiAmericas gained 9 per cent to close at $28.50.
633;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-08-04T21:06:56Z;PepsiCo pays up;The deal makes financial sense;"Now the games really begin. In the red corner sits Coca-Cola, with a team of separate and not entirely equal bottlers. Facing them across the North American beverage market in the blue corner is PepsiCo, which announced on Tuesday that it would combine with its two largest US bottlers, PepsiAmericas and the Pepsi Bottling Group. The rivalry between these two differently structured competitors should provide decades of gripping viewing for armchair managers.By taking full control of its bottlers for $7.8bn in cash and shares, Pepsi aims to grow faster and more profitably than its rival in the long term. The North American market is already saturated with soft drinks, so the key to decent returns in the future relies in innovation and making the most of every opportunity to sell in different retail environments. Separating bottlers from their parents provides less incentive to take risks with new products, or to invest in the difficult process of identifying which drinks fare best on each shelf of thousands of varied retailers.The deal also makes financial sense, with investors pushing Pepsi shares up 5 per cent in response on Tuesday. The group did have to return with an offer more than a fifth higher than its initial approach – for two companies that had no prospect of another buyer emerging. But the lift in the offer price reflects the $240m of annual cost savings targeted, worth $1.8bn taxed and capitalised. Adjusted for that, the valuation is reasonable at less than eight times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Coke, meanwhile, prefers to stick with long-term targets and investment plans for its team of bottlers. Its challenge will be to persuade investors they should stick their money on red.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

634;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-08-04T16:01:41Z;PepsiCo raises price to win bottlers;;PepsiCo has reached a $7.8bn agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of its two largest bottlers, Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) and PepsiAmericas (PAS) after raising its initial bid by more than 20 per cent.The agreement brings to an end the messy takeover bid for the two bottlers launched in May. The initial $6bn combined price tag was rejected as too low and sparked an embarrassing court battle over the way it was handled.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, welcomed the deal, which PepsiCo argues will streamline its efforts to distribute both its increasingly broad portfolio of soft drinks, and snacks from its Frito-Lay and Quaker divisions.She said the deal would enable PepsiCo “to present one face to retail customers’.“Ultimately it will put us in a much better position to compete and to grow both now and in the years ahead.”“The fully integrated beverage business will enable us to bring innovative products and packages to market faster, streamline our manufacturing and distribution systems and react more quickly to changes in the marketplace, much like we do with our food business,” she said.PBG is PepsiCo’s largest bottler, with annual sales of about $14bn, handling over half of its beverage sales in the US, and about 40 per cent of its soft drink sales worldwide. Internationally, it handles distribution in Canada, Greece, Mexico, Russia, Spain and Turkey.PAS, with annual sales of around $4.9bn, bottles and distributes PepsiCo beverages in 19 US states in the midwest, as well as in Eastern and Central Europe. It also has a share in bottling in Central America and the Caribbean.The transaction reverses the spin-off of PBG by PepsiCo a decade ago.The agreement values shares of Pepsi Bottling at $36.50 and PepsiAmericas at $28.50, offering investors cash or shares.PepsiCo initially offered the equivalent of $29.50 per share for Pepsi Bottling and $23.27 for PepsiAmericas in both cash and shares.The parties expect the transactions to close in late 2009 or early 2010. PepsiCo’s debt financing commitments were provided by BofA Merrill Lynch and Citi.Centerview Partners and BofA Merrill Lynch are acting as lead financial advisors to PepsiCo. Citi is also acting as financial advisor to PepsiCo. Morgan Stanley is acting as financial advisor to PBG and Goldman Sachs is acting as financial advisor to PAS.PepsiCo’s shares rose almost five per cent to $59.00 on the news. PBG’s shares jumped more than 8 per cent to $36.37, and PAS shares moved up more than 9 per cent to $28.51.
635;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;A group that brings shock tactics to opera;;"Two lovers sing a duet leaning out of the eye sockets of a giantess. Men clad in white slowly secrete from her nipple, others scramble through the delicately veined tangle of her intestines. Hold on to your stomachs: La Fura dels Baus is coming to town.The Barcelona theatre group has joined forces with English National Opera to bring theatrical flair to György Ligeti’s 1978 opera Le Grand Macabre, the latest in the Coliseum’s series of multidisciplinary partnerships. World-class venue, huge budget, slick press campaign – could this really be the same La Fura dels Baus whose punky 1980s manifesto declared itself “not a theatrical group …but a criminal collective”?Of course not, says Alex Ollé, La Fura’s artistic director, shaking his head: “That describes our generational rage back then well, but of course I don’t think this is the age we are in now.”It is as well he does not, since Ollé is now sitting with me in the pleasant garden of a luxurious Rome hotel where he has spent the night. Behind us rises the city’s Teatro dell’Opera, where Le Grand Macabre opened in June, the bouquets just winning out to the boos.It is principally Ollé, a “Furista” for 30 years, who has in the past decade steered the troupe more and more into the lavish spending and stroppy audiences of opera. Now 49, with nervy fingers forever readying the next cigarette, Ollé has hooded, mournful eyes that are recognisably those staring from La Fura’s first grainy photos in 1979, the year of the group’s founding. Yet for all the edginess within the work itself, Ollé prefers a gradualist assessment of the group’s evolution from industrial space to opera house. “The Barcelona middle class, the type that goes to the opera, has always been more supportive of the avant-garde than elsewhere in Spain,” he points out.“And, anyway, in this Ligeti piece we’re basically still doing what we always set out to do: provoke confusion in the audience. Make them vulnerable so as to penetrate. Get inside them.”Coming to St Martin’s Lane in September to kick off ENO’s new season, Ligeti’s only opera switches between romp and moments of searing terror in the face of an armageddon that never quite arrives. “Magnificently clever” was how this newspaper described its opening night in Brussels in March.So too was its first night in Rome – principally owing to the suppurating giantess that forms the centrepiece of Ollé and his team’s interpretation. She is both gross and tragic, her skin crawling with projected images, one breast drooping on to the stage and her big head moving from time to time in doleful slowness. Expert dramatic pacing perfectly complements what Ligeti once called the “cartoon-strip” succession of his score and brings the production to the pitch of repulsion and anxiety that La Fura has awoken in audiences from its earliest performances.The group started out as street performers, priding themselves on their multidisciplinary skills as dancers and musicians, and with a strong acrobatic aggression picked up in circus training. “Fura” is Catalan for “snooper” or “ferret”; the Baus is a river in a rural area north of Barcelona where its founders first raised hell in the late 1970s. If that interpretation does not mean a great deal, well, the “music” of the name, its founders insist, is more important than its meaning – a characteristic piece of Fura reasoning, for however much the group has evolved and expanded, euphony and visual magnificence usually outweigh any conceptual complexity. This is at once La Fura’s great flaw and at the same time the source of its power when applied to opera.It was in 1984 that La Fura made its name with Actions, a spectacle held in a Barcelona warehouse. Middle-aged Barcelonans, long jaded by La Fura’s catalogue of violent catharsis ever since, can still be roused by the memory of Actions, by all accounts the theatrical event of that year. Shaven-headed, phlegm-spewing “mud men” writhed along the floor, clutching at the legs of the audience, who scattered in all directions. Naked men on wires, apparently contorted in agony, crashed into a white backdrop like vast dying flies, smearing “blood” along its surface. The public was repelled but flocked back for more.These enfants terribles did not spring from the void. There is a strong tradition in Catalan culture of what is called rauxa, the mad exuberance of a Salvador Dalí or a Calixto Bieito. There is also the Catalans’ traditional obsession with bodily functions, all of which helps make up what Ollé calls “the DNA of La Fura”.He also credits older Barcelona performance groups such as Els Joglars, created in 1962, which did much to set the transgressive agenda and to shake its audiences out of the grey cultural mizzle of Franco’s dictatorship. It is to such pioneers that La Fura owes its theatrical freedoms: in 1977 members of Els Joglars were jailed for their staging of La Torna, a play that “insulted” the Guardia Civila and became a test case which the forces of reaction eventually lost. The vomiting, visceral “mud men” of Actions were potent proof of how completely the dam had been breached by the early 1980s.An explosion towards the mainstream came when La Fura created a characteristic spectacle at the opening ceremony of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics: Jason’s voyage to the pillars of Hercules, complete with a fully manned Argo and huge war engines, was a far cry from the pyrotechnic kitsch of most Olympiads, and included such classic Fura touches as a lacerated, bleeding body carried aloft and a flying cannonball made up of compacted bodies.From this point, La Fura expanded and internationalised, and have given some 2,500 performances around the world to date, many mounted from their roving ship Naumon, based in Barcelona’s old port.The Olympics also marked, as Ollé says, the moment when factions in La Fura started to go their different ways: some down the path of film, others of more spectacles or “macroshows” or – to the dismay of many – staging glitzy corporate events for Pepsi and Vodafone, to name just two of the dozen or so large corporations that have commissioned promotional events from the group. There is now a record label and ventures in feature films, even acting masterclasses in “Furan language”, and the company’s performance schedule remains frenetic: in the next couple of weeks alone there will be a spectacular entitled Extollunt Marmora Lunam performed in the marble quarries of Carrara in Italy (August 2), another (on the same day) to inaugurate a new stadium in Cornellà de Llobregat in Cataluna, a performance (two days later) of Carmina Burana in the Basque country, then a macroevent entitled The Beat of the Forest at the Sziget Festival in Budapest (August 12) – all this before Boris Godunov in Mexico in September and Les Troyens in Valencia the following month.Among all this activity, Ollé and his colleague Carles Pedrissa have continued to concentrate on opera. In 1996, after their first production of Manuel de Falla’s La Atlántida, Ollé was introduced to the director of the Salzburg Festival, Gérard Mortier, who brought the Fura production of Berlioz’s La Damnation de Faust to Salzburg three years later.What La Fura can bring to opera, according to Ollé, is “drama to match the music”. His Fura team for Le Grand Macabre is small – just half a dozen people covering video, costume and set – but sufficient for his needs: “Opera often lacks a certain stage-mindedness, and we have years of experience of exploiting the whole space to the full.”If that is what La Fura brings to opera, what opera brings to La Fura is perhaps more pertinent still. The group’s macroshows staged in the 1980s and 1990s had grown ever more violent and audiovisually sophisticated: men ate raw offal; bodies twitched from gallows; slops were poured over caged prisoners. Yet amid all this rauxa and fury, the themes and ideas of those shows often seemed oddly bloodless. “The manipulation of the masses by the media” was one portentous 1990s subtitle. The visual language, then as now, was extraordinary, anguish-inducing, but its underlying concepts had seemed shaky, even superfluous.“Our power is often more visceral than intellectual,” Ollé himself admits. More severe critics argue that La Fura has merely become yet another lucrative Barcelona brand, sucking up to the authorities it once sneered at. Even sympathetic critics have quietly admitted to me that the spectacles often feel like an artistic dead end.Opera, on the other hand, has been La Fura’s chance to go back to the drawing board. In that sweet liberty found in restraint, it seems those snoopers/ferrets flourish best when they have someone else’s concepts and someone else’s music to hang on to.If so, the need is mutual. Ollé’s Fura colleague Carles Pedrissa joined forces with conductor Zubin Mehta in June for a production of the Ring Cycle, staged in Valencia but beamed live to eight European cities. The attractiveness to the opera world of such ventures is obvious, since they project youth, multimedia, anarchy, technical brilliance and rudeness – “everything that opera must offer,” Ollé says, “if it is to survive.”‘Le Grand Macabre’ is at the ENO, London Coliseum, from September 17; www.eno.orgwww.lafura.com"
636;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-27T21:35:05Z;M&A;Managers are no longer sheltering from the crisis;"No. That is what you would expect a target company to reply when an unsolicited bidder comes knocking. And “no” is what a series of unwanted bidders have lately got. Bottlers have rejected PepsiCo’s unsolicited offers. Anglo American has snubbed Xstrata. Oil company Venture Production is resisting a £1.3bn bid from UK utility Centrica. Meanwhile, Resolution’s offer for British fund manager Friends Provident has run into the sand. What is noteworthy, however, is that these hostile bids have been tabled at all. Only four months ago, the world was supposedly headed for financial Armageddon.The return of hostility is an encouraging sign. It shows animal spirits are returning to corporate boardrooms. Managers are no longer sheltering from the crisis under the table. Worldwide there are twice as many hostile bids around, as a percentage of total deals, than there have been annually, on average, since 2000. In some countries, there has been an absolute rise too. In the UK there have been more hostile bids so far this year than in all of 2008, even excluding Xstrata/Anglo, according to Dealogic.This makes economic sense. Many industries need restructuring. Companies with strong balance sheets that have weathered the crisis are now taking opportunistic pot-shots at weaker peers. Targets naturally respond that these offers undervalue their “true value”, as they are based on recently depressed share prices.That has put acquirers in a bind. They have been reluctant – or unable – to get the extra financing they need to make knockout cash offers with juicy premiums. That is how US utility NRG Energy effectively rebuffed Exelon. Indeed, the only big mergers and acquisitions restructuring taking place is where government financial backing is available – as in the state-guaranteed loans on offer in the car industry. Hostility has come back, but not credit with it. Until it does, acquirers’ bark may prove worse than their bite.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

637;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-27T09:52:35Z;Rexam considers £350m rights issue;;Rexam shares fell nearly 10 per cent on Monday after the packaging and can group said it was considering raising several hundred million pounds of equity from existing shareholders to avoid the risk that its credit rating might be cut to junk status.The company, whose clients include Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, said continued tough trading conditions meant cash flows had not improved and the risk of a downgrade had become “unacceptably high”.The comments sent the shares 32¼p lower to 291½p on Monday, valuing the group’s equity at £1.87bn.The loss of investment grade status would force Rexam to pay higher interest rates on its debt, damaging profitability. As a result, the group said it was looking at a number of options, including an equity raising, although no decision has been made yet.But the group said in a statement to the Stock Exchange on Monday: “The absence of [any] upturn will reduce Rexam’s ability to generate significant free cash flows to pay down debt in 2010.”If there is a cash call, it is likely to be announced on Thursday when the group issues its first-half results and is likely to total about £350m, according to a person familiar with the company.Citigroup and RBS Hoare Govett, the group’s retained advisers, are understood to be sounding out Rexam’s leading shareholders about the move.Net debt at the company, which two years ago paid $1.6bn to acquire O-I Plastics, a unit of US company Owens-Illinois, stood at £2.7bn at the end of March.Along with a weaker pound, which has pushed up the cost of servicing its dollar-denominated debt, the group has also suffered from falling demand for beer and soft drinks cans in North America and Europe.Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have lowered Rexam’s credit rating to the lowest investment grade this year.In spite of downgrades, Rexam said it was not in danger of breaching debt covenants.Although trading had not improved in recent months, the group said its half-year results would meet market expectations.Analysts are expecting underlying pre-tax profits to fall from £158m last year to £130m.Last month, Rexam refinanced £860m of debts that were due to mature next year to 2012. It does not face any further refinancing needs until 2011, when it has to repay £500m.
638;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-22T20:32:50Z;Wall Street fluctuates on mixed signals;;US stocks fluctuated on Wednesday as investors reacted to signs of strength in the housing and consumer sectors and mixed messages on banks’ future bad debts.Banks opened lower as Wall street reacted to warnings by several companies of loan losses to come.But they turned around after Andrew Cecere, chief financial officer of US Bancorp said he saw credit write-offs stabilising.US Bancorp rose 3.8 per cent to $18.96, while Morgan Stanley, which made a wider loss than expected after making a $700m writedown on its commercial real estate portfolio, rebounded after heavy early losses to end 0.1 per cent lower at $27.54.Mr Cecere’s words also helped other regional banks enjoy a strong afternoon in spite of mixed earnings.SunTrust, which made a narrower loss than expected, ended 6.7 per cent up at $16.19 while KeyCorp, which missed analysts’ estimates, was 7.1 per cent higher at $5.16.“Right now the market feels good about itself, and is focusing on signs of stabilisation rather than the negatives,” said Paul Miller, a managing director at FBR Capital Markets.Wells Fargo remained resolutely lower however as the prospect of further credit losses negated the impact of encouraging revenues, with analysts warning much of the income from mortgage refinancing would not be repeated. Its shares ended down 3.6 per cent at $24.45.Bank of New York Mellon also lost ground after reporting earnings slightly below expectations, falling 6.2 per cent to $27.32.The markets followed several banks and bounced back during the day.“Even if you have a few people hitting the “sell” button on results, there are others underneath willing to buy the dips,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.The markets were also helped by optimism on housing after figures showed an unexpected rise in home prices in May.Mr Bernanke told the Senate he saw a “levelling-off” in house prices, although he added that foreclosures could yet pressure them again.KB Home gained 6.1 per cent to $15.03 while Lennarrose 7.7 per cent to $10.62 and DR Horton climbed 5.6 per cent to $10.38.Starbucks led the consumer sector higher after cost cuts helped it swing to a profit and beat analysts’ forecasts. Its shares jumped 18.4 per cent to $17.39.Resilience in consumer spending helped Applereport much better earnings than expected, with sales and profit margins both beating expectations. The stock picked up 3.5 per cent to $156.74.“The consumer is responding to Apple’s product introductions as well as price cuts, which is a good sign for the rest of the market,” said Bill Shope, an analyst at Credit Suisse.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 0.4 per cent lower at 954.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 8,881.26. But the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 1,926.38.Newspaper stocks performed well after Media General reported a quarterly profit and said declines in advertising revenue were beginning to ease. The company’s shares rose 84.3 per cent to $4.33.Of the blue-chip newspaper publishers, the New York Times Company, which reports results today, rose 3.1 per cent to $6.62.PepsiCo slipped as its quarterly revenues disappointed. Even though the company topped earnings expectations, the shares dropped 0.9 per cent to $55.89.In the technology sector, the shine from Apple’s results was dulled by disappointment over results from AMD, the microchip maker.Sliding sales saw the company miss estimates, and the shares gave up 13 per cent to $3.55.But Yahoo was able to overcome weak advertising revenues and beat analysts’ expectations with its earnings. Its shares climbed 3.7 per cent to $17.37.Boeing was the latest Dow component to beat its earnings estimates as it saw growth in its defence programs, but the shares fell 2.4 per cent to $42.Eli Lilly and Pfizersaw mixed fortunes even after both drugmakers reported better earnings than expected and raised their full-year forecasts.Eli Lilly fell 1.9 per cent to $33.79 while Pfizer picked up 1.1 per cent to $15.87.
639;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-21T15:04:17Z;Coke sees robust international sales;;Robust international sales volumes, including a 33 per cent year-on-year increase in India and 14 per cent in China, helped Coca-Cola offset continued sluggish demand in the US during its second quarter.Coke’s worldwide sales in case volume terms increased 4 per cent in the quarter, supported by 5 per cent growth internationally, in line with the company’s strategic targets.But the strength of the dollar weighed on international revenues and lead to a 9 per cent fall in comparable earnings to 92 cents per diluted share against a year ago.Excluding the impact of currency, the company’s operating income increased 9 per cent, exceeding its 6 to 8 per cent long-term growth target.Apart from India and China, Coke said it had realised “sound unit case volume growth in other key markets around the world including Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Thailand, Korea and Northwest Europe”.Muhtar Kent, chief executive officer, said that despite the global economic gloom, Coke had “outperformed the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink industry in most of our key markets and [driven] further global volume and value share gains”.He also expressed satisfaction with the impact of the company’s latest global marketing drive to support its core Coke carbonated drinks, with Coke brand sales up 3 per cent during the quarter, including 5 per cent growth in Japan, 6 per cent growth in China and 29 per cent growth in India.However, Coke’s US business continued to face tough conditions, with overall unit case sales down 1 per cent, including a 4 per cent volume fall in retail outlet sales, offset by a 7 per cent increase in food service sales to restaurants. Its carbonated drinks, including Coke, reported a 2 per cent decline in volume sales, while still drinks, including Fuze and Glacéau gained 1 per cent in the quarter. Sales of Coke Zero reported a 12th consecutive quarter of double digit growth, up 24 per cent.Mr Kent said the company remained encouraged by its performance in North America, and stressed efforts to improve the pricing structure of its core Coke drinks to drive sales. He said that the company’s new, smaller 99 cent, 16 ounce bottle of Coke was attracting over 1m new and incremental sales every week.Coke reported earnings per share of 88 cents, which represented a 44 per cent increase versus last year, when earnings were hit by 40 cents of restructuring charges. Revenues fell 9 per cent to $8.27bn, as a result of currency pressures and restructuring charges.Coca Cola shares were down 0.8 per cent at $50.63 in early trading in New York on Tuesday.PepsiCo reports its second quarter results on Wednesday.
640;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-19T22:39:45Z;World’s next top brands set to rise in the east;;"The world’s next Coca-Cola or Starbucks is more likely to emerge from Asia, the Middle East or South America than the US or Europe as global economic wealth shifts.In research prepared for the Financial Times, Wolff Olins, the consultants behind the London 2012 Olympics logo and the Product Red campaign, has tipped five food and drink brands from emerging markets to become global brands.They comprise Juan Valdez Café, a Colombian coffee chain; Almarai, a Saudi dairy and fruit-juice company based in Riyadh; Patchi, a Lebanese boutique chocolate chain; ChangYu, China’s biggest wine producer; and United Spirits, India’s largest liquor group, which owns Scotch whisky Whyte & Mackay.“It used to be possible to be a global brand by dominating the US market,” said Melanie McShane, a strategist at Wolff Olins. “That’s changing rapidly. Now you have to be number one in Asia.”The findings echo research by US business consultancy Bain & Co, which estimated that one-third of the FT Global 500’s companies could come from emerging markets by 2015 thanks to what it calls a “seismic shift” away from developed markets.Satish Shankar, a Singapore-based partner with Bain & Co, said that established western consumer goods brands were being forced to “battle it out” with emerging market brands as they moved eastwards to take advantage of rising demand for branded products. Some are acquiring local brands, with PepsiCo paying $1.4bn last year for Lebedyansky, Russia’s largest juice group, and Unilever buying Inmarko, the country’s biggest ice cream brand.Coca-Cola’s attempts to acquire Huiyuan, China’s biggest juice group, for $2.4bn this year were less successful – Chinese regulators blocked the deal.Others are taking minority stakes or forming joint ventures. UK-based distiller Diageo is in talks with United Spirits over acquiring up to 15 per cent of the Indian company, while PepsiCo this year formed a joint venture with Almarai in Asia, Africa and the Middle East."
641;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T05:21:43+0000;Reaggregating the supply chain;;"The pendulum of business practice naturally swings back and forth. When every manager has read the book on the benefits of standing-only meetings, returns from embracing the fad are squeezed by competition. Outsourcing is one of the latest tricks to feel the pull of gravity as companies take steps to reverse some of the relentless disaggregation of supply chains that has taken place in the past two decades.PepsiCo’s desire to reunite with its American bottlers a decade after it spun off the operations is a case in point. Similarly Boeing, already two years late in getting its new Dreamliner into the air, was forced last week to buy one component manufacturer for at least $580m as the aerospace manufacturer tries to fix an ambitiously complex and disparate supply chain.More broadly, the recession has prompted a reappraisal of the advantages of vertical integration – after all, the low volatility of the past decade did not just mask risks in the financial world. Disruptions caused by a lack of trade finance and a drop in orders have hurt disparate manufacturers and component suppliers alike. For auto companies in particular, painful interdependencies have been exposed.Greater caution, towards balance sheets and critical operations, will make managers more inclined to keep production in plain sight.Such risk aversion is likely to prove temporary. But there is danger of a more profound shift. At an economy level, the deep downturns experienced by countries heavily engaged in trade, such as Germany and Japan, have led to commentary that a reliance on exports is a weakness. A less trade-friendly political environment would curtail the trend toward ever greater globalisation. Outsourcing would be a minor victim of such a change.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

642;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-14T16:40:20Z;Kirin-Suntory merger to spur consolidation;;Kirin confirmed on Tuesday it was in early merger talks with Suntory, its local rival, in a move that is likely to trigger further consolidation in Japan’s food and drinks sector.If the deal to combine Japan’s largest and second-largest food and drinks groups goes through, it will create an entity with revenues of Y3,820bn ($41bn) that could become a significant operator, particularly in Asia.The new group would be significantly smaller than global giants such as Nestlé or Unilever.However, it could become the first Japanese group in the food and drinks sector with sufficient scale to compete on the global stage with overseas peers such as PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch InBev.The combined company would have annual beer sales by volume of about 56m hectolitres, according to Bloomberg data, making it the world’s sixth-largest brewer, behind Molson Coors and ahead of China’s Tsingtao.The discussions highlight a recognition on the part of Japanese companies that their long-term survival depends on them strengthening their position at home while at the same time expanding abroad.“The main objective is to create a stable cash cow in the domestic market and [use that as a basis to] invest in overseas markets,” said Hiroshi Saji, analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.Both Kirin and Suntory are considered winners in their sector.But the Japanese market for the beers and beverages that the two groups make “is not a market that will grow 10 per cent, 20 per cent, in future”, according to Suntory.Kirin said: “We have been saying for a while that we cannot expect top-line growth in the domestic market.”The problem that food and drinks makers face in Japan is not simply limited to the country’s ageing society, which is sapping demand for everything from cars to beer.Large retailers, themselves under pressure due to slow consumer demand, are using their purchasing power to drive down prices.This is particularly true in the soft drinks market, where fierce competition among more than 10 manufacturers gives the retailers an advantage over their suppliers.Against this backdrop, the potential synergies from a merger of Kirin and Suntory are compelling, analysts say.Suntory has a strong position in soft drinks, an area in which Kirin has struggled.Kirin’s operating profit margin on domestic soft drinks was a meagre 2 per cent, compared with more than 10 per cent for its beer and related products.“If Kirin were to focus on liquor businesses and Suntory on soft drinks, there would be potential for improved profitability at Kirin,” Taizo Demura, analyst at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, said in a report.Meanwhile, Kirin has an extensive distribution network in the Asia-Pacific region which it acquired through its investments in San Miguel Beer, the largest brewer in the Philippines, and in Lion Nathan, Australia’s second-largest brewing group.This network could be used to distribute Suntory’s products as well, such as its popular Brand’s health food products, said Mr Saji.A merger still faces considerable hurdles and both Kirin and Suntory emphasise that it is by no means certain where the talks will lead.Combining their operations would also raise anti-competitive issues, since together Kirin and Suntory would have almost 50 per cent of Japan’s market for beer and related products.Analysts say, however, that the very fact that Kirin and Suntory are talking will put pressure on rivals Asahi and Sapporo, Japan’s two other large beer and soft drinks companies, to review their strategies.Asahi has little option but to try and co-operate with Sapporo in beer, and with Coca-Cola, which could be unseated from its top position in soft drinks, said Mr Saji.Whatever they do, “they are now under pressure to take the next step” in their own growth strategies, Mr Saji added.
643;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-14T08:06:44Z;Confident Britvic eyes overseas expansion;;Britvic, the owner of Robinsons fruit squash and Drench juicy waters, is planning to expand internationally through licensing agreements and joint ventures as soft drink sales in its home market remain robust.Britvic also said its full-year results would beat expectations following a bumper third quarter that prompted it to release a trading update early.Its bullishness raises the prospect of sales in the current financial year topping £1bn for the first time in Britvic’s history. Its shares on Tuesday rose 9¼p to close at 306¾p.Most of Britvic’s sales are in the UK and Ireland, with just 3 per cent coming from other markets such as the Netherlands and Scandinavia. But Britvic has been exploring how it can enter new markets using licensing and franchising agreements as well as joint ventures. It could enter such markets early next year, according to Paul Moody, chief executive. “We’ve got brands that transfer well into international markets.”Britvic this year formed a licensing partnership for its children’s Fruit Shoot brand with Buffalo Rock, the US PepsiCo bottler, after running trials in the US states of Alabama, Georgia and Florida. It has sold Fruit Shoot in the Netherlands for five years and its Robinsons squash in Scandinavia for three years.Britvic’s success at managing its brands through the recession is one reason it is tipped as a possible takeover candidate for PepsiCo, which has licensed its Pepsi soft drinks brand to Britvic in the UK until 2023.The Pepsi brand has been performing well, with sales boosted by PepsiCo’s sponsorship of the Twenty20 World Cup cricket tournament, held last month in the UK. About 1.4m consumers entered a competition Britvic ran to coincide with the tournament.Britvic also benefited from its Robinsons sponsorship of Wimbledon. Instead of being “a damp and miserable affair”, Wimbledon had good weather and a local player, Andy Murray, who made it into the semi-finals and gave British consumers “a sense of involvement”, said Mr Moody.Britvic’s third-quarter sales revenue rose 5.9 per cent to £249.1m compared with a year earlier, with revenue in the year to date up 6.1 per cent. Britvic has been outperforming the UK soft drinks market, which has improved recently. UK take-home sales volumes rose 3.2 per cent in June.Analysts said they would raise estimates. Cazenove said it expected to increase its £108m profits forecast by 4 per cent.………………..Tried and trusted brands give smoothies and bottled water a hard timeSmoothies, energy drinks and bottled water have been dumped while colas and fruit squashes are back in fashion, writes Jenny Wiggins.The experience of soft drink brands has been no different from other brands during the recession: people have tended to abandon new products for ones they know and trust.Pepsi, Robinsons squash and the children’s drink Fruit Shoot are among Britvic’s best-selling brands this year.Like McDonald’s, which reinvented its food and drink menu ahead of the recession by adding salads and organic milk – leaving it well-positioned to capture consumers trading down from more expensive restaurants – Britvic has been making the right kind of changes to its drinks portfolio. These include removing artificial colours and flavours and introducing Pepsi Raw, a cola made with cane sugar and natural plant extracts.Cola has remained the UK’s leading soft drinks category (measured by take- home sales value), followed by pure juices, glucose drinks, juice drinks and squashes.The country’s top five brands are Coca-Cola, Lucozade, Robinsons, Tropicana and Pepsi.Britvic is now targeting growth in Gatorade, a sports drink and brand it has licensed from PepsiCo. It wants to increase its market share from about 7-8 per cent to overtake Powerade, which has a 20 per cent share, by 2011. Lucozade is market leader with 60 per cent.But it is struggling with V-water, PepsiCo’s vitamin water brand, which Britvic makes and distributes. V-water is less suited to a recession as it is high-priced in a relatively new category.
644;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-13T19:15:09Z;Tata Tea set to refresh brand portfolio;;The Tata Tea Group, owner of the UK’s Tetley tea brand, is targeting acquisitions of international soft drink brands as it diversifies away from tea to become a global beverages company.“For the right acquisition, we’d gear up again,” Peter Unsworth, chief executive of the Tetley Group and leader of Tata Tea Group’s executive office, told the Financial Times in an interview.“There are certain businesses out there that would fit well with us.”Mr Unsworth, who became chief executive of Tetley in April 2007, would like to extend Tata Tea’s business into smoothies, juices and so-called “functional drinks”.It had considered buying into UK smoothie maker Innocent before it sold a minority stake to Coca-Cola in April.He admires specialist soft drinks companies such as the US’s Jones Soda and the Arizona Beverage Company.Tata can afford acquisitions because it has net cash of $149m and no debt after selling its 30 per cent stake in Glaceau (the owner of the Vitaminwater brand) to Coca-Cola for around $1.2bn in 2007. Tata had paid $667m for the stake the previous year, with the help of the Tata Group.Mr Unsworth claimed the Tata Group, which owns 35 per cent of Tata Tea, could again help fund an acquisition of several hundred million dollars. The conglomerate’s chairman, Ratan Tata, last year cautioned executives against making further acquisitions after being forced to prop up a rights issue linked to its Jaguar and Land Rover acquisitions, but Mr Unsworth said the chairman’s comments “don’t necessarily apply to us”.Tata Tea wants to broaden the range of beverages it offers. Tea sales currently account for just over 70 per cent of total turnover ($1.07bn), but Mr Unsworth wants to reduce this to less than 50 per cent. “We’re moving from being purely a tea business to a beverages business,” he said.The group, which owns coffee and energy drink brands as well as the Indian bottled water brand Himalayan, has also been having discussions with PepsiCo about possible joint ventures.This would not include bottled tea drinks because PepsiCo already makes drinks with Unilever under the Lipton’s brand.Mr Unsworth argued that Tata Tea, the second-largest branded tea group in the world after Unilever with a 20 per cent market share, can take share from the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, which owns tea brand PG Tips as well as Lipton’s.In India, one of its key markets with a 25 per cent share of revenues – the UK and the US also each account for 25 per cent of revenues – it has a bigger share of the tea market than Hindustan Unilever by volume, and is roughly equal by value.Tata Tea also sees opportunity in Russia, one of the world’s biggest tea markets by sales volumes.
645;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-08T10:57:55Z;US to attend World Expo in Shanghai;;"US representatives are preparing to break ground as soon as next week on the American pavilion for the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, ending months of speculation over whether the globe’s leading power might be a no-show at what is being billed as the largest ever world’s fair.Shanghai, China’s largest city and financial centre, has latched onto the Expo as its chance to establish its global profile as a dazzling metropolis in the same way last year’s Beijing Olympics turned the world’s attention to the nation’s capital.Officially budgeting Rmb28.6bn (US$4.2bn) for the event, Shanghai intends to carve a place in the history books alongside milestone world’s fairs like London’s Great Exhibition in 1851, the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris which produced the Eiffel Tower; and Chicago’s 1893 Colombian Exposition, which introduced the first Ferris Wheel.Chinese officials had become increasingly concerned in recent months that the US, which is barred by law from using government funds to build its pavilion, might miss the party altogether, which would have caused major diplomatic embarrassment to both sides.Expo officials were reported earlier in the year to be looking for ways to help defray the costs of US participation, if corporate sponsorships could not be found because of the global economic slowdown.After personal phone calls from Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, American companies committed some $20m to the project in recent weeks. This, however, is still short of the $61m needed to build and operate the US pavilion.“We’ve had a sea change of good news over the past two months,” said Frank Lavin, chairman of the US pavilion steering committee and a former senior trade official under the Bush administration. He added that the personal intervention of Ms Clinton led fundraising to “pick up dramatically.”The new sponsors include General Electric, PepsiCo, 3M, Dell, Yum! Brands and Cargill.It now looks almost certain that the US will participate, but a source close to the effort said, “Nothing is ever done until it’s done.”Organisers believe a formal participation agreement could be signed with Shanghai Expo as early as this week, with ground-breaking perhaps next week during a visit by Gary Locke, the ethnic Chinese US commerce secretary.The Expo, which will run from May 1 to October 31 next year, is expected to attract 70m visitors, including 3.5m from abroad.The US pavilion would be one of the largest at Expo and would include a section on “the success of the Chinese in America”. The Expo, whose theme is “Better City, Better Life”, will boast national, corporate and other pavilions, some with walls made of soyabean fibre, air conditioning systems run with river water and lights powered by solar panels.Preparations for the event have turned the vast city of 17m people into a building site: several new subway lines are being added to give the city a 400km underground railway network, one of the longest in the world.A new terminal has been built for cruise ships, airports are being renovated, thousands of the city’s often foul public toilets are being cleaned up and Expo is even tackling the local cuisine: Expo food will minimise offal, and ban chicken bones, all in aid of impressing picky foreigners.Expo will make permanent improvements to the physical infrastructure of Shanghai – not to mention making this already western-friendly city easier to navigate by foreigners, by teaching more taxi drivers to speak English and discouraging foreign pet peeves such as spitting in public and queue-jumping.Shanghai plans to add 20,000 hotel rooms by the end of next year – a 34 per cent inflation in the supply of starred hotel rooms – at a time when occupancy rates at five-star hotels have already been savaged by the global financial crisis.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen"
646;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-01T21:35:07Z;Brands show off niche side;;When Mars, the maker of M&Ms, Skittles and Twix, embarked this year on its first new confectionery brand launch in 20 years, it turned to women for inspiration.Fling, a chocolate bar on sale in California and online at www.flingchocolate.com, is quite clear about who its target market is: the slim fingers of shimmering chocolate are packaged in a bright pink wrapper with the slogan “Naughty, but not that naughty” while claiming to contain less than “85 calories per finger”.“We really went unapologetically feminine,” explains Thomas Pinnau, vice-president of indulgence for Mars’s snackfood division. “We had lengthy discussions about whether pink would be too feminine but we decided if it’s polarising, that’s good.”Although other chocolate brands have often subtly pitched their products to one gender or the other – about 65 per cent of Dove chocolate bar buyers are female, while 70 per cent of Snickers bar buyers are male, and Nestlé prints the words “not for girls” on the Yorkie bars its sells in the UK – what is unusual about Fling is the overt nature of its gender bias.“This brand is taking it a step further,” says Rita Clifton, chairman of Interbrand, the brand consultancy. “It feels overtly female.”Some consultants are sceptical that Fling will work. “Consumers happily buy into brands that cleverly target them but if the brand image is too obviously transparently marketed, they can feel patronised,” says Don Williams, chief executive at Pi Global, a London-based brand consultancy .But Ms Clifton says Mars can succeed by tapping into online social networking sites that allow companies to target specific groups of consumers. “You can get a critical mass of people around a particular [brand] at very low cost,” she argues. “Providing you can sell enough of your brand at the right price, you’ve got a business model.”Mars is promoting Fling on websites, such as Facebook where the brand has more than 5,600 fans. Comments have included: “Had my first naughty fling in the office yesterday …YUMMY!”Other food companies also use the internet to approach women.PepsiCo, the snackfoods and soft drinks group whose brands include Lay’s crisps and Sun Chips, is taking a similar approach via two websites: www.awomansworld.com and twitter.com/awomansworld, the Twitter site (which has nearly 3,000 followers). The sites are used to pitch snackfoods like popcorn and vegetable crisps at women. “Snacks made just for you,” the womansworld website says.PepsiCo developed the online sites as part of a strategy to “better communicate” with women, says Becky Frankiewicz, vice-president of women’s portfolio marketing at Frito-Lay. “Consumer goods companies have long recognised the purchasing power of women in the household …but less so her purchasing power for herself,” she explains.Doug Anderson, senior vice-president of research and development at Nielsen, the US market research group, says these kind of gender-specific marketing strategies reflect the “overall decline” of the mass market, in part due to a drop in the number of households with children.He argues that consumer products will increasingly need to be targeted at niche markets of all kinds, including those differentiated by gender, age and ethnicity. “The consumer marketplace is more fragmented than ever – there’s clearly a risk in business – as usual,” he says.Andy Fennell, chief marketing officer at Diageo, the UK distiller, agrees that consumer goods companies can no longer blithely mass market their products.“Consumers have an expectation that you’ll get into some kind of dialogue,” he argues, adding that consumers now expect to be involved in the development of brands. He points out that while there are some 600 Face­book pages dedicated to Diageo’s Baileys liqueur brand, the company has initiated only one of them.Diageo has taken advantage of this changing dynamic by employing the rapper Sean Combs, who goes by the name of P. Diddy, as a “marketing partner” for its Ciroc vodka brand. Mr Combs is paid to help develop the brand, and he tweets about it at twitter.com/iamdiddy“.Thousands of people follow him,” says Mr Fennell. “Fundamentally, the way human beings interact with each other has shifted.”
647;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-07-01T20:26:38Z;US stocks start quarter on strong note;;"US stocks began the second half of the year on a positive note on Wednesday with shares in prominent food and drink manufacturers leading the market higher.General Mills, which makes Cheerios, reported better profits than expected, lifted by lower commodities prices and strong sales of new brands.The company also raised its forecast for earnings in 2010, and the shares picked up 3.9 per cent to $58.18.Constellation Brands, which owns several alcoholic drinks brands, including Robert Mondavi wines, kept costs sufficiently low to beat profit expectations in spite of falling revenues. Its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $13.61.A weaker dollar boosted shares in multi-national brands. Coca-Cola, which Credit Suisse had said could soon see double-digit earnings growth, picked up 2.5 per cent to $49.18, while rival Pepsiadvanced 2.8 per cent to $56.52.Elsewhere in the sector, Yum Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut and KFC, gained 5 per cent to $35.02 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares, saying its overseas businesses would probably exceed its target of 10 per cent growth in profits.Commodities stocks rallied strongly in the morning but fell back as the price of raw materials dropped during the day. Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold miner, finished 0.9 per cent higher at $50.57.The price of oil briefly rose above $71 a barrel, but then fell back in the afternoon. After a strong morning, Chevron closed 0.4 per cent higher at $66.52 while Exxon Mobil climbed 0.9 per cent to $70.56.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 0.4 per cent higher at 923.33 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 8,504.06 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.6 per cent to 1,845.72.Investors remained focused on commodities and the dollar rather than economic data released during the morning, including two early indications on job losses.The market initially took confidence from the Challenger jobs report, which said that companies announced 9 per cent fewer job cuts in June than the previous year, the first annual decline in planned cuts since February 2008.This was counterbalanced by data from ADP Employer Services, which said companies cut more jobs than expected in June.Investors also took a near 20 per cent fall in mortgage applications during last week in their stride.“People are starting to dismiss some of the negative data and focus on the positives,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.But with the more closely watched data on initial jobless claims and the official unemployment rate due out this morning, the markets slipped as investors became more cautious.“I was surprised by the reaction to the data this morning,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab. “But people have taken some of the gains off the table as we get closer to Thursday’s unemployment reports.”Pfizer gave up 0.7 per cent to $14.90 after the company said it would not continue a late stage trial of its cancer drug Sutent after disappointing results.But rival Biogen Idec climbed 3.6 per cent to $46.77 after it acquired the rights to market an experimental drug made by Acorda outside the US for a fee that could rise to $550m.An analyst at JPMorgan warned that the deal would make it less likely that Acorda would be taken over however, and its shares fell 14.9 per cent to $23.99.There was further concern for the hotel industry after Barclays said a recovery in lodging stocks would lag behind a broader recovery, and the bank downgraded shares in Choice Hotels.This came the day after Wachovia downgraded Starwood Hotels, saying similarly negative things about demand in the sector.Choice lost 2.3 per cent to $26.01. Starwood added to Tuesday’s losses, falling
4 per cent to $21.31.A second initial public offering in less than a week reinforced optimism about demand for new equity, as shares in LogMeIn, a newly listed software maker, rose 25.1 per cent to $20.02 on its first day of trade."
648;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Death sparks off web traffic jams;;Michael Jackson, who spent most of his life being crushed by a media scrum, came close to crushing some media outlets as news of his death started to emerge.The volume of people searching the internet to find news of Jackson’s death caused several sites to collapse temporarily: Twitter ground to a halt while Facebook also experienced problems.Twitter briefly disabled the search bar on the homepage when users swamped the service to discuss Mr Jackson’s death. Trenddr, which tracks social networks activity, reported Twitter users sending close to 130,000 posts per hour, slightly ahead of those related to the Iran elections on its first day.Nearly 50 of the top 100 Google trends was related to Mr Jackson’s death. A Google spokesman told the BBC that some Google News users experienced difficulty accessing search pages related to Mr Jackson between 2:40pm Pacific and 3:15pmNielsen, a research firm that measures internet traffic, said online discussions about Jackson far exceeded those of the recent swine flu scare and also surpassed the Obama inauguration.The sheer level of interest in Jackson’s passing was in keeping with his whole life. From an early age he was a media figure: as he grew older he became highly sought after by companies such as Pepsi, which paid him millions of dollars in return for his endorsement.The singer’s groundbreaking 1980s music videos propelled the fledgling MTV music channel to great heights, while his music and cross-over appeal to black and white audiences reinvigorated the recording industry, with Thriller being one of the best-selling albums released.In the past 15 years Jackson’s star appeal began to wane, brought low by tawdry allegations of child molestation. Although he was charged, a court cleared him of any wrongdoing, yet the damage to his career was immeasurable.Personal eccentricities and Jackson’s ever-changing appearance from repeated surgery made him an object of fascination.His death was front-page news round the world, yet it was online that the story gained the most traction.Websites left TV news channels scrambling to catch up. TMZ, the celebrity site that is part of Time Warner’s AOL group, was the first to report news of his death, while the Los Angeles Times reported that the singer had collapsed and been rushed to hospital.Additional reporting by Kenneth Li
649;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Permira sells its stake in Britvic;;Permira sold its 14 per cent stake in Britvic for about £81m on Wednesday, ending almost three years of frustration for the private equity group in its attempts to agree a buy-out deal with the soft-drinks maker.The market placement of Permira’s 30.2m Britvic shares, arranged by UBS, was agreed at an average price slightly above the 268p per share price at which the private equity group built up its stake in 2006.Permira said: “Our strategy is to make control investments and, as such, we have decided to sell our passive stake in Britvic. The company has performed well.”Shares in Britvic fell 4 per cent to 275p. The sale ends years of speculation that the maker of Tango fizzy drinks and Robinsons fruit squash – founded in the 19th century as the British Vitamin Products Company – could be the target of a private equity buy-out.Yet analysts welcomed the move. “While this may place pressure on the share price in the near term, we view the placing as a positive development,” said analysts at Cazenove. “Permira has long been seen as likely to dispose of its stake, with the overhang a cause of negative sentiment for the shares.”A big hurdle to acquiring Britvic is its close ties to Pepsico, the US drinks group, which holds a 5 per cent stake in the company. A large slice of Britvic’s revenues comes from Pepsi, for which it holds the exclusive UK bottling licence.Bankers think that Pepsi may one day acquire control of Britvic as part of a push to regain control of the Pepsi brand in Europe. The US drinks company recently offered $6bn (£3.7bn) to buy control of its two biggest bottlers.Britvic shares have risen by two thirds since October and passed the 300p mark for the first time in a year when it reported a 16 per cent rise in underlying profits last month as its cheaper brands won market share from more expensive products.Permira took the unusual step of building up a minority stake in Britvic via its Snowdon Acquisitions vehicle in December 2006 after being forced to say it was not planning a hostile bid.“At the time of the investment, we had a broader strategic plan, but the market has changed since then,” Permira said on Wednesday.When the credit crisis started in the summer of 2007, the Britvic stake turned from a springboard for a takeover bid into a fruitless use of investor money. Even as its biggest shareholder, the private equity group never sought a seat on Britvic’s board.Some observers said Permira may have bought its minority stake in anticipation of a bid from a rival private equity group, such as Blackstone, which owns the Orangina drinks maker, or PAI Partners, which owns United Biscuits.
650;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-05-20T16:54:14Z;Britvic sparkles as soft drinks outshine rivals;;Britvic’s traditional portfolio of soft drink brands appears to be winning back cash-strapped consumers, with the maker of Tango and Robinsons squash reporting a 16 per cent rise in underlying profits as more expensive brands fell out of favour.The shares rose 34¼p to close at 303p on Wednesday, their highest in nearly a year, after the company reported an unexpectedly big 70 basis point increase in British profit margins in the half-year to mid-April.UK sales of still and fizzy drinks rose strongly. Paul Moody, chief executive, said: “We are seeing consumers switch back into those core value categories.”In still drinks, Britvic’s sales volumes were up 6 per cent, while the overall market was down 6 per cent. In fizzy drinks, volumes rose 7.5 per cent against market growth of just 0.2 per cent.Mr Moody attributed Britvic’s performance to the value offered by its brands – a one litre bottle of Robinsons squash costs about 85p – and to the decision to extend existing brands rather than launch new ones.Recent brand extensions include a “Be Natural” version of Robinsons, which does not contain any artificial ingredients.Cola sales were also strong, with Pepsi increasing its share in a rising market.Ireland remained weak, with sales volumes down 4.8 per cent and operating profits flat. Britvic, which has recently started selling its drinks through hard discount chain Lidl in Ireland, blamed local economic woes.Including restructuring costs, pre-tax profits rose 1.4 per cent to £7.2m. Total sales were up 6.3 per cent to £483m. Earnings per share were unchanged at 2.3p. Britvic declared an interim dividend of 4.1p, up 8 per cent on last year.● FT CommentBritvic’s modernisation of its core soft drinks business – in recent years it has got rid of unnecessary flavourings and additives – has paid off. As consumers ditch pricey drinks such as bottled water and smoothies, they are returning to Britvic’s brands, which offer value for money. Ireland continues to weigh on group profits, but the company has proved it can deliver steady earnings growth. On a price/earnings ratio of 11.2 times 2009 earnings, Britvic still trades at about a 15 per cent discount to the European beverages sector and appears cheap.
651;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-05-18T10:19:03Z;Surfing sisters set off to work on a power breakfast;;Life was a beach for the Emery sisters from Hampshire. Younger sister Abigail, 33, studied oceanography at Southampton University and is a keen surfer. Fleur, 35, studied Spanish literature at UCL, worked in a German investment bank, as a nanny to a touring rock band and spent a year as a poker professional in London.In summer 2007 they launched Grasshopper Porridge, a company that makes small pots of instant porridge. It was an enterprise born out of necessity.Surfing is an energy-sapping activity and Abigail found her home-made version did just the job once she got out of the surf. Other surfers agreed and the business was born.The Emery sisters joke that they are “more Frank Spencer than Anita Roddick”, and while an endearing message that the media has so far lapped up, it has meant problems for the fledgling business. For example, the sisters designed and stuck on the labels themselves to the first run of 600 porridge pots, but they all promptly fell off. Back to the drawing board.Fleur spent a year researching the porridge market in the UK. A Mintel report told her it is worth £100m annually in the UK, and Grasshopper hopes to take a portion of that. However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate a market share, especially when the big brands, such as Quaker Oats, owned by PepsiCo, dominate.Fleur says the market is “big enough” for Grasshopper and that the people who buy Quaker Oats “aren’t our customers anyway”. So the business appears to be attempting to create a new market – a very challenging undertaking. For example, another company such as Quaker Oats could well launch a similar product. But Fleur says they cannot worry about things over which they have no control.Regardless of the inherent problems, the sisters ploughed on, but accessing capital proved difficult.They approached their bank manager who told them they were welcome to a cashpoint card but that was about it. “We didn’t know what we were doing,” admits Fleur, “so I understand why the bank refused.”In year one, the business had sales of £5,000, mainly via local delis and surf shops, but incurred a net loss of £30,000. In year two, both sisters gave up their jobs to concentrate on building the business and, while sales jumped to £25,000, losses amounted to £25,000.Now halfway through year three, sales have reached £40,000. Thanks to deals with Waitrose and airline Flybe, the Emerys hope they will reach sales of £125,000 by the end of the year.Fleur says the business is just breaking even. Its losses to date have been funded mainly, according to Fleur, “from savings, credit cards, an overdraft, selling everything we could on eBay and poker winnings”.The money went on product and packaging development, large volumes of porridge for market testing, getting the website right, and some £35,000 on the sisters’ salaries.Grasshopper had a big break when it got on to the shelves of Waitrose, but the flipside was that the supermarket suddenly constituted more than 90 per cent of its business.Fleur concedes the situation was not ideal, but adds they were in no position to turn it down. “What it means is that we have to suck up to them a lot,” laughs Fleur. “But it is stressful. On the other hand, they offered us a good deal, with helpful terms, and the people we deal with are nice.”The reality for most small brands attempting to break into the large retailers is harsh. Aside from the task of trying to speak to a potential supermarket buyer (in Grasshopper’s case it was a chance encounter on a Spanish beach that led to a meeting), getting on to shelves often means wafer-thin margins.The bottom line for retailers, however nice they come across, is sales.If your product is not selling, there is little room for sentiment. The supermarkets encourage costly in-store promotions but the supplier has to invest time and money in publicity or advertising to raise its profile.In early April, Grasshopper signed a deal with Flybe, reducing its dependence on Waitrose. Margins are set to increase from 25 per cent to 50 per cent as a result (the retail price for a single pot is £1.99).Yet even this new deal raises questions: is porridge the meal you want on an aircraft? Flybe thinks so, and the sisters hope so, but only time will tell.One hurdle the sisters have to overcome is the fact they are sisters. While it makes for a compelling PR story, it is obvious that they have their differences. They also have a different work ethic.Fleur says: “I’m keen to work. I’m an obsessive, a brainiac. I like to curl up with the financial forecasts.” Abigail says: “I like to have weekends off. I like surfing and going on holiday.”A clear separation of roles and responsibilities is crucial for Grasshopper and the sisters say they are finding the balance.With little competitive advantage and by attempting to create a new market for instant porridge in a pot, the sisters are taking a big gamble. Fleur will need her best poker face if she is going to pull it off.Jamie Oliver is a freelance writer
652;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;PepsiCo sues its largest bottler over bid;;PepsiCo, the soft drink and snack company, on Monday sued its largest bottler, Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), in an increasingly fractious struggle over PepsiCo’s unsolicited bid for both PBG and for its second-largest bottler, Pepsi Americas.PepsiCo is asking a Delaware court to overturn a “poison pill” rights issue defence recently adopted by PBG’s board, on the grounds that it was approved without the presence of two board members representing PepsiCo, which owns 34 per cent of the bottlers’ common stock but controls 40 per cent of its votes.The company said the suit “alleges that the defendants intentionally failed to provide notice of a recent PBG board meeting to John Compton and Cynthia Trudell, the PBG directors affiliated with PepsiCo.”The suit says PBG’s board ”chose simply not to provide notice to two of its 10 board members (and) convene a secret meeting” to respond to PepsiCo’s proposal, rather than calling a full board meeting, where Mr Compton and Ms Trudell could have recused themselves.The rights issue would take effect if PepsiCo expands its share in PBG without agreement with the bottler’s board.The suit before Delaware’s Court of Chancery also argues that the board was in breach of its fiduciary duties when it approved the poison pill, which PepsiCo argues “constitutes an unreasonable and disproportionate response” to its proposals.PBG said in response that the lawsuit was “entirely without merit” and had been filed “in an attempt to divert attention from its grossly inadequate proposal.”PepsiCo owns 33 per cent of PBG and 43 per cent of Pepsi Americas, and last month bid for the outstanding stakes in both, offering $29.50 per share for PBG and $23.27 per share for PAS. Both companies subsequently rejected the offer as inadequate.PBG sells more than a half of the Pepsi-Cola beverages sold in the United States and Canada, and handles about 40 per cent of its global drinks sales, with distribution agreements in Spain, Greece, Russia, Turkey and Mexico.The takeover bid is an important strategic objective for Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, who argues that controlling both PBG and Pepsi Americas will lower costs and enhance PepsiCo’s ability to offer its retailers combined distribution of drinks and its Frito-Lay snacks.PepsiCo’s main rival, Coca-Cola, has said it remains committed to the independent bottler model, which it says enhances the ability of its drinks brands to be responsive to local markets.
653;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-05-12T21:36:43Z;PepsiCo bottlers;;"Even the most determined child can hold its breath only for so long. Parents, after all, hold the purse strings. So what should investors make of the rejection by two PepsiCo bottlers of its offer to buy them out?Shares in Pepsi Bottling Group, for example, trade at a 12 per cent premium to the implied offer price as the market expects PepsiCo to return with a higher bid. Its grounds for rejecting the approach appear legitimate: PepsiCo sees $200m of cost-saving opportunity when most analysts believe at least $500m is possible. And the multiple, at seven times earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation, is below that typical for previous beverage deals.Meanwhile, PepsiCo, in spite of the apparent flip-flopping on strategy, needs to consolidate. The world is a different place since it spun out PBG a decade ago. Wal-Mart is now responsible for a fifth of carbonated drinks sales through retailers. Selling soft drinks has become more complex, with hundreds of product lines and tension with bottlers over sharing sales on non-carbonated beverages such as Gatorade. Furthermore, another of its bottlers – Anheuser- Busch Inbev – is now a larger beast than PepsiCo, a long-term threat to Pepsi’s control of its own destiny.The model of separation also offers little incentive for bottlers to innovate, or take risks, as the owner of the brand can simply extract higher returns through prices for concentrate. Yet the symbiotic relationship also means that the two bottlers’ shareholders cannot push back too hard on price. A poison pill at PBG stops PepsiCo increasing its 33 per cent stake without the approval of PBG’s board. But Pepsi is the only buyer in town and it sets prices on concentrate. Alienating the network of bottlers by squeezing PBG and Pepsi Americas would not be smart – but PepsiCo can afford to be patient.Pepsi Bottling Group last week rejected April’s takeover offer from PepsiCo, its largest shareholder, calling the proposed price per share “grossly inadequate”.Eric Foss, chief executive of PBG, argued in a letter to Indra Nooyi, head of PepsiCo, that the offer had been “opportunistically timed” before the bottler of PepsiCo drinks issued better-than-expected quarterly results.He also said it failed to account for possible synergies, and was “substantially below PBG’s intrinsic value, as well as the value that would be implied by comparable transactions”.PepsiCo’s bid was linked to a simultaneous offer for remaining shares in Pepsi Americas, its second-largest bottler.The rejection was widely expected by Wall Street.Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at Consumer Edge Research, said in a note to clients that Pepsi Americas was expected to follow PBG in rejecting the initial offer, but that “we believe these transactions will get done”.PepsiCo owns 33 per cent of PBG and 43 per cent of Pepsi Americas.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

654;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-05-04T20:52:26Z;S&P tops 900 as investors return to banks;;US stocks surged on Monday, taking the benchmark S&P 500 above 900 points and into positive territory for the year, in a day dominated by rumour surrounding the government’s stress tests on banks.Citigroup and Bank of America are both believed to working on plans to raise $10bn of capital, while they, and at least two other lenders, are still contesting the government’s findings on the strength of their balance sheets. Bank of America denied that it was working on a $10bn plan.But banking stocks extended early rallies after Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the Obama administration, said banks would be expected to raise money needed to pass the tests privately rather than go to the government.With many analysts saying further government involvement would come with heavier regulation, investors took confidence from the news.Citigroup’s shares rose 7.7 per cent to $3.20, while Bank of America jumped 19.3 per cent to $10.38 and JPMorgan climbed 10.2 per cent to $35.79.Wells Fargo leapt 23.7 per cent to $24.25 after Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, called it a “fabulous” bank, even though Associated Press reported the government wanted it to boost its capital reserves.Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, said that if banks needed to raise capital to pass the government’s tests, it would be bad news for existing shareholders no matter how it is done.“People are living in a dream world right now,” he said. “Shareholders are going to be so diluted. There is no way I would buy American banks at this level.”The gains were extended by figures showing that sales of existing homes had risen unexpectedly in March, providing signs that the housing market could be nearing a bottom.The S&P rose 3.4 per cent to 907.24, the first time it has closed above 900 since early January, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.6 per cent to 8,426.74 points. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.6 per cent to 1,763.56 points.China’s manufacturing expanded in April for the first time in nine months, helping push up metals prices and shares in US metal producers.Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, rose 9.4 per cent to $48.64, while Alcoa gained 6.9 per cent to $10.36.This added to optimism from Sprint Nextel the mobile network operator. The group reported a surprise profit on Monday as cost-cutting efforts added to stronger-than-expected revenues, driven by customers joining its cheaper plans. The company’s shares rose 7.1 per cent to $5.General Motors advanced in the morning after Sergio Marchionne, Fiat chief executive, said he wanted to purchase GM’s European operations by the end of May to create a European supergroup. But its shares later drifted and closed flat for the session at $1.81.There was good news for retailers, as Barclays raised its price target on both JC Penneyand Target on which it also raised its earnings outlook for 2009 and 2010. JC Penney, which Barclays said should recover its margins on the back of lean inventories, gained 5.1 per cent to $32.59.Even though Target was downgraded by Bank of America, which said the group might struggle to keep sale numbers and prices at current levels, it managed to rise 1.3 per cent to $40.55.Pepsi Bottling Group rejected a bid of $29.50 a share from Pepsico to buy up the remaining shares in the group, calling it “grossly inadequate”.Pepsi fell 1.4 per cent to $49.10 on the news, but Pepsi Bottling Group per cent gained 0.3 per cent to $31.50.There was a mixed picture for technology. Adobe, the software maker, was downgraded by Citi and UBS, which both said the stock was unlikely to move higher after the recent rally. It fell 2.8 per cent to $26.69.Intel, the chipmaker, rose after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to “overweight” from “equal weight”, saying orders would improve. It rose 5.4 per cent to $16.66.“The rally is being overdone,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at thinkorswim.“If we continue higher, we will have to sell off before Thursday or the results of the stress test could work against us.”
655;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-05-04T18:34:11Z;PBG rejects PepsiCo takeover;;"Pepsi Bottling Group on Monday rejected last month’s takeover offer from PepsiCo, its largest shareholder, calling the proposed price per share “grossly inadequate”.Eric Foss, chief executive of PBG, argued in a letter to Indra Nooyi, head of PepsiCo, that the offer had been “opportunistically timed” before the bottler of PepsiCo drinks issued better-than-
expected quarterly results.He also said it failed to account for possible synergies, and was “substantially below PBG’s intrinsic value, as well as the value that would be implied by comparable transactions”.PepsiCo’s bid was linked to a simultaneous offer for remaining shares in Pepsi Americas, its second-largest bottler.The rejection was widely expected by Wall Street.Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at Consumer Edge Research, said in a note to clients
that Pepsi Americas was expected to follow PBG in rejecting the initial offer, but that “we believe these transactions will get done”.PepsiCo owns 33 per cent of PBG and 43 per cent of Pepsi Americas.It offered $14.75 plus 0.283 shares in PepsiCo for each PBG share, a price equivalent to $28.64 based on Monday’s close.When PepsiCo made the takeover bids last month it stated that the offers are cross-conditional, which means they must both be accepted to become effective.The unusual bidding structure makes for an interesting dynamic between the two bottlers, who must weigh up how much leverage they have – both separately and together – to push for a higher price.Now that PBG has rejected the bid and installed a “poison pill” anti-takeover device to keep PepsiCo from vacuuming up its shares, it appears to have rendered Pepsi America’s decision somewhat moot.A source close to the matter said that PBG has not communicated with either PepsiCo or with Pepsi Americas, but expected that the parties would eventually hold negotiations.Shares of both PBG and Pepsi Americas continued to trade well above the prices PepsiCo offered, which were set at a 17 per cent premium, indicating that shareholders expect both bids to be raised.Ms Nooyi has argued that taking direct control of the two bottlers will give PepsiCo greater flexibility and speed in presenting its increasingly diverse drinks brands to retailers, and in bundling drinks distribution with its Frito-Lay snack business, as well as producing savings.Coca-Cola, its larger rival, has said it remains committed to the model of having independently run bottling partners, which it argues strengthen its ability to respond to local retailers.Muhtar Kent, Coke’s chief executive, told analysts last month that the “spirit of collaboration with our bottlers not just here in North America but across the whole world has never been better”."
656;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-04-29T17:02:26Z;Almarai prospers on diet of dairy;;At what is claimed to be the world’s largest integrated dairy company, young men in white overalls hose down parlours while black-and-white Holstein cows stand patiently as milk is sucked from their udders.It is a process that is repeated almost non-stop throughout the day. Almarai churns out 674m litres of milk a year from a herd of some 55,000 cows that are spread across six farms and milked four times a day.The setting could not be further removed from the landscape of rolling green fields normally associated with dairy farming. These farms are in the midst of sprawling desert in the heart of Saudi Arabia. Outside temperatures can exceed 50°C in the summer and, rather than lush grass, the cows lie on sand.By means of high-tech equipment and a farming system modelled on dairy producers in California and Arizona – which includes mist coolers for the cows – Almarai has evolved into one of Saudi Arabia’s best known non-oil brands.It has averaged a 28 per cent compound annual growth over the past five years. While many companies in the region have delayed projects and expansion plans as they feel the pinch of the global economic crisis, Almarai intends to invest SR6bn ($1.6bn) on expansion and development in the next five years.It is also plans to move beyond its home market in the Gulf by forming a joint venture with PepsiCo that will set up entities to produce and sell dairy products and fruit juice in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.PepsiCo will hold a 52 per cent stake, Almarai 48 per cent, and the two companies will look to build the business through a combination of greenfield projects and acquisitions, says Georges Schorderet, chief financial officer at Almarai.“I still believe there is substantial growth in our existing market in the next two to three years. But if we want to secure long-term growth we need to expand outside the GCC [Gulf Co-operation Council] into new categories,” he says.“We have the know-how and technology we can utilise in other countries – capitalising on our key strengths. We are not going with a junior partner. PepsiCo is one of the leading food companies in the world.”Almarai’s target is to double turnover and profit by 2013, he says, and the company has been seeking acquisitions.In addition to the dairy farms, it manages production, packaging and a vast distribution network that delivers food and fresh dairy products (including yoghurt, cheeses, pastries and fruit juices) to 42,000 retailers throughout the six Gulf Arab states daily.Almarai recently bought a 75 per cent stake in Teeba, a Jordanian food and dairy company, and is in talks to acquire Beyti, an Egyptian dairy company, and Hail Agriculture Development Company, a Saudi poultry and animal feed company.Two years ago it acquired a bakery, and last month the company announced plans to invest SR650m to launch a baby food division, which it expects to be fully operational by 2011.“We used to be a dairy company, but we’ve become a food company,” Mr Schorderet says. “European companies worry about increasing growth from 2 to 3 per cent or cutting jobs, but our challenge here is to cope with double-digit growth and find the right 2,000 people to support our growth.’’But the pace of expansion has caused some investors to question if the ambitious company is spreading itself too thin.“The deal with PepsiCo looks good on paper, since the company may expand geographically and diversify into non-carbonated juices,’’ says Laurent-Patrick Gally, an analyst with Shuaa Capital.“Some investors are worried but we judge by results. Most risks are 18 months off or so, but we have not seen signs of an earnings miss so far.”Mr Schorderet says aggressive expansion has enabled the company to double its turnover twice in the past decade and the financing has been arranged for a five-year plan.Almarai’s net income increased by 36 per cent to SR910.3m in 2008, and it reported net income of SR197.4m in the first quarter of this year, a 22 per cent increase on the same period last year.Analysts attributed the group’s growth to increased market share, which stands at 46 per cent of the juice and dairy market in the GCC region, according to Almarai.It also benefits from the kingdom’s cheap energy costs and its subsidies for livestock feed. In spite of the economic slowdown in the region, officials say Almarai’s sales grew 18.5 per cent during the first quarter.The company was set up by Prince Sultan bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Kabeer in the late 1970s during the first oil boom, when the government began a drive to make the country, which is bereft of rivers and lakes, self-sufficient in certain crucial foods.Some analysts question whether large-scale farming is sustainable in the kingdom given its finite water resources. The government last year announced it would be phasing out wheat production by 2016 to protect the little water that is left.But Mr Schorderet says dairy farming is different because “you cannot import fresh milk from a distance”.
657;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-04-27T08:12:37Z;Mergers and acquisitions;;"For a moment, it was like old times. Last week began with a “merger Monday”: 10 deals, totalling $27bn, including Oracle’s purchase of Sun Microsystems, GlaxoSmithKline’s takeover of Stiefel Laboratories, and PepsiCo’s bid for its two biggest bottlers. Subsequent days seemed promising, too, with rumours of a bid by Diageo for two-thirds of Moët Hennessy and Fiat signalling interest not just in Chrysler but in General Motors’ European operations.Sadly, a few rosy headlines can mislead. Thomson Reuters’ tracking figures suggest that last week was, in fact, nothing special in terms of global mergers and acquisitions values and volumes. Though the week beginning March 29 was one of the strongest since September, activity subsequently dropped below the average for the first quarter of 2009. And M&A values in January-March were already down a third, year on year, to the lowest since 2004.Buyers who are unconvinced stability has returned to equity markets fear making an acquisition that subsequently appears way overvalued. Most see the recent equity rebound as a classic bear market rally. And, while getting debt financing for deals is a touch easier than it was a few months ago, it remains tough for all except solid investment-grade names with a compelling rationale. Sellers, meanwhile, wistfully compare multiples today with a year ago, reluctant to part with assets unless they absolutely have to.M&A is set to remain subdued except in two areas. One is sectors where valuations and cash flows look reasonably solid – notably pharmaceuticals, plus consumer goods and, possibly, resources. The other is in distressed assets, including financial services. In the hardest hit sectors, such as cars, potentially transformational deals may emerge for little outlay, partially financed by the state – as Fiat hopes to do. But, as certain banks have discovered, just because assets are cheap and come with government “encouragement”, that does not make them less risky.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

658;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-04-26T19:23:45Z;Twittering executives reveal too much;;"A few days ago, Adam Brown, the head of digital communications at Coca-Cola, got his car washed and the sun shone down on him in Atlanta. Meanwhile, Bart Cas, his opposite number at Pepsi, went for a run on the Brooklyn Bridge.I happen to know these details because last week I stumbled upon Exec Tweets, a collection of about 100 executives who like to express themselves in chunks of up to 140 characters on Twitter.Thus I have come to be a disciple of Bart and Adam, but I like Bart best. His latest tweet goes like this: “Worked late, woke up feeling tired but driven forward by the many exciting possibilities a new day brings – seize the day!” An earlier one says: “Or Got home – my son told me he loved me – my daughter was as precious as ever … suddenly the wind was at my back again … ”In The New York Times last week Maureen Dowd made fans of Twitter very cross by suggesting that this craze, which has now afflicted 10m people, is a waste of time.She may be right for most of us, but for business people, I don’t agree. I think it is potentially the best communication tool there is; the trouble is that most executives are making a complete hash of using it. Either they fill it with mundane personal detail, or they fill it with mundane professional detail – which is possibly worse. The first scores higher on embarrassment; the second on tedium.Jeffrey Hayzlett, chief marketing officer of Kodak, is a tireless twitterer who reports hour by hour on just how he is spending his day at work. Here is a typical tweet: “Now meeting with the Kodak marketing team for lunch to talk about general items and get to meet the team.” To meet the team in order to meet the team doesn’t seem like something that the 3,453 people who follow him will really need to know.An even more tiresome category of businessman uses Twitter to boast. Sir Richard Branson is a leader here. “Honoured my blog has been nominated for a prestigious Webby Award for business blog. Check it out,” he says in a recent post.Despite the dismal use to which executives are putting Twitter, more and more are signing up for fear of being left behind. Last week I met a British business leader who told me that he had just joined, but complained that he was now so focused on turning the details of his day into pithy tweets that he was finding it hard to pay attention to what he was doing. Worse, once he had composed his Tweet he felt insecure and unpopular as only three people seemed to be following him.Last Wednesday I signed up, too. As I couldn’t find any good executives to follow, I decided to take in the Budget on Twitter through the Treasury feed. Alistair Darling turns out to be quite unpopular, too. While Ashton Kutcher, husband of Demi Moore, is the first to have 1m followers on the strength of posting pictures of his wife in his knickers, the chancellor of the exchequer had only 1,800 takers for his plans for the British economy.Yet his tweets last week were perfect – short, clear and informative. They made me think that if the Budget can be done on Twitter, it must be possible to do all corporate communications the same way, and put e-mail in the dustbin forever. To force everyone to say what they have to say in 140 characters deals with the communications overload at a stroke. Not only would messages be quicker to read and easier to understand, most would not get sent at all. The bulk of internal e-mails are exercises in back-covering or throat-clearing, and so if they were forced down to their barest essentials it would become clear that there was nothing there at all.To communicate this way – either on Twitter or on Yammer, which is a similar service aimed at companies – would have another advantage. It would make clear who are the really powerful people in a company. Humble employees who happen to have good ideas could easily have more followers than the chief executive.Still more revealing would be the ratio of followers to followed, as it tells you whether people are not just talking but also listening. On this score, I’m afraid to say, my new friend Bart falls down. He is only following nine people.Over-deliveryAs well as taking in the Budget on Twitter, I downloaded the full statement, which was rather more heavy going. However, it did allow me to calculate an important – and worrying – new statistic. By comparing the 2009 statement to the 2008 one, I can exclusively reveal that there has been a sharp increase in the use of jargon.In 2008 there were 123 mentions of the verb “to deliver”. This year the tally had soared to 212. Much “value” is being delivered and any number of things are being “delivered against target”. Indeed, there were three mentions of “over-delivery”. There was also a 330 per cent increasing in the meaningless phrase “best practice” and a 130 per cent increase in “roll-out” – which is excusable only when pastry or carpets are at stake.“Stakeholders”, “overarching”, “benchmarking” and “strategic” – all words recently banned by local authorities – were more in evidence this year than last.The only bad word that has fallen from fashion is sustainable, down from 111 last year to just 42. Sustainability turned out not to be so sustainable after all.lucy.kellaway@ft.comRead and post comments atwww.ft.com/kellaway"
659;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-04-21T17:51:55Z;Coke sees potential deals in downturn;;Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drinks company, on Tuesday said it saw more opportunities for acquisitions in the economic downturn, following its recent $44m investment in the UK’s Innocent organic juice brand.Gary Fayard, chief financial officer, said the company’s board would discuss on Thursday whether to renew a share repurchase programme that was suspended ahead of Coke’s unsuccessful $2.4bn bid for China’s Huiyuan juice. But he said the company’s primary focus would be on potential deals.“We knew it was a great brand,” he said of Innocent, in which Coke took a minority stake this month.“Eighteen months ago we called on them, and they wouldn’t even talk to us, and today we are a strategic investor alongside Innocent management. So there are going to be opportunities,” he said. Muhtar Kent, chief executive, said Coke’s “principle focus is to grow our top line effectively in every environment: hard or good.”Coke said robust international demand helped offset the impact of the economic slowdown on sales in North America during its first quarter. Overall worldwide unit case volume increased 2 per cent, below its long- term target for annual volume growth of 3 to 4 per cent.A 3 per cent increase in international sales by volume, supported by double- digit growth in China and India, helped offset a 2 per cent decline in volume in North America, where Coke is also facing a broad consumer shift away from its core carbonated soft drinks.Mr Kent expressed satisfaction with the results, saying Coke had gained market share in many of its international markets, and exceeded its long-term profit targets. The company said it had also gained market share in North America for the fifth consecutive quarter, despite the volume decline “primarily reflecting the continuing difficult macroeconomic environment”.During the quarter it launched a new US and global marketing campaign, and introduced lower-priced 99 cent drink bottles.North American volume sales to restaurants and other locations increased by 3 per cent, and Mr Kent said he believed sales at fast food restaurants appeared to have been boosted by consumers’ discretionary spending as a result of the petrol price fall.The company reported net profits of $1.35bn, or 58 cents per share, down from net profit of $1.5bn, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier.Mr Kent expressed confidence to analysts that Coke’s North America business would improve, and was upbeat on the company’s relationship with its US bottlers, following PepsiCo’s announcement on Monday that it is taking back control of its main US bottlers.
660;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;M&A springs back to life;;"The market for mergers and acquisitions sprang back to life on Monday when 10 deals totalling more than $27bn were announced, with over half of their total value paid in cash.After months of deal inactivity, Oracle agreed to buy Sun Microsystems for $7.4bn; GlaxoSmithKline paid $3.6bn for Stiefel Laboratories; and PepsiCo offered $6bn in cash and stock to buy out investors in its two biggest bottlers. Bankers said the deals signalled improving business confidence and market conditions for transactions, but cautioned that there was still a long way to go before the market could reach the levels of activity seen in the recent debt boom.William Vereker, co-head of investment banking at Nomura, said: “Companies are taking advantage of an improvement in markets to execute on strategic transactions which have been in the pipeline. But confidence is still fragile and much will depend on how markets behave over the coming months before M&A volumes increase meaningfully.”Others said it was encouraging to see deals being struck across several industry sectors. That contrasts with the first quarter, which was dominated by the pharmaceuticals industry– one of the few that is relatively stable and has strong cash flows. Pharmaceutical companies have also been forced to consolidate as they come under threat from patent expiries and generic rivals.However, the value and volume of worldwide deals remain well below the levels seen during the recent M&A and debt boom. In the year to date, worldwide M&A is down a third from last year to $659.5bn. In the same period in 2007, global deals reached $1,424.3bn – the highest year-to-date total on record, according to Dealogic.Wilhelm Schulz, co-head of European M&A at Citigroup, said: “Historically, M&A activity levels have been closely correlated to the state of the equity markets. While the recent equity capital market strength has certainly built board confidence and thereby contributed to increased M&A activity levels, structural barriers such as availability of credit, volatility levels and macro­economic uncertainty remain.”Although companies are using cash to do deals, acquirers with strong credit ratings and cash flows, and which can demonstrate industrial rationale for a deal, are also managing to convince banks to lend.Other companies are turning to the public bond markets as an alternative to costly short-term bank debt by tapping the bond market for long-dated, non-amortising debt. Roche, for example, financed its hostile offer for the 51 per cent of Genentech it did not own with cash, commercial paper, bonds and bank loans.“This is further evidence of the trend of selective big-ticket M&A as strategic consolidators take advantage of the lower market valuations to strengthen their own business with synergistic deals,” Philip Noblet, a managing director in Bank of America/Merrill Lynch’s M&A group, said.The deals did not excite equity markets, which fell on fears of economic weakness and troubled loans at Bank of America."
661;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Pepsi bottles it;;"The Grand Old Duke of York might recognise PepsiCo’s strategy. The group said on Monday it wanted to “strategically transform” its North American beverage business by buying its two largest bottlers – Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas – for $6bn in cash and shares. Such a deal, however, would merely reverse the effect of Pepsi spinning out its bottling operations in a 1999 initial public offering of PBG.Such see-sawing is a familiar sight in the soft drinks business. The industry has never quite made up its mind about the relationship between making and marketing drinks, and bottling and distributing them. Since listing Coca-Cola Enterprises in 1986, Coca-Cola has tended to keep its bottlers at arm’s length, via minority stakes, in the belief this encourages entrepreneurship from its bottlers. Pepsi, by contrast, spent much of the 1990s buying up its bottlers, then selling majority stakes into public markets; the Coca-Cola model.The Dr Pepper Snapple group has, meanwhile, gone in the opposite direction, taking full ownership of its largest bottling partner in 2006.In part, the latest move from Pepsi simply reflects changing management trends. Outsourcing is all very well in terms of keeping the balance sheet “light” but, in troubled times, companies still have a contingent responsibility to these same off-balance sheet operations. Folding in the two bottlers is a recognition of their interdependence on Pepsi, and should allow the group to find $200m of annual cost savings, with a net present value of some $1.5bn.The strategic shift does little, though, to address a problem that has remained largely constant since the late 1990s – after decades of growth, US consumers are switching from the sweet fizzy stuff to other, healthier beverages. Decisiveness is always welcome from management. But Pepsi’s investors should ponder the strategic merits of marching up and down the same side of a hill.PepsiCo, the soft drinks group, on Monday offered about $6bn to buy the shares it does not already own in its two largest bottlers, Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas.The US company’s plan to consolidate its bottling business would give it control of 80 per cent of its North America beverage distribution volume.The move comes as PepsiCo targets some $1.2bn in cost savings over the next three years to be reinvested in its beverages business. Although the company’s US foods business is producing strong sales and profits, its US soft drinks business is struggling. In the first quarter, sales volumes were down 6 per cent and operating profits down 10 per cent as sales of fizzy drinks and sports drinks declined.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

662;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-04-20T20:46:03Z;Wall Street falls despite strong earnings;;Banks gave US stocks their worst day since the recent rally began in spite of better than expected results from Bank of America.The bank made strong earnings but the shares plunged 24.3 per cent to $8.02 as the company warned about “extremely difficult challenges”, especially from deteriorating credit quality.Other banks also struggled after The New York Times reported that the Obama administration was considering converting loans made to big banks into common stock, thereby putting money into them without having to ask Congress.Investors were nervous about the idea, which some called “back-door nationalisation”, and Citigroup fell 19.5 per cent to $2.94 while Wells Fargo dropped 16.1 per cent to $17. Citigroup was also hampered by bearish analysis from Goldman Sachs, which said credit losses at the banking giant were growing at a “rapid rate”. Capital One, the credit card company, was one of the sector’s biggest fallers after Goldman Sachs cut the company from “buy” to “neutral”. Its shares lost 25 per cent to $13.38.A report in the FT that banks would be able to return bail-out money only if it was in the economic interest also hurt the sector.“Investors were disappointed that paying back Tarp (troubled asset relief programme) money looked further away, and then the news on deteriorating credit from BofA tipped them over the edge,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 4.3 per cent lower at 832.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.6 per cent to 7,841.73 points and the Nasdaq Composite index gave up 3.9 per cent to 1,608.21 points.But on the busiest day yet of the earnings season, a piece of acquisition news was the biggest surprise.Oracle, the software company, said it had offered $9.50 a share to buy its rival Sun Microsystems, which had been involved in take­over talks with IBM.Sun’s shares jumped 36.8 per cent to $9.15, while Oracle lost 1.3 per cent to $18.82.Shares of IBM fell as investors moved to anticipate the company’s results, due out after the close.The stock, which has risen more than 20 per cent since the market hit a low in March, dropped 0.8 per cent to $100.43.The takeover offer failed to spark a rally, even as several companies reported better first-quarter results than expected.Drug company Eli Lilly reported earnings that were better than both the same period last year and estimates for this period, but its shares lost 2.3 per cent to $32.99 as investors worried about weaker sales of its brand-name drugs.Halliburton, the energy conglomerate, also beat expectations, although with falling revenues and profits, and its stock gained 0.1 per cent to $18.79 after falling during the morning’s trade.PepsiCo was another company to fall in spite of reporting better results than anticipated. The company announced it was to offer about $6bn to buy the shares it does not already own in its two largest bottlers. This outweighed rising earnings, and its shares lost 4.4 per cent to $49.86. Shares in Pepsi Bottling Group rose 21.9 per cent to $30.73.Hasbro, the toymaker, was one of the few companies whose results did not beat expectations on Monday morning, with low consumer spending during the Christmas season hurting sales. The shares gave up 2.7 per cent to $27.16 after rallying on Friday following better profit margins than expected from its rival Mattel.Steel makers suffered after Bloomberg quoted a company official at Arcelor Mittal, the world’s biggest steel company, as saying it may halve the size of a planned plant in India and indefinitely defer a second facility amid low demand for cars and homes. As metals prices declined during the day, US Steel lost 11.3 per cent to $26.58 and AK Steel dropped 14.2 per cent to $10.25.Lennar, the homebuilder, was one of the heaviest fallers on the S&P after the company said it planned to sell up to $275m in common stock for possible use as working capital and to repay debt. Its shares lost 18.6 per cent to $7.60.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, said: “The majority of the bad news is behind us, but we had a nice run up and a lot of people are now covering their positions.”
663;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;PureCircle profits jump 73%;;PureCircle, the Malaysian sweetener company that has signed deals with PepsiCo and Cargill, has lifted interim pre-tax profits 73 per cent to $2m.Since being recognised in December as safe for general use by the US Food and Drug Administration, seven products containing the company’s sweeteners have been launched on the US market.Revenues for the six months to December 31 rose from $14.5m to $21.6m. The company is now sourcing leaves of the stevia plant, from which the sweetener known as Reb A is extracted, in eight countries. Refined production of Reb A rose to 95 tonnes, compared with the 115 tonnes produced in the whole of the 2007-08 year.The company expects to double the annual capacity of its refinery in Malaysia to 2,000 tonnes by the end of this year. It said the use of the sweetener by major brands was a prelude to “a global market taking off”. It had a two- to three-year lead over the competition, and was “scaling up to meet the expected significant increase in demand.”Basic earnings per share rose from 94 cents to $1.55. There is no interim dividend, but the situation will be reviewed in the light of funding requirements. The shares, priced at 170p for the flotation on Aim in December 2007, closed up 2p at 164½p.
664;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-02-14T00:40:15Z;A few highs – but a lot of mountains still to climb...;;"Happy Valentine’s Day David Rubenstein – you summed up Davos for me. The co-founder of Carlyle, a large American private equity group, said that while he had heard plenty of theories during the World Economic Forum annual meeting about why the world was in this economic and financial mess, he’d heard almost none suggesting how to go about fixing it.The sombre mood at Davos was tempered, however, by the pleasure of seeing some of the people whose company I really enjoy. One of these was Sarah Brown, whose personal advocacy for the fifth Millennium Development Goal – the reduction of maternal mortality – was evident in her speech at the Important Dinner for Women given by Wendi Murdoch and Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo. On this occasion, at least, we were not only told what the problem was – 500,000 women die in childbirth each year, and no progress has been made in reducing this since the goals were laid down in 2000 – but we were each given a card setting out six suggestions of how to help, and were asked by Elisabeth Murdoch to commit to at least one of them:1 Visit to a key Millennium Development Goal country to see what needs to be done;2 Ask for a meeting with a key politician on the issue;3 Set up an initiative at work to encourage your colleagues to do something to help;4 Use Mother’s Day to communicate how we can improve the health of mothers around the world and the importance of mothers to the future prosperity of us all;5 Contribute financially to the campaign;6 Develop your own idea of how you can make a difference on this crucial subject.A problem and some suggested solutions. Mr Rubenstein would have approved, but of course he was not at the dinner, as it was for women only – although Rupert Murdoch did appear at the end to help us with our coats.My other Valentine’s pin-ups are the four speakers at the Credit Suisse lunch I attended. Duncan Niederauer of the New York Stock Exchange, who pointed out that (unlike some other exchanges) his had stayed open every day throughout the crisis last September, and that he was sick of being asked by the media if it was going to close. The other three were Steve Schwarzman from Blackstone (forthright as ever); Jes Staley from JP Morgan; and the star of the show, Eric Mindich of Eton Park Capital Management, once Goldman Sachs’ youngest ever partner.So, plenty of gloom at Davos, but here are 10 of the less serious revelations from the snow this year:1 Adair Turner, chair of the Financial Services Authority and the government’s climate change tsar, can dance;2 Robin Buchanan, the president of London Business School, can ski – but not as well as Reuters’ Tom Glocer and his wife, Maarit;3 Tammy Haddad from Newsweek and I make a formidable team. Yes, Richard Branson, that’s how you came to be interviewed on Tammycam;4 HRH the Duke of York had the most impressively shined shoes at the WEF;5 Being photographed with Sarah Brown, Wendi Murdoch and Naomi Campbell is not a good idea if you already have self-esteem issues;6 Anshu Jain, the head of Deutsche Bank’s global markets division, lives up to his billing. And his wife is incredibly attractive;7 Friede Springer, the widow of German media tycoon Axel Springer and deputy chair of his newspaper company, is very good company and uncommonly knowledgeable about Finland;8 The shuttle from Klosters to Davos is a great place to meet people;9 Swiss trains are cheap, efficient and even used by Kofi Annan;10 Next year I want to meet David Rubenstein.mrsmoneypenny@ft.com"
665;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-02-02T20:12:17Z;Danone ends foray into cosmetics;;Danone has abandoned its brief foray into the cosmetics business less than two years after it released a skin-enhancing yoghurt, acknowledging that consumers were no longer prepared to spend money on non-essential products.Danone said it would withdraw the yoghurt, named “Essensis”, from France in March because sales were suffering due to the global economic crisis, and it would focus on its core brands rather than experiment with new products. “Our focus will be on our blockbuster products,” Danone said.The withdrawal could signal the end of the so-called “functional foods” movement of the past few years in which staid food companies experimented with unusual kinds of products, including flavour and vitamin-enhanced waters.Danone, which made its name selling pro-biotic yoghurts, brought out Essensis in early 2007, claiming it would “nourish” the skin of anyone who ate it. At the time, the product was seen as an early step into the field of nutritional cosmetics.Other food companies also expanded away from their core businesses. US company PepsiCo, under pressure to diversify away from sugary soft drinks into healthier ones, snapped up seemingly buoyant brands such as the UK’s PJ Smoothies. Meanwhile, Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate that sells margarines and ice cream, brought a Latin American soy and fruit juice drink, Adez, to the UK.But like Essensis, both PJ Smoothie and Adez have been axed as consumers return to more traditional brands, such as UK group Britvic’s Robinson fruit squashes.Although the overall market for packaged food in Europe is still growing, consumers have also been ditching non-essential products such as bottled water, drinking yoghurts and chewing gum.In the four weeks to January 4, sales of drinking yoghurt in Europe’s top five markets – France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK – fell 9 per cent, according to data from Bernstein Research. Meanwhile, sales of gum dropped 7 per cent, and bottled water was down 4 per cent.For companies that specialise in mass market brands, such as the UK’s Cadbury, the downtrading in consumer tastes is good news. Cadbury’s sales were up 1.3 per cent in the four-week period to early January, driven by chocolate sales.But for companies that focused on more upmarket products, such as Danone, the change in economic climate is worrying.“When the consumer’s wallet tightens, they question relatively marginal benefits,” says Martin Deboo, food analyst at Investec.Analysts estimate that the profit margins on Danone’s pro-biotic yoghurts are about 20 per cent, almost double the profit margins on their regular yoghurts of about 12 per cent.Unlike its peers such as Nestlé, Danone does not have a broad range of products to provide customers with cheap alternatives as they trade down, although it has started making moves towards mass market brands, experimenting with cheaper kinds of yoghurts in a line it calls “Eco Pack”.Analysts say that while Danone has pitched the move as a short-term reaction to falling sales, it could herald more long-term changes at the company.
666;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Super Bowl advertisers toe Obama line;;Advertisers in Sunday’s Super Bowl game are trying to embrace Barack Obama’s message of self-restraint, even as they spend $100,000 a second for commercials in the biggest US televised event of the year.Nearly 100m Americans are expected to watch the annual ritual marking the end of the American football season. Viewers – from Detroit assembly line workers to Wall Street investment bankers – have been tackled, beaten and bruised by the global economic crisis since last year’s game but they have also watched history made as the US elected its first black president on a platform of hope and ­responsibility.“These difficult times call for honesty and simplicity,” said Katie Bayne, chief marketing officer for Coca-Cola North America. PepsiCo and Coke are both running campaigns embracing “optimistic” and “positive” messages, which Pepsi has deliberately tied in to Mr Obama’s inauguration.Andrew Swinand, president of Starcom MediaVest, said the tone of his clients’ messages had changed since the recession bit. “I see the end of an age of excess and the beginning of an age of simplicity,” he said. “You no longer want the biggest car on the street. Messages of hope and messages of value are more ­relevant.”Audi, which last year touted its $114,000 R8 sports car, has bought a 60-second spot to advertise the A6 saloon car that costs about half the price.Advertisers including Monster.com, Anheuser-Busch and General Electric are paying broadcaster NBC 11 per cent more than last year, or $3m per 30 seconds, to appear in the only show whose commercials are as heavily scrutinised as the action itself. Detroit carmakers have dropped out and FedEx is not returning, but DreamWorks Animation and PepsiCo plan to make a splash with 60-second 3D spots that require the use of special glasses.Getting the tone right is key, marketers say. To the freshly unemployed, lavish marketing spending could come over as distasteful, especially for advertisers such as CareerBuilder.com, a website for jobseekers, which announced 300 job cuts last month.“When you’re cutting salaries and laying people off, it’s hard to explain why you’re buying a Super Bowl spot,” said Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University. Richard Castellini, chief marketing officer at CareerBuilder, said: “It is the one time a year when you truly meet a mass audience …and they go to the office the next day and say: ‘Hey, did you see that commercial?’”Scott Keogh, Audi of America’s head of marketing, noted that last year Audi car dealers reported a surge of interest from buyers after its Super Bowl advert.“The dealers right now are at the front lines of the credit issues and they asked us almost immediately after the Super Bowl if we were returning.”One staple of Super Bowl marketing, humour, is making a comeback.“Last year, I think we really tried to shake people up and get them out of a funk,” Mr Castellini said. “This year we’re doing it in a lighter tone …People don’t want to go to a Super Bowl and have depressing overtones. They still want to have fun.”Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall
667;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-01-29T13:44:19Z;Dimon urges US leaders to solve crisis;;Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, on Thursday appealed to the American leadership to “just get on with” devising a workable programme to address the global financial crisis, as business leaders at Davos expressed growing unease about the impact of the turmoil on global growth.Mr Dimon also urged political and financial leaders alike to face up to the depth of the crisis, and acknowledge their mistakes, so that they could move forward.“Politicians are playing catch as catch can. I haven’t yet seen people get all the right people into the room and close the door and put a solution up on the wall,” he declared to Davos delegates, triggering a rare outburst of spontaneous applause. “This stuff is getting old! I just wish they would get on with it!”Mr Dimon’s comments echo a widespread mood of frustration in Davos about the inability of the American leadership to deliver a tangible plan to contain the problems, during the recent period of political transition.This year’s meeting has been dominated by debate about the search for a financial solutions. And in meetings on Thursday business leaders outside the financial sphere also expressed frustration at the degree to which the overall corporate world was being tainted by the activities of bankers.“There are two streets – 90 per cent of Main Street businesses have got great value and are working just fine. It’s the other street is not,” observed Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo.There was also rising concern about the degree to which the financial woes could affect non-Western countries, as bankers pulled back from overseas markets to repair their own balance sheets. Stephen Green, group chairman of HSBC, said: “One lesson we must not learn is that we can turn the clock back (in finance). If we do the casualties will be emerging markets which depend on international capital movements.”However, Mr Dimon stressed that it was unfair to claim that all banks were slashing their lending. “We made $150bn of new loans in the last 180 days, and $50bn of that was in the interbank market. That is real loans, consumer loans, credit card loans, that kind of stuff,” he said, arguing that JPMorgan Chase “will be fine … we have got plenty of capital.”
668;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-01-13T21:44:36Z;Brands jostle to jump on US inaugural wagon;;It is meant to be the inauguration of a president, but it is turning into an adman’s dream.When Barack Obama takes the US presidential oath on January 20, he will draw vast audiences normally associated with American football’s biggest event, the Super Bowl. Viewers should prepare for a commercial onslaught.From the New York Times newspaper to the African-American broadcast network BET, which has ignored past inaugurations, media outlets are all tapping into an event once seen as formulaic viewing. Television channels have announced marathon schedules usually rolled out only on election days.“Other than the Super Bowl, this will be one of the few events in 2009 that will generate audiences in the tens of millions,” said Frank Cooper III, vice-president of portfolio brands for PepsiCo’s drinks arm.Pepsi, which once styled itself the choice of a new generation and used celebrities such as Britney Spears for Super Bowl commercials, is using the inauguration to unleash its “Pepsi optimism project” campaign.Obama-esque slogans such as “hope” and “yes you can”, and a redesigned red, white and blue logo that bears a strong resemblance to the Obama campaign image will be plastered across buses and train stations in Washington DC. Pepsi, which is sponsoring a symposium featuring film director Spike Lee, was tapping into “a cultural movement”, said Mr Cooper.Ikea has erected an Oval Office in Washington’s Union Station featuring “fiscally responsible furnishings” under the message that “change begins at home”.News networks, encouraged by the large audiences for last year’s election debates, are boasting up to 21 hours of continuous live coverage, while MTV will broadcast the new president’s “youth inaugural ball”.With the swearing-in taking place when most viewers are at their desks, broadcasters are making similar efforts online. CNN.com is working with Facebook to encourage users to swap comments on the inauguration, and CBS.com will feature input from “citizen journalists”.Quaker Oats is supplying oatmeal to 11 bloggers’ parties to promote its “start with substance” campaign to feed 1m poor families. “Next week is an interesting time for us to be able to inspire consumers,” said Shelley Haus, marketing director for Quaker’s breakfast portfolio.
669;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-01-11T21:07:40Z;High hopes fundamental indexing will make it big;;Few institutional managers in Asia seem unhappy that 2008 is over. Volatility hit unprecedented levels, and overall, shares in the region lost two-fifths in value. A new year gives a great opportunity to reflect on what they could have done better, and what new investment ideas may be around.Fundamental or wealth-weighted indexing has been one of the “next big things” for a few years now. How are such strategies catching on in Asia, which is one of the main growth markets for pensions and other forms of retirement saving?“At least one client has started using them in the last 12 months,” says Naomi Denning, head of investment consulting in Asia Pacific for Watson Wyatt, based in Hong Kong. “It’s something we as an organisation have been talking to clients about.“This approach allows funds with limited governance resources to improve their investment structures without too much effort.”Critics say traditional investing benchmarks are flawed. They are built around market capitalisation – the bigger the company’s market value, the more weight it has in an index.But, say detractors, such indices are prone to bubbles. Index-tracking investors have to buy more of the bigger stocks, just because the companies have greater weights in the index. A feedback loop therefore drives up the price, increasing capitalisation and creating more demand for the stocks once their weighting in the index is increased.Enter Global Wealth Allocation of the UK and Research Affiliates of the US. They are two of the main proponents for producing indices that ignore market capitalisation.Like Pepsi and Coke, they do not really like to be compared to each other, even though to outsiders they may seem to be broadly similar in their techniques: the weightings in their benchmarks are based on fundamental measures favoured by value investors.GWA takes existing indices and reweights them according to companies’ ability to create wealth, by looking at net profits, cash earnings and book value.The RA Fundamental Indexation (RAFI) indices choose companies based on the size of their economic footprint, by considering book value, cash flow, sales and dividends. GWA and RA say their methodologies produce better and less volatile returns than strategies based on conventional methods, and the index provider FTSE (half owned by the Financial Times) has produced a series of GWA and RAFI benchmarks.“Generally they have been living up to their promises,” says Ms Denning. “Having said that, our global investment committee was less positive from a timing perspective in the middle of last year, relative to broader indices.” She says the indices had underperformed by about 3 per cent in the last nine months of 2008.“Market cap remains the most popular benchmark, but we do agree that market capitalisation has some in-built flaws and can be improved upon.“I wouldn’t say they [clients] have shown more interest because of the crisis. They are worried about all issues. Trying to look at new ideas is not necessarily on their agenda.”Asian markets have quirks that may not make them so suitable for GWA and RAFI-based benchmarking. “The perception is Asian markets are less efficient,” says Ms Denning. “Some managers do outperform, as there are a lot of non-benchmark stocks [in Asia] that they can hold.“In some respects, it has more appeal in markets where people perceive it is difficult to add value – the client I have [who uses wealth weighting] has built it into the US portfolio.”Stuart Leckie, an investment actuary at Stirling Finance, a Hong Kong-based pension consultant, and a senior adviser to FTSE, thinks wealth weighting and fundamental indexing may catch on in the region. “It’s one of those things that should happen and will happen,” he says. “It just hasn’t got here yet.”There are barriers. Exchange traded fund companies like PowerShares and Lyxor, for example, offer retail products based on RAFI and GWA methodologies. Pension funds in the region might struggle to find a provider who would meet more specialised needs. “I think they would be creating it rather than taking it off the shelf,” says Mr Leckie.Fundamental and wealth-weighted indexing has gained a foothold in Japan. Australia is another market where the techniques seem to be taking root. State Street Global Advisors, for example, launched a wealth-weighted strategy in October 2006 with A$340m of seed mandates.“There are a number of institutional investors who have had put their money where their mouths are,” says Jonathan Shead, SSgA product engineer in Sydney.“We are seeing clients who like the idea and want to use it for long-term core holdings.”
670;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2009-01-03T00:13:49Z;Health minister warns on food regulation;;The food industry could face new regulation if a three-year anti-obesity campaign fails to improve the nation’s health, Ben Bradshaw, health minister, said on Friday.Ministers are working with food companies to try to improve the lifestyle of the nation and health officials insisted co-operation was good.Mr Bradshaw told the BBC: “We have already made progress on things like labelling and fat and salt content working with the industry. But if this three-year campaign does not succeed, we don’t rule out regulating in future.”Ministers have preferred in the past to work with food companies rather than legislating. Mr Bradshaw said the government had decided to work with food manufacturers and supermarkets rather than imposing legally binding nutrition rules.The government banned the advertising of junk foods during children’s television programmes in April 2007 but has resisted calls to extend the restrictions.Health lobby groups say the obesity crisis is fuelled by food companies who put too much salt, fat and sugar in their products and have criticised their involvement in the campaign.The government on Saturday launches its Change4Life campaign with television, magazine and billboard adverts urging people to adopt a healthier lifestyle.The action is being taken after forecasters said obesity was rising so fast that by 2050 four out of 10 children and nine of 10 adults would be overweight or obese.A coalition of 35 food, supermarket, fitness and advertising companies are contributing sponsorship worth £200m ($290m) to the campaign, on which the government is spending £75m.Dawn Primarolo, the public health minister, said the aim was “a lifestyle revolution” on a scale “no government has attempted before”.Planned schemes include PepsiCo UK running advert-s promoting active play, supermarket Asda promoting the cycling event Bike4Life and Unilever supporting the Change4Life campaign through its Flora sponsorship of the London Marathon.“The industry is willing to give £200m to the campaign as a way of deflecting the government’s interest in regulation,” said Tam Fry, National Obesity Forum board member.
671;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;TV ads kick off campaign to tackle obesity;;One of the more ambitious attempts to change a nation’s lifestyle is launched on Friday with the start of a three-year campaign between government, the food and fitness industries and charities to tackle the rising tide of obesity.The campaign, which is branded “Change4Life”, kicks off with £8m worth of television advertisements that will feed into a wide range of initiatives to get people eating better and exercising more. Some of the initiatives will be supported by the very businesses whose products contribute most to the problem when over-consumed.Planned activities include PepsiCo running ads promoting healthy play for children, Unilever branding the London marathon “Change4Life”, the fitness industry offering temporary free access to health clubs later in the year under a “MoreActive4Life” banner, supermarkets such as the Co-op and Tesco promoting healthier eating, and Asda launching a “Bike4Life” campaign to promote cycling to families.The health department has a £75m budget over three years for a campaign which will generate more than £200m of supportive activity from industry, according to “Business4Life”, a coalition of food, drink, retail and fitness providers formed by the Advertising Association.Dawn Primarolo, the public health minister, said the aim was “a lifestyle revolution” on a scale “no government has attempted before” in the face of projections that 90 per cent of today’s children would become overweight adults.The health department, she said, had tried to learn from campaigns such as Make Poverty History and Comic Relief by bringing in a wide range of partners to spread a message intended to encourage people to change their behaviour rather than lecture them on what to do and what to eat.The government advertisements are backed by a website, a telephone help-line and advisers whom the department says can put callers in touch with more than 45,000 contacts from local council and fitness centres, to cookery clubs and after-school and sporting activities. The big cancer and heart disease charities will also support the campaign in their advertising.Tam Fry, a spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said it hoped the campaign would succeed where others had failed.Business4Life said the partnership with government would be “a strong force for good”. The private sector’s vast expertise in advertising, marketing and media could amplify government messages “many of which are often shared with industry”, a spokesman said.
672;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Dollar shops are at heart of consumer sentiment;;Rick Dreiling has had a good year since taking over in January as chief executive officer of Dollar General, the 8,000 store, hard-discount variety chain.Amid the pervasive gloom, Dollar General reported a comparable sales increase of 10.2 per cent in its third quarter – more than three times the 3 per cent growth reported by Wal-Mart, the largest US discounter.“We’re seeing pretty consistent growth in every region we are in …we are seeing really, really solid performance everywhere”, Mr Dreiling told investors last month. “We are seeing new customers and old customers coming in more often.”Dollar General, taken private by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2007 in a $7.3bn deal traces its roots back to 1939. Its stores stock packaged foods, health and beauty items, toys and household items with an average price of about $10. The product mix, 25 per cent of which sells for less than a dollar, includes its own private-label brands and leading national names such as Tide, Pepsi and Crest.With sales of more than $9bn annually, it leads the rapidly transforming US extreme discount sector.Family Dollar, Dollar General’s closest rival, has annual sales of about $7bn from more than 6,600 similarly sized and similarly focused local stores and reported a 2.1 per cent increase in comparable sales for its third quarter.Dollar Tree, the smallest member of the national dollar store trinity, takes an even more extreme approach to pricing, selling everything at its stores for less than a dollar. It delivered a 6.2 per cent increase in comparable sales in its last quarter.All three retailers were already expanding their food selection before the economy worsened over the summer, introducing freezers into their stores to sell milk and eggs, products that drive customer traffic. Dollar Tree has also moved into frozen food, selling products such as Hormel sausages and Green Giant frozen vegetables for a dollar a packet.Bob Sasser, chief executive, told investors this month that Dollar Tree had found itself “squarely in the bull’s eye of consumer sentiment”.Dollar General and Family Dollar reported strong increases in sales of consumables such as packaged foods and toothpaste, which were up 13 per cent at Family Dollar, and 16.6 per cent at Dollar General.Mr Dreiling at Dollar General argues that its strong performance in the downturn is also strengthening its ability to negotiate promotional deals with the leading consumer packaged good companies.
673;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Cadbury to sell Australian drinks arm;;Cadbury has agreed to sell its Australian soft drinks business to Asahi Breweries, a Japanese group, for £550m ($809m), ending its near 40-year interest in beverages.The price exceeded analysts’ estimates of the value of the business, which Cadbury put up for sale this month.However, Coca-Cola has the right under an agreement made with Cadbury in 1999 to buy the business. It has until the end of March to at least match Asahi’s offer, although analysts thought this unlikely. If Coca-Cola decides not to bid, Cadbury said it expected the sale to Asahi would be completed by the end of April.Cadbury merged with Schweppes in 1969, but is now returning to focus on its confectionery businesses and is retaining its sweets activities in Australia.It sold its European soft drinks businesses in 2005 for £1.2bn, and in May this year demerged its North American beverages business under the Dr Pepper Snapple name as it came under pressure from Nelson Peltz, the activitist investor, to improve investor returns. It dropped Schweppes from its own name.Cadbury said the cash could be used to repay much of a €600m ($845m) bond that matures in June next year. It has no other bonds due to mature until 2013.UBS was the adviser to Cadbury on the deal, while Rothschild and Nomura advised Asahi.The Australian business, the country’s second-largest non-alcoholic drinks maker, is still called Schweppes and also owns brands such as Cottee’s, Solo and Spring Valley. It supplies Pepsi, Sunkist and Gatorade under franchise agreements and has 1,500 employees.Asahi’s foray into the Australian market is the latest step in its plans to expand outside Japan where sales of its core beer products have been in long-term decline.Japanese food and beverage companies have been keen to expand into neighbouring markets because of the effects of the country’s shrinking and ageing population on domestic consumption.Beer sales have been declining since they peaked in 1996, both as a result of the declining population and an increase in the popularity of other drinks, such as wine.In October, Danone sold its Frucor energy drink business to Suntory of Japan, while last month Lion Nathan, which is 46 per cent owned by Kirin, the Japanese brewer, bid A$7.7bn (US$5.3bn) for Coca-Cola Amatil, the Australian producer of Coca-Cola.On Friday, Nissin Foods said it would pay Y26.8bn ($295m) for a 33.5 per cent stake in Angleside, which owns the largest maker of instant noodles in Russia.Additional reporting by Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo
674;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-12-16T19:19:41Z;Fat tax, fat chance;;New Yorkers have reason to pause before they guzzle their next can of soft drink. Their choice of beverage may cost them a little extra. David Paterson, the New York state governor, is introducing an “obesity tax” on high-calorie soft drinks. Milk, fruit juices and bottled water will be exempt from the new 15 per cent tax, as well as “diet” versions of drinks such as Diet Coke. But regular Coke and Pepsi will get slugged.The move represents the latest attempt by the US authorities to buck an alarming trend of increasing obesity. Estimates place two-thirds of American adults as overweight, with a third clinically obese. An obesity crisis is looming, well, large. Supersized Americans are suffering from heart disease, diabetes and chronic disease at levels previously unseen, with the situation getting worse.Britons cannot look on with svelte self-satisfaction. Sixty-seven per cent of men and 56 per cent of women in England are overweight or obese. According to the Department of Health, obesity could cost the National Health Service in England £6.3bn by 2015 unless there is drastic action. The situation elsewhere in the UK is at least as bad. If anything, ongoing economic anxiety appears to feed the British appetite for calorie-laden comfort foods.With the country preoccupied by more immediate concerns, now may not seem the obvious time for raising the idea of a “fat tax”. Yet there should be some serious debate about how society should be meeting the costs and burdens of a heavier population. To be sure, those suffering from obesity as a group impose real and serious pressure on public services.A fat tax is not as radical as some may believe: we already impose “sin taxes” on alcohol and tobacco. Countries including France, Canada and Norway have applied higher rates of sales tax on junk food – although such taxes are invariably regressive. Other countries have pursued a more drastic course. This year Japan introduced clearly defined limits for both male and female waistlines. Companies and local governments that fail to meet fat targets face financial penalties, with the overweight being marched off to diet counselling sessions.Please rest assured: we are not advocating such draconian measures. But clearly there is a need for changed behaviour when it comes to eating choices and exercise. A modest, targeted tax on certain foods, with revenue invested in tackling child obesity, may yet see its day. If we do not cut our calorie intake, the risk is that the government will feel compelled to act. Notice has been served.
675;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-12-16T17:20:01Z;New York proposes soda tax;;New York state’s governor has proposed imposing an additional 18 per cent sales tax on sales of non-diet soft drinks, which his office says is expected to produce a 5 per cent fall in consumption.Laura Anglin, the state’s budget director, said on Tuesday that the move was part of efforts to create a “healthier New York,” and that the proceeds of the tax would be directed towards the state’s healthcare spending.The 18 per cent rate will target “fruit drinks that contain less than seventy per cent of natural fruit juice and non-dietetic soft drinks, sodas and beverages”.A summary of the budget document says that the move “it will discourage individuals, especially children and teenagers, from excessive consumption of these beverages”.The change is expected to produce $404m in revenues, out of the $3.1bn in extra revenue generating measures included in the budget.In setting out Governor David Paterson’s budget plans for 2009, Ms Anglin cited New York state’s growing obesity rates, with one out of four of the state’s residents now considered obese, up from 14 per cent in 1995.She also cited a Harvard Medical School study that asserted that each additional 12-ounce soft drink consumed per day increases risk of a child becoming obese by 60 per cent.The proposed tax, which must be approved by the state assembly, would be the first in the US to make a distinction between artificially-sweetened and sugared soft drinks. Numerous states have long established sales taxes on non-essential foods such as soft-drinks and snacks.The level of the proposed New York tax goes far beyond the levels imposed by other states on non-essential foods, none of which is higher than 7.5 per cent.The governor has proposed $7.2bn of spending cuts and raising $3.1bn from new or increased taxes and fees as New York faces what he called its worst budget crisis since the Great Depression.The American Beverage Association, which is representing the position of both Coca-Cola and Pepsico, has argued that rising obesity rates should not be seen as the responsibility of a single food category, but reflect wider factors such as changes in life-style.Pepsico’s global headquarters are based in New York state.
676;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-12-15T20:09:37Z;New York state plans soft drink ‘obesity tax’;;New York state could impose an “obesity tax” on high-calorie soft drinks such as non-diet versions of Coke and Pepsi as public concerns over obesity turn potentially fattening foods into a politically acceptable target for taxation.David Paterson, New York’s governor, is to include a proposed tax of around 15 per cent in a draft budget aimed at closing the state’s $13.3bn deficit.He is also expected to call for spending cuts, and for other revenue-raising measures including extra fees on sales of luxuries including furs and boats. Mr Paterson has said he will not raise state income tax.A number of US states have sales taxes on soft drinks, sweets and snacks, while most other foods are tax-exempt. But New York’s proposals would be the first to distinguish between “diet” and “non-diet” products. It would also double the existing 7.5 per cent sales tax, already one of the highest in the US, potentially raising over $400m.The proposal follows previous efforts by state legislators in New York and California to pass a “fat tax” on high calorie foods. It is expected to face opposition from both Coca-Cola and from Pepsico, which has its corporate headquarters in New York state.Sugared soft drinks have become a particular target for anti-obesity campaigners, with a 2005 study from the Center for Science in the Public Interest saying they are the single largest source of calories consumed by Americans.A review of 88 nutritional studies published last year in the American Journal of Public Health also found “clear associations” between the consumption of non-diet soft drinks and increased calorie intake and body weight.But a rival review of 12 studies published this year in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition said there was “virtually no association” between drinking sugary sodas and weight gain in children and adolescents.The American Beverage Association argues that lack of exercise, genetics and other factors need to be taken into consideration in considering the causes of rising obesity rates.Susan Neely, ABA president, said the idea of taxing a single category in response to obesity concerns was “misguided” and “ridiculous”.“We think this there will be strong opposition to this kind of tax, given the economic conditions,” she said.Margo Wootan, director of CSPI, said a modest tax on non-diet sodas was unlikely to have a significant impact on consumption levels. But she said it was “a reasonable way to raise money . . . It is totally a luxury item, an extra that people do not need to have in their diet”.Both Coke and Pepsi have responded to concerns over obesity by committing to voluntary guidelines that eliminate advertising and marketing of the sugary drinks to children under 12.Norway has experimented with imposing higher rates of sales tax on high-fat and high calorie foods. The UK saw an unsuccessful campaign last year by the British Soft Drinks Association which pushed for the sales tax on “healthier” fruit juices to be lowered from 17.5 per cent to 5 per cent.
677;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-12-07T22:51:05Z;US companies launch ethical standards push;;"Some of the largest companies in the US, including General Electric, Wal-Mart and PepsiCo, were expected on Monday to launch a drive to improve ethical standards in business in an attempt to stem the decline in corporate America’s public standing.The move by 17 companies, with nearly $1,000bn in sales, to commit to key principles of good business conduct comes as the financial crisis and recession are fuelling a political and public backlash against the corporate world.The huge problems faced by companies, such as banks and carmakers, that are run by highly paid executives have exacerbated anger among ordinary Americans who have seen their living standards deteriorate due to the economic slowdown.“In these challenging economic times, it is important that the public have confidence in all of business and not just select companies. We take this very seriously,” said Larry Thompson, PepsiCo’s general counsel and a former deputy US attorney-general.Under the agreement, from the Ethisphere Institute, companies will sign up to four principles of ethical behaviour: legal compliance, including not paying bribes; transparency; avoiding conflict of interests and increasing accountability.The organisers admit that the initiative, called the Business Ethics Leadership Alliance, is partly driven by companies’ desire to burnish ethical credentials and curry favour with Barack Obama’s Democratic administration.But although the principles are vague and most companies should be able to comply with them, the 17 signatories, which also include United Airlines, Dell and Accenture, have agreed to periodic examinations by independent auditors.The founding members have also pledged to try to get other companies to join.Gary Hill, chief ethics officer at Wal-Mart, said the retail group would encourage its huge supplier base to sign up to the principles.Mr Hill said that unethical behaviour was on the rise in corporate America, reversing a trend sparked by the regulatory clean-up that followed the Enron collapse.Some of the companies involved in the pact have faced their own ethical challenges. In 2006, Sempra Energy agreed to pay more than $377m to settle accusations that it manipulated natural gas prices during the 2001 California energy crisis. Sempra could not be reached. In 2005, Wal-Mart paid $11m to the Department of Justice to settle an investigation into the use of illegal immigrants by cleaning contractors at its US stores.Three employees of CACI International, the defence services company, were cited in a 2004 report by the Pentagon into the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.CACI could not be reached but said at the time: “Nothing in the…report can be construed as CACI employees directing, participating in or even observing” the abuses."
678;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-12-01T22:25:06Z;Pownce jumped on by Six Apart;;Pownce, a social media service that has failed to gain traction, is to close down this month after its team and technology were acquired by the blogging company Six Apart.Pownce caused an initial flurry of excitement among Web 2.0 aficionados when it launched in June 2007. It was given a certain cachet by Kevin Rose, who co-founded it and had already co-founded the popular Digg news site.As recently as August, Leah Culver, another co-founder, was featured on the cover of MIT’s Technology Review, which said Pownce was one of 10 web start-ups to watch.Six Apart said it would be merging the Pownce team with its Vox blogging service. The main Pownce website will close down on December 15.The service allowed private messaging among friends and file-sharing. It was compared to the micro-blogging service Twitter, but was harder to grasp than Twitter’s simpler 140-characters-or-less messaging concept.Om Malik, the well-known tech blogger, told The New York Times in July last year: “I love [Pownce] and use it constantly, I like it because it lets me share a lot of different things with the networks of people I really care about.”Yesterday, he blogged on GigaOm: “I used the service for a few months but then lost interest, and so did many of my friends.”It seems Pownce was just one service among many micro-blogging ones and lacked distinct features that could have helped it become mainstream, or even hold the attention of dedicated social networkers.Commenters on another service, Friendfeed, pointed out on Monday that Kevin Rose himself had spent more of his time on Twitter than his Pownce creation.“That’s like the CEO of Pepsi being seen drinking Coke, if you can’t stand behind your product, how do you expect us to?” said one.
679;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-11-26T00:56:59Z;Contenders jockey for New York Fed role;;"The jockeying to succeed Tim Geithner as head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is beginning as the bank’s board of directors prepares to create a search committee to select a candidate for the $398,200-a-year job.Potential candidates being discussed in Wall Street circles include Kevin Warsh, a Federal Reserve board governor; William Dudley, executive vice-president of the New York Fed’s markets group; and Terrence Checki, head of the New York Fed’s emerging markets and international affairs group.John Dugan, comptroller of the currency, is also being mentioned, along with past Fed officials including Peter Fisher, now a senior executive at asset manager BlackRock, and Roger Ferguson, head of asset manager TIAA-CREF.Mr Geithner, president-elect Barack Obama’s choice as Treasury secretary, has not yet formally resigned from the New York Fed. After he does, the bank’s board – which includes such prominent chief executives as Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo – will set up a search committee, which will draw up a list of candidates and make the final choice.It is also customary for the outgoing New York Fed president to have a say in his replacement. Another factor could be Stephen Friedman, chairman of the board of the New York Fed, who has ties to two of the possible contenders. Mr Dudley was formerly an economist at Goldman Sachs, where Mr Friedman was once chairman. When Mr Friedman served as a director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, Mr Warsh served as his deputy.The search comes as the Fed is expanding its balance sheet in response to the financial crisis, increasing the responsibilities of the New York Fed, which is now in charge of everything from Bear Stearns’ troubled assets to hundreds of billions of dollars of AIG’s credit default swaps. It has also become the counterparty and creditor of an increasing number of financial institutions.Mr Geithner will be a hard act to follow at the New York Fed, which occupies a fortress-like building near Wall Street. In the past, central bankers often had academic backgrounds. Today, arguably, the most important qualification is to understand how financial markets and monetary policy interact – a speciality of Mr Geithner’s.“The head of the New York Fed can’t listen to what the banks and the dealers want,” one senior official at the New York Fed said. “You can’t let yourself be captured by what maximises their profitability. You need to push policy goals instead.”For example, the New York Fed has been at the forefront in urging banks to introduce more transparency and better back-office procedures in the credit default swaps market. This has led to protests from dealers who prefer a more opaque and inefficient over-the-counter market because of the potential for greater profits.In recent years the ability of the Fed to dictate to the banks has become far more constrained. Indeed, long-time Fed officials grow nostalgic about how Mr Geithner’s predecessors, such as Gerald Corrigan, hauled bank heads into their offices, forcing them, for example, to eliminate their dividends when their institutions lacked capital.www.ft.com/usdailyview"
680;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-11-07T01:30:04Z;Novo Nordisk to invest in new Chinese factory;;Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceuticals company, is to invest $400m in a new factory for diabetes treatments in China, the latest multinational to commit to a large investment despite slowing Chinese growth.The plant, which will produce insulin-based treatments for China and other markets in Asia, will be the company’s biggest ever investment outside its home country.The announcement, to be made on Friday, follows the news earlier this week that PepsiCo is to invest $1bn in China over the next four years, as the soft drinks and food company bids to expand its distribution network and build a presence in faster-growing markets to make up for the expected downturn in the US.The decisions indicate that many multinationals remain confident about China’s medium-term growth prospects – especially consumer-facing sectors in areas that affect consumers – even as signs are growing that the economy is slowing much more quickly than previously expected.“For over a decade we have realised that the diabetes market in China would grow quickly and nothing in the recent financial crisis has really changed that,” said Lars Rebien Sorensen, chief executive of Novo Nordisk.China has continued to receive large volumes of foreign direct investment this year, in spite of slowing growth in many economies around the world and the tight conditions in credit markets.In the first nine months of the year, FDI in non-financial industries was $74.4bn, an increase of 40 per cent and almost equivalent to the total for the whole of 2007.However, the latest FDI figures do not reflect recent weeks when sentiment about the short-term outlook for the economy has shifted sharply in a negative direction.JPMorgan on Thursday said that Chinese growth in the second half of next year would fall to about 7 per cent – down from a growth rate of 12 per cent last year – due to a combination of weak export markets and a slowing local property market.Over the last month, executives in a range of industries have reported a sharp contraction in sales as the impact of the global financial crisis has started to be felt – impressions that were confirmed by two surveys of manufacturers this week that both showed sharp drops in activity.In order to stimulate growth, the government is expected to invest heavily in new infrastructure and in policies that will boost domestic demand, including expanding the public healthcare system.Novo Nordisk said the large investment in the Chinese market was underpinned by the fact that there were already 40m people with diabetes in the country, even though a relatively small number received proper treatment.

Other companies, including Unilever, Nestlé and PepsiCo, have remained optimistic about the outlook for emerging markets even as they deal with tougher markets in the US and Europe.Emmanuel Faber, Danone’s co-chief operating officer, said: “There will be a continued sluggish environment in the developed markets in 2009 …and some important developing countries will also go through significant growth difficulties.”Sales had slowed in Brazil, Russia and Mexico in recent weeks, Mr Faber said. “We are concerned …there are signs of bigger problems going forward.”In Mexico, people were buying food less often and going for cheaper options, he added, explaining that these changes in behaviour were linked to sharp falls in remittances sent home by Mexicans living in the US.The move came as the French company, which derives about 40 per cent of its sales from emerging markets, concluded a two-day investor conference in Paris.Analysts attending the conference said consumer confidence appeared to be faltering in some emerging markets, including Russia, as economies and currencies weakened.“Clearly the emerging markets are slowing down,” said Warren Ackerman, analyst at Dresdner, adding that Danone would find it hard to match this year’s like-for-like sales growth of 8-10 per cent because it could not keep raising prices.Danone has also been struggling with bottled water sales in developed markets, with sales volumes dropping between 10 and 20 per cent in the UK and France as people switch to tap water and supermarket own-label water brands.Meanwhile, analysts have expressed concerns over Danone’s relatively high levels of leverage following its €12.3bn purchase of Dutch baby food group Numico last year, which has left it with a net debt ratio of about four times earnings.Mr Faber said he was not worried about Danone’s liquidity.“We have more than €3bn of committed, unused bank facilities, which we can tap over time unconditionally.”Danone’s next significant debt repayment is at the end of 2010. It has €1.9bn of commercial paper exposure.Analysts are also worried that people will “trade down” from Danone’s yoghurts, bottled water and baby food to cheaper own-label products.Analysts at Goldman Sachs last week lowered their stock rating on the company to “sell” from “neutral”, warning that the global downturn would “hit Danone hard”. They also suggested that Danone’s attempts to make its own cheap products, such as the Eco-pack (six tubs of yoghurt for €1), was a mistake.“We believe Danone’s launch of Eco-packs into Western Europe is reactionary and defensive and likely to cannibalise existing volumes.”Danone’s shares, down 5.8 per cent in Paris on Thursday, have dropped 25 per cent over the past six months, but have out-performed the CAC 40. They are trading at their lowest levels for three years.
682;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-31T19:11:54Z;MGM junk bond sale comes at a high price;;MGM Mirage, the gaming company controlled by investor Kirk Kerkorian, has raised nearly $700m in the first US junk bond sale in more than a month.The sale shows the credit markets are slowly opening, but the high yield of 15 per cent that the casino operator had to pay and the quick drop in the price of the bonds in trading on Friday highlight the tough conditions that now exist for junk bonds. October is set to be the worst month ever for the asset class.“It is a little bit of a painful coupon, but it does show that we have the ability to access the capital markets and we felt that was important now,” said Daniel D’Arrigo, MGM’s chief financial officer. “No one knows what is in store for the credit markets going forward.”In October, huge aversion to risk and massive deleveraging in the financial system sent yields on junk bonds sharply higher. Risk premiums, or spreads to comparable Treasuries, rose as high as nearly 1,700 basis points this week, according to the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Master II index.At Thursday’s levels, junk bonds were posting a loss of 16.14 per cent for the month, a new record and nearly double the previous record month of September when junk bonds lost 8.3 per cent, according to data from Merrill Lynch. The losses come after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers sent shockwaves through the financial system and banks and hedge funds aggressively sold assets to raise cash for margin calls and redemptions. Default rates are also expected to peak some time in the next year.While a few well-known investment grade companies, such as IBM and PepsiCo, have been able to tap the corporate bond market in this environment, MGM is the first junk-rated issuer to sell bonds since September 24, according to Dealogic.“If [junk-rated companies] are motivated to raise cash, it can be done,” said Christopher Garman, head of Garman Research, which specialises in credit. “However, the terms are going to be very investor friendly.”MGM’s notes, which mature in five years, were sold at 93 cents on the dollar to yield 15 per cent, or 1,225 basis points over comparable Treasuries. The bonds are secured by MGM’s New York, New York casino on the Las Vegas Strip.Proceeds will help repay credit facilities, Mr D’Arrigo said, adding that the bond sale “provided added flexibility as we move through some challenging market conditions”.With the economic slowdown eating into gaming revenues and capital markets tight, MGM’s stock is down 86 per cent so far this year.The MGM deal is expected to be a benchmark for upcoming new issuance as long as risk premiums stay at current levels. The weak showing in trading, though, could deter investors on upcoming new issues.
683;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-27T01:10:24Z;School profile: WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management;;The quaint town of Vallendar, perched on the banks of the Rhine near Koblenz, is a surprising place to find a business powerhouse.Although founded less than 25 years ago, the WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management has emerged proudly from its sleepy surroundings to become one of Germany’s leading centres of business education.WHU’s reputation owes much to a world-class executive MBA programme, run in partnership with the Kellogg School of Management for the past 10 years. The two-year part-time EMBA aims to synthesise US and European management techniques.“The partnership model that Kellogg launched 10 years ago was unique then and still is,” says Bernadette Conraths, head of executive education.In addition to their studies in Germany, the approximately 50 students must spend two weeks on campus in Chicago and may also attend one of Kellogg’s other family of schools, including Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.Diversity and teamwork are hallmarks of the programme. Around half the participants hail from overseas, bringing with them a broad range of academic and professional experience.“We take great care choosing students for this programme,” says Klaus Brockhoff, professor of business politics and a former dean.” From our experience, a substantial part of the knowledge these people get comes from one another.”WHU’s small size and private funding give it a flexibility and ability to innovate that other more well-known academic institutions struggle to attain.A total student body of just 550 has helped foster a close-knit community of aspiring executives while an MBA class of just 24 students allows for particularly attentive tuition.David Beil, who worked for Pepsi in Florida before taking the MBA at WHU, says that the small study groups were a big motivation for students choosing the school: “It’s much more personal here.”WHU also stands apart from its peers through its commitment to academic research, a luxury often shunned by cost-conscious private-business schools, but which the school considers essential to its reputation.WHU’s 22 professors, 10 assistant professors and around 120 doctoral candidates claim to abide by a philosophy of “class, not mass”. There is, however, an emphasis on the practical relevance of research, through close cooperation with the corporate sector.Much of this has been made possible by a DM50m (€25m, $32m) endowment from Otto Beisheim, the founder of the Metro supermarket chain, whose net worth has been estimated at $5bn.Prof Brokoff describes his benefactor as the perfect donor. “People say that private donors trick universities into doing research into their area of interest. But the only thing he asks me is: ‘Are you still good?’”The Metro founder is by no means the only corporate partner attached to WHU. On the day the Financial Times visited, chocalatier Lindt was one of several companies offering advice at a careers fair to students. Many such links have developed into reciprocal partnerships and WHU designs programmes for companies including L’Oreal and Renault.The focal point of campus life is the Marienburg, a Baroque-era stately home that Goethe occasionally frequented before the building passed into the hands of the Catholic Church. Although the school is proud of its rich history, it has been careful to balance old with new, exemplified by a modern lecture centre christened the “Glass Box”.This emphasis on modernity is evident in the school’s ambitious expansion plans. By 2011, WHU hopes to have more than 800 students and about 30 professors, while the class size of the MBA programme is set to increase to 30 students to qualify for the Financial Times rankings.If any further evidence of the school’s calibre was required, a quick perusal of WHU’s high-achieving alumni might suffice.Perhaps the most well-known is Axel Wieandt, the newly-appointed chief executive of Hypo-Real Estate, whose near-collapse recently triggered a €50bn government bail-out. Mr Wieandt took a PhD at WHU and has been a visiting financial lecturer since 2002.Martin Fassnacht, associate dean, says the financial crisis had made WHU’s graduates more valuable to companies. “In difficult times, people want reliability and real ability.”
684;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Innocent ready to test new recipe for growth;;Just over three years ago, when Innocent was taking London by storm with its smoothies, Richard Reed – a man who left a career in advertising to make drinks out of fruit – was knocking back takeover approaches from people who wanted a share in one of Britain’s hippest small businesses.Today, as Innocent’s smoothies turn out to be one of the so-called “discretionary items” that people are cutting back on to save money, they are ready for a little financial help.“This year’s been good for us,” says Mr Reed, one of Innocent’s three founders. “It’s been a gold rush for the last few years.” For much of this decade, Innocent has not had to think too hard about how to make money. Quick to spot the shift in consumer tastes towards healthier kinds of foods, and clever enough to concoct a brand that made drinking smoothies seem stylish, the company’s annual sales quadrupled from £27m three years ago to £113m last year.However, this year, sales have been dropping and will finish the year at about £105m. Innocent is not the only victim of the smoothie decline – sales of its competitors, such as PepsiCo’s PJ Smoothies, have been dropping even faster.“Everyone’s had a pretty bad summer,” Mr Reed says.He is quick to refute suggestions that smoothies are a fad whose time is over. “Smoothies are definitely something that’s here to stay …I don’t think healthy eating is a fad.”But Mr Reed acknowledges it is time for Innocent to start diversifying. “Our job is to find other things that hit the sweet spot.”The company has already started making cheaper drinks, this year launching an Innocent orange juice brand.One-litre cartons of the orange juice sell for £1.89, compared with nearly £3 for its cartons of smoothies. “Oranges are cheaper than mangoes, passionfruits and blueberries.”It is also trying to bring the price of its smoothie cartons to below £2.50, in part by reducing packaging costs. “We’re going to make the average price cheaper over the next year or two on our core smoothies so we can get them into peoples’ weekly shopping trolley.”As well as ready-made vegetable meals such as Thai coconut curry and Tuscan bean stew, the group has put its “Innovation Nursery” to work on other kinds of food products, which it plans to release next year.In addition, it is devoting more money on advertising – doubling the £1.8m it spent last year – and expanding more slowly. It had planned to increase its staff to 350 from 250 at the end of last year but has stopped hiring this year at about the 280 mark.If Innocent is successful in raising £25m-£35m from a minority investor, it will use most of the money to sell more smoothies in continental Europe, which it argues is several years behind the UK in terms of market development.Total sales of smoothies in France have increased from £5m last year to £30m this year, says Adam Balon, another of Innocent’s founders.Innocent already sells smoothies in a dozen European countries and claims to be the market leader in Denmark, Switzerland, France and Austria.“These markets are small, they could be much bigger,” Mr Balon says, adding that the company also wants to eventually enter Spain, Italy and eastern Europe.Questioned about the wisdom of embarking on international expansion during the financial crisis, Mr Balon says: “The world’s not going to be terrible forever …we want to keep going.”
685;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-23T23:20:23Z;Coke bottler sees 10% sales fall;;Coke’s largest bottler on Thursday underlined the weakness of US consumer demand as it forecast a 10 per cent fall in sales volumes in the fourth quarter, while higher commodity and concentrate prices led it to cut its earnings guidance sharply.Coca Cola Enterprises bottles and distributes about 80 per cent of Coke’s products in the US and also controls the UK and other European markets.CCE said sales of its more profitable 20-ounce bottles of soft drinks and water in North America continued to decline in its third quarter, while it also faced continued high commodity costs.The economic pressures have heightened strategic tensions with Coke, which holds about 40 per cent of CCE’s shares, after the bottler increased prices in September in response to soaring commodity prices.Coke subsequently said it would impose a matching increase in the price of the concentrate it supplies to the bottler, and reduced its funding of CCE’s marketing activities by $35m.Coke this week removed Gary Fayard, its chief financial officer, from CCE’s board, replacing him with a retired company veteran, saying that there was a need to focus on his CFO role under Muhtar Kent, its new chief executive.John Brock, the bottler’s CEO, said the decision to increase prices was “absolutely essential”.“It would have been perhaps better if we could have figured out a way where we could have had an agreement with Coca-Cola where this concentrate price increase and/or the marketing funding played itself out in a different fashion,” Mr Brock said.Both Coke and its rival Pepsi-Cola are struggling with continuing declines in demand for traditional carbonated sodas that have been exacerbated as the economic slowdown has hit sales to restaurants and to convenience stores.CCE said it had cut some 1,000 jobs, or about 1.6 per cent of its North American workforce, in response to slower demand since September.PepsiCo said this month that it would eliminate 3,000 jobs in a cost-cutting drive.CCE’s shares fell over 18 per cent to $8.99 in midday trading on Thursday.CCE’S earnings were down 20 per cent at $214m or 44 cents per share, on a 6 per cent increase in revenues to $5.74bn.The company dropped the lower end of its 2008 earnings forecast by 15 cents to $1.25.
686;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Sarkozy reverts to type;;Thank you to Nicolas Sarkozy for providing such a dramatic and timely re-enforcement of my Tuesday column (see below). No sooner had I subtly insinuated that he was going crazy, then he took to the stage at the European Parliament and gave a speech calling for the creation of a European sovereign wealth fund. Its mission – it seems – would be to buy up strategic chunks of European industry.The global financial crisis seems to have liberated Sarkozy to give public voice to the kind of stuff that French politicians normally save for late-night drinking sessions - capitalism needs taming, the Americans are crazy, we can’t have the Asians buying up our businesses, why can’t the state subsidise more big industrial projects…etc, etc. It’s all coming out.So let me point to a few obvious objections to this sovereign wealth fund proposal. First, these kinds of funds are generally set up by petro-states that are rolling in cash – Abu Dhabi, Russia, Norway etc. I haven’t noticed that the public coffers of the European Union are overflowing with funds that we simply don’t know what to do with.Second, one of the things about SWFs is that most of them, have generally made sensible investments, for non-political purposes. Sarkozy seems to have something entirely different in mind: a fund that would be used to fend off unwelcome foreign investors, like that outrageous suggestion that Pepsico might buy Danone. Again, this seems a slightly dated concern. Give it a few months and we’ll be screaming for foreign investment.Finally, small European states will rightly fear that any investments by an EU fund will be directed towards those nations with the most political muscle. And that is a recipe for a breakdown in the European single market – which is absolutely the last thing we need, in response to a recession.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
688;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-17T20:44:04Z;Wall Street ends in red in volatile session;;A wild week for Wall Street stocks that saw their biggest gain since the Depression and worst sell-off since 1987 drew to a close with another highly volatile session that ended in the red.Relatively upbeat earnings and a further easing of strain in money markets failed in the end to outweigh a fresh batch of gloomy economic data and renewed concerns over the health of some financial institutions.The market swung between gains of as much as 4 per cent and losses that hit 2.9 per cent as last month’s options and futures expired.Big name financials including Metlife and State Street endured heavy losses towards Friday’s close and finished down 9.2 per cent at $31.14 and 9.6 per cent at $40.76 respectively.Housebuilders, home furnishers and real estate services were among the key losers on Friday from grim construction and building permit data. DR Horton, CB Richard Ellis and Leggett & Platt were among the biggest drags on the market, down 8.3 per cent at $6.77, 4.8 per cent at $6.32 and 12.3 per cent at $16.29, respectively.The S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent at 940.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,711.29 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4 per cent at 8,852.22 points.Yet the benchmark S&P still finished the week up 4.6 per cent – its biggest gain since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 – with the Nasdaq up 3.7 per cent and the Dow 4.7 per cent higher.In each session, an overwhelming number of trades took place in the final few minutes of trading, which traders put down in part to a wave of fund redemptions.Defensive names were among the favourites as investors dipped their toes back into the market after stocks’ worst weekly sell-off since the Depression. Wal-Mart gained 5.5 per cent over the week to $53.77. Healthcare topped the sectoral leaderboard, up 8.8 per cent. St Jude Medical, which gained 13.9 per cent to $37.03, helped sentiment with well received results.Financials climbed 5.8 per cent over the week, lifted by the fresh $250bn plan to shore up US banks. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – advanced 11.4 per cent to $23.24, 28.7 per cent to $114.30 and 5.5 per cent to $14.88 respectively.Amid plenty of third-quarter earnings, PepsiCo was one of the relatively small number of companies to undershoot analyst forecasts. The shares fell 6.8 per cent over the week to $53.88.Figures from Coca-Cola, up 6.5 per cent to $44.20 over the week, were better received. So too were those from Intel and Peabody Energy, which gained 2 per cent to $15.50 and 11.8 per cent to $32.03 over the week.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. However, it finished the week down 1.2 per cent at 69.45.Technology stocks were down after three companies in the sector reported better than expected results after the bell on Thursday.Google rose 5.5 per cent to $372.54 after the internet search group’s profits surpassed Wall Street forecasts. Eric Schmidt, chief executive, warned of “uncharted territory” due to the financial crisis. Advanced Micro Devices and IBM added 2.2 per cent to $4.21 and lost 0.8 per cent at $90.78 after both surprised Wall Street with third-quarter earnings ahead of expectations.Aerospace and defence stocks fell after Honeywell trimmed its guidance for the rest of the year. The diversified manufacturer, off 5 per cent to $29.37, did so even after it became the latest company to overshoot quarterly earnings forecasts.Caterpillar fell 7.2 per cent to $39.32 after Credit Suisse cut its price target from $66 to $46 while Potash eased 0.4 per cent to $74.43 after Citigroup cut its price target.
689;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Britvic ‘beacon of hope’;;Paul Moody, Britvic’s chief executive, claimed the maker of old-fashioned drinks such as Robinsons squash and Britvic mixers was a “glowing beacon of hope” in a gloomy world as the group’s annual sales rose 29 per cent to £926.5m.“Brands become more important in times of economic pressure,” Mr Moody said as the soft drinks group released a trading update for the year to the end of September ahead of preliminary results next month. “The [soft drinks] category is pretty resilient against economic slowdown.”Britvic shares, which have underperformed the FTSE 100 over the past year, jumped 12¼p to 184¼p after sales rose for still drinks such as water and fizzy drink brands such as Pepsi.Still drink revenues rose 4.8 per cent in Britain while fizzy drinks improved 4.1 per cent.In Ireland, which contributes about a fifth of operating profits, sales were also higher because of the strengthening of the euro against sterling, but underlying revenues dropped as the economy weakened.In the UK, Pepsi took a record share of the cola market (about 23 to 24 per cent) after Britvic heavily promoted Pepsi Max.Sales of Robinsons also improved after Britvic removed artificial colours and flavours from the squash and employed Tim Henman, the tennis player, to market the brand. Robinsons now has a 43 per cent share of the market.Gatorade has snagged 6 per cent of the sports energy drink market after being introduced into supermarkets four months ago.Comments about “glowing beacons” may be slightly over the top, but Britvic has attractions. Bottled water, where sales are dropping as people switch to tap water, accounts for less than 5 per cent of sales and Britvic’s ownership of squash and fruit juice brands and mixers mean it is not dependent on fizzy drinks. With the shares trading at 7.7 times 2008 earnings, a chunky discount to European peers, Britvic could be a tonic for suffering stock market investors.
690;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-15T21:24:28Z;US shares plummet again on recession fears;;US stocks plunged yet again on Wednesday on fresh concerns that the vast government intervention in the financial system may not be enough to stem the credit crisis.Fears also persisted that it had in any case come too late to prevent severe and long-lasting recession. Retailers Nordstrom, Macy’s and Bed, Bath & Beyond suffered some of the heaviest falls in the fall-out from grim retail sales data, down 12.4 per cent to $16.54, 17.5 per cent to $8.66 and 11 per cent to $23.89 respectively.In spite of better-than-exexpected corporate earnings in the sector, financials slumped 9 per cent overall.Citigroup and Morgan Stanley – which bounced 21.2 per cent and 16.5 respectively in the previous session – retreated 12.8 per cent to $16.23 and 16.3 per cent to $18.13 after Oppenheimer warned that the government’s bank rescue was not a “panacea’’ for all ills.The major indices opened lower and sold off sharply towards the close, a hallmark of recent slumps that traders put down, in part, to another wave of mutual fund redemptions. The S&P 500 closed down 9 per cent at 907.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 7.9 per cent down at 8,577.91 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 8.5 per cent lower at 1,628.33.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up 24.8 per cent to 68.78, a figure that indicates severe distress.The bloody retreat over the past two sessions erased virtually all of the gains from Monday, itself the biggest rise since the Depression.Energy and materials were the biggest laggards, down 15.5 and 12.1 per cent respectively, on mounting concerns of a global slowdown. US Steel sank 17.7 per cent to $38.82.“There can be no doubt now that the economy is in recession,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics. “It will be there a while.”Financials took scant comfort from JPMorgan Chase, which fell 5.5 per cent to $38.49, even after its earnings exceeded expectations. Wells Fargo which also did better than forecast, held on to gains for much of the session but closed down 0.5 per cent at $33.35.State Street, one of nine institutions in which the government will take an equity stake, sank 17.4 per cent to $46.83 after the group warned of unrealised off-balance sheet losses.Elsewhere, Coca-Cola was the only stock in the Dow to find positive territory, up 1.1 per cent to $44.21 after the soft drinks group’s quarterly profit compared favourably with a glum outlook from PepsiCo the previous day. PepsiCo lost a further 5.8 per cent to $51.25 after a 11.9 per cent slide in the previous session.Intel’s relatively well received results failed to boost Dell, which lost 10.65 per cent to $12.58.
691;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-15T14:40:01Z;Coca-Cola earnings top forecast;;Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drinks company, reported a 14 per cent in its third quarter earnings on Wednesday, as robust international growth again offset slowing US consumer demand.Coke reported earnings of $1.89bn, or 81 cents per diluted share, as revenues rose 9 per cent to $8.4bn.With one-off charges removed, Coke’s earnings per share rose 17 per cent - in a sharp contrast with the quarterly performance of its rival PepsiCo, which on Tuesday reported a 6 per cent increase in comparable core earnings per share.Muhtar Kent, Coke’s chief executive, said the company “once again demonstrated our ability to perform consistently…despite an incredibly challenging economic environment”.He said Coke’s “international operations, in particular the emerging markets, continue to drive our growth, more than offsetting the challenges that we are addressing in North America.”Like PepsiCo, Coke reported a continuing slide in demand in North America, where the soft drink category has declined, total case volume falling 2 per cent.Its North American sales volumes of carbonated drinks fell 2 per cent, but the company said its Coke brand drinks gained market share during the quarter, supported by its Olympic marketing campaign.Sales of still juices and bottled water in the North American market were flat, although it said it gained market share on the strong performances of its new Glacéau Vitamin Water drinks and Fuze juices and teas. That contrasted with PepsiCo’s performance in the Americas, which reported a 5 per cent fall in still beverage volume sales, including double-digit declines in its bottled water and enhanced Propel brand waters.Coca-Cola has been working to strengthen its US beverage business, and particularly its Coke brands over the past three years, and has been expanding its drinks portfolio to include newer juice and enhanced water brands such as Vitamin Water.Internationally, the company reported strong growth in emerging markets, with China, for instance, seeing sparkling volumes up 13 per cent, and still drink sales up 27 per cent.In Europe, volumes increased 3 per cent, while volumes in Russia fell 3 per cent, reflecting a cool summer and the impact of economic instability.In New York morning trading, Coke shares were up over 5 per cent at $46.21, pulling back losses that followed PepsiCo’s disappointing results on Tuesday.
692;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;The Short View: Anxiety in markets;;The Big Bounce to follow the Great Crash was inevitable. After indiscriminate selling and then buying, on Tuesday some discrimination returned. And the results were disquieting.The cost of insuring against default by the largest US banks has roughly halved since Friday. So the debt market views the US Treasury’s move to buy stakes in the biggest US banks as ending the risk of a general banking collapse.It is thus worrying that other markets did not respond positively. An early rally in European equities petered out, while US indices ended down. Economically sensitive sectors, such as industrials and tech, bore the brunt. Oil, another proxy for economic growth, fell.This happened in spite of the fact that both commodities and equities looked oversold after the huge falls. Traders could have bid them higher without showing much optimism. So the market remains convinced that a severe recession is almost upon us and took Monday’s bounce as a selling opportunity.Equity volatility, as measured by the Vix index, rose slightly, and remains at levels without precedent until this month. Yields on Treasury bills stayed at historically low levels. These showed that aversion to risk remained very high.What are the concerns? New casualties from this month’s events could yet emerge, particularly among hedge funds. High-yield corporate debt yields are so high that it is not worth small companies’ while to borrow. Emerging markets face high borrowing rates, and their currencies have fallen, moving almost exactly in line with equity volatility. And the corporate outlook is perilous as Pepsi, down 12 per cent after refusing to offer guidance on its 2009 earnings, made clear.Even if a banking collapse has been averted, the impact of the crash remains unclear. Recession seems guaranteed. So stocks had only a one-day bounce.john.authers@ft.comForum: Discuss John Authers’ Short View

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.8 per cent at 9,310.99The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3.5 per cent at 1,779.01. Intel slipped 6.3 per cent to $15.93 ahead of results that were due after the bell. Microsoft fell 5.5 per cent to $24.10 after Credit Suisse cut its forecasts and Google lost 4.8 per cent to $362.71 after Barclays cut its price target from $600 to $542.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 8.8 per cent to 59.81, which continued to indicate signs of severe distress.“You’d be delirious to say all of a sudden that this situation has been resolved,” said Joe Cusick, analyst at OptionsXpress, who added the reaction to the PepsiCo numbers showed traders were “starting to focus on the earnings and economic outlook.” A slew of other corporate results are due in coming days.Financials were the stand-out winners on Tuesday, up 6.4 per cent overall. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – surged 16.4 per cent to $26.53, 10.7 per cent to $122.90 and 18.2 per cent $18.62, respectively. There were also tentative signs on Tuesday that the paralysis in credit markets, which reached historic levels had begun to ease.Bucking the trend, JPMorgan Chase fell 3.1 per cent to $40.71, weighed down as Barclays cut its third-quarter earnings estimate ahead of results due today. Some analysts also said that the government plan may be of less benefit to the group, which has thus far appeared more resilient to the crisis than rivals.Regional banks boasted the biggest gains, up 14.3 per cent. The Treasury confirmed that it was also prepared to plough money into a wide range of lenders in addition to the nine institutions from whom it has secured participation. Keycorp and National City surged 54.3 per cent to $11.97 and 34.8 per cent to $3.10 respectively.Meanwhile, General Motors and Ford soared as much as 22.6 per cent and 24.3 per cent, respectively.The hard-hit car groups, subject to merger speculation, later retreated to stand 0.5 per cent higher at $6.54 and 2.5 per cent higher at $2.45. Concern over the likely success of a merger with each other, or Chrysler, offset hopes that the Treasury could purchase auto loans under the remit of its financial sector rescue plan.Most non-financial sectors posted declines. Technology, materials and industrials fell 3.9 per cent, 3 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively. Energy stocks struggled to find positive territory even as oil prices rose, down 0.1 per cent overallReal etstate investment trusts sustained heavy losses on concerns of a property slowdown. Simon Property Group and Vornado Realty Trust fell 8.5 per cent to $72.07 and 10.3 to $8.12, respectively.Elsewhere, Ingersoll-Rand fell 4.7 per cent to $22.20 after the manufacturer lowered its profit guidance for the year due to weak North America and Western Europe sales in September.Escaping the declines, Johnson & Johnson climbed 2.1 per cent to $64 on the back of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings.Maxim Integrated Products gained 1.8 per cent to $14.26 after the chipmaker unveiled plans for a $750m share buy-back. The group missed first-quarter earnings expectations.
694;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-14T19:58:48Z;London dividend income search favours oil majors;;Oil companies helped underpin the London market on Tuesday, which rallied for a second straight day.Dealers said income investors, set to lose their dividend payouts under the terms of the government bail-out, were switching into the energy sector from banks.BP jumped 6.8 per cent to 446¾p after Tony Hayward, chief executive, said that his main priority was to maintain dividends.In a series of upbeat meetings with brokers, Mr Hayward said he expected oil to hold above $75 a barrel on Chinese demand and because Saudi Arabia are the only source of incremental supply. He also emphasised that the dividend is pegged to earnings rather than the oil price.BP was on a prospective dividend yield of 7.6 per cent at last night’s close. The B shares of Royal Dutch Shell, up 4.6 per cent to £14.51, were yielding 5.8 per cent.Analysts said the cash looked secure providing oil stays above $50 a barrel.“The sector should be able to weather a period of lowerprices,” said UBS.“Even with limited access to debt markets, in combination with internal sources of funding (such as the release of working capital) we think dividends are robust and confirm valuations as attractive.”The FTSE 100 closed up 3.2 per cent to 4,394.21, gaining 137.31 points.The benchmark had been on course for its biggest two-day rally in two decades, peaking in mid-afternoon at 4,534.35 in reaction to the US’s injection of $250bn into its banking system.However, weak results from PepsiCo weighed on Wall Street and left the FTSE off session highs.Barclays was the day’s top performer, jumping 14.3 per cent to 246p as investors welcomed its independent approach to bolstering its capital ratios.The bank said on Monday it would raise £10bn without drawing on the Treasury’s scheme to underwrite share issues.”We believe that Barclays’ route of avoiding government capital will differentiate Barclays in the eyes of investors,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Helsby.“Firstly, it allows it to avoid the constraints of the preference capital on dividend policy and second it edges Barclays further toward the winners.”HBOS and Lloyds TSB were the sector laggards as yield investors sold.HBOS closed off 5.2 per cent to 85.3p, while Lloyds fell 6.6 per cent to 151.3p. That priced HBOS at a 7.3 per cent discount to Lloyds’ revised all-share offer.Royal Bank of Scotland also closed in negative territory after a volatile session, down 1.1 per cent to 65p.RBS had earlier rallied sharply to above its rights issue price, raising the prospect that the government may not have to take up its full allocation of the bank’s £37bn cash call.Elsewhere among the gainers, tour operator Tui Travel rose 11 per cent to 257¾p after 51 per cent shareholder Tui said it was considering a bid for the rest of the company. Arbitrage trading helped Carnival rally 5.4 per cent to £15.54.Dealers said the cruise operator’s UK stock had been trading at an unprecedented 18 per cent discount to its US listing, compared with a historic spread of about 2 per cent.Invensys was up 5.6 per cent to 182p after Goldman Sachs added the engineer to its ”conviction buy” list.The investment bank said the company’s financial position – £200m net cash, no debt and a pension fund weighted towards Treasuries – was secure in a protracted downturn, and reckoned the rail business would be defensive.Goldman also turned positive on Bodycote, which was off 3 per cent to 148¼p. Still in the capital goods sector, Morgan Crucible was up 10.5 per cent to 118 ¼p helped higher by vague speculation about a bid.Two years ago, Morgan Crucible rejected bids from peer SGL Carbon and Credit Suisse’s buy-out division which were said to be in excess of 300p per share.The ceramics manufacturer has since sold its pension schemes, removing a poison pill to any deal.JKX Oil was the top performer on the FTSE 250, gaining 31.9 per cent to 233½p on bargain hunting and after the son of chief executive Paul Davies bought 1,000 shares.
695;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-14T19:03:47Z;Consumer goods;;Brewing a cup of poppy tea is one way to deal with a headache brought on by crashing stock prices and is in tune with the more thrifty times. But when in pain, most consumers tend to ignore cost and reach for a familiar branded remedy. Hence one reason to look toward the medical end of the consumer goods spectrum. Johnson & Johnson and PepsiCo both reported third-quarter numbers on Tuesday morning, but while the former was typically reliable, the maker of snacks and soft drinks saw its share price plunge.The now familiar problem is that competition for parched throats does not just come from peers. Free refreshment is on tap in most parts of the developed world and it comes without the environmental or health nags that attach to many packaged, sugary products. North American beverages saw volumes drop by 4 per cent, versus last year, and there are signs that weakness is spreading. Last week Pepsi Bottling reported tough conditions in Europe, with Russia and Spain, facing their respective challenges, being particularly weak.PepsiCo did announce plans for a $1.2bn productivity programme, but the move again highlights the difficulty that food companies have in raising returns. More than 3,000 jobs are to go, but there was a striking absence of raised guidance for profits. The focus instead is very much on using the savings in the attempt to restore growth to North American Beverages – moving costs around, rather than cutting them out.That has been captured to an extent by the market. Down 10 per cent at times on Tuesday, PepsiCo now trades at valuation levels barely seen since the 1980s, at around 14 times 2009 earnings. For the same price investors can pick up J&J, offering a business balanced across consumer healthcare, drug development and growth in medical devices. It seems less likely to induce a sharp, stabbing pain.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
696;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;PepsiCo to cut 3,300 jobs in cost measure;;PepsiCo, the US soft drinks and food company, on Tuesday announced a $1.2bn cost cutting drive with the loss of 3,300 jobs, amid growing uncertainties over the outlook for global consumer demand.The job cuts represent just 1.7 per cent of the group’s global workforce, but reflect a symbolically significant retrenchment by one of America’s best-run companies in response to the gathering macroeconomic gloom.The company also declined to give earnings guidance for its coming 2009 financial year, underlining the impact of the current turmoil in global markets on business planning.Indra Nooyi, chief executive, said PepsiCo was “facing challenges that are really out of our control, and that affect others as well”.“We have to stop and ask ourselves the question, is it prudent to do something radical to deliver [earnings forecast] numbers?“And the answer is no. Because we are running the company for the long term.“You never run a company where you burn the furniture for the short term,” Ms Nooyi said.PepsiCo on Tuesday ann­ounced third quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations, due mainly to the impact on its international revenues of the sudden strengthening of the US dollar, and weak soft-drink sales in its US market.Richard Goodman, chief financial officer, noted that the decline in US demand for soft drinks was “unprecedented”, and pointed to falling sales at fast-food restaurants as consumers ate out less, to declining sales in convenience stores and to a steep decline in sales of bottled water.Case sales of Pepsi-Cola carbonated soft drinks declined 3 per cent in the Americas, while non-carbonated volumes were down 5 per cent, reflecting double-digit falls in sales of bottled drinking water and the company’s Propel energy drink.But Mr Goodman said Pepsi­Co had seen no significant slowdown in international consumer demand for its drinks and snacks.“When I look around the world …both in snacks and beverages, the trends are really consistent with what we’ve seen year to date,” he said, citing in particular “very, very healthy growth” in Asia and the Middle East.In North America, Pepsi­Co’s Frito-Lay snacks saw continued solid growth, which Ms Nooyi said reflected both the comparative saturation of the drinks market, and the more discretionary nature of drinks.“There’s a free substitute called tap water …and that’s why you are seeing the beverage category more impacted than the snacks category,” she said.The company said third-quarter revenue grew 11 per cent to $11.2bn, while earnings fell to $1.58bn or 99 cents per share, including 7 cents of mark-to-market losses on its commodity positions.PepsiCo’s shares fell in New York, dragging down rival Coca-Cola.
697;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-13T09:44:09Z;Guest column: Beyond the industrial;;"In the wake of the collapse of the US financial system, there is some schadenfreude in the air in Japan. As Nomura Securities picks up pieces of Lehman Brothers and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group provides a lifeline to Morgan Stanley, Japanese feel vindicated in their criticism of American “financial capitalism”.Yet this should not hide the challenges Japan faces.Japan remains wedded to an industrial model in a post-industrial world. Protecting “monozukuri” (“making things”) is a frequent slogan in Japan, as if manufacturing were a more noble – some would say manly – enterprise than services.Consequently, whereas Japan has highly efficient industrial giants, its service sector lags behind in productivity. The evidence of Japan’s failure in industries such as software and entertainment is obvious outside the country. Japan’s manufacturing brands are ubiquitous, but very few Japanese companies are capable of selling software, web-based applications, hospitality industry products, logistics, education, and even animation – that quintessentially Japanese creation – in foreign markets.This endangers the entire Japanese economy. As we continue to move toward a post-industrial world, services and soft goods will capture an ever-growing share of the value chain. It is not an accident that many of the world’s most successful business leaders (such as investor Warren Buffet, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Ingvar Kamrad of Ikea) made their fortunes in services and software.The rigid hierarchical structure of Japanese companies and groups, more suited to industrial production than to the service sector, partly explains this. There are, however, also demographic factors.A defining trend of our era is the increase in global “brain circulation” – the frequent movement of highly educated individuals from the worlds of business, research and development, academia and other fields across national borders.This has created a class of “ampersands” – business professionals, professors and scientists who belong to one and another country, thus helping the international circulation of ideas.Permanent migration is also an important element of the picture. Immigrants include the founders of Yahoo, Google and Ebay, as well as the chief executive of PepsiCo and three of America’s 2007 Nobel Prize winners.Japan scores low on both “brain circulation” and immigration.With few exceptions, its top managerial and scientific echelons are exclusively Japanese. At the same time, Japanese are seriously under-represented in foreign multinationals (outside Japan) and in research labs. Japanese academics rarely teach in foreign universities and foreign professors are still rare in Japan.All this undermines the Japanese service industry. Successful service conglomerates need to be culturally international. A manufactured product can often be sold throughout the world with no or relatively minor modifications. On the other hand, services, be they hotel chains or information, require a much deeper understanding of local cultures.Another factor is that just 10 per cent of Japanese managers are female, as opposed to more than 40 per cent in the US. Forbes’s 2007 list of the 100 most powerful women in the world includes 49 Americans and five Chinese, but not one Japanese. At elite colleges in America, women are almost as numerous as men; in Japan they can be outnumbered by 1:4. The most dynamic Japanese women professionals work for foreign companies or overseas, shunning home-grown corporations.Since service requires cultural flexibility, companies that are gender diverse as well as cosmopolitan are more likely to be adaptable than those dominated by middle-aged monolingual men.If it is to remain prosperous, Japan will have to realise that services are essential to the welfare of an advanced economy.This will require legislation to facilitate short-term and permanent immigration.Furthermore, Japan needs to internationalise its universities, by bringing in top-quality foreign professors in large numbers and making its universities attractive to foreign students. These steps will require improving English fluency. Even recent graduates of top universities often can barely speak English, thus isolating them from the rest of the world.Additionally, empowering women needs to be seen as a national priority. While the rest of the world is using the talent of 100 per cent of its population, a country that relies on only 50 per cent of its citizens faces a fatal handicap.Andrei Hagiu is an assistant professor in the Strategy Unit at Harvard Business School. Robert Dujarric heads the Institute of Contemporary Japanese Studies at Temple University Japan in Tokyo."
698;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-11T00:27:58Z;The financial collapse and other causes for concern;;Go on, you try. You try to get anyone’s attention for worthy causes while the financial world is collapsing around us. Nearly 600,000 women might die in childbirth each year but if a bank is going bust almost every day, it is tough to get anyone to notice.Fortunately, for those unlucky enough to live in parts of the world where childbirth is routinely life-threatening, people do keep trying. Following on from the Davos dinner in January, when 40 important and influential women (OK, 39 and me) met to discuss Millennium Development Goal 5 (to reduce maternal mortality), a ladies’ lunch was held in London in March by Sarah Brown and Carla Bruni. It was in support of the White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood (WRA), an international coalition that seeks to make childbirth safer. Last month, a larger WRA ladies-only dinner was held in New York. Wendi Murdoch, who with Queen Rania of Jordan and Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, had hosted the original Davos dinner, put immense energy and effort into staging the New York event, and this time her co-hosts were Queen Rania and Brown.The Lovely Lucinda asked me what I was going to wear to the dinner. I explained that it didn’t really matter – I was going to be the least consequential person there. Just to prove this, I flew across the Atlantic with my fellow guests Elle Macpherson and Sarah Ferguson. If you ever wish to feel inconsequential, may I recommend a seven-hours-hour plane journey in the company of a supermodel and a former royal wife who spends almost all her time on philanthropy.We were joined on the Manchester-NY leg of the journey by political hacks en route to cover the prime minister’s visit to the UN special session. I got chatting to them and asked if they would like to meet Elle. With one exception, they all said yes. The exception did not decline, but asked who Elle Macpherson was. Who is Elle Macpherson? I could have forgiven this from an Oxbridge-educated journalist from a worthy newspaper, but not when this person’s sister is a (very) famous fashion editor.The dinner was held at a restaurant called Tao, which I am sure had never seen anything like it. I fought my way through the door amid a tide of media people, a consequence of arriving just behind Sarah Palin. Right now, even people who don’t know who Elle Macpherson is have heard of Sarah Palin. My dinner companion was Martha Stewart. This proved handy when trying to establish what to do with empty edamame pods. The worry about which receptacle to choose was hardly in the same league as the question over what to do about the fact that Millennium Development Goal 5 is the only one that has not come closer to being achieved, but at least Stewart was there to help me. We discussed, inter alia, the financial crisis, our respective Agas (hers is grey with four ovens, mine red with two) and maternal mortality.By bringing together Stewart, along with 99 of the most powerful and influential women in New York that week (the guests ranged from Susie Buffett to Vera Wang, as well as a few first ladies to support our own) it was hoped that a swelling tide of indignation about the lack of progress in achieving Millennium Development Goal 5 would lead to a greater sustained effort on the part of world leaders to redouble their efforts to get there.Brown, Murdoch and Queen Rania had assembled an impressive guest list, even as Washington was striving to reach an agreement on a rescue fund for the US financial system. Banks will stand and fall, and it is right that our governments should act to solve the current crisis that is grabbing all the headlines. Although, if you are bleeding to death after childbirth in sub-Saharan Africa, I doubt that you will notice.www.whiteribbonalliance.orgmrsmoneypenny@ft.com
699;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-09T19:56:09Z;Consumers forced to rethink buying patterns;;"For much of the past century, there has been no better place to live comfortably than the US. In the world’s richest economy, air conditioners, microwaves and refrigerators that spit out ice cubes are common household goods, seen more as necessities than a luxuries.But as the country teeters on the edge of recession, life is becoming harder for the average American. With the purchasing power of the US dollar in sharp decline – it takes $2.66 to buy the same amount of goods that $1 would have bought in 1980 – and household incomes dropping, Americans are being forced to cut back on some of the products that have made life good. In western Europe, consumers are in a similar quandary, with France last week becoming the first large economy to acknowledge it had fallen into a recession.But in Asia, eastern Europe and South America, where many economies are still growing, life has been getting better for emerging middle class consumers, as more people than ever can afford to buy basic consumer products such as toothpaste, televisions and shampoo.“In developed markets [such as the US] consumers are still trying to preserve their buying power, which is all about trading down,” says Jeffrey Palma, an equity strategist at investment bank UBS. But in emerging markets the story is different,” he adds. “Incomes are rising…the phenomenon of trading up is still very much in place.”In the US, people are changing the way they shop as makers of branded household products and packaged foods put their prices up to recoup higher transportation and raw material costs. Last month, Jeff Rein, the chief executive of Walgreens, one of the largest US drug stores, noted that there had been a slowdown in the growth of the number of prescriptions being issued in the US.“We believe the biggest impact has been the very tough economy,” said Mr Rein, noting that a July survey by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners found that 22 per cent of Americans are reducing visits to the doctor to save money. Eleven per cent were found to be scaling back on medication.Sales of discretionary food and drink items, including bottled water and non-carbonated juices, and other drinks, are also dropping. Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, said recently that consumers who might have previously left a screw top bottled drink unfinished, now finish it off. Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola’s largest bottler, has reported falling sales of larger, more expensive 20oz bottles of Coke that are a staple at petrol stations.But sales of cheap foods, such as cold, sliced meats as well as soups and frozen vegetables, are rising as people take thier lunches to work and look for cheap alternatives to fresh fruit and vegetables.US consumers are consolidating shopping trips to save money and spending more time at big stores that sell lots of different products at relatively cheap prices. These include: Wal-Mart, the low-cost chain; Costco and BJs, so-called “club” stores that charge membership fees; and discount chains, such as Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Consumers are also buying more so-called “own brand” goods.In Europe, consumers are cutting back on grocery purchases in all countries except Denmark and Norway, according to research group Nielsen, which tracks supermarket sales. “The second quarter revealed a clear and present pullback in consumer consumption,” the group says.To stop consumers “trading down” to cheaper own-label products, companies have begun making cheaper versions of their core products. In France, dairy group Danone has recently put a new kind of yoghurt into supermarkets. Labelled the “Eco Pack”, shoppers get six yoghurts for one euro. The yoghurt tubs weigh 115g each, compared with the 125g tubs the company usually makes, and Danone has also used less packaging, launched fewer flavours and spent less on marketing to keep the price down.But while companies are having a tough time making money in the US and western Europe, doing business in emerging markets has been getting easier. Whereas inflation is rising faster than wages in western markets, in emerging markets it’s the other way around. “In most emerging markets consumers are seeing increases in their real purchasing power, despite higher rates of inflation,” Clayton Daley, Procter & Gamble’s chief financial officer, told an investment conference last month .P&G, like other multinational western consumer goods companies, has been able over the past year to use strong demand in emerging markets to offset slowing sales in the US and Europe. In 2001, P&G’s emerging market sales were some $8bn annually. Today, they are $25bn, and the fastest-growing part of the company’s business.However, there are some initial signs that consumers in India, China, Russia and Brazil will not be immune to events unfolding in the US and Europe.At the end of September, Pepsi Bottling Group, which bottles and distributes PepsiCo products, was one of the first US companies to point to signs of the slowdown in the developing world spreading – as it blamed macroeconomic issues for a slump in sales over the summer in both Russia and Mexico.In Russia, Eric Foss, Pepsi Bottling Group CEO, cited “some near-term uncertainty and financial market volatility” that had led to the soft drinks market’s annual growth slowing to the range of 3 to 4 per cent, down from the low double digit growth rates seen previously. But he stressed the company’s belief that Russia “remains an attractive place for PBG to play over time”.In China and India, which have lower levels of income per head than Brazil and Russia, a big swing to upmarket brands has yet to happen outside of the countries’ biggest cities. But economists are confident it will.India has a lower gross domestic product per capita than Russia, Brazil or China, with less than 20 per cent of homes owning a microwave, refrigerator or washing machine compared with more than 50 per cent in China and nearly 100 per cent in Russia.But with India on track to have more people than any other country in the world by 2030, and incomes rising, consumption is expected to rise at faster rates than other countries.Meanwhile in China, companies say there is plenty of room for growth. Although people still spend just one-thirtieth the amount of money per head on P&G’s products than they do in the US, the time will come when the amount of money they spend will be the same, according to Bob McDonald, P&G’s chief operating officer. “It’s irrefutable.”"
700;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-10-01T04:36:35Z;Low sales spread globally for Pepsi bottler;;Pepsi Bottling Group, the largest global bottler of Pepsi-Cola drinks, said on Tuesday it was seeing signs that the slowdown in the US was spreading to its global customers.Eric Foss, chief executive officer, said that soft consumer demand in the US had spread during the third quarter “across geographies” leading to sales volume declines in Europe and Mexico.In Europe, total volume of cases sold fell 6 per cent. He cited economic factors ranging from economic volatility and the impact of food inflation in Russia, to the effects of the housing slump in Spain. In Mexico, where case volumes were down 9 per cent, he noted that cash remittances from the US had fallen to their lowest level in over a decade, leading to declines in consumer confidence.PBG said the total volume of cases it sold during its third quarter fell 6 per cent in the US and Canada.Just over 30 per cent of PBG’s $14bn annual revenues come from its international business in Europe and Mexico, which accounts for around 40 per cent of PepsiCo’s global drinks business.Over the past year, strong intenational sales have helped to offset the increasingly sluggish US performance of consumer goods companies, ranging from Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark.Over the summer, the larger US food companies reported continued strength in their international operations during their second quarters, with General Mills saying it was expecting “continued strong top line growth”, and Kraft citing “good organic growth”.In the US, where PBG handles more than half of PepsiCo’s business, it noted that sales of both bottled Aquafina water and non-carbonated drinks and Tropicana juices had been harder hit by slowing demand than its traditional carbonated drinks such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew.Mr Foss argued that the non-carbonated drinks were largely dependent on single serving sales in stores and “were probably a little more prone to be more impacted by difficult economic conditions that prevail right now”.Water sales volume was down 6 per cent during the quarter in the US, exceeding the overall 2 per cent decline for the category, which PBG attributed in part to its decision to avoid chasing competitor’s price cuts to support sales.Its non-carbonated drinks volumes fell 2 per cent, against an overall 3 per cent decline in the category. Carbonated drinks sales fell four per cent, in line with forecasts.PepsiCo reported net income for the third quarter of $231 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, on revenues of $3.8bn.

Last month, Unilever’s Skippy brand peanut butter reduced the contents of a typical jar from 18oz to 16.3oz by increasing the depth of the indentation on the bottom of the plastic tub. It kept the price unchanged.Kellogg has done the same thing with its Apple Jacks breakfast cereal: while the front panel size – and the price – remain the same, the contents have shrunk from 11oz to 8.7oz. Cans of Del Monte’s StarKist tuna now contain 5oz of fish rather than 6oz, while a redesigned bottle of PepsiCo’s Tropicana orange juice contains 89 fluid ounces compared with the previous 96 fl oz.The food companies involved mostly blame the impact of rising commodity prices for what are in effect unit price increases being passed to the consumer, although a few creatively attribute content reductions to more “consumer friendly” packaging designs. “It is in effect raising the price, but it seemed to appeal to the consumer psyche, despite paying the same price but getting less,” says Pat Conroy, who heads the consumer goods practice at Deloitte & Touche USA.For the companies, the results can be extremely positive. General Mills reduced the depth of packets of its leading breakfast cereals such as Cheerios while maintaining the dimensions of the front of the box and the price. As a result, the number of packs sold increased by 6 per cent, yet the weight sold was virtually unchanged from the previous year.Ed Dworsky, the editor of Mouseprint.org, a website that tracks consumer issues, says the tactic, known as downsizing, is as old as the packaged goods industry itself and takes advantage of the fact that consumers are “price sensitive, but not net weight sensitive”. But over the past year, he says, the tactic has become increasingly prevalent, driven by soaring fuel prices – since downsizing also reduces transport costs per unit, adding to the savings from having less of the product in the pack.“I can’t remember a time when I’ve seen this many major brands and this many categories involved in downsizing,” he says.But not all the downsizing is under the radar. All the leading US liquid detergent brands have over the past year shifted to smaller, double concentrate versions of their products, in an environmentally focused initiative driven by pressure from Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer.Kraft Foods has responded to growing economic pressure on its customers by introducing smaller “single serve” packages of some of its leading brands at lower prices – a strategy traditionally used by companies to drive sales in developing countries rather than in the US. It also delivers higher profit margins on each unit.“There are many shoppers who are looking at the existing budgets, and they might be thinking, ‘I’d like to buy the larger detergent but I don’t have the money, so I’ll go for something smaller’,” says Ira Matathia, director of consulting at BrainReserve, a trend forecaster. The single-serve packages also follow a boom in small packages of snacks and sodas that has been driven by obesity and health concerns, after the success of the 100 calorie “snack pack” of cookies introduced by Kraft’s Nabisco in 2004.Now Coca-Cola and PepsiCo both produce 100 calorie versions of their carbonated drinks, which are three-quarters of the size of their standard 12oz cans. That emulates the small-but-powerful can concept that has been popularised by energy drinks such as Red Bull.Some of the present outbreak of shrinkage in food packaging is a direct result of a weakening economy. Mr Matathia and others argue, however, that it is playing out against the background of a broader trend – with concerns about issues such as sustainability and health leading towards a desire for greater simplicity and frugality.In a new study on the “culture of the recession”, BrainReserve found that 84 per cent of the 1,011 adults surveyed reported they were “inclined to buy less stuff”, while 72 per cent “want to reduce clutter” in their lives. It had previously argued that 2008 would be a year in which consumers sought greater simplicity in their choices.Sohrab Vossoughi, the founder of Ziba, a Portland, Oregon-based research and design firm, says his company has been forecasting the emergence of a “less is more” philosophy for some years. “The abundance economy is here and people have access to everything, as much as they want. But then they are asking, ‘Now what?’,” he says.He cites as evidence a new housing development in downtown Portland that is marketing itself, with Ziba’s help, under the slogan “Buy Small”, arguing that its one-bedroom, European-scale 550 sq ft apartments are not only less expensive but also better for the environment. “It used to be that less is less, and now less is more. Large purchasing used to signify status; now small purchasing signifies status.”Other indications of the taste for “less is more” include the decline in sales of sports utility vehicles and the Fresh & Easy “neighbourhood markets” opened in America by Tesco of the UK, which offer a highly edited selection of groceries in stores of less than 15,000 sq ft. The concept is being emulated by Wal-Mart, Safeway and other supermarkets.American consumers have not relinquished their enthusiasm for giant-sized buckets of popcorn at the movies, for massive sky-scrapers or for king-size Snickers bars containing more than 500 calories. Mr Matathia also notes an economic counter-trend towards “big” – as consumers seek to save money and fuel by bulk-buying at warehouse discount clubs or concentrating all their shopping into one stop at a Wal-Mart Supercenter.But beyond the downsizing tactics of consumer goods companies, or shoppers heading to their local 200,000 sq ft Wal-Mart, he argues that “you have the confluence of a bunch of cultural currents that are all in principle moving towards the idea of smaller. The prevailing social trend is that we are in a post-supersize-me environment.”"
702;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-09-01T19:04:19Z;Russia’s coming of age;;Patrick Ricard, the man who has run French distiller Pernod Ricard for more than 30 years, first visited Russia in the early 1960s. He did not like what he saw.“It was a terrible country,” Mr Ricard says solemnly, sitting on a couch in the foyer of Moscow’s Baltschug Kempinski hotel, surrounded by people talking on mobile phones and smoking cigarettes. “Nothing was clean, it was sad and poor.”It is easy to see how a very French Frenchman – the 63-year old Mr Ricard is the kind that dislikes speaking English and wears a red boutonnière on the lapel of his suit – would once have found little to enjoy in Russia.Thirty years ago, there was little to choose from in Russian shops. They offered one kind of milk, one kind of cheese and one kind of beer – when such products were available. And nearly everything was made in the Soviet Union.Today, Moscow’s bustling supermarkets stock the world’s most expensive brands, including Pernod Ricard’s whiskies, cognacs and champagnes. “The country has changed a lot. You notice a difference in just six months,” Mr Ricard says. “You see they want to succeed.”While the world’s leaders fret over the political consequences of Russia’s rising economic power, such as its recent invasion of Georgia, the world’s makers of wine, chocolate and ice cream are far less perturbed, seeing instead an unmissable business opportunity.“The marketplace is changing more quickly here than anywhere else I’ve ever seen or experienced,” says Bernard Meunier, the Belgian who runs Swiss food group Nestlé’s Russian subsidiary, Nestlé Rossiya.In his Moscow office, Mr Meunier shows off a new ice cream brand named 48 Kopeks, which Nestlé has developed for the local market. The name refers nostalgically to the price Russians paid for ice cream in the 1960s and 1970s. “The Russian consumer is getting richer faster than any other consumer in Europe,” he explains.During the past few decades, as the European and US companies that make the world’s washing powders and instant soups roamed the globe seeking people they could turn into “consumers”, they focused on South America and Asia but largely ignored Russia.Before the Soviet Union fell apart in the early 1990s, it was almost impossible to get foreign brands into Russia. And even after its demise, many foreign companies remained nervous about investing in a country that seemed politically and economically unstable, as well as corrupt.Their worst fears were borne out at the end of the 1990s when Russia slid into a financial crisis. As the value of the rouble tumbled and banks collapsed, it seemed doubtful whether the country would ever be able to sustain a vibrant domestic market.Today, those fears are fading fast. Less than 20 years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia is on the verge of becoming one of the most lucrative consumer goods markets in the world.Foreign consumer goods companies such as Nestlé, Unilever, PepsiCo, Kellogg’s, Kraft and Wrigley have so much confidence in Russia’s future that they have been racing to buy Russian brands, acquiring some $2bn (€1.4bn, £1.1bn) of local companies during the past 18 months. Among the companies purchased were Lebedyansky, Russia’s biggest fruit juice producer, and Inmarko, its biggest ice cream brand.Antoine de Saint-Affrique, the Frenchman who runs Unilever’s central and eastern European businesses – and who last year transferred his office from Rotterdam to Moscow – argues that companies that do not invest in Russia will miss out on the opportunity of participating in what he describes as “extraordinary” domestic growth.“Russia has enormous potential that will go above and beyond the oil industry,” he predicts, comparing Moscow to cities such as New York, London and Shanghai as he points to the office block going up across the street from Unilever’s Moscow headquarters. “They’re building it night and day.”Supporting evidence is not hard to spot in Moscow, a city where posters advertising films such as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull are plastered over socialist murals of workers carrying pickaxes. In the basement of a branch of Seventh Continent, one of the first supermarket chains to open in Russia more than a decade ago (it now has close to 130 stores) shoppers happily pay 2,119Rbs ($86, €59, £48) for a bottle of Olmeca Tequila – more than double the price it would cost in the UK. Nearby, at a more expensive grocery chain, Globus Gourmet, a 1988 bottle of Dom Perignon champagne can be picked up for 35,230Rbs.McDonald’s – which along with Pepsi was one of few foreign brands to get into Russia in Soviet times – is more popular than ever. Queues trail out of a suburban store on a Saturday afternoon and it is opening restaurants faster in Russia than in any other European country. It claims its Pushkin Square restaurant in central Moscow, opened in 1990, is the busiest in the world.Fancier restaurants are also appearing on Moscow’s streets. At the GQ Bar, a bar and restaurant south of Red Square that opened last year, dessert plates piled with raspberries are served with flakes of gold leaf. And at Turandot, a restaurant near Pushkin Square that opened two years ago after $50m was spent building it over six years, diners can spend thousands of roubles transporting themselves back to the 18th century. The restaurant’s walls are decorated with original French tapestries, waiters wear knickerbockers and the wooden chairs are elaborately hand painted.Expatriate business people believe the ostentation evident at such venues reflects Russians’ age-old propensity to indulge in the finer things in life when they can. “People like good food, good wine, good cars…and young Russians believe they can turn everything into gold, which currently is true,” says Dominique Bach, the Frenchman who runs the eastern European operations of PepsiCo, over a glass of champagne on a balcony outside Moscow’s Swissôtel.“Russia is not a place where doing business is boring,” he adds.
703;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-08-24T14:50:22Z;Poll fears ahead of Democratic convention;;A successful presidential convention can give the nominee a five- to 10- percentage point bounce in opinion polls. But as Barack Obama and running mate Joe Biden chart their course across the swing states of the mid-west towards Denver on Wednesday, a large chunk of media attention will be eaten up by Hillary and Bill Clinton.Many supporters of Mr Obama express private anguish over the prominent role he has conceded to the former president and first lady on three out of the four days of the convention this week. The democratic nominee starts off the convention with an insignificant 1- to 2- percentage-point lead over republican rival John McCain.Mr Obama’s supporters fear that by stealing part of the show, the Clintons may also limit the opinion poll upside. “They got everything of substance that they asked for,” said one senior Democrat, who was not involved in either Mrs Clinton or Mr Obama’s campaign. “And they also got some extras.”Tomorrow Mrs Clinton will give a keynote address to an audience of 20,000 in the Pepsi convention centre in downtown Denver. Bill Clinton will follow with his own prime-time address to party delegates on Wednesday. And on Thursday disaffected Clinton delegates will get the opportunity to make a symbolic roll call vote for her nomination.In addition to these three concessions, Mrs Clinton negotiated the right to show a short film about her life that will air prior to her speech. Showing a biopic is a privilege normally reserved for nominees or special circumstances – such as the appreciation today that will be accorded to Ted Kennedy, the senator for Massachusetts, who was recently diagnosed with a brain tumour.In addition, supporters of Mrs Clinton have succeeded in inveigling strong language into the Democratic party platform condemning misogyny. Although the party platform is more symbolic than a European-style party manifesto, the wording harks back to the highly-charged days of the primary campaign earlier this year when Clinton supporters alleged their candidate was the victim of sexism.Many of Mrs Clinton’s supporters, roughly a quarter of whom say they plan to vote for Mr McCain, will be out in force in Denver continuing to argue that the former first lady would have been the better nominee. Among the most vocal is Party Unity My Ass, a pro-Hillary groups whose website trails the catchphrase “We are the ones no one was expecting” – a mocking reference to Mr Obama’s line: “We are the ones we have been waiting for”.Their resentment has been fuelled by Mr Obama’s decision to have excluded Mrs Clinton from his shortlist of vice-presidential nominees and the fact that he offered the slot to a candidate who garnered only one per cent of the vote before withdrawing from the race. Mrs Clinton, by contrast, won almost half the overall vote.Yet to judge by Mrs Clinton’s public comments, Mr Obama has little to fear from her address tomorrow: “Senator Biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice-president who will help Senator Obama both win the presidency and govern this great country,” she said in a statement on Saturday.The same reassurance is not felt about Mr Clinton, who has continued to convey only lukewarm support for Mr Obama in his public comments. Friends say that privately he is still seething about what he sees as the Obama campaign-inspired portrayal of him as a racist during the primaries.But even if Mr Clinton swallows his pride and delivers a barnstorming address for Mr Obama, the convention’s message will have been partly diluted. “It is really hard to see why the Obama camp has given such a big role to both Clintons in a year that is supposed to be about change,” said the head of a liberal thinktank, who asked for his name to be withheld.Historians of party conventions point out that their two primary purposes are to set a course for the general election and to demonstrate party unity to the nation. They also point out that candidates who lose presidential elections have often emerged from a divided convention.For example, in 1992, George H.W. Bush’s convention was hijacked by Pat Buchanan, the nativist Republican, who launched his “culture wars” from the podium. Or Gerald Ford in 1976 whose relatively bland presidency was put in the shade by Ronald Reagan’s rousing address. Or Al Gore in 2000, who was overshadowed by none other than Bill Clinton. “The Clintons have done this before,” said the senior Democrat. “And they are capable of doing it again.”But the real test, he added, will come early next week in the post-convention opinion polls.
704;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-08-17T22:18:57Z;Food and consumer groups get hedge smart;;Food and consumer goods companies are overhauling the way they buy and hedge commodities after being caught out by increases in the prices of raw materials that have squeezed industry margins and cut profits.Companies are turning to commodity trading houses for the first time to hire traders and are buying complex financial trading systems to help them cope with a new era of global inflation.Such decisions suggest executives have realised that volatile commodity markets are not a short-term phenomenon but a structural change driven by ­rising demand from emerging markets.Peter Evans, co-ordinator of the European consumer products practice at headhunter Russell Reynolds Associates, said companies were approaching trading houses such as Cargill, Bunge and ADM to find traders who understood volatile markets.“If they can buy commodities more intelligently than their competitors, that can be a competitive advantage,” he said, adding that the firm had been hired to fill a new role of global commodities procurement director at one of the biggest food groups.Prices of some commodities, such as corn and wheat, are now fluctuating as much in a single day as they did in a year in the early 1990s.Brice Russell, chief procurement officer for food group Mars, said companies were poaching people from each other as well as from commodity trading houses because it was hard to find experienced people.“A lot of managers have not been in an inflationary environment before …they have to figure out how to manage it,” he said.Michael Schwartz, chief marketing officer at Triple Point, a US-based company that designs trading software for oil companies, miners and Wall Street banks, said: “Consumer industry companies are showing interest in managing their commodities exposure now in a way very much similar to the energy and metals companies.”Rick Hughes, vice-president of global purchases at Procter & Gamble, which hedges all kinds of commodities, said: “We’ve gone longer and hedged a broader portion of our portfolio.”Unilever created a position of chief purchasing officer a few months ago. Kellogg’s, which has hedged 90 per cent of its raw material exposure this year, said it hedged earlier, and PepsiCo said it was also hedging more.
705;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Amazon to boost focus on loyalty schemes;;Amazon, the online retailer, wants to sell more goods and digital downloads for loyalty programme points rather than money, as it builds on its experiences supporting a points-redemption promotion for Pepsi.The retailer says in a current job advertisement that it is planning to create a “new rewards redemption platform business” as part of its global payments system, a move that may be aimed both at its own credit card users and members of other loyalty programmes.Loyalty programmes operated by airlines, credit card companies, retailers and others are an increasingly important marketing battleground in the US. LoyaltyOne Consulting, which has worked with a range of leading US companies’ loyalty schemes, estimates that an average family is enrolled in 12 programmes, and actively participates in four to five.Amazon, like other US retailers such as Gap, rewards users of its branded credit cards with gift cards linked to purchases. Leading supermarkets have also linked loyalty card points to cheaper petrol at their filling stations. Best Buy, the electronics chain, has created a programme that allows its customers to exchange loyalty points for goods.Leading credit cards and airlines have increasingly begun using their online presence to give loyalty programme members the opportunity to trade points for goods from leading retailers.Kelly Hlavinka, of LoyaltyOne, noted that programmes operated by airlines and hotels were increasingly offering merchandise. “They have people who have used a lot of points and the opportunity to use them may be limited …so they are looking to broaden their redemption portfolios to give customers a bigger choice for where they burn their points,” she said.American Express’s Shop­Amex site, for instance, offers an online comparison site that allows points accumulated under its Membership Rewards programme to be redeemed on a vast range of products at participating retailers, including Amazon.American Express said merchandise exchange “was really an area that we’re focused on over the past few years, as people have become more aware of it”.Under Amazon’s “Pepsi Stuff” collaboration in the US, the online retailer operates a website where Pepsi’s customers register purchases, acquiring points that can be exchanged for music downloads and a limited selection of electronics and branded clothing.Ms Hlavinka noted that Amazon’s product range and brand could make it an attractive partner for companies that did not see it as a direct competitor.
706;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Britvic faces tough conditions;;Britvic underscored the difficult environment facing soft drink producers by warning that there was no end in sight to either falling pub sales or rising raw material prices.The shares fell 18¼p to 237¼p after the maker of Robinson’s squash said pub sales would “remain challenging” and the cost of raw materials would be higher than expected this year.Britvic said its raw material costs, which include concentrate, glass, PET, steel, juice and sugar, would rise 4.5 per cent this year, up from earlier guidance of 4 per cent. Analysts estimated this would reduce earnings by £1m, although Britvic said lower-than-expected interest charges would counter the additional costs.Nevertheless, analysts said the group’s outlook could hurt profit growth, particularly as supermarkets are making it increasingly difficult for food and drinks companies to push through price increases.Alexandra Oldroyd, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: “Their margins are likely to be under pressure next year.”Sales of Britvic’s so-called still drinks such as squashes and waters did better than the overall market, as did its fizzy drinks, and the group’s revenues rose 3.7 per cent in the nine months to July.However, Britvic said sales of all kinds of soft drinks were continuing to fall at pubs and bars – the places where it makes the most money – and were showing “very low growth” in supermarkets and convenience stores.An economic slowdown in Ireland is also causing problems for the group, which bought Irish brands such as Ballygowan water and Club fizzy drinks from C&C last year.“Economic conditions in Ireland have become markedly more challenging in the last three months,” Britvic said, adding that sales were falling in both supermarkets as well as pubs.Analysts said the 7.4 per cent rise in Britvic’s sales volumes in the most recent quarter appeared to have been driven by Gatorade, the sports energy drink that Britvic markets and distributes. Although the brand, which is owned by PepsiCo, is well known in the US, it has not been marketed as hard in the UK.Britvic’s total sales rose 30 per cent to £690m in the nine-month period, including £147.2m of sales from Britvic Ireland.The group said full-year earnings would be in line with expectations.Both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo this week confirmed that they are experimenting with smaller bottle sizes in the US as they look for ways of saving money as the costs of both making soft drinks and packaging them rises.
707;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-07-24T17:54:13Z;Coke to shrink size of cans in Hong Kong;;Coca-Cola is shrinking the size of its Coke and Fanta cans in Hong Kong as it battles soaring aluminium prices, in a move analysts say foreshadows broader packaging changes from the world’s leading soft-drink brands.The soft-drinks group is reducing its can sizes to 330ml – the most common can size – from 355ml.John Sicher, analyst at drinks newsletter Beverage Digest, said: “In a number of markets the big beverage companies are starting to look at different package sizes…both Coke and Pepsi are testing different package sizes in the US.”Mr Sicher said both companies were experimenting with “slightly smaller bottles” and that changes in packaging were likely to be “a major theme” for the soft-drinks industry over the next few years.He said there were two reasons for the changes. First, rising commodity prices have increased the cost of packaging as well as the drinks’ ingredients.Packaging costs have been affected by record aluminium prices following a 65 per cent appreciation over the past three years. Aluminium prices have been driven by rising energy prices, sharply increasing the cost of production. Energy accounts for about 45 per cent of the cost of producing finished aluminium.The cost of the soft drinks themselves has also risen, as rising corn prices have raised the cost of high fructose corn syrup, which is used to sweeten most soft drinks.Second, companies are becoming careful about working out the most effective price and packaging mix for their products.Cutting the volume or weight of products is becoming an increasingly popular way to push through effective price rises while protecting profit margins, according to John Kemp, analyst at RBS Sempra.The alternative - to raise prices - has led to a decline in demand for some companies. Swiss food group Nestlé and Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever have lost sales volumes after raising prices, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.The fizzy-drink market has fallen into serious decline over the past five years with all top brands losing sales as people switch to healthier drinks.The US economic downturn is adding to companies’ woes with PepsiCo this week reporting that sales were slowing at convenience stores as people become more careful about how they spend their money.Neither Coke nor Pepsi were immediately available for comment.www.ft.com/consumer
708;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Joint initiative aims to combat obesity;;Food and advertising companies are joining forces with the government to launch the biggest anti-obesity ­marketing campaign seen in Britain, in a move intended to project a more proactive, industry approach to tackling health problems.A consortium of food, soft drink, fitness and broadcasting companies is to contribute £200m ($400m) in cash and “in-kind” donations such as free air time to a Department of Health campaign called “Change 4 Life” that will hit television screens and other media early next year.The campaign, which will strengthen a £75m advertising blitz announced by the department earlier this year, will encourage people to eat more healthily and exercise more often in an attempt to bring down soaring obesity levels.Until now, the food industry has been slow to take responsibility for its role in contributing to obesity through the sale of “junk” foods.PepsiCo, one of the companies involved in the coalition, said: “It is an unprecedented step …there’s definitely been a shift in the broader industry and a willingness to be proactive.”Alan Johnson, the health secretary, has said that obesity “is probably the biggest public health threat that we face”, with costs to the National Health Service likely to rise sevenfold by 2050.The problem of obesity would not be solved by finger-pointing or by vilifying the extremely fat, Mr Johnson said on Wednesday, as he called for a “national movement” to tackle the issue.“Commentators who point and shout at pictures of the morbidly obese simply fuel the problem,” he said, and allowed many others, “who in fact have high blood fat or are simply somewhat overweight, to say: ‘Well, that’s not me. I don’t need to change what I do.’”A more intelligent message was needed, he said, explaining to parents that many children, regardless of their size, had dangerous levels of fat in their arteries or around their organs and that this might reduce life expectancy by up to 11 years.Baroness Buscombe, chief executive of the Advertising Association, argued that a marketing campaign that included industry would be more effective than one run by the government, and said industry involvement that reflected a genuine interest in tackling the obesity problem rather than being a move to avoid tighter regulation.“There’s no question of a quid pro quo here,” she said.However, Neville Rigby, the director of policy at the International Association for the Study of Obesity, said that advertising campaigns were unlikely to solve the obesity problem, and that a regulatory approach was needed, including such actions as banning sales of junk food near schools.
709;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-07-23T21:39:09Z;Wall Street advances as oil prices drop;;US stocks advanced for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices dropped sharply and lawmakers moved closer to a deal on legislation to backstop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Crude oil prices fell back for a second day, slipping below $125 a barrel and helping to offset some mixed earnings reports from consumer-oriented companies.In the consumer discretionary sector, Whirlpool shares added 12.5 per cent to $76.69 after the appliance maker said second-quarter profits had fallen less than expected. The sector advanced 2 per cent.In the consumer staples sector, Costco Wholesale said earnings would be “well below” Wall Street expectations as it had absorbed some recent hikes in energy prices to attract customers. Costco fell 11.9 per cent to $63.43. Wal-Mart Stores slid 1.6 per cent to $58.09 while Kroger lost 2.3 per cent to $28.18.There was some better news from PepsiCo and McDonald’s, which both beat analyst estimates for their quarterly results.PepsiCo rose 2.3 per cent to $67.72 but McDonald’s slipped 0.8 per cent to $59.66. The sector rose 0.5 per cent.In industrials, Boeing, the aerospace group and CH Robinson, the logistics provider, both undershot Wall Street expectations while Norfolk Southern, the railway company, outperformed.Boeing and CH Robinson fell 3.7 per cent to $66.72 and 15.6 per cent to $49.56, respectively. Norfolk, however, added 6.5 per cent to $69.96, helping the industrial sector advance 1.1 per cent.Seven of the 10 leading industry groups closed in the black, nudging the benchmark S&P 500 up 0.4 per cent at 1,282.12 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent higher at 11,632.38 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent ahead at 2,325.88 points.On Tuesday, stocks overturned early losses to surge in late trading after oil fell back and the new chief executive of Wachovia announced a turnround plan, prompting a powerful rally in banks.Financials climbed for a second session on Wednesdsay as lawmakers prepared to vote on a bill that would authorise the Treasury secretary to inject capital into the two government-sponsored entities if needed with only limited restrictions as part of a broader package to address the housing crisis.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial Services, said: “The power of [the] blank cheque is huge in terms of restoring confidence in the major players of the mortgage market – Fannie and Freddie. Just having that there is psychologically very important to the market.”Fannie Mae climbed 11.9 per cent to $15 and Freddie Mac added 11.3 per cent to $10.80. The financial sector added as much as 4.6 per cent before paring gains to 1.9 per cent.Amid the positive sentiment, investors could not overlook poor results from Washington Mutual. The largest US savings and loans company, said it had lost $3.33bn in the second quarter, significantly more than forecast.Washington Mutual shares, which have lost about 88 per cent of their value in the past year, slumped 20.1 per cent to $4.65.The technology sector was also in focus. Overnight, Yahoo said second-quarter profits dropped 18 per cent to $131.2m on higher development costs and declining advertising spending.The company also reduced its full-year revenue forecast and the shares dropped 4.7 per cent to $20.39.EMC, the maker of storage-computers, was the leading sector gainer, however, surging 13.7per cent to $14.17 after it posted estimate-beating second-quarter profits and boosted its 2008 sales target. The technology sector advanced 1.4 per cent.Telecom stocks were the best performers on Wednesday. AT&T, the telephone carrier, said second-quarter profits jumped 30 per cent to $3.77bn, helping the shares to advance 3.9 per cent to $33.06 and the sector to add 3.4 per cent - its biggest one day gain since late January.As oil prices dropped, energy stocks were again a weak spot in spite of some solid earnings from ConocoPhillips. The third-largest US oil producer posted a record $5.44bn second-quarter profit thanks to soaring gas and oil prices. Still, investors were not satisfied and the shares fell 2.9 per cent to $81.83. The sector dipped 3.8 per cent

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
711;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-07-23T20:14:08Z;US downturn hits PepsiCo beverages;;"PepsiCo on Wednesday said the downturn in the US economy was hurting sales of soft drinks, including its Aquafina bottled water.The company said sales of soft drinks were falling in US convenience stores, including its Gatorade brand. Sales volumes dropped 3 per cent in North America against a 1 per cent fall in the quarter overall.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, said; “People [are switching] to tap water and [applying] their discretionary dollars to Frito-Lay salty snacks.”However, strong snack food sales and a weak dollar, helped lift PepsiCo second quarter profits.Net income increased to $1.7bn, or $1.05 a share, in the three months ended June 14, exceeding analysts’ average estimate by 4 cents. Sales jumped 14 per cent to $10.9bn.Ms Nooyi said snack food sales rose even though the company pushed through price rises as it sought to offset a 10 per cent increase in commodity costs this year.The company, the world’s second-biggest soda maker, benefited from its 60 per cent snack-market share as cash-strapped US consumers added chips to meals at home instead of eating out.It appears a weak economy is becoming a new factor putting pressure on the bottled water industry.Falling bottled water sales have also hurt profits at Danish brewer Carlsberg, which claimed sales were damaged by the environmental debate on bottled water versus tap water.Nestlé, the owner of water brands such as Vittel and Perrier, has also said sales in Italy, France and the US were dropping as environmentalists encouraged people to use less plastic and drink tap water.PepsiCo forecast “continued strength” in earnings for the second half of the year, and said its broad portfolio, which includes healthy foods like Quaker Oats, would help it produce consistent results. However, it warned the third quarter would be “interesting”, because it would feel the full impact of commodity price rises.It also said it was unsure how long it would be before sales of fizzy drinks, which fell 2 per cent in the quarter by volume, returned to strong growth.“The category has never been in such decline as it is now,” Ms Nooyi said.But she added she remained “optimistic” about its future."
712;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-07-23T18:40:56Z;Thirst to be first: race for a global lead in beer;;"Chris Burggraeve, chief marketing officer of InBev, leans on a bar in front of a Stella Artois tap as he delivers the Belgo-Brazilian brewer’s somewhat tautological corporate spiel. Brands, he says, are “the lifeblood of any branded goods business – and that’s what we are”.The appearance by the fresh-faced Belgian comes on a video clip at globalbeerleader.com, a website set up by InBev – producer of Stella and brands including Beck’s – as part of its successful campaign to take over Anheuser-Busch of the US.The $52bn (£26bn, €33bn) deal agreed last week gives InBev prime position in the world’s most profitable beer market: Anheuser-Busch has a near 50 per cent share in the US, which by volume is also the second biggest beer market in the world after China. At least as important, the acquisition helps position the brewer for the future by giving it Budweiser, the world’s best-known beer brand.Brewing still has few truly international brands. Of the world’s top 10 best-selling brands (a list topped by Bud Light, China’s Snow beer and Budweiser), only for Heineken of the Netherlands do international markets account for the vast proportion of sales. But the ownership of strong international brands is becoming increasingly important to brewers, for two main reasons.First, they are prized by consumers in fast-growing markets such as Russia (see below) and China, who did not have access to foreign brands until recently. Second, even in mature western markets, the premium on prominent brands is high and growing. Heineken, for example, says profits on the Heineken brand are twice those on the regional brands such as Amstel that still form about 80 per cent of sales.Those better profit margins become all the more important to brewers in the current environment of high commodity and energy prices and slowing world economic growth. Big rises in raw material costs, including hops and malted barley as well as oil for transport and aluminium for cans, have been forcing them to put up beer prices. Jørgen Buhl Rasmussen, chief executive of Carlsberg, the Danish brewer whose brand is in the top 20 global best sellers, says: “When you don’t have strong brands, it’s very hard to offset price increases.”Some drinks analysts predict that half of the beer industry’s profits will eventually be derived from premium brands, up from about 10 per cent now. This would strengthen the position of groups such as InBev, Heineken and Carlsberg, they add. The Dutch group sees itself as having a head start – it began moving into US and Asian markets more than 70 years ago. “It takes you decades to build an internationally recognised premium brand,” says Jean-François van Boxmeer, Heineken chief executive.But although Budweiser is one of the world’s most most widely recognised consumer brands of any kind – ranking in league tables close to Nike and Dell – it is drunk mostly in the US. By volume, barely 5 per cent of Anheuser-Busch’s beer (which also includes brands such as Michelob and Rolling Rock) is sold internationally. That offers InBev a vast opportunity. “Budweiser has always been much better known than drunk around the world,” says an investment banker who advised InBev’s executives on the Anheuser takeover. “Bud could easily become their big global brand.”That is also how Carlos Brito, InBev’s Brazilian chief executive, sees it. The success of companies such as PepsiCo and McDonald’s shows people still want American brands, Mr Brito says. “Consumers like the US lifestyle.” Budweiser, he adds, can sell “America in a bottle”.Gerard Rijk, analyst at ING, sees the trend towards a few big brands as weakening the position of others such as SABMiller, the brewer that emerged from South Africa and began adding northern hemisphere brands in the late 1990s, when it bought the Czech Republic’s Pilsner Urquell. It subsequently absorbed Miller Brewing of the US in 2002, which gave it the Miller Genuine Draft brand, as well as Italy’s Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Grolsch of the Netherlands. But these four (excluding Miller Lite, sold mainly in the US) account for less than 2 per cent of the group’s total sales volumes.Mr Rijk argues that SABMiller’s lack of a “dominant overwhelming brand” makes it vulnerable despite being a well-run company. “When there is not yet a global brand, you can break it up.” Some of SABMiller’s rivals also see the brewer’s lack of global brands as an Achilles heel. “It is one of their challenges,” says the chief executive at another big brewer.Graham Mackay, SABMiller’s chief executive, acknowledges that global brands are increasingly important, noting that beers such as Peroni are growing faster than other brands at the group. But he adds: “The idea that we’re going to be broken up any time soon is quite fanciful …We’ll continue to be a consolidator.”Other beer analysts back him up, saying there is no reason for SABMiller to be a loser in any further acquisition round. Andrew Holland, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, expects two main blocs to be created – one led by InBev and the other by a combined SABMiller/Molson Coors, which recently merged their US brewing businesses. “The next logical thing is for SAB to do a full merger with Molson Coors,” says Mr Holland.All the while, each of the big brewers will have to spend big sums burnishing the image of its best brand and further extending its international reach. As Heine­ken’s Mr van Boxmeer puts it: “A large part of the world which was closed 20 years ago has opened up …You can see a large trend of demand for ‘something else’, which we can provide.”For InBev’s Mr Burggraeve, who joined the group only last November after a dozen years at Coca-Cola (see below), that marketing task began right then, and in all urgency, rather than by making videos for the Anheuser bid. InBev has been regarded as one of the industry’s poorer brand managers, having failed to protect the premium image of Stella Artois in the UK.British demand for Stella, once marketed as “reassuringly expensive”, dived after InBev cut prices and the brand became associated with the country’s binge drinking culture. The poor UK performance dragged down global Stella Artois volumes in 2007, before improving this year amid a new advertising campaign that emphasises its quality and purity.Many in the industry consider InBev’s management to have been tough and efficient rather than brilliant marketeers. As chief executive, Mr Brito reflects the culture of the company when he describes his lifestyle: “I have no hobbies. I work all the time.”Now, he is to become custodian of what has long been promoted as the “king of beers”. With so valuable a brand as Bud to protect, Mr Brito might need to consider getting out more.Emerging tipples rise up the value rankingsWhen brewers talk of their “global” brands, they no longer just mean those from western Europe or the US. Some of the emerging global names began life far from there.Baltika, the Russian brand owned by Carlsberg, and Brazil’s Brahma,owned by InBev, beat brands including Miller Genuine Draft, Foster’s and Molson in the 2008 market value ranking of beer brands by Millward Brown, a research group.Millward Brown says Baltika, at number 15 on the list, is valued at just over $1bn (£501m, €636m) while Brahma, which pulls in at number 17, is worth $944m. (Skol, where rights are shared – InBev brews it in Brazil and Carlsberg has most of the rights beyond Latin America – ranks eighth, worth $1.9bn.)Carlsberg says Baltika, of which it recently gained full ownership after buying Scottish & Newcastle, its former joint venture partner in Russia, is now one of its top four international brands along with the Carlsberg brand itself, Tuborg and 1664 Kronenbourg.Baltika was the reason that Carlsberg, with the help of Heineken, launched a surprise bid for S&N last year in a deal that split up the British brewer. Carlsberg wanted a bigger stake in the Russian beer market, where annual sales volumes have been rising some 10 per cent on average in the past four years, but it also saw the global potential of the Baltika brand.“It’s becoming international,” Jørgen Buhl Rasmussen, Carlsberg’s chief executive, told the Financial Times as he opened the brand’s 11th Russian brewery in May.Baltika, which was developed only in the early 1990s but is now Russia’s biggest beer brand, was first exported in 2000. Since then it has been shipped to some 47 countries including Australia, Japan and Greece and is also brewed under licence in the UK and Ukraine. About 10 per cent of its total sales come from outside Russia.InBev’s Brahma brand is much older, having been created in 1888 in Brazil, where it was long considered an ordinary beer brand. But InBev began creating a global image for Brahma when it started exporting it to 15 countries in 2005. It is now available in more than 30 national markets, including 20 outside Latin America.The brewer redesigned Brahma’s packaging, creating a curved bottle with embossed lettering in what it says was an attempt to form a link between the Brazilian culture (“optimistic and creative”) and the beer.The redesign was also the brewer’s first attempt at creating a global brand after InBev was created by the merger of Brazil’s AmBev and Belgium’s Interbrew in 2004.But although InBev describes Brahma as one of its “global flagship” brands, along with Stella Artois and Beck’s, it does not appear to have won over the palates of American and European drinkers. Asked which will be the brands of the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev with most potential, Carlos Brito, chief executive, says: “Bud Light, Bud and Skol.”Bottling gives brewers a taste for the soft stuffBranding has become so important to brewers that some industry specialists believe they may one day consider merging with some of the biggest brand names in the drinks business: Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Carlos Laboy, a beverages analyst at Credit Suisse, says that as brewers become bigger, they are starting to think of expanding beyond beer. “InBev is not thinking in terms of being a brewer …they want to become the most dominant consumer packaged company in the world,” he says.Pepsi and Coke already have substantial bottling and distribution agreements with brewers around the world. When it completes its acquisition of Anheuser-Busch, InBev will be the biggest company outside the US in the business of turning PepsiCo’s proprietary concentrate into the finished product on supermarket shelves. SABMiller, meanwhile, is one of Coca-Cola’s biggest bottlers outside Latin America; in Australia the two have a joint venture, Pacific Beverages, which is building a brewery on the country’s east coast.It has long been the soft drinks companies’ strategy to franchise bottling operations. Carlsberg bottles Coca-Cola drinks in Denmark and Finland, and Pepsi in Sweden, Norway and Laos. Heineken owns a stake in Compañía Cervecerías Unidas, the Chilean brewer and soft drinks bottler.For the brewers, bottling is a convenient sideline that makes use of their existing capacity. But the low margins in a business until recently dominated by small, family-run companies mean they have not pursued it as a serious long-term strategy. Profits are limited because the brewers do not have any control over marketing and branding, and have to split revenues with the brand owner. Brewers also say that soft drinks companies have been sharply increasing the price of soft drink concentrate over the past decade.Graham Mackay, SABMiller chief executive, acknowledges that owning a big soft drink brand – assuming SABMiller could ever afford to buy one – would be far more profitable than bottling one. “We can’t do with soft drinks brands what we might like to do with them.”Some suggest that SABMiller could strike some sort of deal with Coca-Cola. That might sound implausible, points out Mr Laboy, but so did the idea of InBev buying Anheuser-Busch five years ago when its market capitalisation was one-third that of the American brewer.For their part, soft drinks companies have been reluctant to sell beer, wine and spirits because they are wary of being linked with the problems of underage or binge drinking. “They’ve considered [getting into alcohol] many times,” says the chief executive of one brewer. “But they want to stay squeaky clean.”Coca-Cola had a brief flirtation with alcohol, owning the US’s Taylor Wine Company for seven years before selling it to Canada’s Seagram in 1983. But it has since pursued a pure soft drinks strategy.Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chief executive, insists that soft drinks have a strong future. “I believe that there is no better consumer business in the world today or in the future than the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink business,” he said in February at a conference in New York.However, with soft drinks companies now battling declining markets for fizzy drinks, some analysts say they should reconsider the logic of owning alcoholic brands. Mr Laboy argues that one way Coca-Cola could cut costs and improve profits, as sales of its core Coke brand slow, would be to buy either SABMiller or Fomento Económico Mexicano (Femsa), the family-controlled Mexican brewer.He also says brewers should consider making a move on the soft drinks groups – in particular, that InBev should take a close look at PepsiCo. Anheuser-Busch InBev will have close to 40 per cent of the volumes in the Chinese beer industry …What would their business look like if they had the entire PepsiCo portfolio on their trucks?”"
713;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-07-01T18:31:02Z;Coca-Cola;;Muhtar Kent should not take it personally. On his first day behind the desk as Coca-Cola’s new chief executive, shares in the drinks group sank to their lowest point in just over a year. Much like a new president inheriting a disastrous legacy, however, that trough ought to play to Mr Kent’s advantage. Not because he can blame his predecessor – he enjoys a good relationship with Neville Isdell, who remains as chairman. And the transition has been smooth, exceptionally so by Coke’s standards.Rather, Mr Kent inherits a group that has recovered well but now faces headwinds largely beyond his control. In the US, structural decline in sales of carbonated soft drinks has been reinforced by an economic slowdown forcing Americans to trade down to cheaper brands and eat out less often. Meanwhile, investors are nervous about the impact of rising prices on consumers in faster-growing emerging markets, their concerns heightened by gloomy outlooks from some of Coke’s bottling partners.Such pessimism, with Coke’s stock now trading at a lower multiple of earnings than during its meltdown of 2004, ignores Coke’s defensive qualities – and the role Mr Kent can play. Only a fifth of Coke’s operating profit is derived from North America, considerably less than for arch-rival PepsiCo. While Coke does not enjoy Pepsi’s exposure to snacks, the flip side is less pain from rising crop costs. Similarly, the warnings from Coke’s bottlers have more to do with their exposure to plastic and aluminium costs than slumping sales.Mr Kent’s background in bottling provides the first chance to make his mark. Low-margin bottlers are in the business of picking up pennies. Applying that mindset more rigorously to Coke’s marketing-led model should yield efficiencies.Longer-term, Mr Kent’s strategic challenge is like that faced by Microsoft – what to do when you sell the soft drink equivalent of Windows in a mature market? Fortunately, Coke’s strong balance sheet and free cash flow provide the necessary tools. In the meantime, streamlining the existing operation should give investors a short-term rush.Post and read comment on this LexLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

714;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-06-27T21:36:53Z;Marketing man lands top BBC radio job;;The transfer of the BBC’s most senior marketing man to take control of the corporation’s radio and music, one of its top editorial jobs, was described as “provocative” by a senior ex-BBC figure on Friday.Tim Davie, a former PepsiCo executive who became the BBC’s marketing director three years ago, has been given the biggest job in the British radio industry as director of BBC audio and music.He replaces Jenny Abramsky, who is leaving the BBC in September after 39 years to chair the Heritage Lottery Fund, at a time when the BBC’s power in radio is under increasing scrutiny as commercial rivals struggle.Mr Davie’s new role puts him in charge of Radios 1, 2, 3, 4 and Five Live analogue stations and digital channels from 1Xtra to the Asian Network. He will also be responsible for the BBC’s three orchestras in England, the BBC Singers and the BBC Proms.His appointment marks the replacement of a lifelong BBC programmer with a marketing executive who trained at Procter & Gamble and joined PepsiCo in 1993, rising to become vice-president, marketing and franchise for the soft drinks and snacks group across Europe.It comes amid a debate about the public service role of BBC services such as Radio 1 and Radio 2, which rivals accuse of being excessively commercial.He will find himself involved in debate about the future of digital radio, to which the BBC is committed. He will have to call on his experience of the outside world when working alongside commercial radio companies and Channel 4 to rationalise the current disparate provision of digital stations.“This will certainly be seen as a provocative appointment inside the BBC because this must be the most senior post to be occupied by someone from the world of marketing,” a former senior executive of the BBC told the FT.A current executive, who has worked alongside Mr Davie, added: “I think Tim’s good: he has a lot of drive and he will try to achieve a position where everybody in the industry understands what we are all trying to do.“I think it is a message from Mark [Thompson, director-general] that radio is now one part of the multiplatform media and you don’t need to be a dyed-in-the-wool, 30-year radio person to take charge of it.“But it is hard to get away from the fact that it is a drawback that he is not a radio man. He loves music, but that doesn’t automatically translate into a deep and subtle understanding of the network.“He comes with a very steep learning curve.”Mr Davie, 41, a Cambridge graduate, is married with three sons.
715;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;Bunge to buy Corn Products for $4.4bn;;"Bunge, the world’s largest oilseed processor, has agreed to buy Corn Products International, a producer of high-fructose corn syrup and food additives, for $4.4bn, as the boom in commodity prices prompts US agribusinesses to seek increased global scale.The acquisition shows how the fast-growing agricultural sector has given companies in the industry increased purchasing power and has driven them to look for ways to expand their share of global markets.Underlining how its bottom line has been boosted by strong growth in fertiliser and oilseed prices, Bunge also on Monday increased its 2008 earnings forecast more than 30 per cent from $7.10-$7.40 per share to $9.35-$9.65 per share.The increase does not include the effects of the acquisition, which the company expects to close in the fourth quarter.Grain prices have spiked across the board in the past year, with corn one of the star performers.Increasing demand from emerging economies, the flooding of corn-producing areas in the Midwest in recent weeks and the needs of the ethanol industry have all pushed prices to record highs.Under the terms of the deal, every Corn Products share will be exchanged for $56 in Bunge stock, a 31 per cent premium to the company’s closing price of $42.90 on Friday. Bunge said it expects synergies of $100m-$120m a year. Corn Products shareholders will own about 21 per cent of Bunge once the deal closes.Corn Products, based in Westchester, Illinois, makes corn syrup for companies such as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Kellogg, Unilever and Nestlé.Alberto Weisser, Bunge chief executive, said the two companies had talked a
decade ago about a takeover and had revisited the subject on several occasions. He said the timing had not been right until now, as Bunge had been focusing on organic growth and riding out difficult times for the farming sector in 2005 and 2006.Mr Weisser said the combined company would be able to offer customers “a complete package” from raw materials to value-added ingredients. “Customers like depth in product lines, in size and in scale,” he said.Bunge said the deal extends its presence in North and South America, while offering opportunities to build on Corn Products sales in emerging economies.“This is a good deal for both companies,” wrote David Driscoll, an analyst at Citi Investment Research, in a research note.“Corn Products gets a substantial premium to its prior closing price … and Bunge uses its very strong stock as its currency to do the deal.”"
716;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-06-17T18:53:21Z;Wimm-Bill-Dann resists multinational bite;;Multinational food companies are moving into Russia to snap up local businesses but Russian group Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods says it is determined to make acquisitions of its own and remain independent.“We’re still in acquisition mode,” says Tony Maher, Wimm-Bill-Dann’s chief executive.Russian dairies remain among the group’s targets, even as they became harder to buy as the dairy sector consolidates, he says.Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, warned recently that Russian consumer goods companies were becoming more vulnerable as multinationals move in.“We consider multinational companies to be a long-standing threat to take market share away from local companies,” S&P said.Multinationals had an advantage over Russian companies because they have better long-term access to capital, it added.International food groups believe Russia will become one of the strongest consumer markets in Europe over the next few years as its expanding economy makes people wealthier.Goldman Sachs recently increased its forecast for Russian gross domestic product for this year to 7.5 per cent, from 7 per cent, due to high levels of investment in the country.Meanwhile, growth in household consumption is running at 12.8 per cent compared with 11.2 per cent in 2006.International food companies that have made big acquisitions in Russia over the past year to take advantage of the country’s growth include Unilever, PepsiCo, Kellogg, Kraft, Nestlé, Coca-Cola and Carlsberg.Wimm-Bill-Dann has also attracted the interest of foreign buyers, such as French dairy group Danone. It has remained independent, although Danone has quietly built up a stake, today owning some 18 per cent.The company’s Russian founders, a group of about half a dozen individuals, control the company with a 47 per cent share, allowing it to defend itself from unwelcome predators.Wimm-Bill-Dann, which was established in the early 1990s and specialises in selling mid-priced dairy foods such as milk, cheese and yoghurts, as well as baby food and juices, has been one of Russia’s most successful consumer goods companies, with its market capitalisation tripling over the past two years to about $5.5bn.Listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2002, its American depositary receipts have been trading at over $120 per share, up from about $37 per share, over the same period.It is the leader in the Russian dairy market, with some two-thirds of the market, although it has lost the top spot in beverages to Lebedyanksy, the juice company recently bought by PepsiCo.Wimm-Bill-Dann has grown by acquiring dairy producers and processors throughout Russia, giving it the scale to compete successfully, and it has also benefited from expansion in the Russian dairy market.The Russian market for packaged dairy foods grew to 10.1bn litres in 2006 from 8.7bn litres in 2004.But the company also plans to focus on developing its national dairy brands, which have folksy names including “Little House in the Village”, “Happy Milkman” and “Kuban Cow”.Mr Maher, who has been chief executive of Wimm-Bill-Dann for the past two years after joining the company from Coca-Cola, says Russians like brands.“They’re conspicuous consumers. As they get more money, they trade up …We estimate that real incomes have doubled over the past five years.”He says Wimm-Bill-Dann’s annual sales, which were $1.4bn two years ago, will reach $3bn this year and $4.5bn-$5bn by 2010. In the first quarter, sales rose 35 per cent to $732m while net income increased 30 per cent to $42m.Like other food companies, Wimm-Bill-Dann has suffered from higher raw material prices, particularly milk prices, which were up 62 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same quarter last year.It has been cutting costs to compensate, including using its dairy factories to make juice.“We probably saw the worst of [Russian food price inflation] last year,” Mr Maher says.
717;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Final encore for a man of the people;;"Neville Isdell is an imposing figure; more than six feet tall and solidly built, he is often referred to in the media as a former rugby player, a reference to his sporting days at university in South Africa. But as he prepares to step down after four years as chief executive of Coca-Cola, it is a more nuanced biographical detail that he prefers to accentuate.“My major was sociology; I’m a qualified social worker,” he says. “I do think it is all about people.”When he took the helm in June 2004, many of the people at Coke were not very happy. Neither were the board nor the shareholders. Nor were the independent bottlers who mix and distribute Coke, Sprite and the group’s other leading brands.The world’s biggest soft drink company seemed to have lost its way after the dramatic global expansion in the 1990s under Roberto Goizueta. Sales of sparkling drinks in the US were in decline and its marketing was uninspired. Its strategy was unclear: Coke had lost out to PepsiCo in a battle for Gatorade and had abandoned a botched attempt to launch its Dasani water brand in Europe. There was also a simmering war going on with its independent bottlers over price increases.Mr Isdell, a former senior bottling executive who turns 65 this month, was enticed out of retirement by a board that wanted a chief executive who knew both sides of the Coke system – meaning both CocaCola and the bottlers.He says he had a clear idea about what he wanted to achieve, and how he intended to go about it. “You don’t want to come and do quick fixes. When I accepted I agreed with the board that I was going to set it up for the long term and I believe that I have,” he says.Within his first month, Mr Isdell made two substantial changes, appointing a new head of human resources who would report directly to him – giving him close control over what he calls “the people equation” – and creating a new “bottling investment group” to repair the relationship between the two halves of the business.His next move was to create a shared agreement among Coke’s own people about what needed to be done. It was important, he says, to focus on the obvious question of what exactly Coca-Cola was, and what it was not, in spite of a clamour of calls from investors and analysts for action on everything from Coke’s assertive board to its lack of non-carbonated beverages.Before his arrival, he says, Coke had various strategic statements about its purpose. “But there was [no] coherence to them and…there were clearly mixed messages out there.”So in the summer of 2004, 150 of Coke’s top managers were brought together for three days in Miami, for a series of discussions on a new “manifesto”. In the break-out sessions, Mr Isdell sat listening to people “pour out what they felt was wrong”. “That is an important part of the rebuilding process …And then you say, ‘here’s what you said is wrong with our business…so what are we going to do about it?’”Mr Isdell’s people skills are integral to his management style. He is at pains to put people at their ease, a characteristic shown by his habit of waiting outside the interview room to greet his guests.He can also still deliver an authentic Northern Irish accent, although he left his birthplace for southern Africa at the age of 10.After leaving university, Mr Isdell joined Coke’s local bottler in Zambia in 1966, and six years later became general manager of Coca-Cola Bottling of Johannesburg, the largest Coke bottler in Africa. Subsequently, he held positions in Australia, the Philippines and Germany, before moving to Europe and spearheading the expansion of Coke into new markets in India, the Middle East and eastern Europe and Russia in the 1990s.By the time he retired for the first time in 2001, he was vice-chairman of Coca-Cola HBC, the company’s leading European bottler. He was running his own Barbados-based investment company when he was called back by Coke.Mr Isdell’s long history at the company strengthened his resolve to focus on core products. At one break-out session in Miami, managers echoed Wall Street analysts who were suggesting that Coke should try to emulate Pepsi’s acquisition of the Frito-Lay snack company, which reduced its dependency on the historically declining fizzy drinks business.“My reply was simply this: ‘You’re all telling me that we are not running our own business at all well. So why would we buy another business, and think we could run that any better than the people who are there? Unless, you’re telling me that we need to get their management to come and run our business.’“That closed down that debate. That’s where you swing it, and they say, ‘Got it, we’re clear.’”The new manifesto, by his own admission, “is not earth shattering”; it says, for instance, that the company will “reinvigorate growth…by building a portfolio of branded beverages, anchored in our icon, Coca-Cola”. But, he says, “it does reflect who and what we are”.Armed with $400m in additional spending on marketing and innovation from the board, he helped select Weiden & Kennedy as Coke’s new advertising agency – working with Mary Minnick, whom he had brought to Atlanta from Asia in May 2005 to head marketing and innovation.Ms Minnick’s proven talents created one of the toughest decisions of the four years – who would become the next chief executive.Mr Isdell’s preference was for Muhtar Kent, rather than Ms Minnick. The two had worked together at the Amatil-Europe bottling subsidiary, building market share in eastern Europe in the 1990s.However, Mr Kent had left Coke in 1998 after a sale of Amatil shares led to his investigation by Australian regulators for alleged insider trading. But Mr Isdell was convinced of his former colleague’s leadership potential and persuaded the board the younger man should return to Coke.In 2006 Mr Kent was appointed chief operating officer and the following year was named international president. Though Ms Minnick subsequently left the company, Mr Isdell says he would have loved her to stay.As Mr Isdell prepares to stand down, he says that the toughest period came 18 months after he took over, when Wall Street and the media could see no measurable improvements. Then, he said, he focused on keeping people on course, by preparing them for a difficult stage that he argues is part of every turnround effort.“You know it’s working. But most people don’t believe it’s working…That’s when people tend to panic, and go back to short termism. And then you have to stick with it…talked to everyone a lot about that, just to make sure I kept those people with me.”Under Mr Isdell, the company has recorded steady international sales growth of more than 4 per cent over the past 12 quarters. And while sales in the US are being depressed by the slowdown in economic demand, he argues that the key carbonated drinks business is “on track” for better results, supported by initiatives such as new bottle design.Mr Isdell believes Mr Kent is, like himself, a man with people skills, and describes the UK-educated son of a Turkish diplomat as “ambassadorial”.“He’s one of the world’s great best networkers, and that’s what you need in the business that we’re in. He’s really excellent at that.”"

Hogg Robinson had also signed up a number of new clients which would begin to benefit the group in the new financial year, and after a restructuring of the business he was “cautiously optimistic” about the future and predicting growth in the new financial year.New clients include Ericsson, Lloyds TSB, Pepsico and the UK’s Ministry of Defence and Foreign & Commonwealth Office.The shares edged higher in opening trade, up ¾p to 42p.While approaching 80 per cent of the group’s revenues came from managed clients, the remaining business relied on one-off bookings made for clients without long term contracts and in events management, and these areas had been weaker. Mr Radcliffe said the group had been slow in spotting that trend but had now cut costs to the level of demand.Julian Steadman, the group’s new finance director, had decided to take a £2.4m exceptional charge against one long-term contract in North America where he felt there were unrecoverable costs. He said he was happy with the group’s other contracts. The charge was more than offset by a £4.4m gain following the settlement of a dispute with Kuoni Reisen, the Swiss travel group.Profits fell in the group’s European business and a loss was incurred in North America, but the group’s business in Asia Pacific moved into profit.The group held its final dividend at 2.8p to give a total of 4p, representing 73 per cent of earnings per share. It said it was committed to at least maintaining the annual dividend at that rate and once earnings increased would aim for a payout in the 50 to 65 per cent range.Hogg Robinson floated out of private equity ownership in October 2006 at 90p a share, but the share price has been weak since, after a profit warning in June last year, and another in March. However, stake building by BCD, the private Dutch rival to Hogg Robinson, had raised expectations of a bid. BCD recently lifted its holding to over 16 per cent.Mr Radcliffe said he could not comment on what BCD’s intentions might be.The group increased revenues in the year to March by 6.7 per cent to £332.2m, with organic revenue growth of 2 per cent. It reported a fall in earnings before interest, tax and amortisation by £3.8m to £40.3m, but the previous year benefited to the tune of £3.4m from the Fifa World Cup.Pre-tax profits were up from £12.9m to £25.2m after a much lower interest charge following the flotation. Reported earnings per share were up from 4.3p to 5.5p.
719;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-05-22T20:53:46Z;Fall in jobless claims lifts Wall St;;Wall Street stocks rallied modestly in light trading on Thursday after an unexpected fall in the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits cheered investors, but a retreat in some commodities prices hit related stocks and whittled gains.According to the Labor Department, initial jobless claims fell by 9,000 to 365,000 last week, suggesting that while labour markets remain sickly they are not deteriorating. Economists had expected claims to rise moderately. Still, the trend seems clear as the four-week average for claims rose marginally to 372,250.Early momentum helped investors shrug off the latest numbers on house prices from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. House prices fell 3.1 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, faster than analysts predicted. The numbers will reinforce fears that, amid tightening lending standards at US banks and rising foreclosures, the already prolonged housing slump has further to run.After a day of range-bound trading, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,394.35 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 12,625.62 points. The Nasdaq Composite rebounded 0.7 per cent to 2,464.58.So far this week, equities have been rattled by worrying reports on inflation and squeezed by the relentless rise in oil prices, which threaten to curb consumer spending, hit corporate profits and slow already weak economic growth.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve spooked investors, indicating that it was finished with rate cuts for the moment even as it slashed its economic growth forecasts and raised its projections for inflation and unemployment.Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said: “The market is still looking for some direction. We have had two days of heavy selling, we are heading into a long holiday weekend and I think people are taking a breather and reassessing the situation.”At the open, the broader stock market looked vulnerable to yet another spike in energy prices as oil briefly pushed through $135, driven by a fall in US stocks of crude. But by the close the picture had reversed, as commodities fell back, knocking related stocks but allowing the other industry groups to pull away. The energy sector fell 1.1 per cent while materials lost 0.3.Consumer discretionary stocks wobbled between gains and losses as Ford said it would take longer than forecast to break even due to higher costs and slower sales. Ford fell 8.2 per cent to $7.16 and General Motors slipped 3.6 per cent to $18.43.Limited Brands helped cushion losses, however, after the operator of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain posted estimate-beating earnings. Limited Brands rose 3 per cent to $18.85 while the broader sector added 0.2 per cent.Wendy’s also made ground after William Ackman, the hedge fund manager who is the largest shareholder in the hamburger chain, said the company could increase its value dramatically by selling stores and real estate. Wendy’s shares rose 6 per cent to $29.73.Financials were unlikely winners, but joined a suite of heavily sold sectors that bounced back. They rose 0.9 per cent, led higher by Citigroup and JP Morgan which added 3.1 per cent to $21.72 and 1.5 per cent to $43.05 respectively.The sector advanced despite the fact that a leading banking analyst slashed his 2008 earnings for a number of the big brokerages. Richard Bove of Ladenburg Thalmann suggested selling shares in Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, knocking shares in all three.Consumer staples were the main gainers, adding 1.1 per cent – their biggest rise since the start of April – on analyst upgrades and improved sentiment as investors moved into counter-cyclicals.CVS Caremark, the pharmacy chain, added 1.5 per cent to $42.59 while PepsiCo and Coca-Cola rose 1.7 per cent to $68.38 and 2.9 per cent to $57.27.Deal news was another bright spot. NRG Energy, the second-biggest power producer in Texas, made an unsolicited offer to buy Calpine, the largest producer of electricity from gas-fired plants in the US, for $9.6bn in stock. Calpine rose 8.1 per cent to $23 while NRG slipped 5.1 per cent to $40.35.
720;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-05-21T17:43:03Z;Better ‘still’ drink sales help to restore Britvic;;UK consumers’ appetites for increased energy have affected the soft-drinks market with Britvic, the owner of Robinsons squash and Drench water, reporting slower sales of traditional carbonated drinks as people switch to energy drinks.The drinks group, which reported a 13 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to £17.2m, said it was making up for weak sales of fizzy drinks by stronger sales of “still” drinks such as its squashes and waters.Paul Moody, chief executive, said the market for fruit carbonates was performing very poorly: “Lemonade is pretty much a commodity now,” he said.Mr Moody said glucose-based drinks – such as Lucozade – and energy drinks – such as Red Bull – were the fastest-growing part of the soft-drink market. Britvic hopes to tap into the glucose market with Gatorade this year and will consider expanding further in the energy market. It already owns Red Devil, the Dutch energy drink.Analysts said Britvic’s sales in the six months to mid-April were good, given poor overall sales volume increase of 0.4 per cent in the soft-drinks market.Britvic’s shares rose 4p to 329½p after Mr Moody said the group would meet its earnings goals this year and that “growth trends” appeared to be improving.Britvic performed better than the overall market in sales of still (non-carbonated) drinks. Its sales volumes rose 5.9 per cent. The market fell 1.1 per cent. But in fizzy drinks it lagged behind the market, with a volume increase of 0.2 per cent against a market increase of 2.2 per cent.Mr Moody blamed “aggressive” Christmas discounting by rivals for the slower increase in fizzy drinks. “We chose to focus on value rather than volumes,”he said.Britvic said raw material costs would rise 4 per cent this year. It would not be able to recoup that by increasing prices but by other cost cuts, such as using less plastic in bottles.Sales increased 29 per cent to £454.7m. The interim dividend is raised 15 per cent to 3.8p. earnings per share were 6.1p (5p).FT CommentBritvic has done a good job of turning round its soft- drinks business after failing to anticipate how quickly consumer taste was shifting from carbonated drinks. The group will continue to benefit from its relationship with Pepsi – it owns the rights to the Pepsi brands in the UK – as the US company develops natural colas such as Pepsi Raw. On a price/earnings ratio of 10.8 times 2009 estimated earnings, Britvic trades at a discount to competitors such as AG Barr and looks cheap.
721;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-05-01T19:41:13Z;Cadbury goes solo as a confectionery group;;Cadbury shares are expected to be worth about 640p each when it starts trading solely as a confectionery group on Friday before listing its drinks arm on the New York Stock Exchange next week.Cadbury Schweppes shares rose 2 per cent this week before closing at 574½p on Thursday as Mars’s $23bn (£11.7bn) acquisition of Wrigley renewed speculation that Cadbury could be taken over by another confectionery company, possibly Kraft.Cadbury Schweppes’s shares have now been de-listed and replaced with Cadbury plc shares ahead of the listing of Dr Pepper Snapple Group next Thursday.A price of 640p reflects a relatively high price-earnings valuation for Cadbury, compared with other food companies, at about 23 times 2008 earnings.Shares of Dr Pepper have started trading in the so-called “grey market”, an unofficial market of newly-listed stock, at about $27.50 a share. This is below analysts’ expectations of at least $30 a share and if the shares remain at this level, Dr Pepper would have an enterprise value of about £5.3bn.Analysts said that the price of Dr Pepper shares in the grey market reflected uncertainty about the group’s future earnings growth, as well as worries that many British investors would sell the shares due to restrictions on holding foreign investments.The listing of Dr Pepper comes after Cadbury warned last month of a slowdown in its US fizzy drinks business, which owns brands such as Dr Pepper and 7-Up. Americans are drinking less fizzy drinks, with consumption at its lowest level since 1993, according to Beverage Digest, the drinks newsletter.Other soft drinks companies are suffering as Americans switch to healthier drinks such as fruit juices and bottled water, with both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo reporting declines in their first-quarter sales volumes.Cadbury re-confirmed earlier guidance this week that Dr Pepper’s long-term sales growth would be in the range of 3 to 5 per cent, while earnings per share growth would be in the “high single digits”.
722;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;OFT focuses on beverages in price-fix probe;;The Office of Fair Trading is also looking into beverages as part of its latest probe into alleged price-fixing between supermarkets and their suppliers, with requests for information sent to Coca-Cola Enterprises and Britvic.Coca-Cola Enterprises, the world’s largest soft drink bottler, said that it had been asked to provide information to the OFT and that it may have to meet the regulators.Britvic acknowledged on Monday night that it had also been contacted by the watchdog. The soft drinks group owns the Pepsi, Robinsons and Tango brands.The drinks companies join a growing raft of suppliers that are under scrutiny from the watchdog. Nestlé, the maker of Nescafé coffee and Maggi instant noodles, confirmed on Monday that it, too, had been contacted by the OFT.The requests for information followed coordinated visits to the big four supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison – and Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer goods company, last Thursday.Mars, the maker of Pedigree and Unilever, the company behind the Dove brand, has been sent letters by the OFT seeking to arrange visits to its offices while Reckitt Benckiser, which manufactures Finish dishwasher products and Veet hair removal cream, confirmed that it also had received a letter requesting information, although it had not been asked for a face-to-face meeting.The breadth of product categories that the OFT is looking into has surprised the supermarket chains. Previous probes into alleged price-fixing have focused on specific categories – milk and tobacco – rather than a wide basket of goods. However, this time the OFT is looking at a fistful of products such as batteries, bread, confectionery, health and beauty goods, cleaning fluids and fresh vegetables.Retail insiders said on Monday that they were baffled by the range of products and relationships under scrutiny and they believed that the watchdog was on a “fishing exercise” to see if it could unearth any evidence of collusion over prices.The latest probe comes on the heels of last week’s report from the watchdog alleging price-fixing in the £10bn-a-year cigarette market in the UK between 2002-03.Meanwhile, its probe into milk price-fixing during the same time period resulted in supermarkets and dairies agreeing to pay fines of up to £116m ($230m) last December. However, Tesco and Morrison have continued to deny any wrongdoing in the investigation.The OFT’s latest probe will do little to ease growing tensions between supermarkets and the watchdog. Retailers are angry at the watchdog’s strategy of mounting high-profile investigations into industries that resonate with consumers.Lombard: Be fair to the OFT

724;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-04-21T21:35:25Z;Green in fashion for HK’s rag trade;;"Leading Hong Kong clothing manufacturers are coming together to reduce the environmental impact of their factories in response to growing pressure from international retailers.The group, the Sustainable Fashion Business Consortium, is being launched today, World Earth Day.Many Chinese suppliers are being told to clean up operations from their US and European customers.Leading the charge is Wal-Mart. The world’s biggest retailer will in October convene a meeting of 1,000 of its suppliers to set goals for reducing their impact on the environment.Well-known brands such as L’Oréal and Pepsi now ask suppliers to measure their carbon footprints.The 12 companies in the Hong Kong consortium represent every part of the production process, from design to yarn-spinning and textiles, and garment manufacture.Its members supply Marks & Spencer, the UK retail chain, Brooks Brothers, Gap and other brands.Pat-Nie Woo, consortium chairman, said the group was formed to help manufacturers work with retailers, government and agencies to promote environmentally sustainable practices.“To be honest, nobody is sustainable at the moment,” he said.Initial goals include devising a carbon accounting standard specific to the clothing factory.This would allow companies to put labels on clothing that detail its carbon footprint, a feature demanded by more and more retailers and brands.“There has been a very top-down approach towards sustainability by brands and retailers who say: ‘You guys have to do this or we are not buying from you’,” he told the FT.“But in the end, who is running the factories? We are in the best position to tell you what is the best way to calculate the carbon footprint or what are the best green processes to adopt,” said Mr Woo, who is also a director of Central Textiles, one of only two large yarn spinners in Hong Kong.Other companies in the Hong Kong consortium are: TAL Apparel, which supplies Burberry, JC Penny and Nordstrom among others; ladies lingerie maker Ace Style; and Crystal Group, a supplier to Anne Taylor, H&M and Levis.The companies, which predominantly manufacture in mainland China, produce more than 500m yards of fabric and 250m garments every year.With the World Wildlife Fund the group is working to develop low-carbon manufacturing processes in the Pearl River Delta manufacturing hub. The hope is that companies adopting those processes could then sell the resulting reduction in their carbon dioxide emissions as carbon credits.The consortium also aims to come up with a package of measures to reduce waste and streamline production processes.One planned project, for example, looks at ways to recycle leftover pieces of fabric, which account for up to 20 per cent of the total amount of fabric used by a typical garment factory.“It effectively saves you money and it is a great story to tell your customers,” Mr Woo said."
725;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Coke gets lift from international business;;Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drinks company, shook off the effects of the US consumer slowdown during its first quarter, delivering results that beat Wall Street’s expectations on strong international demand and currency benefits.Coke’s earnings rose 19 per cent to $1.5bn, or 64 cents per share, while revenues increased 21 per cent to $7.4bn.Without currency gains, revenues would have increased by 12 per cent.Neville Isdell, who steps down as chief executive this summer, said the company was “off to a good start” for the year and expected to achieve its growth targets for 2008.However, Coke’s performance in North America, where it is striving to revitalise its sparkling-drinks business, were hit by the decline in visits to restaurants and fast-food outlets that has resulted from the economic downturn.Muhtar Kent, chief operating officer and Mr Isdell’s designated successor, said Coke was facing a “challenging” macro-economic environment in North America, with away-from-home consumption hit hardest during the quarter.“There’s a move from on-premises to more home consumption and we’re realigning our marketing programmes all the time on a flexible basis to ensure we can capture whatever opportunities are out there.”Sales on a unit case basis of both sparkling and non-sparkling drinks were flat for the quarter in North America, with foodservice and hospitality sales down 4 per cent, and retail sales up 2 per cent.However, its non-sparkling drink sales, which include last May’s $4.2bn acquisition of Glaceau and sales of Fuze juices, increased 10 per cent.Coke said it had launched Glaceau in Australia during the first quarter and was looking at further international expansion later in the year.In Europe, the company also launched a range of canned expresso coffees in the first stage of a global partnership with Illycaffè, the Italian coffee brand, which will expand eventually to North America, where its rival PepsiCo has seen strong growth in its Starbucks brand canned coffees.Mr Kent said the company had yet to see any evidence of the US slowdown having any impact on demand in Latin America.“We have not yet seen any impact not just in Mexico, but across Latin America, although certainly that could be a risk going forward.”Coke reported a 20 per cent increase in volume sales in China, and double- digit increases in India, Turkey, Russia and eastern Europe.Sales outside North America account for 75 per cent of Coke’s total revenues.
726;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-04-15T17:10:53Z;QBE’s reputation goes before it in move for rival IAG;;QBE’s reputation for not overpaying is well-known in the Australian market and has not been lost on previous owners of its acquisition targets.But QBE’s cash-and-shares proposal to buy Australian rival Insurance Australia Group looks a little on the mean side. By QBE’s measure (three month weighted average prices) its offer is at a 12 per cent premium, while IAG says it is a miserly 1 per cent above its closing price at the end of last week.Although it says it wants a recommendation, QBE says its proposal remains on the table until Monday despite the forthright rejection of IAG’s board.Keeping the proposal open in such a way is not the friendliest tactic, while QBE’s decision to publicise its own deal was also attacked by IAG’s board, which had agreed to confidentiality. Both sides admit there are synergies to be had from throwing the businesses together.IAG would be part of an internationally focused group, while an enlarged QBE would strengthen its position in Australia’s car and home insurance markets.IAG’s shareholders have not had the smoothest ride in recent years and the trading performance has been poor. But QBE, which has honed its M&A skills in dozens of deals under canny boss Frank O’Halloran, can probably afford a bit more, and IAG’s closing price on Tuesday indicates it might need to return with a better offer.Food for thoughtYoghurts are certainly not a strategic sector, but that did not stop the French government a few years ago erecting all sorts of barricades to prevent PepsiCo launching a takeover bid for the French dairy champion Danone. The government’s reaction was all the more absurd since Paris was responding only to rumours. Indeed, the US multinational never even confirmed an interest in Danone.Danone hardly qualifies as a French company these days. France now accounts for barely 14 per cent of sales, and this is one reason why it is currently in such good form. Its broad geographical mix is one factor behind the impressive 18.7 per cent rise in the group’s first quarter sales.There are two other reasons for Danone’s performance. First is the investment in the fast-growing baby food and clinical nutrition sector by acquiring Numico. It paid a full price for the Dutch company but it is reaping dividends. The strong growth in its new baby food operations is helping Danone outperform the market’s expectations.Then there is the strength of its brands, enabling the company to raise prices. This has more than offset raw material costs and maintained margins. Danone confirmed this week it still expects earnings per share to grow by more than 15 per cent this year.The worst also seems to be over in China. Although Danone is still in litigation with its Chinese partner Wahaha, it is increasingly relying on Numico for its exposure to this important market where it now intends to adopt a go-it-alone strategy.Time for a policy rethinkNo change to strategy. No change to dividend policy. The same listing arrangements, in the same countries, on the same blue-chip indices. No staff relocation or job losses.Thus, seemingly at the stroke of the pen, Shire will be transformed from a UK-based pharmaceuticals company into a new entity incorporated in the British Channel Islands and resident in Ireland. One report on Tuesday accidentally coined a euphonious new word for the group’s manoeuvre – “avoision”. Shire says it is “protecting” its tax position.Whatever it’s called, Shire is one of the first FTSE 100 companies to make such a change unprompted by the need for wider corporate restructuring. Even if the actual (unspecified) amounts at stake are small, its decision is a symbol of the UK Treasury’s deteroriating relations with business.Almost every UK-based multinational must be considering something similar. At companies such as Shire, which earn the large majority of their income outside the UK, it would be a dereliction of duty for finance directors not to present options for improving tax efficiency to their boards. Some efficiencies can be realised without shifting across the Irish Sea or English Channel. But as tax competition hots up, the relocation option must look attractive.Happily for the UK Treasury, it is not that simple. Shire must perform contortions to allow shareholders to continue to take dividends from a UK-resident company, for instance. But if others are not to follow Shire’s lead – and perhaps go further and relocate people, not just nameplates – Britain needs to re-examine its policies. It cannot be good for investment in Britain if large UK tax residents feel, for whatever reason, they need to protect themselves against what the future holds.world.view@ft.com
727;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-04-07T20:53:08Z;Productivity gain from starting the weekend early;;"At half past three every Friday afternoon at Zehnder Communications, the words of Homer Simpson ring out over the PA system: “I would kill everyone in the room for a drop of sweet beer.” Then the beer gets cracked open (with soft drinks for abstemious types).For the past 12 years, staff at the New Orleans advertising agency have enjoyed “Free Beer Fridays”.“We wanted to do something regularly that would make this a great place to work,” explains Jeff Zehnder, chief executive. “It’s a cool-down period, a chance to get to know each other and talk over the week.”At the Montreal offices of design software business Autodesk, there’s a similar policy: Friday afternoons are all about beer and chips. “You can stop work at 4pm,” the company says, to sample “different kinds of speciality locally brewed beers, wines and a variety of potato chips. We do sometimes watch clients’ films, but mainly it’s just a good chance to unwind, relax and catch up with each other. It’s very well appreciated.”Others go further. “Summer hours” are a long-established institution in the US. Typically, from May to October, staff are allowed to arrive at work earlier in the mornings and then leave at lunchtime on Fridays. According to HR consulting firm Hewitt Associates, 10-12 per cent of large American employers offer staff this option. In the UK, PepsiCo offers it to staff at its Reading headquarters.Although allowing an early end to the week may seem like a nice thing to do, there are good reasons why this might be the best use of a Friday afternoon. The thing is, even if employers don’t give staff a winding down period, they’re likely to be doing it anyway.Research by UK-based Employment Law Advisory Services suggested that British businesses were losing £50m a year from employees skipping off on Friday afternoons. The firm found that bogus meetings, over-running lunches and doctor’s appointments were the top three excuses. And these findings are bolstered by research from the Automobile Association, the motor breakdown service, which suggests that the Friday afternoon rush hour in fact starts at noon.“It’s an endemic global phenomenon,” says Peter Mooney, ELAS head of consultancy. “It’s amazing how often you can send an e-mail or make a phone call and not get any response until Monday morning. More and more workers are seeing Friday afternoon as an unofficial holiday.”Sebastian Bailey, a director at the Mind Gym learning and development consultancy, says that, in many companies, even if staff are present their minds may be elsewhere. “Staff tend to wind down on Fridays if there aren’t pressing deadlines…People take their foot off the gas. Cyber-slacking with sites like Facebook is particularly prevalent.” Indeed, so well known is this phenomenon that it is enshrined in the language: “A Friday afternoon car” refers to a sub-standard vehicle, presumed to have been built after lunch on a Friday; and Friday is also sometimes known as ‘POETS’ day (piss off early, tomorrow’s Saturday).So, the thinking goes, as a business you may as well get the credit for something that your staff are probably going to do anyway. And besides, those who provide relaxed get-togethers give their staff an opportunity to bond, get to know people they don’t work with in their immediate environment and talk over the week’s issues. Perhaps companies that let staff wind down on a Friday afternoon will be more productive than those that keep them working up to the final bell.“By letting people go a little earlier or have beer and pizza on Friday afternoons, you create goodwill, engagement and loyalty,” says Mr Bailey, adding that the payback often comes in the form of greater effort at other times. Mr Zehnder puts it slightly more pithily: “If you work here, you bust your ass all week. By Friday afternoon, you’re brain dead.”"

Nestlé and Boost Juice will spend £5m on a marketing campaign.Nestlé is overhauling its UK business by focusing on its core confectionery brands such as Kit Kat – which returned to profitable growth last year after losing sales and market share – and also on its “health and wellness” products.Smoothies remain one of the fastest-growing parts of the soft drinks market. Marks & Spencer and other retailers sell own-brand smoothies to compete with market leaders Innocent and PJ Smoothies, which is owned by PepsiCo.Total take-home sales of smoothies rose 31 per cent last year to £214m, according to the Britvic soft drinks report. Innocent, whose sales rose 46 per cent to £141m, controls more than half the market.If Nestlé’s smoothies are successful in the UK it will expand sales of the drinks to other countries.Multinational food and drink companies are increasingly trialling products in the UK because they believe British consumers are on the leading edge of trends.PepsiCo recently started selling Pepsi Raw, made with cane sugar and extract of natural plants such as the kola nut, in the UK to see how consumers would respond to an almost completely natural version of the soft drink.Simon Lowden, the chief marketing officer of Pepsi International, said: “We certainly expect it to be more broadly available than just the UK.”This is the first time Nestlé has sold a smoothie made from fresh juices in the UK. The Swiss company spent 18 months developing the drink with Boost Juice, which has about 180 stores globally, including eight in Britain.

About 8 per cent is held by individual entities.The biggest single shareholder in the oil company is Albert Frère, the Belgian entrepreneur, with 5.3 per cent, while employees own 4 per cent.Safe could not be reached for comment.
730;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;Videocon makes an ambitious call on Motorola;;Videocon is the latest Indian company to test its global aspirations.The maker of televisions and washing machines is eyeing the handset business of Motorola, the 80-year-old US telecoms equipment group.Videocon this week submitted an “expression of interest” to Motorola days after the US company unveiled plans to separate its struggling handset business from other operations.Never mind that Motorola is not known to be soliciting bids.And never mind that Motorola has seen its global share of the wireless handset market almost halve over the past year.Videocon contends that Motorola’s handset business would be “synergistic” for its new foray into telecoms.The Indian company recently won a licence to launch mobile phone services in India, the world’s fastest-growing wireless market.And Videocon is rolling out a domestic retail chain that will sell appliances and electronics, including mobile phones.A bid would not be Videocon’s first leap beyond Indian shores.In 2005 it bought the television tube business of French group Thomson for $300m and the Indian appliance unit of Sweden’s Electrolux for $74m.Videocon’s move on Motorola is very ambitious.Reports indicate that Motorola’s handset business is worth about $3.8bn, more than Videocon’s annual revenues in the year ended September 2007.Videocon also led the ill-fated $750m bid for Daewoo Electronics of South Korea, which collapsed last year after protracted talks and disagreements over price.Making precision electronics such as mobile phones in India is no easy task. Neither is selling them.Finnish handset maker Nokia dominates about two-thirds of the market.Britain’s C-suite obstacleIt is hard to imagine being taken to task by Indra Nooyi.Speaking Wednesday in London, the chief executive of PepsiCo came across as a boss who is firm, fair, and full of wit and wisdom about modern office life.For example, when her assistants take calls from her teenage daughter pleading for more time on her Nintendo, they run through a Nooyi-approved checklist – “Have you done your homework?” and so on – before authorising the request and sending Ms Nooyi a note of what was agreed. She calls it “group mothering”.So far, so fluffy.But it would be dangerous to underestimate the steel at the heart of her approach.She e-mails colleagues through the night, expects “24/7” commitment from people working on deals for her, men or women, and acknowledges that when you choose to enter the “C-suite” of chief executives and chief financial officers, notions of flexibility and work-life balance tend to disappear.That’s no reason to accept the macho status quo, however.In addressing a question at the Women of the Future conference about why she chose the US, not the UK, in which to pursue her career 30 years ago, she went straight to the heart of a problem with corporate Britain.If she had chosen the UK, she said, she would not now be running a multinational company: “I look around at [British] society – I don’t see too many people like me in CEO positions. I don’t see people like me having broken through in major C-suite jobs.”The message is clear: Britain is lagging behind America on diversity.As Ms Nooyi suggests, it will take much more “tireless lobbying” before a tipping point is reached, and the number of women running Britain’s biggest 100 companies reaches even a small handful.However softly put, that is a hard message, but one that UK companies need to act on.French art revivalThe US and Britain, in that order, are the world’s two largest art markets. But what is the third? These days, it is no longer France but China. Globalisation is all very well, but this is clearly rattling the French government. So much so that the French culture minister Christine Albanel has decided to launch a campaign this week to revive the country’s art market through a battery of fiscal and financial incentives.Mrs Albanel is proposing to follow the UK example of introducing zero interest rate loans to encourage collectors and other buyers to acquire works of art. France currently accounts for only 6 per cent of the world art market. Half a century ago, the annual turnover of a Parisian auctioneer was higher than the combined sales of Sotheby’s and Christie’s.world.view@ft.com
731;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-04-02T19:16:40Z;Shed the boiler plate and let audit kitemarks take off;;Like a skull on the desk of a medieval scholar, a copy of Enron’s 2000 annual report – its last – sits on Lombard’s desk.From the opening letter from Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling – “Enron [is] the right company with the right model at the right time” – to the page of company values (Communication, Respect, Integrity, Excellence), there are plenty of moments to make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. The audit report by the late Arthur Andersen LLP is not one of them.The opinion is short and unremarkable. Would Andersen have survived had the report been a lengthy piece of boilerplate, stuffed with caveats and get-out clauses? Almost certainly not. Enron was a fraud. Andersen, while guilty of forming too close a relationship with its client in non-audit business, was brought down by a charge of obstruction of justice, not of lax auditing.But adopting a “kitemark” approach – as proposed now by KPMG’s John Griffith-Jones – might have made Andersen think twice before cosying up to Enron as it did. Instead of lengthy legalese, the co-chairman of KPMG Europe suggests a one-line endorsement that the accounts are, in the opinion of the firm, “about right”. The possibility of undetected fraud is the only escape clause.This is brave. It reminds the user that a “clean” audit report is an opinion, not a scientific fact. Too many shareholders misunderstand that fundamental point. Assuming the technology for eliminating material error in audits advances in the coming years, a kitemark approach might allow firms to concentrate on identifying fraud, which Mr Griffith-Jones calls “the weak link in the chain” of auditing.Like all principles-based approaches, whether in regulation or accounting, the kitemark risks falling to earth at the first gust of legal challenge if lawyers reach for the rulebook. But rather than making auditors think they can somehow dodge the blame by loading additional clauses on to their report, it should force them to shoulder more responsibility.Why mother knows bestIt is hard to imagine being taken to task by Indra Nooyi. Speaking yesterday in London, the chief executive of PepsiCo came across as a boss who is firm, fair, and full of wit and wisdom about modern office life.For example, when Ms Nooyi’s teenage daughter calls pleading for more time on her Nintendo, the PepsiCo boss’s assistants run through a Nooyi-approved checklist (“Have you done your homework?” and so on) before authorising the request and sending Ms Nooyi a note of what was agreed. She calls it “group mothering”.So far, so fluffy. But it would be dangerous to underestimate the steel at the heart of her approach. She e-mails colleagues through the night, expects “24/7” commitment from people working on deals for her (men or women) and acknowledges that when you choose to enter the “C-suite” of chief executives and chief financial officers, notions of flexibility and work-life balance tend to evaporate.That’s no reason to accept the macho status quo, however. In addressing a question at the Women of the Future conference about why she chose the US, not the UK, in which to pursue her career 30 years ago, she went straight to the heart of a problem with corporate Britain.If she had chosen the UK, she said, she would not now be running a multinational company: “I look around at [British] society – I don’t see too many people like me in CEO positions.

As Ms Nooyi suggests, it will take much more “tireless lobbying” before a tipping point is reached and the number of women running Britain’s biggest 100 companies reaches even a small handful. However softly put, that is a hard message, but one that UK companies must heed.The wonder of WooliefieldIt sounds like the high street’s ultimate two-for-one offer: drop into Somerfield for six pork pies, emerge with a value pack of Woolworths T-shirts, or vice versa. The unworthy first reaction to the retailers’ reciprocal store-within-a-store pilot project was that two drowning men were clinging to each other for support. There is a warped logic to the idea. Each group is lumbered with hundreds of branches, in varying sizes, so why not see if product exchange leads to an overall increase in footfall?It’s been done before, of course. Last year, WH Smith agreed to open Post Offices in some stores and Boots to sell Prudential’s health insurance. Older shoppers may remember a similar idea: small outlets in close proximity peddling their wares to people as they pass by. That pilot project lasted millennia before it was blown away by the arrival of Woolworths, WH Smith, Boots, and their ilk. It was called a market.
732;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-04-02T01:23:03Z;Corporate websites: The FT-Bowen Craggs Corporate Website Index;;Ten years ago the world’s largest companies were obsessed with getting their collective heads round the world wide web. But they paid it too much attention and by five years ago, many of them had all but lost interest – another mistake.Now, websites are getting about the amount of attention they deserve, a good deal of which has been applied in the past year.This is the main message from the second FT Bowen Craggs Index of corporate website effectiveness. A third of the web estates we looked at last year have been substantially revised. Some have been overhauled, introducing a coherence they have never had. The big gripe of so many web managers – that bosses see the medium as marginal – is being widely addressed.This year the Index has been expanded from 60 to 75 companies: the top 25 in the FT Global 500 – ranked by market capitalisation – from the US, Europe, and the rest of the world (including Russia). Five of the newcomers are Chinese, but they also include high profile westerners such as Google, Hewlett-Packard and PepsiCo. A handful of companies fail to meet the market capitalisation criterion, so have been dropped.The Index is unlike other rankings for two reasons. First, it takes an overall view. Rather than concentrating on a particular element, it looks at the jobs a web presence is asked to do, and sees how well it does them.Second, our approach is “expert” rather than “check box”: our analysts, experienced in both business and the web, make judgments at every stage (see Methodology).It is hard to see patterns based on sector – Coca-Cola, for example, has one of the best websites in our survey and PepsiCo one of the worst. But, as last year, there are strong regional themes with some subtle developments.The big story is that European companies still have the best websites. They take eight of the top 10 positions: all are companies that decided a few years ago to take the web very seriously and are offering an excellent service that they are constantly refining.Within Europe, newcomer Unicredito Italiano follows ENI in proving that Italians – relatively new to the web – can leapfrog their northern neighbours.But there are signs that US companies are stirring. More than half of them have made significant changes in the past year – considerably more than those from other regions.ExxonMobil and Pfizer have both jumped from stodgy and old-fashioned outfits into smart new clothing – they have a way to go in beefing up their content, but the structure and messaging are now good. Others have started to move but have a long way to go – AIG has sorted out its US site, but not the rest.There are still too many US sites suffering from poor governance (a posh word for how they are run), which leads to a strange mix of good content and terrible functionality: Verizon is in the leading group when it comes to investor and media metrics, but is worst bar none on construction.Similarly, Google should know better than to let its decentralised philosophy play havoc with its web presence. While the site (we looked mainly at the “About Google” areas) scores well because the content is generally excellent, it is seriously unco-ordinated.Why is Coca-Cola so much better than PepsiCo? Because Coke sees its corporate website as a part of its overall brand-building, while Pepsi uses it primarily to talk to investors, and does so with no great skill.There are patchy signs of movement in the rest of the world too, though for now the Chinese and Russians are packing the bottom of the table. They look and behave like sites from the past.I suspect that will change, at least for the Chinese. Bottom-placed China Mobile, a Hong Kong-quoted company, has a deeply unimpressive site. But its majority shareholder China Mobile Communications Corp – state-owned and therefore not in the list – has just launched a site that stands up well to western rivals. If that is the start of a trend, expect significant moves.As last year, it is the Japanese who disappoint. Only Canon’s site has had a significant make­over. Honda’s international site is shown up by its US subsidiary, which also owns the “dot com” address, while the banking sites are all a bit of a mess.Here are further important themes from the Index:● Video and multimedia, mostly Flash-driven, are making a big impact. Siemens has superimposed an all-singing multimedia home page on its site – it changes every month or so, and is a sophisticated way for the shaken giant to express its technological prowess.Several companies now use videos on their home pages – it makes sense with broadband, as long as the modem-driven get a decent alternative.● Multimedia is part of a move to make websites more interesting, fun even. Chevron pulls you in to play Energyville, a game to bring power to an imaginary city, while Petrobras has a game where “Ort finds himself surrounded by unbalanced environments”.A rare touch of flair from Japan is the Web Banking College, a virtual world with games, in the local language version of Sumitomo Mitsui’s careers area.● Developments under the label “web 2.0” are hard to spot, though many of them are happening away from the corporate site. We are seeing the use of blogs to provide a chatty alternative to formal content. Most are found on IT sites and in careers areas, though Wal-Mart’s frank Check Out, a blog by its buyers, is an intriguing sign of openness.● Relaunching can make things worse. General Electric has fallen back, partly because its home page is less well managed than it was, but mainly because it has a new navigation system that has been launched without enough attention to detail. Sites need to be debugged, but not just technically.● Hard graft pays off. The top-ranking sites built a solid platform a while ago, and are busy polishing it. Siemens has added a fancy new home page, but has otherwise left a solid and rational web presence intact. Shell has concentrated on bringing a great estate of country and business sites into a smoothly co-ordinated whole. Likewise, Unilever has been rolling out carefully localised country sites for the past two years.● Two technical points. First, be cautious about using a “sniffer” to guess where visitors are from by using their IP addresses. AIG does this, with the result that Americans get a smart home page but everyone else gets the terrible old one. Better to have an international page all can appreciate, and let people choose where to go from there.Second, do not be dogmatic about new windows. Several sites have recently adopted a “one window” policy – click a link and the new page opens in the same window. It makes little usability sense.As Julie Howell of Fortune Cookie, and formerly web expert at the UK’s Royal National Institute of Blind People, says: “As long as clear warnings are given, multiple windows don’t cause accessibility problems.”David Bowen is website effectiveness consultant for Bowen Craggs & Co (dbowen@bowencraggs.com)
733;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-04-02T01:23:03Z;Corporate website index: How well do websites serve their various audiences?;;"How well do corporate websites serve the various interest groups that use them?The FT Bowen Craggs index examines this question in detail and reports on the findings in the main table, and in further tables on the Bowen Craggs website which anyone can recalibrate. Here, we look at each user community and how it is served:Serving societyReputation management is a big issue for many companies and several have realised their website is a good place to address it.Companies have two main audiences: the general public and the growing social responsibility profession, which measures performance against set standards.Some companies have specific issues – one-off or rumbling – and use the web to tackle them. In the past year, BP has built up a detailed dossier about the Texas City explosion – it does not exactly flag it, but does not hide it either.Coca-Cola gives a higher profile to its Coke Facts site, addressing issues such as water management at its Indian plants. Meanwhile, GSK made an interesting one-off move last year, when it used its home page to communicate rapidly with shareholders who had received hostile letters from an animal rights group.It will be interesting to see if more companies make use of this obvious, but somewhat neglected, noticeboard.On the more positive side, HSBC is busy building its “sustainable” image on one mini-site that is packed with engaging case studies, and another that hosts a lively forum. Hewlett-Packard takes a different tack – it has a site helping customers save energy; the implication is that it must therefore be on the side of the good green guys.Two developments at the less glamorous corporate social responsibility end. First, more companies are showing how they measure up against benchmarks such as the Global Responsibility Index. BHP Billiton’s online sustainability report can be gauged, using colour-coding, for compliance with the GRI and other indices.Second, corporate governance material is being made more accessible by intelligent use of the web’s functionality. Look, for example, at Petrobras’s interactive diagram on the governance page – click to find out more.And if you work for Arcelor Mittal and want to spill some beans, go to the online whistleblower’s form – a sign of openness, whether or not it is used.Serving investorsInvestor relations teams are surrounded by an industry that wants to sell them all the bells and whistles it can. But these are not necessarily what the “end customers” need. The trick is to know what is really useful, and to provide it professionally.Our study segments investor relations customers into three: analysts/investors who follow the company; analysts/ investors wanting to research it; and private shareholders.Sites that do well serve all three categories, but in a thoughtful rather than “chuck it all in” way. UBS provides analysts with a “create your own report” feature, but does not give individuals a share price look-up, as many companies do. It probably has good reasons.Individual shareholders should not be ignored, though many companies do and very few take real care of them. BP is an exception, with its targeted help for holders of ordinary shares and American depositary shares, and the “Learn about investing” section for the newcomer.Among those who are helping the researcher, Cisco stands out with its Analyst Resources section, which includes specially created videos and podcasts.At the other end of the list are companies where the IR team takes little notice of the web.Some of these are surprising. Wal-Mart clearly does not think of its shareholders as another set of customers. Instead, it gives them a mix between a labyrinth and an old-fashioned library to negotiate. There is information here, but it is hard to find and the service for private shareholders has managed to get worse, with the disappearance of an introductory page for them.Serving the mediaThis metric scores an average of 16.2, against 19.8 for investors and 19 for customers. That is not surprising: many press offices simply do not see the web as an important part of their service.The more switched-on do though, offering a simple but effective service based on journalists’ need to get good information fast.Verizon, Unicredito and IBM score well by excellent provision of the basics. Press releases that are easy to browse and search, comprehensive press contacts, useful press kits and excellent image libraries.Providing good downloadable pictures should be a killer application for these sites – picture desks hunting for photos late at night find them a godsend.Some companies go much further, using their sites to build and sustain a close relationship with the specialist press. IT companies are best placed to do this, because of the natural wiredness of their community.Cisco and Hewlett-Packard fill their media areas with online tools for journalists: blogs, videos, podcasts, SMS and RSS feeds. They are buzzing advertisements for what the web can do.A sad example at the other end of the scale is PepsiCo – its approach is tokenist, with nothing but press releases, not particularly well organised. There is a case for saying that, if the rest of the site has enough information, journalists will find what they need. That is not true here, and the absence of a contact number for journalists is a sign that the press office has yet to get its head around the medium.Serving jobseekersThe website is often the first calling point for most people looking for jobs. A few of the companies in the Index do not use their sites for recruitment – and some do but badly – but the great majority try quite hard.The first category of site is in essence a labour exchange: look at our vacancies and apply online. Sophisticated search tools, CV filing and online applications processes are becoming standard, though a company such as Roche has an exceptionally refined system, including a sliding bar allowing jobseekers to move from a broad search to an exact match.Roche does not attempt to enter the second category, however: companies that are using their sites to court candidates. Here, the most interesting developments are found, with web technology and high quality content stretched to appeal to a demanding, often young, audience. Microsoft gets it right with many upbeat videos showing what life is like in the company, as well as a mass of blogs.UBS has videos too, as well as “Assess Yourself”, a self-profiling device to help candidates understand where they would best fit in. Sumitomo Mitsui has a pseudo virtual world in its Japanese language careers site, while IBM has the real (or rather virtual) thing. Its student portal links to a series of “challenges” in Second Life – this may (or may not) be a glimpse of the careers site of the future.Serving customersSome companies are not trying to use their corporate site to help customers.The Russian sites come into this category, so – more surprisingly – do PepsiCo and Unicredito, the Italian bank. If this is a strategic decision, that is up to them, though the evidence from other companies is that a surprising number of consumers look at corporate sites, even when little information is provided for them.It was this discovery that persuaded Unilever to switch from an investor to a consumer focus. Its large multinational web presence offers consistent “journeys” to general brand information and country-specific sites.Feature material is mixed in on the way to make the site as attractive as possible, but not in a way that slows journeys to decision or buying points.Cisco provides routes to specific or general information, depending on whether customers know exactly what they want. Routes are also given by product name or sector, for the same reason. And there is plenty of help: comparison tools, videos, FAQs, product demonstrations, even online training seminars.Royal Bank of Canada and Wells Fargo provide a similar combination of clear journeys and plenty of help, and also let customers buy, apply or make contact from the site. These and several other financial services companies – especially in North America – have sites ruthlessly driven by the customer marketing imperative.Which is fine, were they not missing out unnecessarily on marketing to other groups, such as potential employees and investors."
734;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-03-20T18:23:06Z;Pepsi in deal with Russia juice group;;PepsiCo is becoming the latest US food and beverage company to seek a share of the rapidly expanding Russian consumer market, with a deal to take a 75 per cent stake JSC Lebedyansky, Russia’s leading branded juice company.PepsiCo and the Pepsi Bottling Group, in which PepsiCo holds a 45 per cent share, will invest $1.4bn in the Russian company, excluding its baby food and mineral water business.The deal marks PepsiCo’s biggest ever international acquisition.Zein Abdalla, president of PepsiCo Europe, told reporters in Moscow that ”from the PepsiCo standpoint, this investment represents one of the most exciting steps our company has ever taken internationally”.Lebedyansky is the world’s sixth-largest juice manufacturer and the largest in Russia, with an estimated market share in Russia of around 30 per cent. Its juice business revenues in 2007 were around $800m.The American companies have the right to take make an offer to acquire the outstanding shares in the company after the transaction closes.PepsiCo has been focusing on expanding its international sales, which currently account for around 40 per cent of its total revenues.Eric Foss, chief executive of PBG, said Russia “represents our biggest growth market, and we are making smart investments that further enhance our business there”.Lebedyansky’s nearest rival in the Russian juice business is Multon, which was acquired by Coca-Cola in April 2005. It produces the Rich, Dobry and Nico brand juices.Lebedyansky’s brands include Ya, Frustyle and Tonus drinks, and it has a distribution network that covers all of Russia as well as Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Belarus.In January, Kellogg, the world’s leading maker of breakfast cereals, bought Russia’s United Bakers Group for an undisclosed sum in a deal that the company expects to use to significantly expand its presence in the Russian market.In another indication of US interest in the booming Russian consumer market, Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, is also looking at possibe entrance into the market.
735;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-03-17T18:59:19Z;The battle for global business is not yet won;;EADS, the European defence company, has beaten Boeing to win a huge US Air Force order. And, as of May, Unilever will not have a British or Dutch member of its top executive team for the first time since the company was formed by an Anglo-Dutch merger in 1930.It would be comforting to view this as a sign that commerce has dissolved national differences. Unfortunately, it has not.Take the EADS win of a $35bn contract to provide the US Air Force with refuelling tankers. It was achieved in highly unusual circumstances. The air force originally selected Boeing to provide the tankers, a deal that was cancelled after it emerged that a top defence procurement official had been holding secret job talks with Boeing. Both she and Boeing’s then-chief financial officer went to prison. Philip Condit, Boeing’s chief executive, was also forced to resign.In the reopened contest, EADS had to cast itself as an all-American provider of jobs in order to succeed. It chose a US partner, Northrop Grumman, to front its bid. Northrop said the contract would support 48,000 American jobs, almost double its initial estimate of 25,000, which it claimed was more than Boeing’s projected 44,000. The aircraft will be assembled in Alabama.As for Unilever, Geoffrey Jones, Harvard Business School professor and author of the book Renewing Unilever, argues that the complexion of its executive management– the team will consist of a Frenchman, three Americans, two Indians and a Zimbabwean – is exceptional.Few companies have gone as far as Unilever in shedding their national identities, or, in this case, dual identities. Most people would struggle to guess the nationality of Unilever’s brands – where do Flora, Dove or Domestos come from? – but not many companies are like that.John Kay argued on this page in 2004 that “almost all companies have an identifiable nationality” and that remains the case. Some have made efforts to shed their origins, but few have followed through, either because no one found it convincing or because it proved commercially damaging.One company that tried, strangely enough, was Boeing. In an interview with the Financial Times in 1997, Mr Condit said he wanted to see Boeing lose its American image over the next 20 years. “I believe we are moving towards an era of global markets and global companies,” he said. We are over half way through those 20 years and Mr Condit has gone. Who today thinks of Boeing as anything other than American?British Airways tried to become a denationalised company too. Under Robert Ayling, its then chief executive, BA commissioned art from around the world to replace the Union Jack on its tailfins. British business travellers, key to the airline’s profitability, were furious and Lady Thatcher covered up one of the international designs on a model aircraft at a Conservative Party conference. BA went back to the Union Jack.Another blow to cross-border business was the unravelling in 2007 of the DaimlerChrysler merger after nine fraught years. EADS itself has been a fractious Franco-German entity.There are signs of cross-border success. Renault’s link with Nissan is one of the most intriguing. Royal Dutch Shell, an Anglo-Dutch combination that became a single company in 2005, has been around longer than Unilever. ArcelorMittal is a genuinely international company.While few companies’ leadership teams are as international as Unilever’s, many have chief executives who grew up elsewhere. Both Vodafone and PepsiCo have Indian-born bosses.Manufacturing is international. Brands may have national associations, but the products have probably been made in Asia. But there are signs everywhere of a protectionist backlash. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have attacked the decision to give the air force contract to EADS. Supporters may hint we should not take their protectionist rhetoric seriously, but they use it because it resonates with voters.As my colleague, Michiyo Nakamoto, reported this month, Japanese sentiment has swung against foreign investors. Takao Kitabata, the top bureaucrat at the ministry of economy, trade and industry, said Japanese companies should be able to choose their shareholders, a breed he called “fickle, irresponsible and greedy”. José Manuel Barroso, European Commission president, has warned of the dangers of European protectionism.These are perilous times. If we are heading into an international downturn, protectionist pressures will only grow. The idea of business as an instrument of international co-operation has shallow roots. Boeing has launched a formal complaint against EADS’ victory.

736;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-03-16T22:03:48Z;Retailers clash with Pepsi over free music;;Pepsi is at odds with some of its biggest US retail customers over a national marketing campaign offering free digital music downloads from online retailer Amazon.The deal represents Amazon’s biggest-ever marketing partnership with another brand, and is an important part of its efforts to drive traffic to the fledgling MP3 “DRM free” music download service it launched last year.But the partnership has antagonised rival bricks-and-mortar retailers. Amazon’s media and electronics business competes directly with Wal-Mart and Target, the two largest mass retailers, while its rapidly growing grocery business competes with major supermarkets.“You have to ask yourself why Pepsi would team up with a company that doesn’t sell its products, and risk antagonising all the people that do sell its products,” said a source at one retailer.The programme was launched with a high-profile television ad featuring pop-star Justin Timberlake during February’s US Superbowl. But the promotion has received little attention in grocery aisles.In an apparent response to retailers’ concerns, Amazon’s name has been banished from the front of Pepsi bottles carrying the promotion – rendering it invisible in supermarket aisles to passing shoppers.Similarly, Amazon’s logo is on the back of cardboard multi-pack cartons of cans that are stacked on the shelves of mass discounters and supermarkets, next to the product’s bar code and nutritional information.The treatment contrasts with a promotion between Pepsi and Apple’s iTunes, in which the iTunes name was carried prominently.Jeff Smith, retail consultant at Accenture, argues the tensions reflect underlying challenges for Pepsi and other brands in adapting the traditional way they communicate with retailers to accomodate new digital selling and marketing channels.“The thing they didn’t think about is that anyone selling Pepsi in the general merchandise or electronics business is going to feel that they were promoting a competitor,” he says.Wal-Mart accounts for 18 per cent of North American sales of Pepsi’s parent PepsiCo, while about a third of PepsiCo’s North American sales come from just five retailers. The store has its own Mp3 download service.Both Pepsi and Amazon declined to comment.

They said BMS had also put out feelers to pharmaceutical companies which have nutritional divisions, including Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.“BMS has made informal approaches, but it has not yet started a sales process,” they added.It comes less than three months after BMS said it would conduct a strategic review of both its nutritionals business and ConvaTec, the wound care products supplier it owns, to focus on becoming a global biopharmaceutical company.BMS declined to comment on the sale, but said it “continued to evaluate its strategic options with Mead Johnson and Convatec”. The company could also decide to spin off the units to shareholders, or do nothing.Under Jim Cornelius, its new chief executive, BMS’s strategy is to shrink down into a focused maker of speciality pharmaceuticals.Morgan Stanley and Citi, which have been mandated to auction ConvaTec, are understood to have extended the deadline for second round bids to June, after failing to attract enough interested bidders. So far, 3M, the diversified technology company which also has a healthcare business including wound care, has emerged as one of the strongest bidders.For such consumer groups as Nestlé and Danone, acquiring Mead Johnson would cement their positions in the infant formula market.Last year, Nestlé spent $5.5bn to acquire Gerber, the baby foods business, from Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical company; while Danone bought Numico, the Dutch maker of baby food, for $16.8bn.Mead Johnson is best known for its Enfamil and Enfalac range of infant formula.The division employs about 5,000 people globally and manufactures and markets more than 70 products in more than 50 countries.BMS has already announced plans to cut costs by $1.5bn by 2010, including cutting 10 per cent of its workforce and closing more than half of its manufacturing plants. In January, BMS sold its Medical Imaging business to Avista Capital Partners, for $525m."

739;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;Whitehall revolving door under scrutiny;;"Former ministers and civil servants who breach the rules when they take jobs in the private sector should face criminal action, a senior Whitehall figure said on Thursday.Appearing in front of the Commons public administration committee as part of its inquiry into the role of lobbyists – the first such investigation for 15 years – Lord MacLennan said there was a convincing argument for following the US system, where there were clearly defined legal requirements covering such moves.If breaches were reported by whistleblowers “then the normal forces of the criminal justice system come into play”, said Lord MacLennan, who belongs to the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. “That is an option and I hope it is one which will be considered.”Such a change would mark a revolution in the current system, under which the advisory committee’s advice is based on fluid definitions of lobbying and has no enforcement powers.About 800 moves from the public sector to the private sector are passed to the committee every year and of these 50 or so are examined by its members. But it emerged that only one minister and two civil servants had ever been urged not to take a particular job in the private sector.The trend for former “crown servants” moving on to often lucrative posts in business is perhaps best exemplified by Tony Blair, the former prime minister, who has won lucrative contracts with JPMorgan and Zurich Financial Services since leaving office.The many former ministers now in the private sector include Patricia Hewitt, former health secretary, who is paid by Alliance Boots and Cinven; Denis MacShane, former Europe minister, now working for United Utilities; and Alan Milburn, who is on the board of PepsiCo.Many former civil servants and special advisers have also been vetted by the advisory committee.They include Air Chief Marshal Sir Anthony Bagnall, now an adviser at EDS; Sir Richard Dearlove, former chief of the intelligence service, who is on AIG’s board; and Sir David Omand, former security co-ordinator at the Cabinet Office, who is now adviser to the Society of British Aerospace Companies.Among the most controversial of recent years was Sir Robert Walmsley, former chief of defence procurement, who, a year after retiring in 2003, took a job with General Dynamics, a US defence company that had won £2bn in orders from the Ministry of Defence.Paul Flynn, the Labour MP, said it was wrong that so many people were using public posts “as a springboard, as an apprenticeship, for earning great riches”.MPs on Thursday questioned the process by which the advisory committee – described by Mr Flynn as “an all-male collection of the great and the good” – offered its advice and whether it was too lenient.Former crown servants are almost always given approval for their new posts but are sometimes advised to wait for a period of months before starting. They may be advised not to lobby the government for a certain period, usually 12 months.In the case of Air Chief Marshal Sir John Day, who had been asked to wait a year before becoming an adviser to BAE Systems, the period was cut to three months after an intervention by Mr Blair."
740;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-02-19T13:57:29Z;Cadbury spin-off;;Cadbury Schweppes has not made a popular decision, but it has made the right one. Shares in the UK confectioner dropped 5 per cent on Tuesday, following the announcement that shareholders would not receive a cash payment when the US beverages business is demerged.The Dr Pepper Snapple Group is shortly to be spun out from Cadbury’s confectionery arm via a listing in New York. Some investors, most vocally the activist Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management owns 4.5 per cent of Cadbury, had hoped that more debt would be taken on. In his December letter to the company he advocated a hefty ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 4.5 times for beverages, and 2.5 for confectionery.Cadbury’s management has opted instead to maintain investment-grade credit ratings for both units, and run with current debt levels – once split, net debt to ebitda for beverages and confectionery should be about three and two times respectively. This is both pragmatic – the junk debt market is effectively closed, making any financing expensive – and sensible. A higher level of gearing would simply be reflected in a lower equity value for the demerged unit, while competitors Coke and Pepsi are run with far less debt.The decision is also not greatly surprising. Activism works best when there is a lack of direction operationally, and management are distant from shareholders. Mr Peltz found success with Heinz, where his arrival helped to clarify management’s ideas for improving the business. At Cadbury his agitation for a break-up was well timed last year, but there was already a clear plan in place for confectionery. Even if there is still a reluctance to provide precise targets for margins, its aims are well understood. Concentrating on delivering them without unnecessary financial engineering seems right.Post and read comments on this Lex
741;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-02-18T18:09:28Z;US retailers hope for tax boost;;For beleaguered US retailers struggling with slowing consumer demand, relief could be on the way in the form of an estimated $42.9bn spending boost from federal tax rebates, aimed at steering the US away from recession.According to a survey of more than 7,000 people for the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend about 40 per cent of the extra $105.7bn due in rebates that will start arriving in May. A further $30bn will be used to pay down debt, $19.8bn will be saved and the remainder either invested or used to pay for medical bills.However, for retailers and consumer goods companies, much will depend on whether consumers choose to spend the extra money on food and low-margin basics, or on discretionary purchases, such as home goods, electronics and toys.Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, has said she expects the rebates to deliver a “one-time jolt” to consumer spending. But she told clients that “we expect most consumers who decide to spend their cheques to purchase lower- margin food and consumables” rather than discretionary items.In an indication of the state of lower-income consumers, Wal-Mart said that, in January, its customers were using Christmas gift cards to pay for food and other basics, rather than buy discretionary goods.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, and other discounters are expected to offer free cheque cashing facilities for rebate cheques, and they are likely to be prime beneficiaries of the extra spending. Citigroup says that, in 2001, about 25 per cent of a similar round of rebate cheques were spent at Wal-Mart.But if the large discounters – Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target – seem well-positioned to win business from hard-pressed consumers, others who depend on discretionary spending, or spending linked to the housing market – such as Home Depot or Macy’s department stores – seem less likely to benefit.The split in fortunes between basic and discretionary spending extends across the consumer sector.In the food industry, restaurants are showing signs of strain: same-store sales growth at McDonald’s has been slowing, while Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, has declared that the US consumer is already in a recession, as his company reported a second quarter of falling traffic.However, food companies such as Kellogg, Kraft and Pepsico are more troubled by higher commodity prices than slowing demand, and see themselves as able to profit if consumers opt to eat at home, rather than restaurants.Also, suppliers of household staples, such as Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Clorox, argue that they have seen no significant slowing in demand, or evidence of consumers shifting to cheaper alternatives.Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate Palmolive, told investors that “so far we are seeing no indication of the slowdown,” in the US.But beyond personal care, companies that sell even some of the most basic household products have been feeling the pressure. Newell Rubbermaid, whose products range from storage bins to baby chairs, cut its 2008 sales growth forecast on January 31 to 2-3 per cent, down from its previous forecast of 3-5 per cent.Martin Franklin, chief executive of Jarden, argues that his company’s lower-cost consumer products such as coffee pots and fire extinguishers will benefit from the rebates. “I don’t think the stimulus package is going to make you go out and buy that $2,000 flat-screen TV.“But when it comes to going out and buying some of the smaller ticket items that you have in your life that you don’t want to cut back on, then I think the stimulus package will have a positive effect.”Predictably, US retailers welcomed the federal tax rebates, which they had lobbied strongly for. Tracy Mullin, chief executive of the NRF, described the package as “a crucial component to economic recovery”.But as retailers set out their first-quarter earnings view over the coming two weeks, investors still expect the overall mood to remain sober, with retailers taking a conservative approach to inventory planning, with resulting knock-on effects for their suppliers.

By Eric Finkelstein and Laurie Zuckerman
John Wiley & Sons £14.99, 274 pages
FT bookshop price: £11.99The American supermarket group Safeway recently launched an online “wellness” service, enabling customers to evaluate the nutritional status of the food in their trolleys under the slogan “Healthy shopping just got easier”. It also recently offered a buy-two-get-one-free deal on cases of Coke, Pepsi and 7Up. Such are the contradictions fuelling the American obesity debate, examined through the cool lens of economics by Eric Finkelstein (with Laurie Zuckerman) in The Fattening of America.Finkelstein rolls out the statistics: two-thirds of Americans are overweight and the number of obese individuals has more than doubled in 30 years, with increases across all economic, racial and age groups. But in a survey of the main arguments why, he steers the blame away from individual responsibility and sets it firmly at the feet of the economy: market forces, not sloth, are making us fatter.Finkelstein’s tone is chatty and accessible, with frequent references to his pseudonymous Uncle Al, a successful but overweight lawyer. Uncle Al personifies the challenge: he knows the long-term health risks, but is not prepared to accept the short-term costs and sacrifices required to get thin. So it is that the economy shapes Uncle Al’s choices. Safeway lures him with a can of soda for less than a third of the price of an apple. For this, blame government agricultural subsidies, which have lowered the cost of corn syrup used in the production of fizzy drinks, making fruit a comparatively less attractive crop. Advances in medical technology, backed by medical insurance, are also to blame. Why worry about eating a lot and doing no exercise if you can take a diet pill, or get your insurer to fund gastric bypass surgery?Finkelstein insists that he is not a “fattist”. He gives space to the argument that if people want to get fat, that’s their call. But obesity is ultimately bad economics. America will be less competitive for having to shoulder the healthcare costs.So how do you make people thinner without drastically interfering in personal freedom? Wellness programmes might help, but they won’t change behaviour that is shaped by the economy. Dr Finkelstein’s “small ray of hope” is again market-driven: that the rising costs of obesity will eventually lead to new technological inventions – such as effective weight-loss drugs or exercise video games – that succeed in countering the economically-determined spreading of our waistlines. In the meantime, though, keep jogging.Jonathan Birchall is the FT’s US retail correspondent"
743;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-02-12T19:15:34Z;Full steam ahead? Although fear of recession stalks America, business is undeterred;;"From where Paul Double stands, on the placid banks of the Mississippi, the gloomy predictions of an impending US recession emanating from New York and Washington are no more than a faint hum from places far away.Mr Double, whose Canamar International makes huge plastic sheets to cover coal and grain from a plant nestled on the Minnesotan stretch of the big river, sees no signs of a slowdown.“Our business is in excellent health,” he says, adding that booming demand for commodities is prompting clients including Conagra and Cargill, the agricultural products groups, to place record orders. “By November we were already ahead of the past 12 months; by the end of our fiscal year in March we will have had our best year since 2005.”Mr Double’s jubilation points to a stark difference in opinion between two important constituencies in the US financial and economic landscape: when it comes to the health of the world’s largest economy, it appears that economists are from Mars and businesspeople are from Venus.In recent months, as a litany of poor data, tales of woe from the financial sector and reports of belt-tightening consumers prompted expert after expert to predict the first US recession in almost a decade, businesses have begged to differ. From entrepreneurs such as Mr Double to huge multinationals including General Electric and Kraft, corporate America has been decidedly more upbeat than the Federal Reserve and private sector economists. As one senior executive puts it, the US economy at the moment is like a stormy sea: tempestuous for those looking at it from the top but a lot calmer for those inhabiting its deeper reaches.To be sure, most corporate executives express concern at the prospect of a darkening economic picture – and companies directly affected by the subprime meltdown and the decline in consumer confidence, notably banks and housebuilders, are already ensnared in their own mini-recessions. But the attitude of most of the rest of US business is well summarised by David Cote, chief executive of the conglomerate Honeywell. Asked by an analyst last month about the recession, he replied: “We don’t really see it yet.”That sentiment is mirrored by business leaders across the Atlantic, alert to whether the US malaise is spreading to their home shores. Ian McCafferty of the CBI, the UK’s largest business organisation, says that as he travels around the country, its members’ views become more optimistic the further they are from the City of London. “I have been asking members whether they are facing significant constraints from tougher credit conditions. The answer across the board is: ‘not much’,” he says.From Germany’s industrial heartland, meanwhile, Jürgen Hambrecht, chief executive of BASF, this week accused the financial industry of “panicking” – and predicted that the US would not suffer a recession this year.Such protestations of optimism by American and European captains of industry raise the issue of whether companies’ desire to capitalise on the last leg of the business cycle will leave them blindsided if a slowdown does arrive. As US economic health deteriorates, the question for chief executives and investors is: can corporate leaders ensure their companies do not lose revenues and customers by retrenching too soon, while at the same time preparing contingency plans for the possibly leaner years ahead?To many experts, the confident statements coming from American boardrooms ring increasingly hollow. The prospects of a US recession have grown significantly over the past fortnight, as key indicators on employment and business sentiment disappointed economists and Wall Street investors. On February 1, the Labor Department released figures showing that the US had lost 17,000 jobs in January– the first decline since March 2003.The second bombshell came on February 5, as many Americans headed to the polls for the presidential primary elections, in the form of the Institute for Supply Management’s monthly report on the health of the services industry. That gauge of the largest sector in the US emerged below 50, which separates an expansion from a contraction, also for the first time since March 2003.The news confounded hopes that, despite a marked deceleration in growth in gross domestic product to an annual rate of just 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, sectors not directly tied to the mortgage crisis would be able to escape the worst. Since the double whammy of bad data, forecasters have been lining up to declare the onset of a US recession.In a note headlined “Free Fallin’”, Goldman Sachs economists last week gave voice to the concerns of the bears, which include their colleagues at Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and a dozen other financial groups. Even less pessimistic pundits such as Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, admit that the economy is close to breaking point. “Recessions are all about shifts in business behaviour. This is the key call,” he says.But many of the executives in charge of making that call do not appear ready to switch into recession mode just yet. In their view, battening down the hatches at a time when their markets are still growing would be, quite simply, bad business.They point for example to Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest household goods group and one of the savviest predictors of consumer behaviour, which detects little or no impact on its domestic operations. Clayt Daley, P&G’s chief financial officer, told Wall Street analysts this month it had gained market share in three-quarters of its US business because consumers had not switched to private label versions of its products such as Tide detergent and Pampers nappies.Other corporate leaders argue that their businesses are, to varying degrees, recession-proof. Food companies such as Kraft and PepsiCo maintain they would benefit from a downturn as people eat at home more frequently or plump for affordable “treats” including sodas and snacks to beat the recession blues. Logistics groups such as UPS, whose brown vans help keep the economy ticking over, still predict that their domestic business will grow this year as people and businesses keep sending letters and packages. As a senior executive at one of UPS’s rivals says: “We are a need, not a want.”Small businesses, which have fewer financial and operational resources to withstand economic convulsions, are also unwilling to throw in the towel. When SurePayroll, a group that prepares payrolls for some 18,000 small US companies, analysed January staff data, it was surprised to find that small businesses were still hiring and increasing employees’ salaries.“Recession, schmecession. That’s what most small business owners appear to be saying about the economic storm clouds,” says Michael Alter, SurePayroll’s president. “Our data indicate that the news of the demise of the economy has been greatly exaggerated.”Students of past downturns argue that the gap between economists’ pessimism and business confidence is due to a combination of timing and psychology. First, different companies perceive recessions differently, because economic downturns and individual industries’ business cycles are not synchronised. In addition, experience suggests that as the threat of a downturn increases, corporate leaders tend to understate it, in an attempt to maintain morale among staff, customers and investors. When Bain, the management consultancy, looked at the behaviour of 377 of the largest US companies in 1981-2001, it found the same overconfident demeanour displayed by many chief executives today.“As evidence gathers that a downturn is likely, executives often continue to radiate confidence – and even clairvoyance – about the future. They don’t want to frighten the troops, which will only make matters worse,” say the Bain authors in the Harvard Business Review. “Our research shows that most executives are likely to be overly optimistic in the face of an approaching downturn. Some will contend that their industries are safe, period. Others believe that their own company’s ability to weather a downturn is superior to that of competitors.”Yet executives’ fighting talk cannot be dismissed as a clever psychological ruse, hubris or even plain old wishful thinking. In today’s globalised economy, a number say their company really can cushion the impact of a domestic downturn, by relying on overseas operations. Jeffrey Immelt, chairman of General Electric, has made it clear that his promise of 10 per cent-plus growth in the conglomerate’s earnings in 2008 is driven by the fact that over half of its revenues come from outside the US.With a lower dollar boosting exports and demand for infrastructure such as energy and aerospace equipment soaring in emerging markets, Mr Immelt remains confident that a US slowdown will not derail GE. “A lot of the senior leadership team, including myself, travelled around the world and the emerging markets,” he told investors recently. “Every place we went there’s a need for power, there is a need for planes, there is lots of capital being invested in infrastructure and there are just no signs that this global infrastructure boom is slowing at all.”It is no coincidence that some of the more optimistic statements have come from industrial companies that have placed bets on fast-growing overseas markets. Yet even airlines – a frequent victim of slowdowns, especially when, like now, they are accompanied by high oil prices – are relatively upbeat because of solid demand for international travel. “Looking ahead to the first quarter, demand in all our regions remains strong,” Jeff Smisek, Continental’s president, said last month.Critics charge that the positive talk coming out of America’s boardrooms is in danger of obscuring the worsening reality, thus preventing companies from planning for a downturn. Indeed, evidence from the last recession six years ago suggests that far too many executives insist on seeing the world through rose-tinted glasses.“Decision-making is very tough in downturns. Psychologists say there are at least three ways executives botch decision in times of economic stress,” says Bain’s Darrell Rigby, who has studied downturns since 1987. “Their perceptions become distorted, they obsess on insignificant details and they try and prove that their mistaken hypotheses were right all along.”Mr Rigby estimates that fewer than one in five US companies enters a downturn with adequate survival plans, even though implementing timely contingency arrangements has been proved to be a key competitive advantage during economic contractions. In 2000-01, for example, the electronics group Emerson fared better than most because its sophisticated planning system, which required every unit to file a quarterly forecast each month, enabled management to predict the downturn.But most companies prefer merely to slash capital expenditure, fire employees and squeeze suppliers. Some of those classic recession tactics have already been on display this time around. Investment banks have shed thousands of people, while Detroit’s struggling carmakers are reportedly putting pressure on suppliers in an attempt to rein in costs.Management experts say such moves are rarely useful and often counter-productive, as they deprive companies of the resources needed to take advantage of the next upturn. “The specific question executives need to answer is, what is the benefit of hunkering down versus the opportunity costs of not continuing to invest?” says Patrick Viguerie, head of McKinsey’s corporate practice in the Americas.Indeed, recessions, which in the US last less than a year on average, have proved to be good times for nimble companies to steal a march on their competitors. Starbucks, for one, harnessed the 2000-01 slowdown to consolidate its position as the world’s largest coffee shop group. Building on prudent financial management in the years preceding the downturn, the Seattle chain expanded internationally and increased the proportion of licensed, rather than owned, outlets – a strategy that boosted its profit growth.Others were less proactive – and were punished for their inaction. McKinsey estimates that 40 per cent of US industrial companies and one in three US banks lost their position as their sector’s best performer during the last recession. “When economic uncertainty increases, you have this temporary freeze,” says Nick Bloom, economics professor at Stanford University. “Companies don’t hire, don’t spend, they just wait. The irony is: if every company in the economy waits, that in itself exacerbates the recession.”In the current uncertain times, this fear is starting to dent the aura of confidence displayed by corporate leaders. As John Chambers, Cisco chief executive and one of the information technology industry’s longest-serving and most thoughtful leaders, said recently: “When I talk to many CEOs, most of them would say, ‘I feel pretty good about my business but I don’t like what I’m hearing and seeing’.”Additional reporting by Justin Baer, Jonathan Birchall, Hal Weitzman and Chris Giles………………………………….Changing habits put defensive plays in doubtIn 1991 and 2001, the last two US recessions, those without jobs spent their days waiting for the phone to ring, the old-fashioned kind that was plugged into a wall, writes Aline van Duyn.During the wait, and in evenings spent at home – going out had become too expensive – people watched television, their most important source of entertainment.Chances are that people who lose their jobs in the current economic downturn will behave slightly differently. For a start, most people with traditional telephone connections now have mobile phones. There are also more alternatives to television, such as playing video games or watching films via high-speed internet connections.This may have implications for investors. “The lowest earnings risk rankings are mostly in traditional defensive areas, specifically consumer staples, pharmaceuticals and telecoms,” analysts at Morgan Stanley said recently. But what if changing habits also alter the performance of traditional “recession-proof” sectors such as telecommunications?“Historically, the telcos and cable operators were both ideal defensives,” says Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “After all, nobody in their right mind would disconnect their phone line, or their cable service, in a recession. What if someone miraculously called with a job offer? And what else is there to do but watch TV while you waited for the call?”Mr Moffett, however, believes that changes in the types of business done by telecoms companies could turn this on its head. “What if everything we think we know about this sector behaves in a recession is wrong?” he asks.For example, people may be more inclined to disconnect landlines and hang on to their mobile phones. Growth in mobiles could well slow – in the US, 80 per cent of the population has one already. The race between cable companies and telecoms groups to offer customers bundled phone, internet and television services could make it more likely that people will switch regularly to lock in the latest cheap offers.Exposure to emerging markets could have a bearing on what stocks prove to be defensive. Many equity investors have based their strategies around an expectation that growth in countries such as China, India and Brazil would remain solid even if the US slows down.Others are unconvinced. “This decoupling theory is starting to be very severely tested,” says Tobias Levkovich, an analyst at Citigroup. “This makes it hard to hide out, because some sectors [such as energy and materials] which can perform well in a downturn may not do so if commodity prices fall on the back of lower global demand. It is very uncomfortable.”In the 2001 downturn, the bursting of the technology bubble was particularly painful for internet start-ups that had developed plans around expectations of a huge boom in online business. This time around, online companies are widely expected to benefit, with traditional media bearing the brunt of any downturns in advertising. The large audiences for web-based content, and the increased ability to target customers through detailed information about their web-surfing habits, are widely expected to accelerate the shift from traditional to online media.One sector that should live up to its traditional defensive role, however, is healthcare. Extending healthcare services to the millions of Americans who currently have no insurance or coverage is expected to be an important issue in this year’s US election. Regardless of the direction of US economic growth, there is little chance that spending on healthcare will diminish, certainly not in this economic cycle."
744;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-02-09T00:04:49Z;Suited and booted;;I was very nervous before going to Davos. No, it was not the thought of rubbing shoulders with more than 1,000 of the world’s business and political leaders (and apparently 10,000 support staff). It was about what to wear while doing so.You would think that being a girl would be an advantage at the World Economic Forum, where again this year only 17 per cent of delegates were female. But it is hard to stand out against the phalanxes of suited men when you can’t dress to impress. The most crucial part of a woman’s wardrobe – footwear – is not available to her. It’s hiking boots, snow boots, or nothing – otherwise you will fall over, or worse, get wet feet as you move from one venue to another.With the Jimmy Choos firmly in the wardrobe at home there seemed little point in wearing a skirt, so it was trousers for me, although I did notice both Indra Nooyi, CEO of Pepsi, and HM Queen Rania of Jordan in skirts on stage during one forum. Mind you, it’s different for the VIPs (and to be a VIP at Davos you have to be a real VIP as almost everyone there runs a company or a country). They are chauffeured everywhere, so perhaps they didn’t need to be quite as careful as us mere mortals forced to travel a pied.Naturally, I looked at the delegate list before I went and noticed to my delight/horror that Anshu Jain was due to attend. Not that I could get an invite to the Deutsche Bank party, you understand (and I did try the straightforward method of asking for one). My company was good enough for John Thain and Jamie Dimon, but not Josef Ackerman.Well never mind – maybe I would meet Mr Jain on one of my numerous yomps (in not very glamorous footwear) up and down the Promenade, or while milling around in the Congress Centre, or even while strategically wandering up and down the corridor in the Hotel Belvedere that housed the DB press office. So before leaving for Switzerland I booked myself in for a 10,000 mile service at the beauty therapist and hairdresser, just in case.I took hand luggage only – spare socks, shirt and knickers, a washbag and a computer – but my overnight bag was not nearly as comprehensively packed as my handbag. As well as the obvious (purse, notebook, pen and business cards) I needed my earmuffs and sunglasses (for when I ventured outside) reading glasses (for poring over the notes in the dimly-lit sessions), gloves, Blackberry, phone, newspaper, make-up …I did pack the key jewellery and one smart jacket, and thank goodness I did, because the women that did make it to Davos had a world agenda – and when powerful women meet each other, they dress up. Sitting here in our little world of falling stockmarkets and bailed-out banks it is easy to forget that once upon a time, the world set eight Millennium Development Goals that it pledged to achieve by 2015.Although progress on all of them has not been as fast as it might have been, there has been some movement on all but one – number five, which calls for the maternal mortality rate to fall by three-quarters. Some 530,000 women still die in childbirth each year, as I was reminded at the women-only dinner hosted by Indra Nooyi, Wendi Murdoch and Queen Rania.Held in the Davos Golf Club (how many of you knew that Davos had a golf club?) it united 40 extraordinary female achievers (well, 39 and me) and even launched its very own webpage, www.myspace.com/davosdinner. There might not be many women at Davos, but the ones that were there were determined to make themselves count.Not that it remained women-only for the entire evening. The event took on a somewhat surreal air once the girls had had the call to arms (and you could not listen to our speakers without being moved – even a hardened old cynic like me can be transported to new levels of determination by listening to Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, joint managing director of the World Bank and the former Nigerian minister of finance).Suddenly, a white-jacketed waiter looking suspiciously like Bono appeared with a plate of food, followed by that consummate sommelier Rupert Murdoch with the wine refills, and the Google trio of Larry, Sergey and Erik did the water round. How amazing is that? Even in Davos, I doubt there was another event quite like it.It felt like I had had the whole Davos experience in one go, I reflected on the train to Zurich the next day. The issues of our times, the women who can make things happen, the world’s business and political leaders. But not, I realised, even after all my best efforts, Anshu Jain.Next year, perhaps less money at the hairdresser and more to a charity that can help reduce maternal mortality.mrsmoneypenny@ft.com
745;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-02-07T21:36:34Z;Wall St rebounds in volatile trading;;"US stocks rebounded on Thursday as bargain-hunters rushed to buy into market weakness and called a halt on a three-day losing run.Consumer stocks surged in volatile trading after reassuring earnings guidance from JC Penney and Gap helped offset earlier disappointment with Wal-Mart’s January sales figures.The sharp upswing bore some of the hallmarks of an over-sold bounce and was led by beaten-down financial, energy and telecoms stocks. The rally stemmed a slide of almost 5 per cent on the S&P 500 this week.In spite of a broad-based rally a weak sales outlook from Cisco continued to weigh on some large-cap technology companies. Utilities stocks also lagged.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,336.91, having fallen 0.7 per cent before rebounding as much as 1.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 12,247 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,293.30.“I think the most likely scenario is that we reached a low in January and we are now in the base-building process,” Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said.A broad range of retailers rallied after JC Penney, up 8.5 per cent at $47.44, said same-store sales declined less than forecast and fourth-quarter earnings would be at the high end of its forecast range. Gap’s shares also rebounded, up 7.2 per cent at $19.65 after its earnings outlook also pleased investors.Elsewhere retail sales figures were generally disappointing, as consumers faced with falling house prices reined in their discretionary spending. However, the S&P retail index climbed 3.7 per cent to 403.51 as analysts said weaker consumer spending was already priced in to many retail shares,Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose only 0.5 per cent in January, much less than the 2 per cent increase Wall Street had expected, and its February sales forecast also offered little cause for excitement. The shares fell in early trading but later closed up 2.1 per cent at $49.84.Upmarket retailer Nordstrom rose 3.7 per cent to $37.67 in spite of reporting a 6.6 per cent decline in same-store sales. Macy’s, up 4.9 per cent at $25.11 had reported a 7.1 per cent sales drop on Wednesday.Technology stocks also pared early losses caused by a cautious sales outlook from Cisco. The networking company said quarterly profit rose 7.2 per cent to $2.06bn, in line with analysts’ estimates, and projected 10 per cent sales growth for the fiscal third quarter, below expectations. The shares rose 1.3 per cent to $23.38.Many investors consider Cisco a bellwether for the sector and its cautious outlook kept shares in a some of large-cap tech companies under pressure. IBM fell 1.2 per cent to $102.34 and Hewlett Packard gave up 3.9 per cent to $40.50.There was mixed news on the employment front. Weekly jobless claims fell 22,000 to 356,000, but the reading was still far higher than many analysts had predicted. Jobless claims had surged the previous week to the highest reading in more than two years, but this time the market was expecting a figure of about 340,000. The four-week moving average of first time claims rose 8,500 to 335,000.“On balance, initial jobless claims have drifted higher, although at this point they remain below levels typically associated with outright recession,” economists at Bear Stearns said.Pending home sales fell a weaker-than-expected 1.5 per cent in December, according to the National Association of Realtors, and were down 24.2 per cent from the previous year. Homebuilder DR Horton rose 1.6 per cent to $15.04 after it posted a narrower-than-expected $128.8m quarterly loss.Consumer products group PepsiCo said fourth-quarter profit fell 30 per cent to $1.26bn from a year ago, when results were improved by a tax benefit. However, revenues rose 17 per cent to $12.35bn and the shares put on 5.5 per cent to $70.41.Rating agency Moody’s said fourth-quarter earnings fell 54 per cent to $127.3m as revenues from structured finance slumped. However, the result was slightly better than analysts had forecast and the stock surged 10.4 per cent to $37.Financial companies closed broadly higher after Jamie Dimon,chief executive of JP Morgan, said a possible downgrade of a key bond insurer would not be “that big a deal” for the banking industry. JP Morgan’s shares rose 3.2 per cent to $45.11Exchange operators also enjoyed a bounce after an analyst said the market overreacted to a Department of Justice call for ownership for clearing houses to be
broken off from futures exchanges. CME Group rose 8.8 per cent to $528.01 after falling 17.6 per cent the previous day."
746;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-02-05T13:19:53Z;Business optimism counters economists’ gloom;;It was hard to escape the sense that the business leaders who had been chauffeured and helicoptered into Davos to talk about what they were doing to improve the world felt a little upstaged.The Federal Reserve’s sharp rate cut on the eve of the World Economic Forum and the revelation of a massive fraud at Société Générale two days later ensured that discussions were dominated by debates about economic and market turmoil.“The meeting and the mood today has been overshadowed by the financial crisis,” Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo, admitted on day one, reminding other delegates that they were at Davos to address long-term challenges rather than short-term issues.Yet as the week went on, the corporate leaders’ messages began to cut through. One of those messages was that they were less convinced than the economists and bankers that the outlook is entirely gloomy.Sony’s experience runs counter to “the aroma of disaster wafting through the halls of Davos”, said Sir Howard Stringer, chairman of the Japanese electronics and media group.Niall FitzGerald, chairman of Reuters, the news and financial information group, noted that the mood was less bearish the further east an executive was from Frankfurt. Any fears among American delegates contrasted with optimism from Russian, Chinese or Indian companies.The other overriding business theme was, again, corporate social responsibility. But after last year’s parties in a “climate change igloo” there was less public relations glitz and more of a recognition that companies’ responses to environmental issues will affect their bottom line.Customers now expect companies to have meaningful environmental policies, one senior advertising executive said, adding that publicity stunts no longer impressed. “Brands will have a really tough time in this environment, unless they have a genuine role, over and above the services they provide,” Mr FitzGerald added.Perhaps as a result, executives from companies as diverse as Coca-Cola, Nestlé and Dow Chemical rallied around a central theme of this year’s Forum: the growing scarcity of resources, from clean water to affordable food to accessible oil.All are inter-related, they said, and each has a role to play in climate change, the dominant theme of Davos last year. That overarching but somewhat intangible challenge is now comprehensible to business in terms of key ingredients in the corporate supply chain.As they announced their own initiatives or pledged to rally round the UN’s Millennium Development Goals, the corporate mood was again summed up by Ms Nooyi at the end of the week. Issuing a challenge to her fellow CEOs, she said: “It is time to move from discussion to decision.”
747;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-01-28T22:17:59Z;Intel wires into green energy;;Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, gave a boost to green power, becoming the largest corporate buyer in the US of renewable energy certificates (Recs).Intel said it would buy 1.3m megawatt hours’ worth of certificates every year – enough to power about 130,000 US homes – in a multi-year contract.The company is understood to be paying in the range of $4m to $10m for the certificates.Recs are an indirect method of encouraging green energy use. Companies generating power from renewable sources, such as the wind and sun, are generally not profitable without subsidies because their energy is more expensive to produce than electricity from fossil fuels, but they get the same prices for selling it to the grid as conventional energy suppliers.Recs provide an extra income stream for renewable generators, as companies and individuals can buy the Recs with the aim of encouraging greater investment in renewable power. Many companies use the Recs as “carbon offsets” to balance out the negative impact of their activities on the climate.However, an investigation by the Financial Times last year found that in some cases Recs did not make the difference between profit and loss for wind companies, but enriched generators that would already have been profitable, in part thanks to other subsidies.Intel’s investment overtakes that of PepsiCo, which has bought 1.1 gigawatt hours, and puts it at the top of a national league table compiled by the US Environmental Protection Agency.Intel has also been a purchaser of wind power in Oregon, where it has production facilities, and invested over $20m in more than 250 energy conservation projects over the last seven years, saving in excess of 500,000MW hours.

I fear that the China IPO market for private companies might be a goner now until after Chinese new year [February 7].”This week Changsheng China Property, a mainland commercial real estate developer, put plans to raise up to US$145m in Hong Kong on hold.Other IPOs in Asia have also fallen victim to the market volatility. On Wed­nesday, Cebu Pacific, the Philippines’ second biggest airline, shelved an IPO.

750;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-01-25T03:33:08Z;Ban warns business on looming water crisis;;Businesses are doing too little to tackle a looming water crisis, Ban Ki-Moon warned the World Economic Forum on Thursday, describing their response to a UN water sustainability initiative as “a drop in the bucket”.Water has displaced climate change as Davos delegates’ chief worry outside the US economy, with no fewer than nine water-related events on the programme, compared with just one last year.“What we did for climate change last year, we want to do for water and development in 2008,” the UN secretary-general told the meeting, highlighting “water stress” as a common denominator between disease, rising food prices and crises such as the Darfur conflict.A handful of corporate leaders called for more engagement from governments and business, after Mr Ban complained that only a fraction of the 1,000 companies represented in Davos had joined the UN’s CEO Water Mandate, launched six months ago.“We feel a little bit frustrated that up to now only 20 companies have signed up,” said Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman and chief executive of Nestlé, the food and drink group. Agriculture, rather than industry, accounted for 70 per cent of water use, he added.But he lambasted governments for “trying to solve one problem – the energy problem – by making another one – the nutritional problem – worse” in promoting biofuels. About 1,000 litres of water were needed to create one litre of bio–diesel, he said.A price must be put on water use, Mr Brabeck-Letmathe added, calling for the creation of trading schemes for water akin to the exchanges created for carbon allowances.Andrew Liveris, chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical, likened water shortages to concerns over other scarce resources, describing water as “the oil of this century”.In spite of the close connection between global warming and drought, water issues had got lost as part of the climate change debate, said Neville Isdell, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola.Companies had the know-how and the profit motive to find solutions to a problem that directly affected many businesses’ supply chains, delegates said, but they called for collaboration with governments and non-governmental organisations.Unless the communities in which Coca-Cola operated had access to water, “we haven’t got a business”, said Mr Isdell.A year after companies used the alpine gathering to trumpet their efforts to reduce their carbon footprints, several executives highlighted a new ambition to become “water neutral” as well as “carbon neutral”.“Our goal is to get net zero water usage. We want to have a closed system where we’re not parasites on the earth,” Indra Nooyi, chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo, told the FT. Such progress would happen only if companies appointed an individual to take responsibility for their sustainable water policies, she said.Water-related events at the forum range from private sessions for the food and beverage industries to a debate on “thirsty energy”, which is expected to examine ways of reducing the amount of water used in extracting oil.Comment: How we can take firm action to cut carbon
751;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-01-23T13:42:28Z;Economic gloom must not overshadow Davos;;Recent turmoil in global financial markets and fears of a US recession must not be allowed to divert businesses and governments from other pressing issues, the organisers of the World Economic Forum said on Wednesday.Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, joined other co-chairs of the event in calling on delegates to take a longer-term view. The meeting was “bound to be dominated to some extent” by economic concerns, he said, but he expected more progress to be made on other subjects.”I think the action points at the end of the week will be focused on the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals, climate change and the Middle East,” he told a press conference in Davos. “I think you’ll find greater action points on these than on the situation in global financial markets.”Indra Nooyi, chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo, said the market backdrop would be an even “bigger test” for Davos than globalisation. Delegates must “move from discussion to decision and from research to action,” she said.Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, expressed confidence that the US had “a fully engaged administration and a fully engaged central bank to address the threats to its economy”. But he expressed doubts that policymakers could play a key role in resolving the threats, suggesting such problems work themselves out.“We’ve had a financial crisis every five years for the past 100 years and they have all come from a different source and they have all been resolved,” he said. David O’Reilly, chairman and chief executive of Chevron, added that he was confident that the US economy could correct itself more quickly than expected.Mr Blair highlighted his hopes for progress on reviving the Doha round of world trade talks, adding that he expected there to be “some fairly tough talking” on European Unions agricultural subsidies this year. But Henry Kissinger, another co-chair, raised concerns about a growing protectionist mood in US politics, saying: “This is not a great year in America for far-sighted and imaginative economic policy. I’m sure you’re going to hear a lot of talk that not only sounds protectionist but is protectionist from the presidential candidates.”Sir Howard Stringer, chairman of Sony, told the Financial Times the Japanese electronics and media group did not see signs of a US slowdown in its stores or at cinemas.“It’s certainly easy to aggregate negatives about the economy that add up to the rumours of disaster wafting through the halls of Davos, but our own experience runs counter to that,” he said.“Our Christmas sales in the US were up double digits year-on-year and the US box office just had a record Martin Luther King weekend,” he added. The apparent resilience says one of two things, he said: either the high-definition electronics “revolution” was outweighing consumer concerns, “or it’s the Shirley Temple factor: when depression looms, people entertain themselves and don’t want to be reminded by economists things aren’t so good.”
752;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-01-20T19:54:50Z;Suppliers pushed on their green credentials;;Small suppliers to multinationals are feeling the heat of global warming as an increasing number are being forced by their big-name customers to prove their green credentials.Household names from a range of industries, including Dell, L’Oréal, PepsiCo, Hewlett-Packard and Reckitt-Benckiser, have announced that they will ask suppliers to measure and disclose their carbon footprint, which is the amount of greenhouse gas they emit.Each company will select a pilot group of up to 50 suppliers for the project who will receive a questionnaire in the first quarter, which will help them calculate their emissions.Measuring emissions this way will allow companies to compare their suppliers with their peers, finding cost savings by eliminating practices that waste energy.Paul Dickinson, chief executive of the Carbon Disclosure Project, which has co-ordinated the initiative, said: “[This] is a key step towards a unified business approach to climate change.”He said the project would spur action: “By bringing together the purchasing authority of some of the largest companies in the world, [we] will encourage suppliers to measure and manage their greenhouse gas emissions.”Wal-Mart in the autumn became the biggest company to announce such an initiative, starting a trend later adopted by Tesco, Nestlé, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Cadbury Schweppes and Imperial Tobacco.The Carbon Disclosure Project, a not-for-profit organisation with more than 300 institutional investors, including Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, among its members, said its methods were designed to let suppliers use a single standardised method to work out their carbon footprint.
753;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-01-16T02:08:04Z;Handle with care: bands, fans and brands;;The recipe of bands, fans and brands is a potent mix and should be treated with great care, corporate sponsorship experts said on Tuesday.Guy Hands believes that by attaching individual brandnames to some of the artists in his EMI stable he could bring in much-needed revenue, likening rock bands to football teams.But change a single ingredient from a successful recipe and you can come up with something foul-tasting, if not entirely poisonous, according to Rupert Pratt, managing partner of consultancy Generate Sponsorship.“Football teams and football fans accept sponsorship and commercialisation because it has become so much part of the infrastructure of the game now,” he told the FT. “But that just isn’t the same with music. Sponsorship of music is much newer and bands are much more protective of their image.”The association of commercial companies and pop or rock artists is hardly new – the New Seekers’ hit “I’d like to teach the World to Sing” was originally arranged for use in a Coca-Cola commercial in 1971 – but Mr Pratt said the way Mr Hands was suggesting linking a brand to a major band was untried.“T-Mobile sponsored the Rolling Stones [in 2003] with a serious amount of money, but they didn’t have any branding at the concert because the Stones wouldn’t allow it. The only thing they could do was light the stage in magenta, which was their corporate colour.”He said he could understand why Mr Hands saw the possibilities in sponsorship because the current earnings from corporate involvement in music, such as Carling’s support for the Reading music festival each summer, went to promoters and artists.“I can see his thinking. You can package up and sell a band and the added benefit would be that sponsors will do a lot of the marketing for you.”But Mr Pratt and Karen Earl, whose company Karen Earl Sponsorship has clients that include Guinness, Royal Bank of Scotland and Aviva, both raised the fundamental issue of rights.“It’s all very well saying that they are going to offer the rights to a band, but I do wonder what the artists think about it – that is something that sponsors would need to be assured about it,” Ms Earl said.Different acts have different attitudes. Jack White of the White Stripes wrote a song for Coca-Cola in 2005 that won him the opprobrium of fans and fellow musicians alike.When the Rolling Stones sold Microsoft the rights to use “Start Me Up” for the launch of Windows 95, at a price of $10m (£5m today), the band’s support base barely noticed.Ms Earl’s point was underlined by John Webster, from the Music Managers Forum, who said: “People have tried this for years but it has always foundered on artistic sensibilities.“It’s not impossible …but people have to consider that some bands aren’t interested and fans could potentially be turned off by something like that.”And then there is the potential downside for companies of association with an unpredictable group of individuals.PepsiCo’s $5m involvement with Madonna in 1989 was a vivid example. She made a clean-cut video of her single “Like a Prayer” that was broadcast as a Pepsi advert, but her own promotional video for the song showed graphic images linking sex, murder and religion in a way that drew a torrent of protest. Pepsi withdrew its advertisement.Ms Earl said: “I do think sponsors would be very interested to know more about what Guy Hands is talking about, but it would not be for everyone.“I would want a sponsor getting involved in this to be knowledgeable and experienced. And they would have to be pragmatic in so far as the potential pitfalls are concerned, and just ride with them.”
754;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2008-01-15T19:16:43Z;Bruised music majors back iTunes rival;;Next month’s Super Bowl will feature a sales promotion that is audacious even by that event’s over-inflated standards: Amazon.com, the largest online retailer, will offer as many as 1bn free downloads from its new digital music store in partnership with Pepsi and singer Justin Timberlake.The promotion represents a coming-out party for the Amazon MP3 service, which launched in September. But it also poses a question: is a viable competitor to Apple’s iTunes digital music store finally on the horizon?Five years ago, the major music companies – Universal Music, Sony BMG, Warner Music and EMI – embraced iTunes for pioneering a legal digital music market. These days, however, they are chafing under its dominance and eager for alternatives.Their chief complaints are iTunes’ uniform pricing policies, in which all songs sell for 99 cents, and Apple’s unwillingness to install more robust anti-piracy protections on the iPod to stop illegal copying of music. Their frustration has only grown as double-digit falls in sales of compact discs, their lifeblood, make them desperate to reap greater profits from digital music.Yet Apple has so far found it easy to dismiss the music companies – sometimes rather rudely – because Microsoft, Sony and other competitors have failed to cut into iTunes’ roughly 80 per cent share of the market. Some download stores have been plagued by clumsy user-interfaces. Monthly subscription services win praise from executives but have had a hard time convincing all but a small core of die-hard music fans to sign up.The biggest reason, though, for Apple’s dominance is the iPod itself. The wildly popular device has sold more than 120m units so far and consumers understandably want to buy digital music that will be compatible with their favourite player.“You can have a fantastic service and a fantastic online store, but if you don’t have a device strategy, you will fail,” one music executive explained. “Up until now, we haven’t seen any device that has the potential to defeat the iPod.”But the rules of the game may be changing. Over the past year, the largest music companies have begun striking deals to supply their music without the digital rights management (DRM) software that is designed to prevent unauthorised copying. Dropping DRM may make music even more vulnerable to theft. Yet it should also level the playing field with iTunes because tracks sold in the unprotected MP3 format will work on a variety of devices, from iPods to PCs and mobile phones.“Consumers want to be able when they purchase music to play it on any device,” Pete Baltaxe, director of digital music at Amazon, said last week after announcing that the company had sealed a deal with Sony BMG to offer tracks from its artists in MP3.That deal was significant because it made Amazon the first company to win backing from all four major music companies for its DRM-free service. While Mr Baltaxe declined to discuss iTunes, Amazon was clearly aware of the competition when it opted to price many of its tracks at 89 cents apiece.Ironically, Steve Jobs (left), Apple’s chief executive, is the one who led the charge for DRM-free music. In an open letter to the industry last February, Mr Jobs argued that it would ease consumer concerns about interoperability and expand the digital market for everyone. Yet, in a sign of the music industry’s antipathy for Apple, only one major company, EMI, has struck an MP3 deal with iTunes so far, and the others do not appear to be in any hurry to follow suit.Instead, they have been out seeding potential rivals. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest music retailer, has begun selling MP3s from Universal. Best Buy, Target and other stores are expected to win similar deals. But the betting in the industry is that Amazon has the best chance of taking on iTunes.Unlike Wal-Mart and other bricks-and-mortar giants, Amazon already has a base of more than 72m customers who have set up accounts to shop at its online site – many of whom have been buying its CDs for a decade.Amazon will also be able to use its vast mine of consumer data and its recommendation engines to package these goods more effectively. “They’re off to a very good start,” says James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. “I really look at Amazon as the single biggest threat to iTunes.”One music executive agrees, noting that the companies could give the service an extra boost by offering exclusive tracks from their artists. “Amazon has the best shot,” he says.Perhaps mindful of their experience with iTunes, music executives are trying to hedge their bets this time around. Some believe that subscription services offered through mobile phone carriers represent the future. Next-generation handsets are finally arriving en masse and consumers are already accustomed to paying monthly phone bills. Why not add on a nominal subscription fee for unlimited music, they argue?Universal appeared to move down this path last month when it introduced a “Comes with Music” promotion in which buyers of certain Nokia mobile phones would receive unlimited downloads from the record company for a year.Meanwhile, they are backing a whole new generation of music-oriented social networking sites. One that is drawing considerable attention, Imeem, is trying to build its business alongside iTunes. The site allows consumers to stream as many songs as they like for free on their computers and encourages them to share with friends. If they want to download a song to a portable device such as an iPod, they can click through to a link to iTunes or Amazon.com.Imeem, meanwhile, is planning to make money from advertisers such as Samsung. The site drew 20m visitors in December and has won backing from all the major music companies.Dalton Caldwell, Imeem’s chief executive, argues that the site is not a competitor to iTunes, but instead aims to win over converts from the much larger population of music fans getting their fix for free on the internet. “We consider our real competition to be the illegal [file-sharing] sites. The people using those services are used to free,” Mr Caldwell says.Another advertising-supported service, Q-Trax, will offer free downloads and is expected to launch later this month. There is even talk that Yahoo, the internet portal, might be readying an online music store.If these and other iTunes alternatives take off and expand the legal online music market, then the beleaguered music companies should profit. But one of the biggest beneficiaries may be Apple. The reason, say analysts, is that more digital music can only lead to more demand for the iPod. “Apple folks will agree that this is good even for them,” Mr McQuivey says.
755;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:28+0000;Fanatical nation sets financial target;;The International Cricket Council has good financial reason to keep India sweet as the dispute over sportsmanship, alleged racism and bad umpiring during its tour of Australia festers.The fallout from the strained relations between Australia, cricket’s most successful nation, and India, the commercial powerhouse of the game, could be highly damaging for cricket’s world governing body. For now the ICC has averted the prospect of a cancelled tour but it is struggling to assert its authority in the face of India’s unstoppable economic supremacy over the game.Sponsors and media rights owners are underpinning unparalleled growth in the game, driven by India’s burgeoning middle class and the passion for cricket among the nation’s 1.1bn people.An explosion in the value of media rights puts the sport in the kind of bracket more often associated with truly global games, rather than one played to consistent international standard by only nine countries.ESPN Star Sports won a bidding war to acquire the audio-visual rights for ICC tournaments such as the World Cup, Champions ­Trophy and the new-fangled Twenty20 world championships during 2007-15. Its bid, said to be about $1.1bn (£560m, €750m), amounts to double the previous seven-year deal struck with Rupert Murdoch’s Global Cricket Corporation.The Board of Control for Cricket in India, at the centre of the furore, is also cashing in, having sold home international matches until 2010 for $612m to Nimbus Communications, again double the amount of the previous deal.The cricket calendar is bursting as new tournaments and formats are devised to exploit cricket’s increasing popularity. The BCCI is setting up an Indian Premier League, another international Twenty20 event, and has sparked off another broadcasting bidding war with a base price of about $60m a year.It is also hosting a Twenty20 Champions League in October, the winners taking home £1m.Meanwhile, an unauthorised and much vilified Twenty20 league has begun in India, paying cricketers twice the amount for a few weeks’ work than they would earn in a year.India is said to generate about 70 per cent of the game’s global revenues and the rupee is critical to cricket tournaments held elsewhere. The sponsors of the 2003 World Cup in South Africa were predominantly India-based companies, although other global sponsors – such as LG, PepsiCo and Hero Honda – joined the party for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies.Cricket rights elsewhere are booming and Mr Murdoch’s company is behind them. BSkyB’s four-year deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board is worth £208m, while his Nine Network is paying A$315m ($270m, £130m, €180m) for coverage of seven cricketing summers in Australia.Australia knows full well the economic value of a ­popular Test series to the national economy. Last year’s England tour of Australia, watched by 1.2m spectators, generated A$317m in direct expenditure.The ICC is coming out of this nicely, making revenues of $69m in 2006-07, leaving a surplus of $40m. But events in Australia suggest its hold on the game is in irreversible decline.
756;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-12-11T20:12:16Z;Cadbury Schweppes’ progress;;It seems that to have a gorilla in the room is not a problem, as long as it can play the drums. Cadbury Schweppe’s peculiar advertising campaign is helping –Tuesday’s trading statement confirmed third- quarter momentum, with full-year sales growth likely to be ahead of previous guidance of 4-6 per cent.Yet there is already a large degree of hope in the share price. The beverage unit, now rechristened the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, is to be demerged with a US listing next year. If no extra debt is taken on beforehand and the cost of the process in fees and taxes is £350m, “Dr Snapper” looks likely to carry £2.1bn of net debt. Assuming a 15-20 per cent valuation discount to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo is appropriate – Dr Snapper has less international growth, a much higher tax rate, and a 10th of earnings come from low-margin bottling operations – this implies an enterprise value of about £7bn, or 230p of equity per Cadbury share. That would put the remaining confectionery business on a hefty 23 times 2008 earnings, versus about 17 for the food sector.To justify such a premium, either better margins or a bid is required. The latter still seems unlikely. Wrigley and privately owned Mars would probably encounter antitrust obstacles. Nestlé’s growth strategy is focused outside confectionery, and struggling Hershey can’t afford it.The key then is improving profitability. Management aims to move the operating margin up to the mid-teens by 2011 from about 10 per cent now. With price rises feeding through and a full restructuring of production under way, this will be possible but challenging. To move at anything more than a moderate pace, however, will be to risk the fate of Hershey in the US, where underinvestment led to a sales slowdown. Patience will be required.
757;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-12-11T03:10:39Z;Companies move to halt junk food advertising;;Nearly a dozen global food companies will on Tuesday announce plans to halt advertising junk food to children under 12 throughout Europe by the end of next year in the first serious attempt by food groups to tackle one of the causes of childhood obesity.The self-imposed ban, which follows a similar move by soft drink companies last year, comes after Markos Kyprianou, the European Union’s health and consumer affairs commissioner, warned industry to stop advertising junk food and drink to children voluntarily or face legislation.Food companies say that they want to show the EU that they are making a “credible” effort to limit advertising of sugary and fatty foods to children in television, print and on the Internet.The companies committing to what they call the “EU Pledge” are: Burger King, Coca-Cola, Danone, Ferrero, General Mills, Kellogg, Kraft, Mars, Nestle, PepsiCo and Unilever.Each company will set its own guidelines for what kinds of foods are inappropriate to advertise to children, but will base these guidelines on national or international nutrition standards. “It’s not a one-size fits all marketing code,” said one food company. Compliance with the standards will be monitored by independent bodies.Companies will also stop marketing foods and drinks in primary schools, unless they receive the approval of school authorities.Mr Kyprianou is also drawing up minimum food labelling standards, though plans have been delayed by internal Commission infighting. A proposed “made in EU” label drew fire, as did a proposal that all meat should carry the place of birth, death and slaughter.A leaked copy of the legislation, now expected early next year, shows industry will have some flexibility in what information it publishes and where.Details of calorific value, fat, saturates, sugar and salt must be placed prominently “in the field of vision” of the viewer reading the name of the product and with a minimum font size of eight.“Small print size is one of the main causes of consumer dissatisfaction with food labels,” the paper says.While consumers like schemes such as the traffic light system in the UK, more evidence is needed on its effectiveness, it says.Drinks makers are worried by plans to force beverages with more than 1.2 per cent alcohol content to include the number of calories on the bottle. They will also have to provide a fuller list of ingredients.In addition, drinks other than tea or coffee that are high in caffeine content will have to say so prominently.A spokeswoman for Mr Kyprianou said that the legislation could be amended further before publication in the New Year. It will then have to be agreed by governments and the European parliament.

759;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
760;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-12-09T19:10:42Z;Europe sets sights on US students;;"A rainy autumn day in a business park to the west of Reading is an unlikely starting point for a trip to the UK. But for 15 students at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, just outside Chicago, there was a clear purpose.They were using their Thanksgiving break last month to visit companies in the London region to investigate opportunities for working in the UK, either on graduation or as an intern during their three-month summer break next year.Traditionally, the European job market has been difficult for US MBA graduates to break into, even when the companies involved are multinationals, because there are usually separate recruiting initiatives in each geographical region.“The on-campus recruiting in Kellogg is very robust,” says second-year student Stephen Silzer, who was one of the joint organisers of the Eurotrek. “It’s not as easy to get those contacts in Europe.”One of the four Americans on the Kellogg Eurotrek, Mr Silzer says he is looking at opportunities in both the US and Europe: “I’m not saying I am dead set on working in Europe, but if the opportunity is there . . . ”The six companies hosting the students in the UK – Abbott, Amazon, BP International, Google, PepsiCo and Yahoo – were eager to persuade the students of the joys of working for their respective companies.At the Theale Business Park near Reading, Salman Amin, president and chief executive of PepsiCo UK and himself a Kellogg alumnus, turned on the charm. Casually dressed in a sweater and no tie – in contrast to the Kellogg students – Mr Amin told students that what made a difference in MBA students was not brains nor technical know-how, but leadership and how to deal with adversity. “In my opinion, Kellogg does that better than any other business school.”While PepsiCo UK promoted itself as a flexible employer – 30 per cent of the management team works part-time, according to Ben Lamont, talent acquisition manager – a trip to Google in central London in the afternoon revealed a different culture. With free breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, Google employees are well fed, ran the cultural mantra from the Kellogg alumni who hosted the presentation.Google, according to a study compiled this year by Universum, the Swedish recruitment analysis company, is the most popular recruiter among MBA graduates in the US, and ranks third among European MBA graduates, ahead of Goldman Sachs, General Electric and LVMH. This may be one reason why its London office was particularly busy during Thanksgiving week, playing host to students from 10 US business schools, including Yale, Chicago, NYU Stern and the Darden school – 75 students in all.Good contactsThe aim of the exercise, according to Alison Parrin, MBA recruitment manager, was to open the doors to the students and talk about the roles they could expect from Google. Although the offer of internships or jobs was not the aim of the meeting, she says: “Certainly students have [already] followed up with me.”At Kellogg, Marisa Voorhees, senior associate director for alumni relations, says the Eurotrek students made good contacts during the trip. “By the end, students were very interested in working in Europe.”While Google was proving particularly popular with US MBA students, so too were the A-listed banks and finance houses in the City of London. More than 260 students from eight of the top US business schools – Chicago, Columbia, Harvard, Kellogg, MIT Sloan, NYU Stern, Stanford and Wharton – eschewed the traditional Thanksgiving turkey to attend the London Banking Days programme.This is the second year that 12 top banks, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and UBS, have held the two days of information and networking, and it is proving increasingly popular.Sessions at the event included one on investment banking versus hedge funds, another on the value of an MBA and a third on starting a career in London. There was also a speed networking event.“The purpose is to give the banks the opportunity to educate the students on what the European financial markets are about,” says Jackie Wilbur, director of career development at MIT Sloan.Pitching their skills to London-based banks will put MBA internees from these top schools in direct competition with their European peers from schools with two-year programmes, notably London Business School and Iese Business School in Barcelona.AsiaBut these days, for students who want to work in finance and banking, London is proving attractive, says Ms Wilbur. This is particularly true following the debt crisis in the US. “What New York is telling our students is, look to Europe and look to Asia,” she adds.US business schools have the “trek” culture down to a fine art. MIT Sloan students have access to 60 or 70 treks during their two-year programme, both industry-focused trips – finance or biotech for example – and geographical ones – to India, Hong Kong or London. And they are not alone. Kellogg students also reel off the list of locations and industries on the trek calendar.The problem, it seems, is trying to fit them all in. Or, indeed, to have any time to study.PepsiCo trawls schools in search of top international talentPepsiCo UK, the soft drinks maker that also owns the Walker’s Crisps and Quaker Oats brands, took the first steps last year to becoming an international MBA recruiter.

So the aim of the Global Leaders Programme, says Lucy Tarrant, MBA manager at Barclays GRCB, is to recruit a different type of person into the financial company.“Barclays has an ambitious growth profile,” Ms Tarrant says. “This is a programme we desperately need.”The bank is hoping to run a summer internship for around 20 first-year MBA students next year and recruit 30 full-time employees during September 2008. Eventually it could recruit as many as 50 MBA graduates each year.Ms Tarrant says that although the retail and commercial banking arms of Barclays have a well-established graduate-trainee
programme in place, MBA students will give a “quicker return on investment”.At the end of their three-year global rotation, the MBA graduates are all expected to take up positions as senior global managers, she says.www.ft.com/businesseducation"
761;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-12-05T07:34:05Z;Responsible investment: Reducing risks by going green;;Private bankers make easy targets for environmental activists. Green lobbyists often equate being rich with being greedy, and say high net worth individuals (HNWIs) consume too much of the world’s natural resources.In fact, private wealth managers are some of the most enthusiastic supporters of clean and green technologies.They have invested in them for decades, long before issues such as global warming became daily news items.Of course, their motives are not entirely altruistic. There are very good returns to be made from socially responsible investment (SRI), which broadly speaking means investing in companies and technologies that reduce pollution and energy consumption, and promote sustainable development.Some SRI may be old investment themes in trendier packages. Infrastructure such as new sewers may be worthy but dull and sounds a lot more exciting with a “green” label, especially if the project is in a fashionable country such as India or China.Nevertheless, issues such as climate change create the need for innovation, and as a result, opportunities for investors.“There’s nothing wrong with it, as long as it makes money,” says Joachim Straehle, chief executive of Bank Sarasin, the Swiss-based private bank owned by Rabobank of the Netherlands.Sarasin, he says, started looking at how environmental and social themes were affecting asset management as far back as 1989. The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 popularised the concept of sustainability, and raised clients’ interest in SRI as a possible investment theme.Sarasin installed one of Switzerland’s biggest solar panels at its headquarters in 1993, and a year later launched what it believes was the world’s first investment fund based on the concept of eco-efficiency.The assets managed by its specialist division, Sarasin Sustainable Investment, grew by more than a third between 2005 and 2006, to SFr5.5bn ($4.88bn).Asia shows lots of potential. Sarasin’s research says three-quarters of the solar collectors installed in the world last year were in China. Sarasin last month signed a letter of agreement with a South Korean private equity fund to invest in clean technology.Other wealth mangers are launching products to help their customers understand and benefit from these trends.Credit Suisse’s private-banking division launched the Credit Suisse Global Alternative Energy Index this year. This tracks alternative energy sources, and is designed to give investors worldwide exposure. CS also launched a Global Warming index in August covering renewable energy and carbon-controlling stocks.ABN Amro’s Climate Change & Environment Index measures the performance of stocks closely connected with tackling the adverse effects of climate change and mitigating environmental degradation.SRI has a harder theoretical edge that its soft-hearted “hug the planet, save the whales” image may disguise. High-profile alternative energy receives lots of publicity.But there also rewards for investors in mainstream companies that take sustainability seriously. Risks are reduced, and the quality of earnings increases. Environmental friendliness is often economically efficient.Profits for far-sighted companies that minimised their dependence on oil for energy or for raw materials proved to be less volatile than those of rivals caught unawares this year when crude oil surged to nearly $100 a barrel.Similarly, good safety and pollution control also make a lot of sense. They may cost more in the short run, but they reduce the chance of accidents, lawsuits, bad publicity and boycotts by consumers.Such technology is an important part of another SRI fund, the Clean Energy fund run by the asset management arm of Pictet, the Swiss private bank. This rose by 30 per cent in the six months following its launch in May.“That’s not negligible, given the state of the markets,” says Ivan Pictet, senior partner at the bank.The fund invests in renewable energy producers such as Vestas Wind, a Danish company that builds wind-powered generators, and Q-Cells of Germany, one of the world’s largest makers of solar cells. US companies dominate, but there are big holdings in businesses in Taiwan and Portugal as well.The Clean Energy fund is one of Pictet’s family of SRI-themed or related funds. The first big investment product was a Clean Water fund that was motivated in part by the realisation that one-quarter of the world did not have access to pure water.“We started it in 2000. That was when everyone was still talking about the internet,” says Mr Pictet. “Now it’s reached SFr6bn, which is one of the biggest water funds in the world. So far the interest is very broadly based. The Japanese are some of the biggest subscribers, but we have have sold a lot to US pension funds.”Asian interest in SRI will, he thinks, be stimulated over the next few years as growth makes cities less and less liveable.“I think it will take a couple of years but people will change their habits, and then change their investment habits,” says Mr Pictet. “It’s a particular issue here in Asia as people have to breathe the air in Hong Kong or Beijing. They will become more sensitive to investments of this kind.”SRI has drawbacks as a strategy. Restricting the range of companies it is possible to invest in can constrain performance. “SRI has had a good record so far but it might not necessarily have such a good performance in the future,” Mr Pictet says.And the popularity of SRI brings problems too. Pictet has had to close its Clean Water fund to fresh investors. “One of the biggest problems with all of these funds is that it’s difficult to find ‘pure plays’,” Mr Pictet says. “Our biggest investments are in multinationals that might have other businesses outside the water business.”The danger of that is the SRI funds simply looking, and performing, like blue-chip index funds.“We are making a second water fund soon that will be purely in technology related water treatment,” says Mr Pictet. “This will necessarily be smaller. It’s in the pipeline for the next 12 months. It may be more volatile but it will be a pure play on water technology.”Nevertheless he thinks SRI will become a mainstream investing theme. “For example if you have to choose between investing in Coke or Pepsi, then you will choose the one with the better environmental and social rating.”Mr Pictet says he understands why green sceptics might consider the bank opportunistic. But he points out that the family-owned bank’s pursuit of SRI dates back at least 10 years. “Not many people were talking about global warming then,” he says.The bank has had its carbon consumption audited, and tries to cut down on activities that produce greenhouse gases as a result.It encourages staff to take trains, not aircraft, and use video conferences whenever possible instead of travelling. Employees also receive free public transport passes.Mr Pictet does seem hurt by suggestions that private bankers somehow are cheerleaders for over-consumption of the world’s natural resources.“I think these people misunderstand the community of private bankers in Geneva,” he says. “You find a lot less exuberance compared to hedge funds, private equity or investment banking. We don’t drive big Mercedes at all.”

Revenues increased by 5.7 per cent to £716.3m. Earnings per share before exceptional items were 74 per cent higher at 19.5p.The final dividend was 7.7p, bringing the full-year dividend to 11p, 10 per cent higher than last year.The figures included a five week contribution from C&C, the Irish drinks business that Britvic bought for €250m in August. Renamed Britvic Ireland, the business includes the 7-Up and Pepsi distribution business in Ireland as well as the Ballygowan and Mi-Wadi brands.Sales volumes of J20, Britvic’s fruit juice brand, grew by 7 per cent over the year compared with the slower growing portfolio of Pepsi-brand drinks, which only gained 1.6 per cent. In water, Britvic’s Pennine Spring brand grew by 8.8 per cent over the year.Just under half of Britvic’s revenues come from the non-carbonated ‘stills’ sector, with the other half coming from carbonated drinks. However, Britvic’s stills business is growing 30 per cent faster than its carbonates sector, which includes the UK franchise for Pepsi.“Over the last three or four years there has been an accelerated growth in stills over the growth in fizzy drinks,” said Paul Moody, Britvic chief executive, who said he expected that trend to continue. He estimates that within three years stills will likely make up 55 per cent of the group’s revenue mix.International sales have been helped by expansion of Britvic’s Fruit Shoot children’s drink into the Netherlands as well as the introduction of Robinsons squash into Sweden, Finland and Denmark.Shares in Britvic rose 2½p to 340p on Thursday morning. Shares have gained 48 per cent since they floated at 230p in December 2005.
763;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-11-19T07:18:30Z;Birds Eye Iglo: Creating value from day one;;Tania Howarth knew what was awaiting her when she joined Birds Eye Iglo Group as chief information officer in April. Martin Glenn, chief executive, had already told her that there was “a knotty little IT problem” that needed to be fixed.“That’s a very interesting way of describing it,” says Ms Howarth, with due understatement.Mr Glenn heads a new management team that had taken over last November at the European frozen foods group – branded as Birds Eye in the UK and Iglo in continental Europe – following its purchase by Permira, the big European private equity firm.He and the new board knew that, following its separation from Unilever, the previous owners, Birds Eye Iglo would need a completely new IT systems and infrastructure. They wanted Ms Howarth, previously CIO at PepsiCo’s UK snack food business and subsequently for the Coca-Cola Company in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, to lead the overhaul.Under Unilever, she says, all eight countries that the future Birds Eye Iglo would be operating in had different IT system implementations. “Effectively there were eight country implementations and no common group operating model.” Although all the IT systems were based on enterprise software from SAP, the German software group, different versions were in use, and non-SAP applications varied too.“So [the creation of the new business] was seen as a really good opportunity to simplify the way we worked as a business, standardise what we did and allow new technology to deliver on its promise – that is, if you implement it well and with standards, you can reduce your operating costs quite substantially,” says Ms Howarth.The trouble was, Ms Howarth was initially virtually a one-woman IT team at Birds Eye Iglo, and with 20 years of experience leading IT-enabled change, she knew she needed a consultancy to work with her. The approach was to select outsourcing partners to deliver both the new systems and infrastructure and provide support thereafter, with a very small retained IT organisation which had to be recruited almost from scratch. Fujitsu was chosen as the infrastructure partner and a technology consulting partnership was sought to “make sure that we asked for the right thing – to be our chief technology officer, effectively”, she says.Speed was of the essence. Permira had set a deadline of a year from the sale for the company to be completely independent and to have addressed its legacy IT issues. Ms Howarth wanted a consultancy that would get on with it. “We wanted a company with deep technology skills that could come in and start producing real value from day one,” she says. A pragmatic approach was also needed, unencumbered by endless discussions over methodologies – which is often the way with large consultancies, she says.Within a few weeks of Ms Howarth’s appointment, she had chosen Xantus, an independent IT consultancy with offices in London and Manchester, for the task. Steve Watmough, managing director, says the role was that of a trusted adviser working as part of the client organisation. “It was a business assurance role to start with,” he says, “with us asking whether what was proposed would be fit for purpose now and in the future.”Permira, meanwhile, kept a watching brief, approaching the IT programme with two views that needed reconciling, says Ms Howarth: “It wanted us to have a new set of systems that would run the business efficiently, in a fit-for-purpose way, and with best-in-class costs. But we needed to implement it in a way that doesn’t stop the business running and create huge operational challenges.”Private-equity owners are inevitably going to be more active as shareholders than the average portfolio investor, and Ms Howarth says Permira has “been very involved in the sense that it has held us to account and been very interested in what we have been doing, not to meddle operationally or get too involved in the choices we have made necessarily with vendors but just to make sure that we’re managing the risk appropriately.”For Xantus, the presence of Permira as owner did not make any particular difference to the way it worked, says Mr Watmough. “Birds Eye Iglo is a very focused business with clear objectives,” he says, “and by the very nature of that fact, some of the deadlines have really had to be very concentrated. I think any divestment which had the same clear objectives in terms of getting itself up and running would have had similar challenges.”Although tried and tested technology has been used, with the same version of SAP being put in across the group, the complexities of the job have pushed out the completion date to next May with work in Germany to be finished a few months later.In October, Birds Eye Iglo’s group headquarters and UK business moved to a new office near London’s Heathrow airport. This was a very important symbolic step as the first big, visible deliverable from the IT project, says Ms Howarth. “I believed that executing the IT elements of this had to be perfect. If we couldn’t get this right, we would lose a lot of trust and belief that we can pull off the bigger things, especially as people generally don’t have high expectations of IT delivery!”“So this one did delight the customer and it was one of those moments where you have a team of people who deliver great things and nobody is interested – or even notices – whether they are permanent employees or consultants or third-party providers.”
764;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-11-08T22:40:10Z;InBev disappoints;;The problem with being a one-trick pony is that you have to get the trick right every time. InBev, cost-cutter extraordinaire, has just let down its audience. A weak set of third-quarter numbers suggests consensus earnings estimates for the full year need to fall about 5 per cent. The shock was sufficient to knock shares by 10 per cent on Thursday.That share prices for the other brewers remain largely untroubled illustrates the dent to the Belgian company’s popularity. While its peers have been keen to talk up their branding strategies and growth prospects, InBev has been all about overheads. The culture of efficiency bred at South American group AmBev was transferred to the mature-markets business of Interbrew when the two merged to form InBev in 2004. The new group has produced steadily rising earnings, and its best-in-class valuation, before Thursday’s fall, approached 19 times forward earnings.However, in the third quarter a combination of weak sales growth – hit by an 8 per cent drop in western European volumes from last year – and strong input cost inflation limited margin improvement. With top-line growth lagging behind that of its peers, and merger savings extracted, this raises the risk that, as prices for malt and barley go through the roof, InBev’s cost-cutting experts may be human after all.One solution would be further consolidation to produce new cost savings. The group could raise about €15bn by taking gearing to four times net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. But the difficulty is finding a target of sufficient size. Mexican brewer Femsa would create antitrust problems in Brazil (and it bottles for Coca-Cola, while InBev fills for PepsiCo). This arguably leaves just a deal with Anheuser-Busch. Family control remains an obstacle but, without a new friend, further disappointments may lie in store for InBev.
765;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-11-05T19:58:37Z;PepsiCo links up operations in Americas;;PepsiCo, the food and beverage company, is breaking down the divisions between its North American businesses and Latin America, reflecting the growing importance of its international business.As the part of restructuring, Dawn Hudson, one of America’s most successful women executives, is to step down as head of Pepsi-Cola North America, the main drinks business, in a move that underlines the declining importance to the company of its signature cola drink.Under the changes the company will lift the number of operating divisions from two – North America and International – to three.Under a new structure the North America business joins Gatorade and Tropicana in a new PepsiCo Americas Food division, headed by John Compton. Mr Compton was given responsibility for all PepsiCo’s North America businesses shortly after the appointment of Indra Nooyi as group chief executive last year.A new PepsiCo Americas Beverages division, headed by Massimo d’Amore, will include both the Quaker foods and Frito-Lay snacks units, as well as PepsiCo’s Mexican Sabritas snacks and Gamesa divisions. Michael White will remain head of PepsiCo International, covering the rest of the world.Ms Nooyi said that the new units linking developed and developing markets “allow us to better share best practices among our North America and international businesses, while providing valuable development opportunities for our senior executives”.PepsiCo is one of the first major US consumer products companies to link up its operations in the US and Canada with Latin America. Coca-Cola, its larger rival, operates a separate North America business unit.The changes reflect the growing globalisation of PepsiCo’s operations, with more than 37 per cent of its $35bn revenues last year coming from outside the US.PepsiCo said Ms Hudson, a talented marketer, was leaving the company to “pursue other interests” after a reorganisation that creates three new operating divisions.When Ms Hudson first became head of Pepsi-Cola North America in in 2005, she reported to PepsiCo’s chief executive, overseeing the Pepsi brand, as well as Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist carbonated drinks and the Aquafina water brand.However, following Ms Nooyi’s appointment, the North America cola unit moved down the hierarchy, leading to speculation over her role.The Pepsi-Cola North America unit currently accounts for about 30 per cent of Pepsi­Co’s overall sales.
766;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-10-23T18:23:04Z;Decision with freedom of Europe at its heart;;Article 56 of the Treaty on the Economic Community is quite peremptory: “All restrictions on the movement of capital between member states and between member states and third countries shall be prohibited.”This is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the European Union – the freedom of movement of capital. The other three are: the freedom of movement of goods, services and persons.The freedom of movement of goods was largely established by January 1 1993. The freedom of movement of persons is a reality among the old 15 member states. It is not yet perfect as regards the 12 newcomers but will no doubt in due time become so.The freedom of movement of services was supposed to follow from the services directive which, after a prolonged debate characterised by much heat but little light, was finally adopted by the European Parliament in an emasculated form.These three freedoms apply only among member states. The one on capital is exceptional in that it works tous azimuths, as the French say – it applies to the whole world.What are capital movements? Not only movements of capital between banks but also cross-border investment in shares. That is the standard doctrine of the European Court of Justice. Any company may therefore invest in any other company – special circumstances to do with public order and national security excepted.When therefore Antonio Fazio, former governor of the Bank of Italy, tried to block the purchase of the Antonveneta bank by ABN-Amro, he contravened European law. If the French government had stopped Pepsico, which reputedly wanted to buy Danone, it would have done the same, yoghurt not really being a substance to do with national security.Some governments have attempted to retain their power after a privatis­ation by means of a so-called “golden share” with extraordinary powers. This is what the UK government tried to do in the case of the British Airports Authority. But when the European Commission threatened legal action, it disposed of its golden share.The German government wanted to protect Volkswagen from being taken over. It did so by means of a “VW law”, which is not a golden share but serves the same purpose. This law says that no shareholder may exercise more than 20 per cent of the votes. It is at variance with German company law, which forbids voting caps. Also, 20 per cent of the shares of Volkswagen are held in the public hand, by the state of Lower Saxony. So Volkswagen may take over other carmakers – and has done so – but cannot be taken over itself.It is clear that the VW law infringes article 56 of the treaty, and on Tuesday the ECJ overturned it. This comes after the European Commission had repeatedly tried and failed to convince the German government of the error of its ways. Gerhard Schröder, the former chancellor, invoked the special character of VW as a paragon of popular capitalism, calling this former commissioner “der unselige Holländer”, the wretched Dutchman.He appeared to look upon companies such as Volkswagen as fortresses that must be defended against all comers. He thereby forgot that the interests of management may not be the same as those of shareholders. It is a corporatist view that is not in the interest of the German economy. Traditionally, German companies, especially medium-sized ones belonging to the Mittelstand, have been financed by banks. But for obvious reasons it would be preferable if they were financed by the capital market. Loans must be repaid, shares not. Shareholder capitalism therefore has decided advantages.Franz Müntefering, now the vice-chancellor, also has doubts about shareholder capitalism. He dislikes private equity and hedge funds, which he has likened to locusts that fasten on to a company in order to suck it dry, leaving an empty shell. But there are not many such cases. The main effect of these funds is that they force management to become sharper, in the interest of the companies themselves – and of their shareholders.The whole country benefits where companies are well-run and profitable. This is not to say private equity and hedge funds need no supervision. More transparency is certainly needed, for a start. But sleepy management needs it also and these funds can provide it.These matters concern the heart and essence of economic policy in Europe. The ECJ’s decision places them squarely on the public agenda.The writer was European commissioner for the internal market, 1999-2004

It also represents one of the largest ever private equity investments in the manufacturing sector in China.Foreign private equity firms have faced difficulties securing approvals for proposed investments in China, highlighted by the two-year wait by Carlyle Group for official clearance for its planned minority investment in Xugong, the country’s largest construction machinery maker.However, William Ho, managing director of CVC Asia Pacific, said that the investment had been approved by China’s regulators including key bodies such as the ministry of commerce and the country’s securities watchdog.The Zhuhai Zhongfu deal was made by CVC Capital Partners Asia Pacific II, a $2bn fund.Overseas private equity firms have stepped up their investments in to China’s manufacturing sector.Blackstone, the US private equity group, this summer spent $600m for a 20 per cent stake in China National BlueStar, a state-owned chemical maker.CVC’s move is unusual because few investments to date have been in the form of acquiring shares in a listed company.However, the deal highlights the growing need for private equity firms to think creatively about how they can put money to play in a region in which buy-outs are rare and where it can be hard to secure approvals
768;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-10-19T16:05:36Z;These welcoming shores;;"I love living in America. A lot of my fellow foreigners agree. Consider, for example, Indra Nooyi, the Chennai-born PepsiCo boss ranked as the most powerful woman in American business by Fortune magazine. Mrs Nooyi is the sunny sort of CEO who can hardly find a bad thing to say about anything or anyone – at least in an on-the-record interview. But even against this background of very good cheer, her enthusiasm for her adopted country is striking.“I’m going to tell you something from first-hand experience,” she said when I asked her this week if post-9/11 America had become more hostile to foreigners. “Of all the countries in the world, the United States is still the most open and the most welcoming country, bar none.” To be sure she had made the point, she repeated the phrase “opening and welcoming” twice more for
good measure.America has, of course, been pretty terrific for Mrs Nooyi, but even we non-captains of industry can find a lot to like here. Naureen Chowdhury Fink, the globe-trotting 29-year-old daughter of Bangladeshi diplomats, considers New York home because of how readily this city accepts diversity: “I feel it is a place where I can be the many parts of me . . . I can wear a sari and buy spices to cook with, or I can throw on my jeans and tank-top and grab a coffee and a bagel.”If you are American, I imagine you will accept such praise from these brilliant, foreign-born women as your country’s due. An important part of America’s self-conception, after all, is that it is the land of opportunity, built by attracting the best and brightest from around the world. This notion of the ultimate immigrant-friendly society prevails even in places you might not expect: at one recent private seminar, intelligence and homeland security officials spoke passionately of America’s success at absorbing Muslim immigrants as an essential defence against homegrown terrorist attacks of the sort Britain and Spain have suffered.But, if you are American, you may
not have noticed that your country is becoming a little – or a lot – less welcoming to those of us not born here, or who to some people look
as if we may not have been born here. Boston College professor
and immigration lawyer Daniel Kanstroom thinks America is now
in one of its periodic phases of increased ambivalence about outsiders, with “a general erosion
of respect for human and constitutional rights in this country for both citizens and non-citizens”.Rendition, which Prof Kanstroom describes as a “particularly malign form” of this trend, may finally capture public attention this weekend when a movie of the same name, starring American sweetheart Reese Witherspoon, opens in the US. We may be even less aware of what Prof Kanstroom calls “a very big, well-developed system” which, if you count voluntary deportations, expels 1m people a year from America.Probably because my mother was born in a displaced persons camp, my very personal sympathies are ineluctably on the side of the deported. But you don’t need to be a bleeding heart like me to worry that what University of Toronto law professor Audrey Macklin calls the effort to distinguish between “the good immigrant and the bad immigrant” might, in real life, make all of us feel a little less at home.It certainly concerns a lot of tough-minded capitalists – the FT’s core constituency and the people we talk to the most. One tech industry titan recently told a colleague that if America didn’t watch out, the next Sergei Brin would found the next Google in Russia, not in Silicon Valley. Cicso’s John Chambers, another Bay Area CEO, this week told journalists in New York that immigration was “one of the very most important issues facing our country . . . We have always united the best and the brightest from around the world . . . I am very concerned that we could be distracted on this issue”.I know several American business people who increasingly travel outside the US to meet their global clients or non-American colleagues: the foreigners find going through US immigration too much of an ordeal. Try asking your non-American friends – all of us have had our little moments of unpleasantness. Mine is the grilling of one of my aunts (a 62-year-old retired teacher) when she came to New York to visit my mother as she was dying of cancer – her sister was probably an illegal alien in the US, my aunt was warned. Prof Macklin was embarrassed to recall how she herself was once forced to miss a flight to the US “on the grounds that, according to the immigration officer, I had an attitude.”America is still such a great place that a lot of people are prepared to put up with much more than a long line and a surly exchange at JFK. But the country needs to be careful not to take the love of the world and its immigrants for granted. Globalisation has intensified the competition for smart people and –
at least at the moment – that’s one contest that other countries are working at just a little harder.On a visit to Canada this summer, I noticed a poster in downtown Toronto with a picture of a taxi driver and the question: “If Canada is a land of opportunity, why is a professor driving a cab?” It was part of a $600,000 ad campaign sponsored primarily by the provincial and federal governments, and designed to provoke the native-born into doing better by the newcomers. As the US wages its “war on terror”, it would be a pity if it lost a fight that may be even more important for its long-term security – the war for talent.Chrystia Freeland is the FT’s US managing editorchrystia.freeland@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/freeland"
769;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-10-17T04:38:45Z;Food groups shape up for action;;"The food industry is battling to avert tighter regulation as the government’s crackdown on obesity trains an ever brighter spotlight on its activities.In its attempt to strike a balance between defending its products and appeasing the healthy-eating lobby, the industry has come a long way since early 2005 when Sir John Sunderland, the chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, declared: “There is no such thing as a good or a bad food, only a good or bad diet.”With evidence mounting that the problem of obesity is worsening rather than improving, the industry has become more circumspect in its comments – and more audacious in its actions.Although food groups still maintain that people must take responsibility for their own diets and health, they now acknowledge they can help them do that.Nestlé, the manufacturer of Kit Kats, has cut back the amount of sugar used by 12 per cent and reduced it by a third in the Tip Top dessert topping widely served to children.Mars has promised to stop marketing confectionery to consumers younger than 12 by the end of the year, raising its current threshold from six-year-olds. Unilever has emulated the move and plans to advertise only “healthier” foods to under-11s by the end of next year.McDonald’s is lowering the amount of trans-fat it uses in cooking fried foods to about 2 per cent, from 10 per cent; PepsiCo, which owns the Walkers crisp brand, has created wholegrain snacks called SunBites; and Cadbury’s offers a broader range of portion sizes in chocolate.The Food and Drink Federation, which represents the industry, said: “We’ve made a massive contribution here in the UK. We’re widely recognised for leading the world on …reformulating products, extending consumer choice [in products low in fat and sugar], and …improved nutritional labelling.”But obesity experts say the industry will need to take more radical action if it is to avoid regulation.Neville Rigby, the director of policy at the International Obesity Task Force, said: “The industry has not got the message yet that, across the board, they have to make big changes.”He says that while some companies are voluntarily adapting to the new climate, others are dragging their feet.The industry is unlikely to meet the government’s 2010 voluntary salt reduction targets, he maintains, although some companies claim already to have met them for specific products.Mr Rigby believes governments should consider following the lead of Denmark, which has placed a near-ban on trans-fats.Consumer organisations have called on the European Commission to implement a mandatory nutritional labelling system after the Food Standard Agency’s preference for a “traffic light” system was ignored by many companies. Instead, they went ahead and implemented guideline daily amounts (GDAs).Jim Murray, the director of BEUC, the European consumers’ organisation, says GDAs are too complicated and there is a need for something simpler. The FSA has asked independent researchers to evaluate the different systems.Health campaigners also say that while food companies could do more, so too could governments.Kurt Widhalm, the president of the European Childhood Obesity Group, wants to see more government-backed programmes. He proposes a European Academy for the Prevention of Obesity be established to finance research into the condition."
770;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-10-11T21:28:29Z;PepsiCo confident on global demand;;PepsiCo, the food and beverage company, on Thursday expressed confidence in the continued strength of the global economy, despite the risks of a possible slowdown in the US next year.Indra Nooyi, chief executive, told investors that the company was “sensitive to the possibility of slower US economic growth” in 2008.However, she said she remained confident that PepsiCo could still deliver at least 10 per cent growth in earnings per share in the coming year, supported by a global presence that could “enable us to capitalise on the favourable macro-economic climate in most of our international markets.”Ms Nooyi said PepsiCo, as part of its planning for next year, was currently “going through a scenario for potential economic slowdown in the US”“That means we sit down and think through if there is a slowdown in the US could there be a ripple effect in other countries,” she said.Michael White, head of the international division that accounts for about 40 per cent of the company’s revenues, said he has seen no sign of any slowdown in PepsiCo’s business in emerging markets.“I still am feeling very positive about the economic outlook for the emerging markets for next year,” he said. “I think you will continue to see really solid growth out of these markets, and I don’t think the US housing thing is going to have a significant impact on those emerging markets.”PepsiCo also warned on Thursday that it expected higher commodity prices to continue into 2008, and was expecting commodity prices in the US, excluding orange juice, to increase by one percentage point more than the current year.“Across the board we’re seeing that all grain prices have gone up, and we’re not seeing supplies come on as fast as we’d like it to come on given the growth in demand,” Ms Nooyi said.During its third quarter, PepsiCo said that its international operations had benefited from the cointinuing weakness of the dollar.International revenues rose 22 per cent, compared to 6 per cent increase for its North American FritoLay division, while operating profits increased 19 per cent, against 7 per cent for FritoLay and Pepsi Beverages in North America.Overall, PepsiCo reported a 17 per cent increase in net income, to $1.74bn or 89 cents per diluted share against the same period last year.
771;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-10-11T05:42:26Z;Indian managers could run the world;;In India, the executive awards season is upon us again. This is when corporate India, not content to take breakneck sales growth and soaring profits and stock prices as reward enough for its efforts, goes into a self-congratulatory tizzy.Leading the charge is The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence, organised by the country’s biggest English language financial daily.The newspaper has tried to drum up a sense of excitement ahead of the awards, breathlessly telling readers on its front page that the judges for the event were holding their first meetings to decide the winners at a hotel in Bangalore.“As far as top-line muscle goes, this one’s got to be the best quarter (sic). On Wednesday, India Inc’s first citizens, led by Infy’s (Infosys Technologies) NR Narayana Murthy and Wipro’s Azim Premji will go into a huddle at Bangalore’s Windsor Manor,” the article said, referring to the country’s premier information technology entrepreneurs. “The high-powered group is enough to make the Sensex (the Bombay stock exchange index) shed a [drop of] sweat or two.”Leaving aside the hyperbole, however, it is easy to see why Indian executives are feeling good about themselves. This has been a year in which their entrepreneurial spirit has been on display as never before.For the rest of the world, the most visible manifestation of this has been the entry by Indian companies into global mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The Tata group, one of the country’s largest private sector conglomerates, captured the most headlines with its £6.7bn takeover of Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steel producer. But this was just one of many deals. Among the country’s most aggressive entrepreneurs has been Tulsi Tanti, whose wind power company, Suzlon Energy, bought the German turbine maker REpower Systems this year.But the real test of the competence of Indian managers is profit. Ridham Desai, Morgan Stanley equities strategist in Mumbai, estimates that net profit for the companies he covers will show average growth of 22 per cent in the year to March 2008 while net revenue will grow 36.4 per cent. Return on equity will slip slightly from 23 per cent a year earlier to 21 per cent but will remain respectably high.This last measure is critical when comparing Indian executives with counterparts in other emerging markets. Unlike many of their peers in China, who often run state-controlled companies that benefit from easy credit from government banks and are largely unaccountable, Indian executives focus on returns and capital efficiency.This was also a year when managers from India and elsewhere in the subcontinent were feted for their rise up the ladder of multinationals. Prominent managers, such as PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi or Publicis’ chief innovation officer Rishad Tobaccowala, have drawn attention to the deep pool of talent in the subcontinent and among the world’s 25m non-resident Indians.Not surprisingly, this has led to an increasing focus on India by executive search companies as a source of managers for the domestic market and overseas companies looking to staff their global networks.Boyden, the executive search company, in a recent report, sought to define reasons Indian managers tend to be entrepreneurial. Apart from being well-educated and English-speaking, Indian executives have learned to be highly adaptable in the face of adversity in their domestic market.“India’s limited infrastructure, widely acknowledged as a longstanding liability, obliges people to develop their own resourcefulness,” Boyden offers.“The country’s still cumbersome bureaucracy has encouraged inventiveness and creative thinking just in dealing with it,” it says, adding: “The flip side is that values often get fuzzy or become casualties in the process.”One strong indicator of India’s increasing importance as a source of talent is that it is beginning to show up in the profits of recruitment companies: one, Korn Ferry, said in the first quarter its Asia-Pacific revenue grew 24 per cent, largely because of India and China.India is also starting to attract M&A in executive search and human resources. In July, the UK-based executive search company Hat Pin bought Executive Access India for £6.9m.However, while no one doubts the quality of talent, there are concerns about quantity.With the economy now growing as quickly as that of China, India’s quality business schools are no longer producing a surfeit of managers.In addition, with fat salaries and exciting careers at home, Indian executives have become far more reluctant to move abroad, particularly if this involves going to a market smaller than India or less attractive than, for instance, the US or Europe. Noting the increasing demand for Indian talent, Boyden devotes a third of its report to how to attract and retain managers. The heyday of the Indian executive may be here. But that might prove to be a two-edged sword for would-be domestic and foreign employers used to seeing the country as a limitless pool of cost-effective managerial talent.
772;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-10-10T21:59:58Z;Cadbury Schweppes demerges;;Time for plan B. With private equity’s ability to buy Cadbury Schweppes’ beverage business compromised by risk aversion in the credit markets, the confectionery group has reluctantly opted for a demerger. The door for a buyer is still very much open – management has until next spring to sort out the details of listing on the New York Stock Exchange – but a straight stock split now seems the most likely outcome.This provides clarity, at least, but will it improve share price performance? A US listing is logical, since the vast bulk of the business is in North America. Local equity valuations for beverage businesses are higher than in Europe but a discount to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo is likely. Both have fast-growing international businesses, while Cadbury is experiencing a “challenging US market”. It will also be necessary to find buyers for stock that many European investors will be unable to hold. A 10 per cent discount suggests an enterprise valuation of only about £6.5bn, compared with the £7.5bn-£8bn mooted this year.The scope to gear up beverages to fund a special dividend, if financing conditions improve, looks limited as well. Coke and Pepsi are run with net debt to earnings before interest, tax, amortisation and depreciation of about 1.5 times. At group level, the Cadbury ratio is already almost two times. Similarly, the prospects of a bid emerging for its confectionary side remain slim, in spite of helpfully timed comments on Tuesday from the trust that controls US chocolate maker Hershey. But the trust’s insistence on retaining voting control rules out a merger, and Hershey lacks the firepower for a full cash bid.So what next? Cadbury plans to lift margins, while maintaining growth. Third quarter sales, flattered by last year’s UK salmonella scare, are encouraging, but higher raw material prices, chiefly for milk, are creating a headwind. Plan B, unfortunately, looks like business as normal.
773;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-10-10T21:20:05Z;Catering to the tastes of the times;;When Cadbury Schweppes last week said it was closing its Keynsham factory near Bristol and cutting jobs at its historic Bournville site in Birmingham, investors took it as a sign that the maker of Flake bars and Maynards Wine Pastilles was closing the door on its past.So when the company on Wednesday announced the pending retirement of chairman Sir John Sunderland, a former chief executive who has been with the company almost 40 years, it appeared that Cadbury was also saying goodbye to its old guard.Over the past decade, the company that was established in 1824 by Quaker John Cadbury has been painfully adapting to the modern world, transforming itself from a British chocolate manufacturer famous throughout the Commonwealth for the “glass and a half” of milk that goes into its purple-packaged blocks, into a global confectionery company.When Todd Stitzer took the helm of the company four years ago, he hastened the group’s transformation by cutting costs, restructuring its soft drinks businesses and overseeing Cadbury’s move into chewing gum, a potentially more lucrative market than chocolate.However, change hasn’t come fast enough for investors, who have been worried by the company’s failure to meet its ambitious profit targets.Cadbury’s sluggish core chocolate business has been a particular source of concern, as the group’s mass market milk chocolate brands have become less popular with consumers increasingly attuned to the delights of dark chocolate.Cadbury lost market share in the UK when it undertook a massive recall because of salmonella contamination last year, and has not yet fully recovered.In recent months, Cadbury has found new ways to save money, announcing plans to shut factories and move out of its expensive Mayfair headquarters.Still, delays in the company’s plans to separate its beverages and confectionery divisions have rattled investors, who have met Roger Carr, the company’s deputy chairman, and senior independent non-executive director, to express concerns over the group’s business strategy.“There has been a question over the group’s strategy for some time,” one investor said on Wednesday.Mr Stitzer took pains on Wednesday to emphasise how “important” it was for Cadbury to improve its profit margins, and was unusually blunt in his description of how the company planned to go about it. “We have laid down a list of efficiency actions that could kill a horse,” he said.Investors, some of whom said Sir John “did not have easy relations” with shareholders, welcomed news of his impending departure. One institutional investor said: “It’s time for Sunderland to go. He has been there close to 40 years and the chief executive has been operating with one hand tied behind his back.”Meanwhile, analysts said the decision to press ahead with a de-merger resolved some uncertainty over Cadbury’s future.Martin Deboo, an analyst at Investec, said management appeared to have recovered a “bit of poise” in Wednesday’s trading update. “Management now sound a lot more confident and relaxed than in June.”But Cadbury still has challenges to address.Analysts were surprised to hear on Wednesday of the resignation of Gil Cassagne, president and chief executive of the company’s beverages business. Mr Cassagne is being replaced by Larry Young, chief operating officer of bottling operations.John Sicher, editor of US soft drinks newsletter Beverage Digest, said that while both men were “talented” managers, the pending separation of the beverages business might have raised questions over strategy.Mr Sicher said: “These corporate separation transactions can be difficult and stressful. Sometimes along the way people have different but totally legitimate positions on some issues.”The beverage business had a difficult quarter. Although sales rose compared with a year earlier, profits were hurt by higher commodity costs and the launch of a new sports drink, Accelerade, this year.

774;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;YouGov pushes on with its global ambitions;;YouGov, the internet pollster, on Monday brushed off the loss of a profile-boosting election to push ahead with a plan to build a low-cost global research group.The Middle East was YouGov’s most profitable region last year and more recent acquisitions have expanded its interests in the US, Germany and Scandinavia.In spite of abandoning a proposed Australian joint venture, the group is still eyeing new markets though some such as Russia will be served by panels of internet respondents managed from outside the country.Nadhim Zahawi, chief executive, said: “In the old world, you had to have armies of researchers with clipboards and telephones, and local offices everywhere.“We’re building an internet research business which will operate globally from 12-14 hubs.”In the Middle East, where YouGov acquired Siraj, a Dubai company in July 2006, multinationals such as Unilever and PepsiCo have been commissioning YouGov research into the region’s fast-expanding consumer markets.Most of YouGov’s acquisitions came after the end of its financial year, and their impact is expected to mean it makes more money outside the UK than within it for the first time.Over the longer term, Mr Zahawi said, the group would aim to reflect the geography of the market research industry, with the US its biggest market followed by the UK.Cash and borrowing facilities gave YouGov access to about £21m for further deals, he said, though the management was focused on integrating its purchases.With political polling providing less than 3 per cent of YouGov’s revenues, the group said the prime minister’s decision not to call an election would have little impact on trading.By contrast, sales of consumer research products, such as BrandIndex and Omnibus, and bespoke studies have powered ahead in the UK.Group turnover on continuing businesses rose 51 per cent from £9.47m to £14.3m in the year to July 31.Pre-tax profits rose 36 per cent to £5.52m. Basic earnings per share, restated after a five-for-one share split in April, rose 36 per cent to 6.1p.The company wants to reinvest cash flows in its expansion.Shares, which underperformed the Aim All-Share index by about 20 per cent in the year to Friday, rose ½p to 167p.
775;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-10-05T18:25:02Z;Starbucks loses froth;;After a frenzy of store openings, Starbucks’ US growth prospects are cooling. Growth in footfall has waned and prices have gone up to offset higher dairy, staff and rental costs. New stores are also cannibalising existing units, and the coffee chain has grown more reliant on riskier international growth.Dollars and cents aside, Starbucks also faces strategic questions. Some of its stores have grown cluttered and inefficient, and sales expertise has dwindled as the ranks of baristas have swelled. The company has rightly slowed its growth ambitions and should consider taming them further if it wants to position itself as the best coffee house on the block. In spite of these growing pains, Starbucks still hardly needs to check over its shoulder on its competitors.New coffees at Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonalds have won accolades but are pitched at the lower end of the market. Starbucks’ recent price increases may repel a few customers and a $4.50 latte will become harder to justify if the US economy stumbles. But, even then, many Starbucks devotees are expected to stay loyal to the small, high-margin luxuries it peddles. To hedge its bets, Starbucks has also expanded its ready-to-drink coffee venture with Pepsi and joined with Kraft to sell individual coffee pods for home machines.After slumping by one third in the past year, the company’s shares trade at about 25 times estimated 2008 earnings. Forecasts for earnings growth of at least 20 per cent next year help justify a premium to the market. But Starbucks is under pressure to turn its international business, which now accounts for just 10-15 per cent of operating profit, into its growth engine. The rapid roll-out will be bumpy and international margins – still only half those in the US – must improve. With plans to treble the global store count still intact, Starbucks’ executives could probably use a cup of coffee.
776;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-09-24T18:06:39Z;Bottled water and the madness of crowds;;The walk from the FT to the Savoy Grill was longer than I remembered. It was a warm London day and I was running late. Arriving, I discovered to my relief that my lunch companion was running even later. “Can I bring you anything to drink?” the woman who showed me to my table asked. A glass of tap water, I said. You would have thought I had requested a lap dance from the maître d’.After some disapproving shuffling, my water arrived as my companion slipped into her seat. “Some wine?” our waiter asked. Just water, she replied. “Sparkling, still or” – he gave me a sharp glance – “tap water?”Repeat this performance often enough and I suppose we should not be surprised that sales of bottled water worldwide have increased to 180bn litres a year from 78bn a decade ago. But future generations of historians will surely view our attitude to drinking water with astonishment.Thames Water charges my household a little over £1 ($2) a day for all the water we can drink and as much as we need to shower, bath, flush the toilets and run the washing machine and dishwasher. Why would we pay a price close to that daily rate for a half-litre plastic bottle of the stuff?Those of us who have access to clean and safe drinking water are the luckiest people on earth. Millions do not. We are also the luckiest in history. Until a little under a century ago, public drinking water carried with it the risk of typhoid fever or cholera. Only the very poor drank water. Those who could afford it drank beer or tea with boiled water instead. People with some money drank “small beer” – water mixed with enough beer to kill off some of those nasty micro-organisms.Adding chlorine to the water supply changed all that. In his illuminating book, Wellsprings: a Natural History of Bottled Spring Waters, the American hydrologist, Francis Chapelle, says the chlorination of public drinking water “has probably saved more human lives than any other technological advance in public health history”.So why do people still buy bottled water? Many say it is the chlorine that drives them to it: they do not like the taste. Except that in blind tastings, most people cannot tell the difference between tap and bottled water. My favourite tasting was carried out in 1997 by The Sunday Times. One supposedly expert member of its panel described a glass of water as having a “fresh, sweet lemony aroma”. It was tap water from a Birmingham public toilet.Others say they do not believe tap water is as safe as their governments claim. Drinking water poisoned people in Cornwall, south-west England, in 1988. In 1993, hundreds of thousands in Milwaukee suffered diarrhoea and vomiting after the water supply was contaminated. More than 100 died.But bottled water has had its contamination scares too, although admittedly they have never hurt any one. Perrier had to destroy 160m bottles in 1990 after the discovery of benzene levels twice as high as those regarded as safe by the World Health Organisation. (Benzene is a flammable chemical used in the production of paint and cleaning fluids.)In 2004, Coca-Cola recalled its Dasani bottled mineral water in the UK after discovering that it contained illegal levels of bromate, a chemical that could increase the risk of cancer. It also emerged that Dasani was processed tap water. Several of the leading brands are processed tap water.In his book, Mr Chapelle argues that we cannot ascribe the vogue for bottled water to mere shallowness. Worries about water are buried deep in our consciousness.Water-borne micro-organisms, he writes, “have had 3.9bn years to figure out various ingenious lifestyles for surviving and thriving in water. Humanity, on the other hand, has only been in the water-treatment business for a few hundred years.” Water fussiness is part of what it means to be human.But even Mr Chapelle’s sympathy is strained by the bottled-water drinkers of New York City, whose tap water arrives from the Catskill Mountains, naturally infused with just enough calcium, magnesium and potassium to give it a truly delicious taste. Yet New Yorkers probably drink more bottled water than anyone. It is about fashion, he concludes.People spend thousands on luxury-branded handbags for the same reason. But at least buyers of handbags do not receive an unlimited supply of nearly identical products at home almost free of charge.Still, there is a change in the air. However much people fear chlorine in their water, they fear climate change more. And climate change at least has some solid science behind it. San Francisco’s city authorities and the UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are questioning the environmental cost of bottling and transporting all that water. Coke and PepsiCo are promising to increase their recycling of plastic water bottles. We can all do our bit. Stand up to those waiters.michael.skapinker@ft.com

778;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-09-16T21:12:37Z;Coca-Cola, Pepsi to step up recycling;;Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are stepping up efforts to recycle plastic containers amid a growing backlash against the sale of bottled water in the US and the UK.Authorities including San Francisco’s city government and the UK’s Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, have recently raised concerns over the amount of plastic and energy wasted on a liquid that can be had from a tap.A widespread consumer and government attack on bottled water would hit a multibillion dollar industry and deprive Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Nestlé and others of a significant source of profits in a market that has grown rapidly because of consumers’ preference for non-fizzy, healthier drinks.US sales of bottled water have more than doubled in the past decade, reaching $10.8bn last year, according to the Beverage Marketing Corporation.Last week, Neville Isdell, Coca-Cola’s chief executive, said the company could achieve its goal of recycling all its plastic bottles within five years.Meanwhile, Indra Nooyi, his counterpart at Pepsi, which owns the Aquafina water brand, has said the drinks and snacks group would “do more” to recycle plastic containers.However, unlike Coca-Cola, which owns six recycling plants across the world, Ms Nooyi said it did not make sense for Pepsi – the world’s biggest producer of bottled water after Nestlé – to build its own facilities.San Francisco has banned city departments from buying bottled water dispensers, and wants them to get rid of large bottled water dispensers by the end of the year. It is encouraging other Californian cities to follow its lead. In the UK, Liverpool City Council, Defra and the Food Standards Agency serve tap water.
779;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T06:02:25+0000;Watchdogs to consider food colouring research;;"European food authorities on Thursday promised to consider the British re­search showing a link between hyperactivity in children and food colourings, in a move that could have widespread implications for the industry.The European Food Safety Authority has been reassessing published research on food colourings this year as part of an overall review of food additives and has begun issuing fresh advice on specific colours. It will review the UK findings this month and rule on the use of one of the additives, Allura Red, on which the report was based.In July it said the colouring Red 2G, used in pro­cessed meats, was a “safety concern” after research showed it had been linked to cancer in animals.EFSA said it did not conduct its own tests on food colourings but its scientists reviewed published literature. It plans to review 45 colourings used throughout Europe by the end of 2008.The European Commission would like EFSA to rule as a matter of urgency, since any results could be incorporated into a new policy of food labelling due to be outlined by the end of this year.Markos Kyprianou, the health commissioner, has indicated he will give food companies at least a year to come up with their solutions for improving the health of products and detailing levels of fat and salt, before proposing binding legislation.The UK’s Food Standards Agency, which follows EFSA’s guidance, onThursday said while it believed new research it commissioned from Southampton University was “an important piece of evidence”, it was waiting to hear the European agency’s opinion before taking further action.The FSA has recommended parents stop feeding foods with artificial colours to children who show hyperactive behaviour.The UK agency said it would not ban colourings or other food additives unless it believed there was an “immediate” safety risk.Food and soft drink companies that use artificial colourings on Thursday said they did not plan specific action as a result of the research.Britvic, the UK soft drinks group that owns the Tango brand and the licence to market Pepsi, said none of its products targeting child­ren used the artificial colours discussed in the report.However, Pepsi, like many other soft drinks, contains sodium benzoate – a preservative tested in the research – as well as artificial sweeteners and colourings.Some companies have started removing artificial colours in response to consumer demand.Cadbury Schweppes, the chocolate and confectionery group, started selling sweets made by The Natural Confectionery Company in independent retailers this summer.Cadbury acquired the company, which is Australian, in 2003. The company makes sweets with natural colours.Cadbury said it had brought the group’s products to the UK to take advantage of the market for “healthy” confectionery, which was worth £390m in retail sales last year. Cadbury on Thursday said sales were “exceeding expect­ations”.Cadbury’s other confectionery products use a mixture of natural and artificial flavours. But it said it was “taking steps” to make products with natural colours and flavourings.…………………………………………..Natural nakers see growthAdding colourings to food dates back to medieval times, when cooks would use saffron and powdered sandalwood as well as spinach and parsley juice to give a “marbleised” effect, according to researchers at Leatherhead Food, writes Jenny Wiggins. More recently, artificial colours have been favoured for their ease and convenience.Richard Ratcliffe, the executive secretary at the Food Additives and Ingredients Association, says: “Natural colours are more expensive and more difficult to use in a food factory.” They are typically less soluble than artificial ones.Natural colours can include turmeric and safflower, used to create yellow; blueberries, beetroot and blackcurrants, to produce red; and paprika and carrots, to make orange.Natural colours currently make up 28 per cent of the £149m European food colours market, according to Overseal, the natural colour producer.The British company says its annual growth rate is five times the overall market and that it is making “progress” on competing with synthetic colours on stability and depth of colour.Sensient of the US, the world’s biggest maker of food colourings, makes both natural and artificial colourings but believes there are “new opportunities” arising in natural colours because of growing demand."
780;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-08-30T18:12:51Z;‘Competitiveness’ rears its ugly head;;There are many specialist terms that have descended into common speech and are used pretty indiscriminately. “Competitiveness” originally had a clear meaning but has now been taken up by politicians and business leaders as an all-purpose slogan. It is a relative concept. We cannot all be competitive against each other. I still remember Emil van Lennep, a former secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, asking: “Against whom should the world be competitive? Against the moon?” If one needed a quick critical reaction to John Redwood’s economic report to the Conservative shadow cabinet, it could have been provided by its title, “Freeing Britain to Compete” and its frequently asserted stress on competitiveness.Unfortunately this debatable concept is now too generally accepted in the political world for such repudiation to be feasible. Originally some economists and officials mentally substituted the word “performance”, but now themselves talk of competitiveness, presumably thinking: if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. This includes some on Mr Redwood’s team who surely should have known better.What is misleading is the transfer to whole economies of concepts relevant to individual businesses or regions. Pepsi has to be competitive with Coca-Cola. Liverpool can try to be more competitive than Manchester in a bid to be the commercial centre of the English north-west. German business has become more competitive than Italian business in terms of reducing its costs so that it can secure more orders.Here we come to the rub of the matter. The competitiveness analysis applies where there is a single currency. If we still had the mark and the lira we could leave the foreign exchange market to sort it out. The exchange rate is a safety valve which allows a country employing it to make up its own mind on its inflation goals and level of business support without worrying about the balance of payments.The vogue for competitiveness arose in a fixed exchange world. Then if UK products were too expensive, or in other ways unattractive, jobs would be cut and foreign exchange reserves might be lost by the British government, which would then have to embark on one of its notorious stop-go episodes. Edward Heath’s decision in 1972 to float sterling, however reluctantly he made it, should have changed all that. Yet even the British Treasury found it difficult to adapt.Plus ça change …John Redwood, in the foreword to his report, instinctively takes the point and, as one would expect, emphatically repudiates any attempt by the UK to adopt the euro or to follow any kind of exchange rate target. He can see how the balance of payments can take care of itself among the different western currency blocks. But he comes back to competitiveness when dealing with the supposed threat from China and other developing countries.There is a slightly more sophisticated consideration which is sometimes advanced. Nowadays, direct trade and payments across the exchanges are dwarfed by vastly greater capital flows. So we cannot rely on the exchange rate moving to offset the cost of extra imports. As a matter of fact the disproportion is frequently exaggerated. For a large part of the movements across the exchanges are extremely short-term ones reversed within days or even hours and therefore not on all fours with trade or long-term capital movements. But I do not need to rely on this aspect. Suppose that sterling does not dip in the way required to balance trade flows, possibly because of positive confidence effects or because China and members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are accumulating reserves. So much the better. For then we come near to enjoying the proverbial free lunch: increased absorption of foreign goods and services without having to sacrifice more British products to pay for them. Of course this bonus may not last, but at least time will have been gained for British producers to adjust.The world is not yet one single economy, but it is moving in that direction. The integration of nations such as China and India into it is the equivalent of multiplying several-fold the amount of unskilled labour relative to the supply of skilled labour and capital. The conventional response is to say that US and European industry needs to move continually upmarket, developing new products and processes, to maintain its position. There are limits to how far this can go. Not everyone can be retrained to undertake high- technology jobs.Moreover, is it really desirable that everyone all the time should be engaged in non-stop reskilling (misleadingly called “lifelong education”). “What is this life if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare”? The western response should surely be to keep its own frontiers open to gain the benefits of trade but redistribute income to those who would otherwise lose out. My longtime slogan, coined before the word “globalisation” was invented, has been: “Redistribution yes, equality no.”www.samuelbrittan.co.uk
781;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-08-24T15:25:14Z;Hope takes root in Bulgarian vineyards;;"The Bulgarians are justly proud that Dionysus, the god of wine, is ascribed Thracian origins. Icarus, though, is perhaps a more appropriate mythological emblem for the country’s recent wine-producing history.Bulgarian wine was one of Comecon’s rare success stories. Not only did bottles of Mavrud, Melnik and Misket help cheer up the kitchen tables of Russian and Polish comrades during European Communism’s final, low-wattage decades, but exports of wine based on international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon also earned Bulgaria valuable hard currency in the west. The country was the world’s sixth largest wine exporter by the mid-1960s and its position subsequently improved further, not least due to a reciprocal deal with PepsiCo in the US. By 1996, Bulgaria was exporting almost 30m litres of wine to the UK. Last year, this had slumped to less than 3m litres.What has caused the wax in Bulgaria’s wings to melt so swiftly? Devastating competition from California and the southern hemisphere has been one factor. The other has been the fatally punctilious restitution of agricultural land in Bulgaria, with each 1947 plot being handed back to “the persons who were therefrom expropriated or to such persons’ heirs by law”. Some 70 per cent of the Bulgarian population lived in the countryside in 1947; 75 per cent of the population is now urban. “In my family,” says wine producer Ivan Zahariev of Stork Nest Estates, “20 people have an interest in six hectares, and not one of us lives anywhere near the village. Yet to sell, everyone has to sign, and if only one person disagrees, the whole procedure is blocked. Appeals and subdivisions take up to five years.” The result, in practice, is that many of Bulgaria’s once-bonny vineyards are now choked with weeds. Sizeable exports continue to leave the country for Russia (70m litres) and Poland (25m litres), but quality is dire, and this will not be wine anyone wants to drink once they can afford something better.The reality of the post-1989 struggle struck me forcefully when, on a recent visit to the country, I stayed in a drab hotel near the Greek border that had been privatised – floor by floor. The result was three different hotels in one small building, with three reception areas, each staffed all night by middle-aged women who looked as if they had hoped for more from life. The market economy, when you start from zero, is tough. The following day, I found myself in the vineyards of Bessa Valley Winery in Pazardzhik, looking around 140 perfectly tended hectares of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Syrah and Cabernet within a 300ha land plot. How difficult had this land been to acquire? “Very, very difficult,” laughed executive director Alexander Kanev. “We started in 2001 and it took us four years. We had to buy from 800 owners. And in Bulgaria you can’t do anything by phone – you have to touch and to see people.” The Bessa Valley advantage is that it is owned by two wealthy foreigners: Dr Karl Heinz Hauptmann, co-founder of Europa Capital Management, and Stephan von Neipperg, whose St Emilion portfolio includes Château Canon-la-Gaffelière and La Mondotte. Success is a little easier when you start from the top.Bessa Valley produces two wines: Enira and Enira Reserva. Initially (in 2004) a lusciously pneumatic blend of Merlot with a little Cabernet, it is slowly working its way towards backbone and complexity. The 2005 vintage (the non-Reserva version is in 47 Waitrose branches at £8.99) is valiant, given the rain-struck summer; but the wine will begin to come of age with the 2006. The Enira (now half Merlot and one-quarter Petit Verdot and Syrah) is brisker and more concentrated than in the two former vintages, the sweet sloe fruit dusted with Petit Verdot pepper; while the Reserva (whose 60 per cent Merlot is structured by 15 per cent each of Syrah and Petit Verdot and 10 per cent Cabernet) has liqueur-like black fruit depths, supple tannins and a dark chocolate finish. Bulgaria has always promised to do for Europe what Chile does for the southern hemisphere. A wine like this suggests that only millions of euros of investment, and a decade of land negotiation, stands in its way.It will need a conceptual revolution, too, among that small, profit-focused elite of supermarket wine buyers who at present source seven out of 10 bottles of wine drunk in Britain, and almost all its Bulgarian wine.Finding anything Bulgarian costing as much as £4.99 in British supermarkets is hard; £3.99 is the usual limit and Tesco has Bulgarian wine on sale at £2.75. The result is a poverty trap for suppliers. The wine in a £2.99 bottle on sale in the UK cannot cost more than 25p; the other £2.74 is tied up in the fixed costs of taxes, transport, dry goods and the retailer’s margin. Remuneration of this order does little other than keep bankruptcy at bay. When Enira first went on sale, the strategy was to sell 80 per cent on export markets and 20 per cent domestically. In fact, the Bulgarians themselves have been prepared to pay more than export purchasers (€6.50 compared with €4 ex-cellars), with the result that that ratio has been reversed.Hope, though, has not yet been extinguished in the Bulgarian countryside and I visited two other major projects where viable land purchases have been made, plantings renovated and major cellar investments made. One, called Catherina, is owned by Belvédère (a French luxury bottle-maker turned Polish vodka distiller, with capitalisation from Angostura’s CL Financial). The 2006 range of red wines from Catherina near Svilengrad is promising, with the ripeness, vivacity and tannic mass that has been palpably missing from Bulgarian reds in the UK for so long. I particularly liked the Merlot (sterner than Enira) and the relaxed, rumpled Mavrud. The packaging of these wines for the local market, where it sells as “Contemplations”, is among the most avant garde I have seen anywhere, and they look prime contenders to shatter the £4.99 glass ceiling when they reach the UK.Terra Tangra, meanwhile, is the brainchild of Emil Zaichev, a winningly enthusastic, wine-crazed Bulgarian cucumber grower who planted 20ha five years ago in south Sakar and has now assembled 300ha. My own first job 25 years ago consisted in large part of retailing case after case of Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon to the wine-crazed commuters of Surrey and I can still recall the pure, frank, winning clarity of its blackcurrant flavours back then. It’s been missing for more than a decade as the vineyards lurched back to a state of nature but when I tasted the 2006 Cabernet of Terra Tangra the quarter-century dropped away and I realised that Bulgaria is, very slowly, inching back.A wide selection of Bulgarian wine is available in the UK from Wines of Course, 153 High St, Ongar CM5 9JD (www.easy-wine.co.uk) and in the US from Bulgarian Master Vintners, 1447 East Napa St, Sonoma, California 95476 (www.bulgarianwine.com)Andrew Jefford is the author of ‘The New France: A Complete Guide to Contemporary French Wine’.Jancis Robinson is away"
782;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Shoppers count the carbon;;Pick up a packet of Walkers potato crisps in the UK and you might notice something unusual on the back. Alongside the normal information on how much fat, salt and calories they contain, there is another label. It informs the consumer that the bag contains only 34.5g of crisps, but 75g of carbon dioxide.That carbon dioxide is not to be found within the packet. It is “virtual” CO2 – a calculation of the amount of the gas expelled into the atmosphere as a result of the processes that went into the packet’s production, from growing the potato to packaging and distributing the finished crisps.This is a carbon label, one of the first of its kind in the world. The idea behind it is that today’s consumers, who are growing ever more environmentally conscious, should be able to see how their buying decisions increase or decrease their environmental impact. It can help people to calculate and reduce their own “carbon footprint”, a measure of how many greenhouse gas emissions they are responsible for. Companies can also use such labels to differentiate their products from those of rivals, and in the future even governments could use them to regulate emissions or crack down on companies that are not obeying environmental strictures.“Carbon labels are a way of displaying very clearly what has gone into a product, of measuring what has been the impact on the climate of making that product,” explains Euan Murray of the Carbon Trust, a government-funded body charged with helping businesses to cut their greenhouse gas output.Only a handful of companies are putting carbon labels on their goods at present, most of them in the UK and working in partnership with the Carbon Trust. As well as Walkers, which is owned by PepsiCo, the chemist chain Boots is putting information on the “carbon footprint” of some of its cosmetics ranges at the point of sale. Innocent, a maker of smoothies and fruit juices, puts carbon label information on its products on its website, and may do so on the products in future.But the idea of the labels was given a considerable boost when Terry Leahy, chief executive of Tesco, the supermarket chain with interests in 12 countries, pledged that his company would eventually have carbon labels put on every one of the 70,000 products on its shelves.Tesco’s announcement was quickly followed by the caveat that it might be several years before the retailer was ready to roll out the labels. Some sceptical observers, particularly at rival chains, took the view that the decision was less an environmental advance than an eye-catching attempt to steal a march on other supermarkets, which have been vying to be seen as the greenest. But the commitment, if followed through, would require a large number of companies to measure the carbon in their products and bring carbon labels to the attention of millions of consumers.The Carbon Trust says more than 150 companies have approached it with a view to using the labels. As well as drawing the support of Tesco, the scheme has won backing from J Sainsbury, Marks & Spencer, Cadbury Schweppes, Duchy Originals and the Co-operative Group.Once a manufacturer, whether it be a food processor or a cosmetics company, has put a carbon label on one product, labelling the rest of its lines becomes easier. Walkers found it could roll out carbon labels to all of its crisp packets within months of doing so for cheese and onion, its most popular flavour.Similarly, once one company has introduced carbon labelling, it becomes easier for others to do so. The Carbon Trust is working with BSI British Standards to create a standard that can be used by other companies to create carbon labels.Doing the necessary research involves time and money. Steve John, director of corporate affairs at PepsiCo, says the process of making the labels for Walkers took about 12 to 18 months.But the measurement and monitoring can yield useful information. All of the companies that the Carbon Trust has worked with on the labels have found they could make savings as a result of what they discovered during the process, cutting their costs at the same time as cutting their carbon output.Jessica Sansom, head of sustainability at Innocent Drinks, found it took several months to carry out the monitoring necessary, at a cost of less than £10,000. But she says it was “an incredibly useful process, it threw up lots of very useful information and we’ve been able to identify lots of win-wins in improving our efficiency”.Energy efficiencies are the most obvious saving: Mr Murray of the Carbon Trust estimates that most companies can cut their energy bills by at least 20 per cent. But companies can also save on water bills, raw material usage and even transport. Mr John says PepsiCo found it could cut its transport fuel costs by a fifth by training staff to drive more efficiently. He says the company is conducting research on how consumers react to the labels, to be published this autumn.For shoppers, it may be ­puzzling to see that there are 75g of carbon in a packet of crisps or 294g in a mango and passion fruit smoothie. Until more products have such labels and buyers can compare like with like, their usefulness is limited.Separate research by LEK Consulting, to be published this week, has found that just over half of people in the UK say they “would value details concerning a product’s carbon footprint when making a buying decision”. Rather under half would use this information to switch to a product or service with a lower carbon footprint, however, and only one in five would go to a less convenient retailer in order to obtain such products.But the research, carried out by YouGov among a sample of 2,039 adults, also found that most people were not convinced by the environmental claims of retailers and manufacturers, despite the enormous marketing effort that many companies have put into painting themselves green.

They included Riley Bechtel of Bechtel Corporation, which has come under intense media scrutiny over its lucrative reconstruction contracts in Iraq, and Lee Scott of Walmart Stores, which has aroused anger among Labour grassroots for its non-unionised workforce.Other signatories to the US-dominated list included Bill Gates of Microsoft, Eric Schmidt of Google, Jeff Immelt of GE, Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo and Arun Sarin of Vodafone.“I want to summon into existence the greatest coalition of conscience in pursuit of the greatest of causes,” the prime minister, whose father was a Scottish church minister, told the UN. “When conscience is joined to conscience, moral force to moral force – think how much our power to do good can achieve.”But some campaigners questioned what the new partnership would actually achieve. “One should welcome any turning of companies towards the path of pursuing some higher moral purpose but not a great deal seems to have resulted from all the other initiatives of this nature – and there are a lot,” Jeremy Carver, a board member of the anti-corruption campaigning group Transparency International UK, told the FT.The prime minister’s aim is to galvanise political, corporate and popular support to revive attempts to meet the flagging millennium development goals – ambitious UN targets to halve world poverty by 2015 – agreed seven years ago. Mr Brown said it was clear the goals, which include a commitment to halving world poverty, would not be met unless “emergency action” was taken. “It is already clear that our pace is too slow, our direction too uncertain, our vision at risk,” he said.The declaration – agreed by 14 world leaders, including President George W Bush and Mr Brown, as well as the business leaders – calls for a UN meeting to be convened next years and binds the signatories to “commit to action,” without specifying that action.Aides travelling with the prime minister to New York denied the new alliance was just a dramatic call to hold a meeting. “This is a big deal. It’s the beginning of a huge campaign,” an official insisted. “I don’t think this is a talking shop … it’s a call to arms.”Shortly after his Camp David summit with Mr Bush on Monday, Mr Brown met Bill Clinton, the former US president who now spends a lot of time tackling poverty and disease in the developing world. The talks with Mr Clinton at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, where Mr Brown stayed on Monday night, were focused on talking poverty, aides said. But the meeting with a prominent Democrat, so shortly after the high-profile encounter with the president, is unlikely to please the White House.
784;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
785;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;PepsiCo’s Nooyi dismisses merger ‘rumours’;;Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo, has dismissed what she called ‘rumours’ that the US food and drinks company discussed a merger with Nestlé, the European food group.“Our strategy is un­changed,” she told Wall Street analysts on Tuesday.PepsiCo’s plan to grow organically, with ‘tuck-in’ acquisitions only, ‘remained consistent.’Her remarks came as the group raised its earnings guidance for the year, having reported a 13 per cent increase in second quarter net income to $1.56bn, or 94 cents per diluted share.Ms Nooyi described the performance in the quarter as ‘excellent’. It reflected “the underlying strength” and balance of the business.The company makes Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker Oats as well as the Pepsi brand drinks.“All of our lines of business performed at or above our expectations, enabling us to generate strong division profit growth while lapping last year’s best quarter,” she said.The 5 cent increase in earnings guidance for the year to $3.35 per share came in spite of an increase in long-term research and development expenditure, investment spending and a higher tax rate, she said.PepsiCo’s diversified portfolio has helped it weather a continuing fall in US demand for its fizzy drinks.During the quarter volume sales of US carbonated soft drinks fell 4 per cent, while sales of non-carbonated drinks, including Lipton bottled teas and Aquafina water, increased 3 per cent.Volume sales of its Tropicana orange juice and Gatorade fell.Internationally, its beverage volume grew 8 per cent, the company reported. That increase was led by double-digit growth in Pakistan, Russia, the Middle East, the UK and China.But there were declines in Mexico and Thailand.Sales of non-carbonated drinks grew faster than sales of carbonated drinks.
786;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-07-24T20:53:56Z;Foreign earnings save US blue chips;;"Foreign earnings came to the rescue of a slew of US multinationals on Tuesday, offsetting weakness in the domestic economy and highlighting their growing reliance on the rest of the world.Several blue chips that reported second-quarter earnings said their international business had outshone their US operations. They included UPS, the logistics group; DuPont, the chemical maker; PepsiCo, the soft-drinks maker; and United Airlines.The one sector that bucked the trend was defence, with Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, among the biggest suppliers of aircraft, missiles and information systems to the Pentagon, beating Wall Street estimates.But the results season has been characterised by the increased importance of US companies’ international operations, which have been helped by the weakness in the dollar and rapid growth in emerging markets.General Electric, the industrial conglomerate, derives about half its sales from overseas and Caterpillar and IBM have both shown strong growth in international sales.UPS, often cited as a bellwether for the US economy, reported better-than-expected profits, lifted by strong performance in its international business. The 4.6 per cent rise in the daily number of packages it delivered internationally helped compensate for a decline of 0.2 per cent in the US.Rival FedEx has also been buoyed by growth abroad.DuPont cited weakness in the US housing and car markets as factors in second-quarter earnings missing analysts’ expectations. Its shares fell 6.4 per cent in late afternoon trading.The second-biggest US chemical company, which sells insulation and paints to the housing and motor industries, suffered a 2 per cent decrease in sales domestically while its overseas volumes grew by 4 per cent.PepsiCo profits beat analysts’ expectations thanks to growing demand for soft drinks in China and Europe and potato chips in Russia and Mexico.An increase in international revenues helped United Airlines shrug off concerns about over-capacity and lower domestic demand to report bullish second-quarter earnings. While passenger revenues in the Americas declined slightly, transatlantic and transpacific flights generated 25.5 per cent and 12.2 per cent more revenue respectively."
787;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;US earnings;;There’s precious little room for patriotism in a globalised world. A rash of quarterly results from big US companies has demonstrated the benefits of moving overseas – and of a sliding dollar. DuPont and PepsiCo on Tuesday told similar stories: weak or negative sales growth at home while sales powered ahead in Europe and Asia. Caterpillar’s sales of machines slumped at home but surged abroad. Even Harley-Davidson’s hogs are accelerating faster in foreign climes.One reading is that Asia and even laggardly Europe are taking up the baton of growth as the US economy falters. A weaker greenback also makes US exports more attractive and boosts the dollar value of foreign profits. America’s largest companies have increased their overseas exposure in recent years. Standard & Poor’s calculates that, based on those companies that report revenues geographically, the S&P 500 derived 44 per cent of sales from abroad in 2006, up from 32 per cent in 2001.There is some evidence that this translates into better stock performance. The S&P 500’s energy, materials, industrials, and technology sub-sectors – all with relatively high foreign sales exposure – have been the best performers so far this year. Financials, meanwhile, with high domestic exposure, are down. But there are other factors at work, too. US-weighted utilities and telecoms stocks are beating the more cosmopolitan healthcare sector. Many companies hedge their exposure to currency effects, limiting the benefits. And while sales growth in places like China is dazzling, the profit pool is much smaller.A better reason for targeting large, diversified stocks might be their relative cheapness and defensiveness. The greenback’s slide, while artificially boosting profits, ultimately reduces foreigners’ appetite for dollar-denominated assets and risk overall. Subprime woes continue to fuel fears of a wider correction, with mortgage lender Countrywide’s gloomy outlook weighing on the market yesterday. Ultimately, foreign exposure offers only a degree of protection when investors see trouble trouble brewing at home.

Germany’s Xetra Dax added 1.2 per cent to 7,991.21, while the CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.2 per cent to 6,065.5.Software maker SAP leapt to the fore of the European risers after it surprised markets with strong second-quarter licence sales. Shares in the world’s biggest maker of business software added 6.1 per cent to €40.24, making SAP the top gainer on Germany’s blue-chip index,Analysts said their faith in SAP had been restored after two profit warnings last year cast doubt on its business model. “We believe these 2Q ‘07 results should dispel residual fears over the strength of its core business and provide support for the company’s full-year target,” said Dresdner Kleinwort. Deutsche Bank and Citigroup reiterated their “buy” recommendations on the stock.Meanwhile, sparkling first-half earnings lifted Roche 2.9 per cent to SFr220.50, the company’s’ biggest gain in two years.

Nestlé dismissed the reports, while PepsiCo declined to comment.The reports also fuelled speculation of a fresh round of deals among European snack and beverage makers. Danone, the world’s largest yoghurt maker, rose 2.4 per cent to €57.13, while Unilever rallied 2.4 per cent to €23.97.A jump in Swiss watch exports in June boosted Swatch and Richemont, up 5.6 per cent at SFr379.25 and 2.7 per cent at SFr79.20, respectively.Capgemini, Europe’s largest computer services company, rose 4 per cent to €57.11 amid resurgent speculation that India’s Infosys might be interested in the consultancy.Denmark’s DS Norden closed 6.2 per cent higher at DKr447 on the back of stronger rates for bulk carriers.The Danish banking sector also performed strongly. Danske Bank added 1.1 per cent to DKr238.75, Sydbank rose 4.5 per cent at DKr279 and Jyske Bank edged up 0.5 per cent to DKr418.50.Spanish drug company Zeltia recovered from early losses, ending 0.1 per cent higher at €8.20.

He has been Sainsbury’s trading director and on the operating board since 2004 and previously held positions at Tesco, Asda and Iceland.Ms Harris is currently a non-executive director of TNT, the Dutch mail and transport company, and has held executive roles at McKinsey and Pepsi.Mr Hampton said: “Mary’s extensive strategic experience in consumer goods and Mike’s range and depth of knowledge of the UK retail market bring real value to our board. “The chairman repeated comments made earlier this year that the supermarket was ahead of its target to grow sales by £2.5bn by March 2008.Sainsbury’s shares firmed on Tuesday on speculation that entrepreneur Robert Tchenguiz would sell his 5 per cent equity stake to Delta 2, the Qatar-backed investment vehicle. If true, Delta’s holding would rise to 29.99 per cent, just below the 30 per cent threshold at which it would be required to launch a full bid.The shares were flat at 577p in early morning trade on Wednesday.
790;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-07-03T19:47:03Z;Danone loses its taste for economic patriotism;;Two summers ago it suited Franck Riboud to call on political allies in Paris to fend off a purported unfriendly approach for his Danone food group from PepsiCo. The result, as we all know, prompted the French government to launch its policy of “economic patriotism”.A string of popular protests to protect French strategic interests falling prey to foreigners encouraged the government to introduce new “poison pill” legislation to make it harder to acquire domestic champions. Paris also encouraged Suez to merge with Gaz de France to prevent Italy’s Enel moving in.Even its more liberal newly elected president – Nicolas Sarkozy – has wasted little time in defending the government’s right to intervene in the interest of French companies. After all, only a week ago he forced his European partners to drop the reference to “undistorted competition” from the proposed new European mini-treaty.But behind all the bluster what has actually happened? Mittal Steel acquired Arcelor despite a vitriolic campaign by the government to block the designs of the Indian steel magnate. Enel will soon have won unprecedented entry into the French energy market as a result of its frustration over Suez. Now Mr Riboud of all people is actually proposing to sell his biscuits to a US multinational – Kraft.Mr Riboud justifies the move as part of his strategy to focus on the faster-growing yoghurt and water activities of Danone. This is a perfectly sensible strategy and exposes the inherent hypocrisy of French economic patriotism. Two summers ago, it clearly suited Mr Riboud to encourage his countrymen to rally to his company’s support against an undesirable US multinational because he did not want to be taken over. Now he is quite happy to shed a business that employs in France even more people than his dairy activities because it no longer fits with his global strategy.The protectionist wave he unleashed two years ago could now come back to swamp him. So far, there have been limited union protests over his decision to sell his biscuit division to Kraft. But these could clearly grow to the point that the government may feel obliged to intervene – in the name, of course, of economic patriotism.German protectionismGermany had its own summer of discontent two summers ago. While France was racing to the rescue of Danone, throwing all its weight to block a rumoured bid by PepsiCo, German politicians called for action to stop the so-called “locusts” of foreign capitalism stripping the country of its assets.Former chancellor Gerhard Schröder went on record at the time that nobody should count on him to “Americanise German society”. Mr Schröder has now gone but his conservative successor, Angela Merkel, appears to be adopting an even more protectionist approach despite all her reforming zeal. Indeed, some are beginning to wonder if she is not turning French.Many in Berlin’s new grand coalition continue to regard private equity firms and hedge funds as dangerous insects. They concede that Blackstone, for example, has indeed helped Deutsche Telekom restructure. But there is no question of the state selling more of its shares in the telecom incumbent, and certainly not to private equity firms, for the time being at least. The same goes for Deutsche Post.But Ms Merkel has identified a new dangerous species – the so-called sovereign-wealth funds from China and oil-rich regions. Her government now plans new legislation to make it harder, if not impossible, for such funds to take over German companies.This stepped-up protectionist stance appears to be causing much soul searching in political and economic circles. After all, Germany prides itself on its free market credentials, although it quickly forgets to say how difficult it remains for any foreign company to launch a successful hostile takeover of a German one. Vodafone managed to pull one off with Mannesmann, though the final deal was backed by the board, but it was probably the first and the last. Even hostile attempts within Germany have backfired. Sure, there have since been hostile German bids but they have invariably backfired – Merck’s hostile attempt to buy Schering was trumped by the friendly Bayer-Schering deal.Germany, like other countries, has every right to protect its strategic interests. Equally, it has lived far too long under the illusion that: “We are the best, we have profitable companies, we are great exporters and we do not need to worry about capital markets.” Yet even the biggest companies need these markets to borrow, hedge and raise equity. Not to mention a more open market for corporate control to punish bad management and questionable practices, which appear to be flourishing these days in Germany.
791;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-07-03T19:30:10Z;Activists find Japan goes against the global grain;;So Nippon Telegraph and Telephone wants to be the next General Electric, diversifying its profit sources from telecommunications into a range of areas as diverse as property and wacky inventions.Not quite – NTT accepts the bulk of its revenue will still come from telecoms. But its diversification goes against the global grain all the same. Shareholder activists these days disapprove of anything that could not be considered the ultimate hard core of a company’s business.That’s not the only thing at NTT that would set them tut-tutting. In other countries a company that had seen a profit fall for three straight years, had Y800bn ($6.5bn) in cash, and was carrying out painfully slow restructuring that still left it with almost 200,000 employees, would attract activists like bees to honey.But this is Japan, where shareholder activism works differently. Some wonder, following last week’s run of defeats at annual shareholder meetings, whether it works at all.NTT has an extra safeguard against activist investors trying to keep it on the straight and narrow. The government still has a one-third share according to the latest numbers, despite Japan’s drive to reduce the role of the public sector in the nation’s economy by selling off assets. This guiding hand might explain why NTT still has 200,000 workers, despite cost-cutting promises.Japan seems as far from ruthless, returns-driven Anglo-Saxon shareholder capitalism as ever.Economic hypocrisyTwo summers ago it suited Franck Riboud to call on political allies in Paris to fend off a purported unfriendly approach for his Danone food group from PepsiCo.

Shares in both Debenhams and Sports Direct continue to trade well below the offer price, while the New Look sale was aborted after bids fell short of the reserve of £1.8bn ($3.6bn).Should Merrill bear part of the blame, and, more to the point, are these disappointments likely to affect other sellers’ willingness to hire Merrill?Blame first. Pricing sales – whether of shares, or of the whole business – is often more art than science. But banks take a big chunk of fees – and responsibility. IPOs can “fail” in several ways. After that, outside events – the weather, the retail environment, or, in Sports Direct’s case, poor communication by the company itself – can undermine shareholder value.Auctions are different. Reserve prices reflect the adviser’s best estimate of enthusiasm for the asset on the block, but clients have their say, too. Merrill had to go along with the decision by Apax and Permira, New Look’s private equity owners, not to drop the price.As for bad publicity, Merrill still rides high. One banker said on Tuesday that to search for links between these three transactions was like mixing “apples, oranges and grapes”. That is true. But if you’re running the fruit-stall, you can’t afford to irritate your customers too often.
792;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-06-17T21:10:24Z;Call for end to quarterly guidance;;An unprecedented coalition of large companies, pension funds, and trade unions will on Monday urge corporate America to scrap quarterly earnings guidance in an attempt to curtail the influence of hedge funds and other short-term investors.The move, backed by leading corporate figures such as Jeff Kindler, chief executive of Pfizer, and Anne Mulcahy, his counterpart at Xerox, will increase pressure on companies and fund managers to focus on long-term objectives rather than short-term fixes.The broad-based coalition, whose participants range from the Business Roundtable, which represents 160 leading US chief executives, to the AFL-CIO, the largest union federation, will also call for an overhaul in compensation practices to reward corporate and fund managers for long-term performance.Monday’s publication of the new set of corporate principles – masterminded by the Aspen Institute, an influential not-for-profit group – underlines corporate America’s fear that the focus on quarterly results is hampering US companies’ long-term prospects and the country’s economic competitiveness.“The signing of the Aspen principles by such a diverse group is a milestone in business history,” said Ms Mulcahy. “What is especially significant is the focus on long-term value and opening lines of communication with shareholders.”The principles, which were also backed by PepsiCo, the Council of Institutional Investors and the Center for Audit Quality, which represents 800 accounting firms, call on companies to “avoid both the provision of, and response to, estimates of quarterly earnings and other overly short-term financial targets”.Instead, companies should talk to shareholders about their business strategy and their outlook over a number of years, according to the document, which has been seen by the Financial Times.More than half of US companies offer quarterly earnings guidance and the percentage is higher among larger groups.In private, many US chief executives say they have to provide their own quarterly earnings forecasts because analysts and investors demand them. Some express the fear that ending the practice would hit their companies’ share prices or that analysts would put out inaccurate forecasts.Hedge funds and other short-term investors tend to like guidance because the discrepancies between actual and forecast earnings offers them lucrative trading opportunities.However, corporate leaders and academics argue that the pressure to meet quarterly forecasts prompts companies to forgo long-term investments such as capital expenditure and research and development.The principles say companies should look at a five-year horizon and urge both executives and fund managers to tie their compensation to long-term performance targets.
793;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-06-03T14:12:13Z;Corporate recruiters go back to school;;"Industrial companies have traditionally favoured hiring “second-hand” MBAs – those who have cut their teeth in banking or management consultancy and want to move on. Now, this is changing.In spite of recent concerns in the business school world that MBA degrees do not teach students skills that companies need, recruiters are increasingly giving the professional services firms a run for their money when it comes to recruiting newly minted MBAs directly from business school. These days companies such as BP, BT, Google, Pepsico, Samsung and Shell are names as familiar on the business school campus as investment banks and management consultancies.The sea change came with the classes that graduated in 2002 and 2003. Following the terrorist attacks in the US and subsequent economic uncertainty, management consultancies and bankers slashed staff numbers and stayed away from business schools. Industrial companies saw their chance.The numbers tell the story. At London Business School, for example, only 15 per cent of recruiters were in industry in 2001, but by 2003 that figure had tripled to 45 per cent. Last year saw it fall to 33 per cent.In addition to those corporate recruiters who began recruiting in 2002, the past three years has also seen a new breed of recruiter looking for future leaders. As a result, on-campus recruiter figures are on the up.At the Kellogg School at Northwestern University, for example, nearly 250 organisations recruited on campus at Evanston this year, says Roxanne Hori, assistant dean and director of the Kellogg career management centre. “It’s crazy,” she adds.At the Haas school at Berkeley it is a similar story. Abby Scott, career services director, reports that there were
23 per cent more recruiters on campus this year than last.At the Tuck school at Dartmouth College, at least half of the on-campus recruiters were corporate, says Becky Joffrey. “It’s striking how many more companies came to Tuck rather than professional service firms,” she says.However, corporate recruiters face problems competing with the professional service firms. First, says Diane Morgan, head of career development at LBS, many corporate jobs need filling as soon as they fall vacant, not as part of an annual intake. And as professional service firms start hiring in September for appointments the following summer, corporate recruiters often miss the boat.Nor do corporate recruiters have the recruitment budgets that the McKinseys and Goldman Sachs of the world can boast.However, corporate recruiters are becoming much more savvy. Peter Abery, programme director of the Future Leadership Programme at BT (see left) says the company has learnt a lot since the programme started two years ago. “The time to be on campus in the US is in September,” he says. This year BT will be there.BT is not the only company recently to commence an MBA recruitment programme. In the past two years, Ericsson and Nike have introduced MBA recruitment programmes in Europe, says Katty Ooms, director of MBA admissions and career services at IMD, where 70 per cent of the graduates enter the corporate world.Certain industries are proving particularly popular this year, notably the energy sector, where MBAs aspire to work in alternative energy. “This category is very, very hot,” says Ms Scott.Those companies that are successful with this approach mimic the professional service firms, searching through “face books” and bringing in teams of recruiters to select the candidates they like. They often have assessment centres and invite their chosen candidates to two or three-day events at the company. “These recruiters are becoming much more professional,” says Ms Ooms.Interestingly, a growing number of corporate recruiters have set up fast-track leadership programmes for MBAs. Such programmes promise students the chance to move quickly to executive positions and it is a policy that is proving popular with participants, says Ms Hori at Kellogg. The idea of getting into a company and leading it “still resonates”, she says.Ms Joffrey says that, in the past, MBAs would go to management consultancy because they believed they could then enter a corporation at a higher level. Fast-track development programmes now ensure that corporate recruits can get to the top just as rapidly. In 2006 and 2007, Tuck graduates went into such programmes at companies including Bausch & Lomb, Nissan, PepsiCo and Monster Worldwide.The task for business school recruitment directors is to match the right graduate with the right corporate recruiter, the latter often having different requirements from the professional service recruiter. In particular, says Ms Joffrey, industrial corporations often look for candidates with previous commercial experience, such as in sales or operations. They also seek those who have excelled in their previous career, irrespective of sector or function, as well as candidates who are willing to travel and work across the globe.Corporate recruiters have also learnt that they have to pay competitive salaries, says Ms Joffrey. “Finally, companies have matched the ante of professional service firms.” A graduate entering a marketing role in the late 1990s would get a starting salary of $70,000. Today, someone going into a leadership development programme would earn $130,000.If nothing else, these salaries show that those who predicted the demise of the MBA may well have got it wrong.In at the deep end: a new recruit gets hands-on with BT’s transformationAt his first day at work after getting his MBA, Emmanuel Lebaut was called into the chief executive’s office and given a project that would help change the way the company operated. It was a degree of visibility, he says, which most MBAs crave but never see in the traditional bank or consulting firm.Mr Lebaut had been recruited by BT OneIT, the IT and technology arm of telecoms group BT, to be one of the first members of the company’s Future Leadership Programme. That was in 2005. Less than two years later, BT has recruited 54 MBAs to the team and has become one of the most visible corporate recruiters in the top cadre of US and European business schools.A Frenchman and an engineering graduate, Mr Lebaut says he had never intended to work for BT when he graduated from his two-year degree at London Business School. But during his programme he had focused on change management and had been won over by the vast programme for transformation that was planned at BT.“BT is changing itself radically, to adapt in advance to what it sees happening in the future,” Mr Lebaut says. “It is quite rare that you get such a scale of change in such a large company.”The change programme was first implemented in OneIT, but groups from the programme are now working for all divisions within BT. Although 14 of the 54-strong team have moved on to work in other areas of BT, none have left the company, says Peter Abery, programme director of the Future Leadership Programme.Typically, MBAs will see a project through to implementation, Mr Lebaut says. “We don’t do the nice pack of slides and then drop it over the wall for someone else. We run with it.”"
794;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T05:21:43+0000;Coke buys Glacéau for $4.1bn;;Coca-Cola has made its largest-ever acquisition of a rival drinks company, in a $4.1bn deal aimed at revitalising US growth that also highlights its failure to respond earlier to consumers’ growing thirst for “enhanced water” drinks.The acquisition of Glacéau, whose bottled drinks include Vitaminwater, Fruitwater and Energywater, will give Coca-Cola about 30 per cent of the US market in the rapidly expanding category.Neville Isdell, chief executive, said the deal represented “a significant step forward in sharpening our focus on re-establishing sustainable growth in our home market”.Glacéau, he said, offered “immediate high-quality growth” and a strong pipeline of products.However, the $4.1bn price underlines the degree to which it has been caught out by the dramatic growth in demand for enhanced water drinks over the past decade.Last August, India’s Tata paid $667m for a 30 per cent share in Glacéau, a deal that valued the company at $2.26bn. Tata said on Friday it would receive about $1.2bn for its stake from Coca-Cola.Shares in Tata Tea, part of the acquisitive Tata group, hit a 15-month high on Friday on the news of the sale.Tata Tea vice-chairman RK Krishna Kumar said the company could use the proceeds of the sale to pay off debt. “Or we could use this for making other acquisitions,” he said.Glacéau was founded in 1996 by Darius Bikoff, a New York-based entrepreneur, at a time when the class was already established in Japan.Its subsequent growth, with unconventional, grass roots marketing efforts, has been driven by the shift in US consumer tastes towards “healthy” alternatives and away from the traditional sugary carbonated sodas of Coke and Pepsi.Mohtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chief operating officer, said: “It is fair to say that Glacéau are the ones that put the enhanced water category on the map.”Coca-Cola’s bitter rival PepsiCo has already secured a substantial lead in the category, with its SoBe, Aquafina and Propel drinks accounting for about 45 per cent of the US market. Access to Coca-Cola’s distribution system is expected to significantly expand Glacéau’s market share.Mr Kent also pointed out that “active lifestyle beverages” had accounted for 30 per cent of total US soft-drink volumes in 2006, and were expected to generate about 50 per cent of the industry’s gross profits over the coming four years.Glacéau will operate as a separate unit under its existing management, in what Mr Isdell said was a reflection of greater flexibility at Coca-Cola, whose core business is highly centralised.He added that Coca-Cola would expand Glacéau’s brands internationally.Coca-Cola’s shares were up 1.5 per cent to $52 at lunch time in New York on Friday.Additional reporting by Joe Leahy in Mumbai
795;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-05-23T19:44:35Z;A commodities boom makes itself felt in the supermarket;;"The old adage that “as goes silver, so go soybeans” is more than just a whimsical piece of American farming folk wisdom. That commodity prices tend to rise and fall in unison is a deadly serious economic phenomenon for consumers around the world as food costs increase sharply, in some countries at the fastest pace for decades.Agricultural commodity prices are often volatile, in part due to weather fluctuations that affect crops. But what is unusual about recent price increases is that so many prices – everything from grains to ground nut oil – are rising simultaneously.Market observers say raw material prices are being driven up by shortages in supply (in part due to the growth of the biofuel industry and a drought in Australia) combined with increases in demand from countries such as China and India.They warn the world could be facing a period of “unprecedented food inflation” over the next 18 months as food companies try to pass on the higher costs of raw commodities to consumers. “It could become a perfect storm scenario,” says Michael Steib, food analyst at Morgan Stanley. He also warned of potential humanitarian consequences. “Affordability could become an issue in some parts of the world,” he said.The 6.7 per cent annual growth in food prices tracked in the US at the beginning of this year, if it continues, would be the biggest annual increase since 1980. The UK is witnessing comparable increases, as is China, where food is up an annual 6.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year. In all these countries, food prices are rising more quickly than overall prices. “There is a global trend,” says Mislav Matejka, European equity strategist at JPMorgan. “Food pricing is on the increase.”No one in the food industry has any doubt that the reason for food price inflation is higher agricultural commodity prices. What is under debate is why all commodities are up so suddenly and for how long the prices will continue to rise.Average US dollar spot prices for corn are up 86 per cent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier; palm oil is up 41 per cent; US raw milk is up 22.5 per cent; soyabean oil is up 32 per cent; cocoa is up 16 per cent; and coffee is up 23.5 per cent, according to data from Morgan Stanley.Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, believes the price increases are here to stay, in part because demand for agricultural raw materials is so strong that countries will have to expand the amount of land they farm to satisfy it. This is more costly than just increasing yields on current farming land, the bank says. “Growing land is going to be a lot more expensive than growing yields,” says Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs.Most analysts say the global economic recovery is also a significant long-term cause: as people become wealthier, they can afford to eat more meat, milk and eggs, which are more expensive than other staple foods.The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which promotes the integration of developing countries into the world economy, says increases in per capita income and expanding urban populations in developing countries will lead to greater consumption of livestock products, fruits and vegetables.An analysis of income growth in China released by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation in April also predicted that higher incomes would lead to greater consumption of vegetable oils, meats and dairy products.Although China should meet much of the higher demand for meat by increasing its own production, it is expected to have to import more vegetable oils and some dairy products. China’s total agricultural imports have grown more quickly than anticipated, more than doubling between 2001 and 2004 to $33bn.Economists worry that the sudden increase in the cost of such a basic good as food will fuel inflation. James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at US financial advisor Wells Capital Management, says the rise in non-energy commodity prices could presage an increase in core consumer inflation later this year.Meanwhile, humanitarian agencies are worried that a sustained rise in prices will make it more difficult to feed people in the poorest countries. Greg Barrow, spokesman for the UN’s World Food Programme, says rising demand for raw materials from China, as well as a weaker US dollar and higher transportation costs, are making its food purchases more expensive. A sustained rise in food prices would mean the agency would either have to ask donors for more money or cut back on aid for the 90m people it feeds, he adds.Stock analysts have begun to downgrade the share prices of food companies, which they believe will have trouble passing on the rising costs of raw materials to consumers. Deutsche Bank last week lowered its equity ratings on Unilever, Danone and Nestlé, citing concerns over the impact of price increases on the companies’ future profit margins, while Morgan Stanley similarly lowered its ratings on Numico.Nestlé, the Swiss food group, last month announced that not only was it facing higher costs for grains, corn and green coffee, but that the price of milk (its biggest single raw material cost) was “going up like a rocket”.Agricultural raw materials typically account for 20-25 per cent of a food company’s costs. Nestlé and Unilever, along with other food and drink companies such as Hershey, Mars, Wrigley, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and SABMiller, have been raising prices to try to recover some of the cost increases.But analysts worry that food retailers may soon start to resist food companies’ attempts to push through price increases and food companies have been looking at alternatives to putting up prices. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, recently said it had started “playing games with [product] formulations” to try to reduce costs, such as using less rapeseed oil in its margarines.One tactic favoured by companies in the past is to sell less food for the same price. Hershey famously kept the price of its trademark chocolate bar steady at a nickel (5 cents) between 1900 and 1969. When cocoa prices rose, it simply bought less and made the bar smaller. This worked until the 1970s, when rampant inflation made it untenable.The strategy is now being tried by cereal makers. John McMillin, food analyst at Prudential Securities, says: “Both Kellogg’s and General Mills [cereal makers] are shrinking boxes: the question is, will Americans notice it?”"
796;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-05-21T07:51:50Z;Fizz drives up Britvic profits;;Britvic on Monday said that strong volume growth in its soft drinks business, allied to better realised prices and cost savings, had pushed up interim profits.The group, in which Permira the private equity firm, holds a 14 per cent stake, increased its interim dividend by 10 per cent in response to its improved trading performance.Britvic last week agreed to pay €249.2m for the soft drinks business of C&C, the Irish drinks group. The deal will combine Britvic’s rights to the Pepsi and 7UP brands in the UK with C&C’s rights to the names in Ireland.Responding to reports that Britvic wanted to pick up rights to Pepsi across more European markets to deter a private equity takeover bid, Paul Moody, chief executive, said the company would continue to look at international expansion, which “may or may not include Pepsi franchises”.He said the group’s strategy since its 2005 flotation had been to look at markets outside the UK for acquisition, but it was a question of what was available to buy.He said management would be meeting Permira this week, as well as its other major shareholders, to discuss the results and the future plans.Operating profits before exceptional items rose 30.1 per cent to £24.2m, with operating margins up from 5.7 per cent to 6.8 per cent. Pre-tax profits were up 61.7 per cent from £9.4m to £15.2m, before exceptional charges, down from £14.7m to £4.9m.Mr Moody said the group had outperformed the soft drinks market in the first half of its financial year, to mid-April. But, he cautioned that the second half, covering the summer, was usually more volatile and the market faced tough comparisons with last year.However, he said the “encouraging trading trends” had continued in the first few weeks of the second half and he was confident for the full year.During the first half year the soft drinks market increased by 1.7 per cent by volume. Britvic’s sales growth was driven by higher volumes, up by 7.5 per cent in still drinks, and 8.1 per cent in carbonated drinks.The group had developed promotions that increased volume without eroding the average realised price. Meanwhile, its programme of “production value optimisation” offset cost increases through savings.Mr Moody said he expected the majority of the group’s growth in the future to come from the stills market as customers switched away from fizzy drinks. Though that switch had been reversed during the group’s first half, he said the carbonated market had not recovered to its 2004-05 level.Within fizzy drinks, Pepsi had increased its share of the cola market by 1.8 percentage points to 23.5 per cent, following strong promotions. Britvic also benefited from entering the “increasingly important discounters sector”, Mr Moody said.In still drinks, which includes Robinsons and J2O, Mr Moody said there would be product launches in the second half, including Robinsons Smooth Juice and Fruit Shoot 100% Juice.Group sales rose 9.3 per cent to £354m, with revenues from still drinks up 8.5 per cent to £167m, and from carbonates up 9.6 per cent to £175m. International sales rose from £9.9m to £11.6m. Earnings per share were up from 3p to 5p, and the interim dividend it 3.3p, up from 3p. In opening trading the shares rose 1p to 392p.
797;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-05-20T21:51:42Z;UK Companies Diary: EMI sounds out offers;;●Britvic is expected to report stronger sales of fizzy drinks when it releases interim results, as it lays out a strategy to fend off private equity interest. There has been speculation it may extend its relationship into Europe with PepsiCo, whose drinks are bottled and marketed in the UK by Britvic. The agreement allows the US drinks group to end it if Britvic comes under new ownership. Britvic has been trying to diversify and develop its brands and last week said it would buy C&C’s soft drinks business for £169.5m. C&C is also the PepsiCo bottler in Ireland. Meanwhile, Paul Moody, chief executive, will be playing down the idea of private equity interest, with Permira sitting on 14 per cent. The prospect of a formal bid lifted the shares to a record of 391p last week, valuing it at £845m.●Having called the recovery in Marks and Spencer after Christmas, Stuart Rose will deliver his third set of annual results as the group’s chief executive. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of about £960m – just short of the £1bn barrier that M&S broke in its mid-1990s heyday – on turnover of £8.5bn. M&S has been rebuilding market share in women’s wear under Kate Bostock and analysts will be looking to see whether the volatile weather and unappealing product that has weighed on rivals such as Next and Debenhams is hurting Mr Rose. He may also have something to say on the opening of standalone furniture stores, as well as international expansion plans and the food business, given that he has just appointed two outsiders – Carl Leaver from De Vere and Steve Esom from Waitrose – to run the two divisions.●Full-year results from EMI coincide with the deadline it has given four potential bidders to make offers for the music company. As a result, speculation over the intentions of Warner Music, One Equity Partners, Cerberus and Fortress is likely to overshadow what is likely to be a weak set of figures. After two profit warnings in January and February, EMI said in a trading update in April that it expected a 15 per cent decline in recorded music sales at constant currencies and flat revenues from its music publishing division. Profits will be harder hit, with a forecast that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will fall from £276m to £174m after high levels of returns of unsold albums from artists such as Robbie Williams. Analysts will be looking for updates on its bid talks, its £110m cost-cutting programme, current sales and the impact of its decision to sell its music online without copyright protections.●Experian, the data and credit checking company will report its maiden set of annual results after it was spun off from GUS, the retailer, last year. Analysts expect the company to report earnings before interest and tax of about $815m (£414m). They will want to know whether Experian, which typically spends about $600m to $700m on deals, will step up the pace of acquisitions in the current year. They will also want to know whether problems at LowermyBills, Experian’s US division, have improved. Experian recently said that the meltdown in the US subprime mortgage market dented sales by 5 per cent at LowerMyBills, which provides customer leads for subprime lenders.●Cable and Wireless, which is reporting full-year results, has been a darling of the stock market over the past year as investors have bought into its vision for revival. The shares have risen 87 per cent over the past 12 months. C&W was suffering a long-term decline ever since losing its duopoly with BT in the supply of fixed-line phone services in 1991. John Pluthero, head of C&W’s UK business, is seeking revival by focusing on serving the needs of medium-sized to large companies, which has meant taking an axe to the old client base. Mr Pluthero has pledged the UK business can generate £2bn of revenue and £400m of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) sometime between 2008 and 2010 and analysts will be looking for progress towards that goal. A poll of analysts by C&W found the UK business would have £150m of ebitda in 2006-07. C&W group, which includes its smaller international businesses, is estimated to have £3.4bn of revenue and pre-tax profit of £192m in 2006-07.●An appropriately sense of Gallic déjà vu will descend on investors in Aegis, the media buyer and research group, when they vote on two board directors nominated by Vincent Bolloré, the French investor. It is the fourth time Mr Bolloré, who owns 29 per cent of Aegis via Groupe Bolloré, has made board nominations. On each previous occasion, investors have sided with the Aegis board, which has argued that because Mr Bolloré also chairs Havas, a rival, any nominations he makes would involve a conflict of interest. Pirc, the shareholder advisory body, has also called on investors to back Aegis’s board and for Mr Bolloré to refrain from seeking more than one resolution a year on nominations.
798;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Bid battle looms for Cadbury drinks;;At least two private equity consortia are understood to be preparing bids for the US beverages arm of Cadbury-Schweppes as it prepares to split its soft drinks brands from its confectionery operations.Blackstone, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Lion Capital are understood to have teamed up to prepare a bid, according to people close to Cadbury. Another consortium made up of Bain Capital, Texas Pacific and Thomas H Lee is also understood to be vying for the business.Six other private equity groups, which are set to form at least one consortium, have also made approaches, people close to Cadbury said.Lion Capital and Blackstone were widely expected to look at the business, which is seen as a natural extension to their portfolio. Together they bought Cadbury’s European drinks business in 2005 which includes the Schweppes, Orangina and Oasis brands in Europe.Cott, the Canadian soft drinks group, last month said it might participate in a joint bid for the Cadbury Schweppes business. Analysts believe Cott could benefit by combining its bottling systems with Cadbury’s.Analysts also believe that Coke and Pepsi could be interested in some of the brands, such as Snapple, Hawaiian Punch or Motts, if they could get round regulatory hurdles. However Cadbury is understood to prefer to sell the business as a whole rather than dividing up individual brands which would be time consuming.Cadbury decided in March to split the two businesses following pressure from Nelson Peltz, the US activist investor. It planned to either sell the beverages business which includes Dr Pepper and Seven-Up in the US, or demerge it by listing it on a US stock exchange.Todd Stitzer, chief executive of Cadbury, said in March that a merger with Hershey, the US chocolate company, would make commercial, strategic and financial sense, but any deal would be difficult given the complexity of Hershey’s ownership structure.Cadbury shares were up 2.6 per cent in early trade at 691p. They have risen 30 per cent since March, when Mr Peltz disclosed that together with affiliates he had bought 3 per cent of the company.
799;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-05-14T10:20:47Z;Britvic pays €250m for C&C’s soft drinks;;Britvic said on Monday it is paying €249.2m (£170m) for C&C Group’s soft drinks business, which is based in Ireland.Paul Moody, Britvic chief executive, said buying C&C soft drinks was “the perfect first step” in its plans to expand internationally. The business was “a great fit, with good prospects for growth” he said.C&C said it would use some of the cash from selling the business to increase its recently announced share buy-back programme from €150m to €300m and use the rest for general purposes.Maurice Pratt, chief executive of C&C, said the deal would give the group a “sharper business focus” and allow it to concentrate on expanding its cider, spirits and liqueurs brands.Mr Moody said C&C’s brands, which include Club soft drinks, Ballygowan water, and the rights to the Pepsi and 7Up brands in Ireland, would fit well with Britvic, which has the Pepsi and 7Up brands in the UK, as well as Robinsons, J2O, Tango and R Whites. C&C has had the rights to the Britvic name in Ireland, so the takeover would combine the two.The Irish market in total, combining the Republic and Northern Ireland, has a population of 5.8m with the highest per capita consumption of carbonated soft drinks in Europe.Britvic has suffered as consumers have been switching from fizzy to still drinks, but Mr Moody said C&C also had strong brands in still drinks, while Ballygowan was the leading water brand in Ireland.Britvic said it was acquiring assets worth €134.4m and would also take on a €20m pension deficit. The C&C soft drinks business made a profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) of €24.7m, on an IFRS basis, from sales of €269.9m in the year to end-February.Mr Moody said that while the deal valued C&C soft drinks at 10.1 times ebitda, because of the lower rate of corporation tax in Ireland, the price would represent 8.3 times ebitda on an equivalent tax basis, which he said put it at the lower end of the range of prices paid in the sector recently.Britvic predicted cost savings and benefits from the acquisition of around €14m a year, for instance from procurement savings and increased use of the supply chain network. It said the integration costs would be around €20m-€25m over the next three years. It said the deal should be earnings enhancing before those costs in the first full year of ownership, and should cover Britvic’s cost of capital in the second full year.When Britvic floated in December 2005 it said it wanted to expand internationally. Since then it has issued a series of profit warnings. Last autumn Permira, the private equity group, appeared keen to make a bid for Britvic but then withdrew. It retains a 14 per cent stake and Britvic’s share price has reflected bid speculation.However, fresh reports over the weekend suggest the private equity group may be prepared to go hostile to secure the drinks group.The shares rose 5.5 per cent or 19½p to 374½p on hopes Britvic may be the latest private equity takeover target. C&C was up 3.8 per cent or €0.46 top €12.45.Britvic, which is due to announce interim results next week, said current trading continued the positive trends it had seen earlier in the financial year and management “remains confident with regard to the full year outcome”.
800;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-05-06T22:16:29Z;Liberty ready to go global;;The new chief executive of Liberty, the upmarket London department store, Sunday night pledged to lead an expansion in the Middle East, Asia and the US for the company that would do “justice” to the world-famous name.Geoffroy de La Bourdonnaye will succeed Iain Renwick as chief executive in July, after holding a series of brand management roles at Christian Lacroix, L’Oréal, PepsiCo and Disney.Mr Renwick left in April when Richard Balfour-Lynn, Liberty’s chairman, said the company needed a different approach. Mr de La Bourdonnaye, 50, pledged one of his top priorities would be international expansion in the US, the Middle and Far East, focused on Liberty of London, the luxury goods business launched in 2005.Liberty has just one shop, in London, and Mr de La Bourdonnaye said it was time to export Liberty of London.He described Liberty as having “a very exotic heritage linked to the history of London”. He added: “The name Liberty is known all around the world, and has not been given justice in terms of its presence in countries like the US and Japan.”Liberty could either open its own shops abroad, or set up concessions inside existing department stores.Liberty is controlled by Marylebone Warwick Balfour, the property company run by Mr Balfour-Lynn. Mr de La Bourdonnaye, who is credited with the turnround at Lacroix, said another of his priorities would be to bring Liberty to profit. Mr Renwick reduced Liberty’s losses, and restored the fortunes of the London store during his 4½ years as chief executive.In March, Liberty said pre-tax losses for the 18 months to December fell 21 per cent to £2m ($3.9m), on sales of £66m, up 52 per cent.Mr Renwick brought stability after turbulence during the 1990s when Liberty went through four chief executives who pursued different strategies.
801;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-04-25T21:26:01Z;Dow sets new mark on strong earnings;;Wall Street cheered a string of better-than-expected earnings and a rise in reported capital spending on Wednesday, propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average through the 13,000 threshold for the first time.The bullish mood in stocks largely reflected upbeat corporate earnings and guidance in recent weeks.The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent higher at 1,495.42 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9 per cent at 2,547.89.Although they are at fresh six-and-a-half-year highs, the S&P and the Nasdaq are below the record levels set in March 2000, namely 1,527.46 and 5,048.62, respectively.In contrast, the Dow’s 30 large-cap stocks set a new record close of 13,089.89, a gain of 1.05 per cent and reached a high of 13,107.45 earlier in the day. The Dow Transportation and Utilities Averages also set record highs of 5,254.90 and 531.27, respectively.“The Dow tends to be tilted towards value stocks and is energy- and resource-heavy, and these areas have been doing well lately,” said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services.He said the weaker dollar also provided a boost to US companies geared towards exporting or competing with imports.Of the 19 Dow companies that have so far reported first-quarter results, 13 have exceeded forecast earnings.Leading the Dow higher was Alcoa, up 5.3 per cent at $35.76 after it said it would explore the sale of its packaging and consumer businesses. Exxon Mobil gained 1.7 per cent to $79.92 amid higher oil prices and ahead of earnings due on Thursday.IBM built on its gains from Tuesday and rose 3 per cent to $101.46. The stock has risen 7.3 per cent this week, buoyed by a higher dividend and plans for $15bn in stock buy-backs.Another Dow stock, Boeing, recouped early losses and gained 1.1 per cent to $94.69 after first-quarter earnings rose 27 per cent compared with a year earlier.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the recent rise in the Dow reflected retirement accounts being opened since the tax year closed on April 15 and the belief among investors that a falling dollar would boost earnings for multinational companies.“Money is jumping into large-cap stocks as they are easy to buy and that tells me the current run is getting tired and is close to ending,” he said.The Dow’s return of 5 per cent so far this year remains adrift of the S&P’s gain of 5.4 per cent. But both benchmarks lag the 10.4 per cent rise in the S&P 400 index of medium-sized companies.The mid-cap index set a new record high of 889.52 on Wednesday and analysts said these companies are in a “sweet spot”.Some benefit from the weaker dollar boosting foreign earnings while, in general, the sector provides suitable buy-out candidates for private equity funds.“Investors are gravitating towards mid-caps’ ongoing profit momentum,” said Alec Young, equity strategist for S&P’s Equity Research.He expected that S&P 400 earnings would rise 13 per cent this year, against a 7 per cent increase for the S&P 500.The explosive rally in Amazon shares on Wednesday was its largest one-day rise since November 2001. Analysts said the surge was no surprise after its strong earnings and also reflected the limited supply of available shares. Some 70 per cent of Amazon’s stock is held by a handful of investors and short interest in the company was around 12 per cent according to Nasdaq data.Amazon also benefited from brokerage upgrades. Mark Mahaney, analyst at Citigroup upgraded Amazon to a ‘Hold’ from a ‘Sell’ and said “a key part of our ‘Sell’ thesis no longer holds” namely that the company “had seen the likely end of margin boosts from third party sales…and we were wrong.”As earnings season continued, PepsiCo said first-quarter profit rose 16 per cent and the company affirmed its guidance for this year. Its stock rose 0.9 per cent to $66.98.ConocoPhillips said its first-quarter profit rose 7.7 per cent, with income from asset sales offsetting lower commodity prices and higher operating costs. The oil group’s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $70.82.Apple, the computer maker, rose 2.3 per cent to $95.35, ahead of earnings due out after the closing bell. Apple said fiscal second quarter profits jumped 88 per cent and beat estimates, amid strong sales of its iPod music players and Macintosh computers. In after-hours trade, shares had risen 7.7 per cent to $102.69.Shares in Corning rose 5.3 per cent to $24.98 after its first-quarter profit jumped 27 per cent.Sun Microsystems tumbled 11.3 per cent to $5.27 after its sales growth missed expectations, in spite of the computer server maker swinging to a small profit in the fiscal third quarter ending April 1.Shares in Eastman Kodak rose 9.2 per cent to $26.23.
802;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-04-17T22:25:49Z;Expensive defensive stocks;;Compared with their bond market peers, investors in US equity markets remain notoriously optimistic in their economic outlook. Or so the conventional wisdom goes. Dig a little deeper, though, and the message is a lot less clear than the near doubling of the S&P 500 since its 2002 trough would suggest.For one thing, shares have lagged behind rapidly expanding earnings. That has left the market as a whole trading at just over 15 times underlying earnings on Standard & Poor’s bottom up estimates for 2007, leading some to conclude that even a few quarters of lacklustre growth need not spoil the party. But the aggregate hides as much as it reveals.Among the sectors commanding high price/earnings multiples, a revealingly large number are in areas that should do comparatively well during a downturn. Consumer staples, for example, trade at about 18 times earnings. This is roughly matched by such businesses as Anheuser-Busch or PepsiCo. Companies credited with earnings growth potential, such as Procter & Gamble or WM Wrigley, are a lot dearer still.Similarly, the slightly more cyclical consumer discretionary sector, which includes media companies and the likes of Target, McDonald’s and Nike, trades at about 20 times earnings. Healthcare, telecommunications and utilities are also valued more highly than the broader market, if less aggressively so. Among classic favourites in rising markets, by contrast, only information technology commands a premium rating.For the S&P 500 as a whole, all of this is offset by the low ratings of financials – the largest earnings contributor by far – and energy. Investors are certainly wise not to expect peak-level earnings in those industries to last forever. Unfortunately, in the process, they have also driven up relative valuations of more defensive sectors – including ones with fairly direct exposure to slowing consumer spending. The mundane headline valuation of the S&P 500 may offer far less protection than at first appears if and when peak profits begin to fall.
803;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Women on march to top of US companies;;The number of women in charge of large US companies could double in the next five years as more female managers break through corporate America’s glass ceiling, according to Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive.Ms Nooyi, one of only 11 female chief executives among Fortune 500 companies, said a growing number of women had risen to senior corporate positions and could make the leap to a top job over the next few years.“The next five to 10 years I think are very promising …I am meeting more and more fantastic women at what I call almost-CEO levels. There is a lot of hope,” she told the Financial Times in an interview.“Eleven is better than zero, progress has been made and I hope that number doubles quickly”.The comments by Ms Nooyi, who became PepsiCo’s first female CEO last October after 12 years with the consumer goods group, contrast with the widespread fears of a slowdown in women’s rise to the top of corporate America.Last year, women lost ground to men in the share of both board memberships and corporate officer positions, according to Catalyst, an organisation focused on gender and equality issues.The research found that, despite accounting for nearly half of the US workforce, women make up only 15 per cent of directors and 16 per cent of senior officer positions in Fortune 500 companies.“Women candidates for senior positions face greater scrutiny than men,” said Ilene Lang, president of Catalyst.“But women are emerging. As companies look for the leaders of the future they want to play with a full deck, why look at only half of the potential talent?”The ranks of female chief executives of large companies, which include Ebay’s Meg Whitman and Xerox’s Anne Mulcahy, were recently augmented by the appointment of Irene Rosenfeld, a former senior executive at PepsiCo, as chief executive of Kraft.Ms Nooyi, who spent the first 23 years of her life in her native India before winning a place at Yale University in the US, said the lack of women in senior positions was one of the historical reason for their small presence in the boardroom.She said that companies had a responsibility to break any remnants of a glass ceiling by setting up programmes to help women rise to the top.
804;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Kraft unveils plans to boost sales growth;;Kraft Foods on Tuesday announced a long-awaited reorganisation which will see the US group increase marketing spending and refocus its product line-up in a bid to boost organic sales growth to 3-4 per cent next year.Irene Rosenfeld, who took over as chief executive last June, said the company will “hit our stride” by 2009, after admitting in recent weeks that its existing turnaround plan was “not broad-based enough”, while its response to competitors has been viewed by analysts as sluggish.Ms Rosenfeld’s task has been complicated by recent mis-steps, such as the $245m write-off for its poorly-performing Tassimo coffee brand. Sales at Kraft, best known for its cheese slices, Oreo cookies and Maxwell House coffee, rose 0.7 per cent last year.Kraft, like rivals such as Sara Lee, is combining a mix of cost-cutting and increased spending on product development and marketing, while rejigging its portfolio to boost margins and secure stable sales growth. However, the industry also faces volatile raw material and energy costs, which have eroded pricing power in some segments.The Illinois-based company has already sold products with annual sales of $1bn, and is cutting 6,000 staff – 6 per cent of its workforce – as part of an effort to generate annual savings of $400m.Kraft said savings from the two existing restructuring plans were on target, and aims to reinvest the savings to bolster growth. The company will also pursue acquisitions – notably overseas – with a balance sheet strengthened by next month’s spin-off from Altria, the US tobacco group which still owns 89 per cent of Kraft.The increased spending saw Kraft cut its earnings per share guidance for 2007 to $1.50-$1.55 – compared with $1.85 last year - with Kraft shares dipping 2 per cent to $34.23 by midday in New York.Analysts also expressed some scepticism about the potential impact of lifting marketing expenditure by little over 1 per cent.Ms Rosenfeld, a 22-year Kraft veteran and the former head of PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay North America unit, said in a presentation to analysts that she would “rewire the organisation for growth”. From 2009, the company is targeting earnings growth of 7-9 per cent and organic sales growth of 4 per cent.Kraft is not expected to announce any more large-scale divestitures, with Ms Rosenfeld focusing on how the company – the largest US packaged food group by revenues – can leverage its scale, a strategy successfully employed by PepsiCo.The company is viewed as having a strong sales force, and a presence across the range of key food segments – frozen, refrigerated and on-the-shelf. Ms Rosenfeld has talked of focusing more effort on higher-margin ready-meal offerings, as well as brands such as its “Back to Nature” line-up which tap into rising demand for healthier foods.
805;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-02-04T22:16:03Z;Mars to end adverts for under-12 set;;"Masterfoods, the makers of Mars and Snickers chocolate bars, is to stop marketing confectionery to children younger than 12 by the end of the year, the first time a big foodmaker has set such a high global age limit for products.The move, which follows mounting concerns about the links between advertising and childhood obesity, is the biggest shift in marketing policy by a large food group since European officials threatened companies with regulation two years ago. It may prompt other companies to follow suit.There are no global standards for marketing snack foods to children.Food groups typically have lower advertising age limits than 12. Some have no limits.Nestlé says it does not encourage “overeating” in children but does not have a specific age limit.PepsiCo, which sells crisps as well as soft drinks, says it does not have a global age limit for targeting children.Cadbury Schweppes does not target children under eight globally, and says it has not advertised to children under 12 in the UK for the past six years.Kraft does not advertise to children under six, and says it only markets “better for you” products – such as fruit juice and crackers – to children aged between six and 11.Masterfoods has a policy of not advertising to children under six. But in a letter to Robert Madelin, the European Commission’s director-general for health and consumer protection, the company said: “We have decided to make an official policy change to a cut-off age of 12 years for all our core products.”Core products include snack foods and confectionery.The letter said the new policy, to apply to all advertising including online and new media, would be adopted by the end of
the year."
806;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
807;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-01-24T16:03:46Z;Wal-Mart acts to restore sales;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has carried out a sweeping reorganisation of its senior US marketing and merchandising executives, as it seeks to revive sluggish sales at its more than 3,000 US stores.John Fleming, who has spent the past two years as chief marketing officer, will now take overall responsibility for merchandising – the art and science of selecting and selling a retailer’s assortment.The decision puts Mr Fleming at the centre of Wal-Mart’s efforts to adapt to the increasingly pervasive industry model to shape strategy around market research that identifies customer desires.Traditionally, Wal-Mart’s “stack ’em high sell ’em cheap” approach largely left the business of market research to its leading suppliers, while the retailer focused on its “Always Low Prices” message.Mr Fleming, who spent 19 years at Wal-Mart’s rival Target, will be responsible for ensuring the results of extensive market research are reflected by what the assortment its merchants choose to sell. He will oversee a department to focus on “customer experience”.As chief marketing officer, he formed the retailer’s first customer research department, and made changes to advertising intended to identify specific customer groups.Jeff Smith, head of Accenture’s global retail practice, noted that under Eduardo Castro-Wright, who heads Wal-Mart’s US store division, “there have been regular signals to Wall Street and the market that they intend to move away from the one size-fits-all, cookie-cutter, mass-merchant model, to something aimed at particular customer segments.”“Wal-Mart is moving to a place where price image, while important, is not the only differentiator, but will be linked to assortment and customer experience.”Mr Castro-Wright described the changes as marking the start of the second year of a three year plan aimed at adapting Wal-Mart’s merchandising to reflect the diversity of its customers.The company has divided its merchandise into five categories: grocery, clothing, entertainment, home furnishings and pharmacy.Claire Watts, formerly responsible for merchandising of all soft goods, will now report to Mr Fleming as head of clothing, while Doug Degn, formerly responsible for hard goods and grocery, is leaving the company after 24 years. Bill Simon, head of professional services, retains reponsibility for the retailer’s pharmacy merchandising.Wal-Mart said that Stephen Quinn, who was recruited by Mr Fleming from Pepsico’s Frito-Lay division in 2005, will become chief marketing officer.
808;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-01-23T23:42:46Z;Tate & Lyle warning;;There’s no accounting for taste. Even as the rest of the market was busily selling off Tate & Lyle’s shares in the wake of its warning on Tuesday, the company’s chief executive and its chief operating officer were buying.Some will see that as canny bottom-fishing. But the general mood, with Tate’s shares off 16 per cent, is very different. Tate has admitted to being too bullish on the near-term prospects for its Splenda Sucralose low-calorie sweetener. Earnings estimates for the years ending March 2007 and March 2008 will fall by 5-10 per cent. Assuming the share price drop relates only to Splenda, that implies the business was trading on more than 40 times 2007 earnings. In part, then, Tate’s savaging reflects a reappraisal of expectations for a product that is, after all, ersatz sugar. not a cure for the common cold.The problem is that Splenda is a totem of Tate’s strategy to move away from commoditised sugar to specialist ingredients. In some respects, Splenda is a superior product to its main rival Aspartame – for example, it copes well with heating. The problem is that 42 per cent of sales are to diet-drinks makers and demand here has been disappointing. Already, Cadbury Schweppes, having tried using Splenda in Diet 7-Up, has reverted to Aspartame. Diet versions of Pepsi and Coca-Cola using Splenda have not made much of an impact.Healthier eating trends should underpin long-term growth. The question is, when? This warning comes just as Tate is tripling Splenda production capacity so, barring a big contract win – and quickly – the product’s high margins will suffer. Moreover, while the strategy remains valid, the warning emphasises Tate is undergoing a transformation. With progress in its blockbuster not busted, but somewhat blocked, investors have been reminded of the risks involved.
809;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-01-23T21:32:05Z;Expert tastes sweet success;;"Tate & Lyle’s trading update may spell out bad news for the company but it is perfect timing for Charlie Mills, a research analyst at Credit Suisse.He published a note on the giant sugar and sweetener maker last week called “Not so Splenda?”.Mr Mills asked in the note whether the “great US Splenda boom is in danger of fizzling out” after pointing out that Diet Coke with Splenda and Pepsi One with Splenda have both failed to take off.He said Diet 7Up, which was the first leading soft drink to use Splenda, has relaunched, reverting back to aspartame.Mr Mills published the note on January 15 – more than a week before Tuesday’s trading update from the sweeteners group – and although the analyst did not say Splenda would not be a success, he hit the nail on the head with his comment that it is the “expectation of rate of growth that needs to be tempered”.Mr Mills, who has covered the industry for 22 years, said he had no inside information from the company: he just trawled through industry data and information on the take-up of its sweeteners after seeing that sales of sucralose were flat.This prediction about Tate & Lyle challenges investors’ frequent claim that analysts are not up to scratch.Mr Mills is part of an increasing tendency for analysts to make bold calls on the future of specific companies – with varying success.Edward Najarian at Merrill Lynch declared in December that Bank of America was very interested in buying Barclays.People close to both companies said there were no talks and Ken Lewis, BofA’s chief executive, later played down the chances of any acquisition outside the US.However, Merrill did better in July by saying the timing of Lord Browne’s departure from BP was an “emerging risk and potential medium-term risk”. A boardroom row immediately burst into the open and Lord Browne said this month that he would stand down as chief executive 18 months early.JPMorgan Cazenove forecast in September that Resolution Life could be taken over. Two months later, the company said it was in early talks about a possible deal.Other recent predictions include Fox-Pitt Kelton’s that Bradford & Bingley would merge with Alliance & Leicester; Collins Stewart suggesting a merger between Akzo and ICI; and Citigroup forecasting a tie-up of Electrocomponents and Premier Farnell.None has been proved right, yet."
810;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-01-23T21:14:52Z;Fad helped create false dawn;;Back in 2004, when Tate & Lyle announced an expansion of its sucralose plant in Alabama, the future was sweet.Tate & Lyle had become the sole supplier of Splenda sucralose to food and drink companies following a deal with joint venture partner Johnson & Johnson and was recommended as the sweetener of choice by the low-carb Atkins diet plan.With consumers flocking to low-carb food and drinks, Splenda – the tabletop version of which contains 0.5g of carbohydrates a teaspoon compared with 5g for a teaspoon of sugar – quickly gained share on aspartame brands such as Equal and Nutrasweet, which dominated the market.Tate & Lyle convinced leading fizzy drinks companies Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cadbury-Schweppes to bring out versions of drinks with Splenda.Iain Ferguson, Tate & Lyle’s chief executive, says the popularity of low-carb diets such as Atkins created “a massive amount” of innovation in the food and drink industry. “Splenda was excellent for that type of low-carb offering.”But as the popularity of low-carb diets faded – Robert Atkins died in 2003 and the company behind the Atkins products went bankrupt two years later – consumer interest in diet drinks start to wane.Today, the fastest-growing part of the drinks market in the US, the main market for Splenda, is bottled water and energy drinks.US sales volumes of sports and energy drinks grew an estimated 18 per cent last year, according to beverage research group Canadean, while bottled water grew 14 per cent.Some flavoured bottled waters use sweeteners, but energy drinks typically do not. Mr Ferguson says“Energy drinks are really about calories and sucralose has zero calories. So it’s not really a natural home.”Analysts say that the market growth for drinks sweetened with Splenda has been “far from spectacular”. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo introduced versions of their core Coke and Pepsi brands with Splenda in 2005 and the two brands took 0.7 per cent of the total fizzy drink market, according to research from Credit Suisse. However, by the end of last year this had slipped to 0.3 per cent.Meanwhile, Cadbury-Schweppes, which became the first company to use Splenda in lemon-lime soft drinks when it introduced the sweetener into its Diet 7 Up and 7 Up Plus in 2005, has reverted to aspartame.John Sicher, editor of US soft drinks newsletter Beverage Digest, says there are no obvious disadvantages to sucralose compared with other sweeteners. “I do not think there’s a problem with the taste of sucralose.”But he believes soft drink companies are reluctant to alter the taste of drinks, because they have suffered when they altered ingredients in leading products. Coca-Cola was forced to revert to its original formula in the mid-1980s when its New Coke flopped.Sucralose, which advertises itself as “the sweetener that is made from sugar and tastes like sugar”, tastes more like “regular” soft drinks than diet versions flavoured with aspartame.Americans are accustomed to the taste of aspartame because it has long been used in the diet versions of the Coke, Pepsi and Dr Pepper brands. “People like the product, people like the taste,” Mr Sicher said. “[Companies] are not going to reformulate those brands.”Mr Ferguson concedes that some US tastes are hard to change. “There’s a very strong consumer understanding and acceptance and probably one might even say consumer liking for the diet drinks as they are currently formulated.”He also admits to having been “over-bullish” on the rate at which fizzy drinks companies would adopt Splenda. “I plead guilty in being too bullish in terms of the speed of uptake.”Use of Splenda is still growing in food, which accounts for 48 per cent of its sales globally, and still beverages. Mr Ferguson remains confident of Splenda’s long-term potential. He hopes both Tate & Lyle’s Alabama sucralose plant and its planned Singapore plant will eventually operate at full capacity. And he argues that food and drinks companies still want to take calories out of their products.Analysts say some of Splenda’s best opportunities may be outside the US, where diet soft drinks flavoured with aspartame are less common. Sales of low calorie fizzy drinks are growing globally, although overall, fizzy drinks sales are falling. Splenda has made its way into Diet Coke in Scandinavia and Japan, as well as into Fanta Orange in France.Mr Ferguson has also hinted at price cuts for sucralose (which is more expensive than other sweeteners) as production volumes rise and manufacturing costs fall. So far, limited production capacity has made it difficult to supply large amounts of sucralose.Tate & Lyle now says it could supply one of the big diet brands if it wanted to switch from aspartame.Mr Ferguson said: “We could just about cope with that now. I would quite like one of them to come and ask.”
811;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-01-12T00:17:25Z;India hails Sarin, not his mission;;Upon his arrival in New Delhi early on Wednesday morning, Arun Sarin received a warm welcome.Television reporters swarmed around the silver-haired chief executive of Vodafone, the UK telecoms company, thrust microphones in his face and lobbed frantic questions about his company’s potential bid for Hutchison Essar, India’s fourth largest mobile operator.Unfazed, Mr Sarin affably told the gaggle of reporters: “It’s two o’clock in the morning! You guys should be in bed!” They giggled but nevertheless followed him until he gave a few pithy remarks about the importance of the “transaction” ahead.Mr Sarin was coming home – a move interpreted by some observers as a charm offensive by the Indian-born executive to help offset Vodafone’s foreign identity as a bidder for Hutchison Essar.Mr Sarin is one of a growing number of pravasi, or overseas Indians, who have climbed to the pinnacles of industry, academia and the arts.One Indian newspaper, the Business Standard, gushed: “For Indian chests might swell with pride at the glass ceilings Sarin . . . has smash-ed to become what he is: one of the most powerful businessmen in the world in control of a British icon.”Mr Sarin’s visit to New Delhi came a day after a government-sponsored conference of overseas Indians. More than 1,200 pravasi from all corners of the world gathered for the annual jamboree whose theme was to forge stronger ties between India and the 20m-25m members of its global diaspora.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the conference: “I want every Indian living and working in India to aspire for the global recognition that a Zubin Mehta [classical music conductor], a Lakshmi Mittal [chief executive of Arcelor Mittal], an Indra Nooyi [chief executive of Pepsi], an Amartya Sen [Nobel prize winner for economics] or a Kalpana Chawla [astronaut] gets when they go overseas.”Mr Sarin carries himself like a relaxed Californian (he lived in the US state for nearly 30 years and is a US citizen). But he made another high-profile visit to India when Vodafone took a 10 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel, the country’s leading mobile phone operator, in 2005.Mr Sarin graduated from the elite Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur but went on to get a masters in engineering and an MBA from the University of California at Berkeley. He worked for various telecoms companies including Pacific Telesis and AirTouch until joining Vodafone in 1999.As India emerges as the fastest-growing mobile phone market, it is no surprise that Mr Sarin is visiting India.Slightly more surprising was that the media frenzy began to calm by the second day of his visit. Television channels no longer flashed constant clips of him entering government ministries. Mr Sarin’s face was not splashed on the front pages of newspapers.It is a contrast to when Mr Mittal won control of Arcelor last summer. The Indian press lauded Mr Mittal as a “man of steel” and likened him to Krrish, the Bollywood version of Superman.The race for Hutchison Essar, however, is different.Mr Mittal was pitted against a European giant and created the world’s largest steel group. Vodafone’s main rival in the battle for Hutchison Essar is Reliance Communications, headed by Anil Ambani, the son of revered Indian industrialist Dhirubhai Ambani, whose face appears on a postage stamp.And, most importantly, the battle is far from over. “When will you make an offer,” reporters yelled as Mr Sarin retreated into his hotel. He turned around, and looking flustered for the first time, said: “In a few weeks.”
812;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2007-01-05T20:43:26Z;Food fight over ‘traffic light’ plan;;It is shaping up as a food fight of epic proportions: manufacturers, supported by Tesco, are ploughing £4m into an advertising campaign designed to see off once and for all the “traffic light” scheme through which the government hopes to turn us into a nation of healthy eaters.If the likes of Cadbury Schweppes, Danone, Kellogg, Kraft and PepsiCo have their way, the Food Standard’s Agency’s plan to force manufacturers to colour-code foods according to levels of sugars, salts and fats will soon be declared past its sell-by date.In its place the makers aim to establish an alternative scheme under which consumers would be told what percentage of their recommended daily sugar, fat and salt intake a product contained. This so-called Guideline Daily Amounts approach is the latest front in a long-running battle between the government and the food industry over how to help consumers make sensible choices.On the one hand, the government is desperate to slim down the nation by encouraging people to change their eating habits. Obesity in adults will have risen 38 per cent between 2003 and 2010, according to official figures released last year. But on the other, food manufacturers, supported by Tesco, Britain’s biggest supermarket chain, are reluctant to see their products blazoned with a red traffic light symbol alerting a prospective purchaser to high levels of salt, sugar and fat.Gavin Neath, chairman of Unilever UK and president of the Food and Drink Federation, has reportedly said the industry could not accept red “stop” signs on products.Instead, more than 20 manufacturers are supporting the GDA scheme and in the coming days those companies will roll out an advertising campaign designed to win the hearts and minds of shoppers.There is some evidence that the food industry’s fears about the impact of a “red for danger” system may be well-founded. J Sainsbury, which is among those championing the FSA’s scheme, said sales of Chicken Madras fell 40 per cent when it put the traffic light labelling on its packaging last year.And yet not all its rivals share its enthusiasm. While Asda, Marks and Spencer and Waitrose tread the same path as Sainsbury, Tesco (flanked by Wm Morrison) is setting itself apart from the pack. Last year, Tesco took the decision to adopt the GDA scheme after two years of researching both approaches.The supermarket chain insists it has tested both traffic lights and GDA labels in its stores – and that it was the latter that increased sales of healthier foods.The green, amber and red traffic light system was too simplistic, Tesco argued, because it did not put the fat, salt and sugar content in the context of customers’ daily allowances. Instead it just sent a crude “stop” or “go” signal.“The test for any nutritional labelling system is: does it change behaviour? – and our nutritional signposts are doing just that,” argues Tesco. “Where our labels have been applied customers are already using them to move towards products lower in salt and fat.”It cites ‘Healthy Living’ egg and cress sandwiches sales of which, it says, have risen 97 per cent while the standard version’s sales have dipped by nearly one-third.The food manufacturers have looked for ways to undermine the government’s efforts, arguing that they unnecessarily “demonise” certain foods, such as nectarines, which are packed with natural sugar, or a bottle of olive oil packed with mono-saturated fats.However Beth Hart, Sainsbury food and health manager and a trained nutritionist, says this is a “bit of a red herring”, since the labelling system being proposed by the FSA applies only to processed foods. She also dismisses the idea that the traffic light system is simplistic. “It may look simple, but the the thinking behind it is very scientific and is backed by current nutritional practice,” Ms Hart said.“We think people take about four seconds to make a purchasing decision. When you are wandering around a store, you don’t have much time to ponder products, so this helps you make quick, informed choices.”Independent research also points to the superiority of traffic lights over the manufacturer-backed percentage-based GDA scheme. The latter’s advantages appear less compelling when juxtaposed with government findings that about 47 per cent of the population struggles to understand percentages.Which?, the consumer watchdog, found in that 97 per cent of people were able to identify healthier products with the traffic light system, against 87 per cent with GDAs.But with manufacturers and retailers split there is much to play for in 2007. The FSA will this month announce who is on the independent panel it has set up to assess the relative merits of the competing schemes in an attempt to find some common ground.Consensus, however, looks likely to prove elusive for at least another year.Have your say - Food labelling: which is the better method?
813;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Dell reshuffles management;;Dell on Tuesday announced a series of management changes designed to inject fresh life into the computer maker, which has been suffering from an erosion in cost advantage, slumping margins and increased competition.The re-shuffling comes as Dell is struggling to bounce back from a disappointing year in which it lost its top spot in the personal computer market to its arch-rival, Hewlett-Packard.Dell said it would split its product development team, which is responsible for Dell’s future product lines, into separate “consumer” and “business” groups in order to achieve better focus.It said it had appointed Steve Schuckenbrock, a former executive at Electronic Data Systems, to head its fast-growing $5bn services business.Mr Schuckenbrock was most recently co-chief operating officer at EDS. Before that, he was with IBM and PepsiCo.“Steve has worked as CIO of one of the most recognised brands in the world and as chief operating officer of one of the premier service delivery companies,” said Kevin Rollins, Dell’s chief executive, in a statement. “We believe his experience…will bring our customers a high level of understanding and innovation.”John Medica, a 14-year veteran and head of the company’s global imaging and displays business, will retire by the end of the first quarter.Shares in the company fell 2 per cent on Tuesday to $26.20. The shares had risen from a low of $19.91 in July but are still off from a recent high of $32 in February.Last month, Dell shook free from the doldrums after several quarters of missed results. Although improved margins helped earnings at the company beat expectations last quarter, sales growth remained sluggish. Concerns remain that Dell’s strategy of direct sales of computers over the telephone and internet may be losing its competitive edge.Mr Rollins, who had been under increasing pressure to restore the company’s reputation as an out-performer on Wall Street, earlier this year announced a series of initiatives, dubbed “Dell 2.0,” intended to inject fresh life into the company’s business model.

He replaces Joan Guggenheimer, who died earlier this year.Under Mr Cutler, the SEC and state regulators forced 12 banks, including JPMorgan, to pay $1.5bn to settle allegations that they issued biased research.His team also took on after-hours mutual fund trading, mutual funds that secretly paid brokers to steer them business, and improper trading by specialists at the New York Stock Exchange.Mr Cutler’s hiring adds JPMorgan to the list of US public companies who have picked general counsels from the ranks of former regulators and prosecutors since the corporate scandals of 2001-02.The shift reflects the growing importance that businesses place on their general counsels and the stricter regulatory environment that Mr Cutler helped create.“I am very pleased that Steve Cutler will be joining JPMorgan Chase in this critically important role. He will be an excellent General Counsel and a key member of our senior management team,” said Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive.“Steve is a strong leader, noted for his integrity, distinguished service in the public and private sectors, and outstanding reputation in the legal and regulatory communities.”Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Pepsico have all hired general counsels with Justice Department experience, and the Willis Group opted for a former member of the New York Attorney General’s office. On Wall Street, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley all have former SEC enforcement directors as their top legal officers.Mr Cutler, who earned both his bachelor’s and law degree from Yale, said in a statement: “This is an exciting opportunity for me to join a wonderful group of people, and I’m looking forward to working closely with Jamie and his team.” His compensation was not disclosed.JPMorgan has faced is a tough regulatory period. In addition to paying $80m as part of the research settlement, it also paid $135m to settle allegations it helped Enron mislead investors.
815;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Britvic blames cheap flights for loss of fizz;;Britvic has blamed the rise in demand for no-frills cheap airlines, which ask passengers to pay for food and drinks, for hurting sales as it reported a 43 per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the full year to £36.5m.The owner of the Tango and J2O brands, which has been struggling to regain investors’ confidence after a series of profit warnings, said sales volumes and revenues fell in the year to October 1. Total volumes dropped 3.3 per cent, driven by an ongoing decline in sales of fizzy drinks, while revenues fell 2.6 per cent to £677.7m.Weakness in Britvic’s international business, which supplies airlines, contributed to the sales decline. International sales revenues fell 4.9 per cent to £23.5m, with Britvic blaming the decline on a rise in cheap air travel.Pre-tax profits were hit by exceptional items such as such as £6.6m in share incentive schemes, £5.5m in listing costs associated with the group’s IPO last year and £7m in redundancy and advisory costs linked to a restructuring. After tax and exceptional items, profits were 0.3 per cent lower at £39.6m.Paul Moody, Britvic’s chief executive, remains cautious about the outlook for fizzy drinks, which account for slightly more than half of the group’s sales revenues. “The volatility continues,” he said.UK fizzy drink sales have declined by about two per cent over the past three months compared with the same period a year earlier, Mr Moody said.However, he added that sales of still Britvic brands such as Fruitshoot H20, a water brand targeted at children, and Robinsons’ squash have been rising.Britvic’s shares increased by 2¼p on Thursday to close at 234p, slightly ahead of their 230p offering price. Britvic said it would pay a final dividend of 7p a share, making a full-year dividend of 10p.FT comment■ Britvic has had a troubled start to life as a public company after failing to anticipate a shift in tastes to healthier drinks. It is now trying to adapt, but the question is whether it can adapt quickly enough. Flat annual profits have been achieved with the help of lower taxes and cost cutting, and it has yet to prove it can deliver sustained innovation. At a p/e ratio of 12 times 2007 earnings, the group looks fairly valued.
816;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-11-27T22:42:41Z;In-house lawyers no longer Cinderellas;;Becoming a corporate general counsel used to be something leading American lawyers did to slow down.The jobs were considered relatively low-key, low-profile and low-paid, at least in comparison to a partner at a big law firm, and lawyers who went in-house often held their jobs until they retired or got bored.Not any more. In the wake of the 2002-03 corporate scandals and the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate accountability law, general counsels are now central figures at most US companies, often reporting directly to the board and often appearing on the list of the five highest paid corporate officers.The post has also become a much riskier assignment. In the past six months, 12 public companies have changed chief legal officers amid investigations into whether the firms illegally backdated stock options grants to pump up executive compensation.Hewlett-Packard is also in the market for a lawyer to replace general counsel Ann Baskins, who resigned after the company’s use of “pretexting” during an investigation of board leaks came to light.“These positions are not for the faint-hearted,” says Catherine Nathan, head of general counsel practice for search firm Spencer Stuart. “The whole environment has changed. Corporations are under a microscope. CEOs are under intense scrutiny and they rely heavily on their general counsels.”Between the departures over stock options and ordinary turnover, the American market for in-house lawyers is hopping, search firm executives say. In-demand candidates are fielding multiple inquiries and compensation packages are rising.The average bonus for the nation’s 100 highest-paid general counsels was $906,820 last year, up 16 per cent, and the average restricted stock grant was nearly $1m, up 35 per cent, according to a study of Securities and Exchange Commission filings by Corporate Counsel magazine.When salaries were included, the total average package reached nearly $2.5m.“I’m seeing a bit of sticker shock [at the size of the wage bills],” says June Eichbaum, senior partner at the search firm Heidrick & Struggles, which has been hired to fill at least four of the positions vacated in the options scandal.“Historically, the general counsel was not thought of as a profit centre,” she says, adding that the job had now become a critical business function.Worried boards are asking for candidates with a different set of skills than they did 15 years ago. Back then, companies wanted merger-and-acquisition experience and investment banking ties.Now even companies not facing immediate regulatory problems want former prosecutors and SEC enforcement lawyers.Search firms date the shift to the Enron and WorldCom scandals, which put corporate fraud on the public radar. Since then, Fortune 500 companies PepsiCo, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Estée Lauder have all turned to lawyers with Justice Department experience.“The board wants someone who can walk into the offices of the SEC and the justice department and know people there . . . someone who understands what the regulators care about today, not what they cared about 10 years ago,” Ms Eichbaum says.Today’s boards are equally clear about what they do not want – anyone with ties to options backdating. With 160 companies enmeshed in the scandal, boards have become insistent that candidates are scandal-free.“They have to have clean hands,” says Martha Fay Africa, managing director of legal search firm Major, Lindsey & Africa. She says boards are asking: “How can we know that this person wasn’t implicated?”The new focus on regulatory issues dovetails with the on-the-job experience of in-house lawyers.For the second year in a row, “keeping apprised of company activities that may have legal implications” has replaced “reducing outside legal spending” as the main concern of American in-house lawyers, with 86 per cent mentioning it in a survey for the Association of Corporate Counsel.“With all of the international operations, they are really on call 24/7,” says James Wilber, a leader of services to corporate law departments at Altman Weil, a consulting firm. “The pressure has increased significantly.”
817;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Food groups urged to enlist in war on obesity;;"Food and drinks companies can avoid draconian regulation if they voluntarily cut down on fat and salt in their products, give clear nutritional information and reduce advertising to children, the European Commission said on Thursday.Markos Kyprianou, the health commissioner, praised companies co-operating in the fight against obesity and called on others to follow suit, saying he did not want to resort to the blunt instrument of lawmaking.“We are facing a complex problem that cannot be solved by legislation,” Mr Kyprianou said. “It is a new way of working together.”Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the soft drinks companies, McDonald’s, the US burger chain, and packaged food giants Unilever and Kraft were singled out as good examples of companies that had changed for the better.However, Mr Kyprianou said independent monitoring of commitments was essential to their credibility. “If self-regulation fails we will take other steps,” he said.The voluntary approach mirrors the strategy the Cypriot commissioner took in a recent debate on binge drinking. Despite pressure from some members for advertising bans, he gave the industry a chance of self-regulation.“The Commission wants to use what works,” said one soft drinks company executive. “This approach produces quicker results.”McDonald’s, which ann­oun­ced this week it was cutting the use of harmful trans-fatty acids in Europe, was commended for devising a simple panel showing how much of the recommended daily amount of calories, fat and so on products contain.Unilever said it had eliminated tonnes of sugars and salt from its standard products. Kraft had stopped advertising fatty products to children and stopped selling in primary schools.Nine companies that are members of the Union of Euro­pean Beverages Associations have agreed to end advertising to under-12s. “We are moving with the consumer,” said Dominique Reiniche, the head of Unesda and European president of Coca-Cola, said. “We used to talk of markets; now we talk about society.”Some 90 per cent of EU citizens in a recent poll said they believed junk food and drinks advertising influenced children. The soft drinks industry’s pledge will be monitored by PwC, the financial services firm, and an expert in broadcasting. “It’s a learning process,” Ms Reiniche said.Mr Kyprianou said that one in five children was overweight and 400,000 more became so every year. He told the FT: “This is a responsibility for all of us. The key question is to give people a choice of product, allow them to make an informed choice and educate them.” He is considering a Europewide standard nutrition labelling scheme to replace numerous national and voluntary company or industry standards that lead to confusion.European health ministers meet in Istanbul next week to discuss a marketing code of conduct drawn up under the auspices of the World Health Organisation.The Bureau of European Union Consumers repeated its call for a ban on advertising to children, which boosted their “pester power” over parents."
818;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Women still struggling to the summit;;"Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo, Irene Rosenfeld at Kraft Foods, Cynthia Carroll at Anglo American: this year’s highly publicised appointments of female CEOs at some of the world’s biggest companies could give the impression that the token female presence at the top of business is suddenly increasing.Think again. Peering down the pipeline that leads to the chief executive’s office reveals an acute shortage of women. The female CEO will remain a tiny minority for years to come.This is the conclusion of a study of companies on the Fortune 1000 published today. A decade from now, the study forecasts, women will account for just 6.2 per cent of chief executives of the largest companies in the US, which usually leads the world in business trends.Constance Helfat, technology and strategy professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, is joint author of the study. “Even though 6.2 per cent is more than triple the current percentage,” she says, “it doesn’t seem very impressive when one considers that by 2016 it will have been about 40 years since women first entered corporate management in large numbers.”The gloomy prognosis is based on what Prof Helfat and her fellow authors believe to be “the most comprehensive set of information” on nearly 10,000 senior executives in the Fortune 1000 at the turn of the millennium. The analysis has taken six years to complete.Its most revealing finding is that in 2000 – a quarter of a century after women moved into management in force – nearly half these companies did not have a single female executive senior enough to be included in official filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The other companies typically had only one or two top female executives, according to the study, “The Pipeline to the Top”, which was published in the peer-reviewed US journal Academy of Management Perspectives.These results contradict optimistic assertions from some senior business people that there are “droves” of women in the pipeline, say the authors from Tuck and from Loyola University, Chicago.“It is difficult to have a full pipeline of women in line for promotion to CEO when, as recently as the year 2000, almost half of the companies in the Fortune 1000 had no women as
top executives at all,” the study concludes.The findings give added urgency to the need to address the shortage of women moving up to the top jobs in business, an issue debated in the UK this week with the publication of annual research into the number of female directors on FTSE 100 boards.While only 15, or 3.8 per cent, of executive directors on these boards were women, researchers at Cranfield University School of Management found a more positive picture when they looked at the gender balance on executive committees – the so-called “marzipan layer” just below the board. In the first study of its kind, they found 70 women, representing nearly 12 per cent of executive committee members.The authors of the Female FTSE research point to two challenges. One is how to persuade headhunters to put forward these women – as well as senior women in the FTSE 250 – for vacancies on FTSE 100 boards.“Search consultancies seem reluctant to sponsor women (or men?) who have not previously held a FTSE non-executive directorship,” they say.Some 53 FTSE 100 companies have women on their executive committees, such as Lloyds TSB and Reuters, both of which have three women on their nine-member senior management teams. So the second challenge is to close the gap between these and the rest, which either have all-male committees or do not reveal their composition.The slow progress of many leading US and UK companies in promoting and retaining women is all the more curious given the established business case for doing so. Catalyst, the US non-profit organisation for women’s advancement, has shown that Fortune 500 companies with the highest proportion of women in senior management significantly outperform those with the lowest proportion, both on return on equity and on total return to shareholders.Catalyst recently warned that, at the current rate, it could take 40 years for women to reach parity with men as corporate officers – executives appointed or elected by the board.As Prof Helfat puts it: “Even if the upper pipeline has a lot more women today – and I know of no data that indicates it has – an improvement so recent is highly unlikely to have much effect on the number of female CEOs for at least the next decade.”Forecasts in the study assume that executives move up one rank every five years and that average CEO tenure is also five years. They focus on the number of women in chief financial officer posts or senior “line” jobs with profit-and-loss responsibility – the usual route to the top. The estimates are higher if they are based solely on a woman’s rank in the hierarchy, not her function.Unexpectedly, the study finds that women are over-represented in accounting and legal affairs and hold their own in strategy and IT. It confirms their under-representation in operational and finance jobs, however.What is to be done to accelerate progress? Women in senior management tend to be younger and to have had less time in their posts than their male counterparts. This suggests that companies have aggressively recruited and promoted them, the study says. The authors recommend that other businesses adopt the same methods.It is also crucial that companies find ways to move women into senior operational roles and hold on to them, the study concludes.As previous research has suggested, having more women in top management helps companies retain women lower down in the hierarchy because they
can see opportunities for advancement."
819;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-10-25T16:06:31Z;CFOs can give us straight talk on sustainability;;"Corporate sustainability – the idea that profits can and should go hand in hand with social and environmental responsibility – has been around for a long time. Now, though, it has reached a tipping point. Nearly 70 per cent of chief executives of mid-sized to large companies believe that sustainability is vital to their profitability, and more than two-thirds say it will remain a high priority, according to recent global surveys by PwC of its clients.Many companies are already practising sustainable business with success. General Electric has doubled its investment in clean technology, recognising that addressing climate change can be great business. Unilever is training developing-world villagers to market and sell single-use sachets of soap, creating profits, economic growth and public health benefits. And Toyota has hit the jackpot with its electric hybrid, the Prius.Yet many chief financial officers do not see the value that sustainability offers their companies. They simply shake their heads, saying “No, no, no”, whenever internal advocates try to propose sustainable business initiatives.CFOs are trained to be sceptical and analytical: these are sterling qualities that help them to avoid getting swept up in corporate fads. But rather than fighting a rearguard action against a sustainability movement that is here to stay, CFOs should apply their analytic rigour to testing and strengthening their businesses’ sustainability programmes. Here are three ways they can contribute to the effort and dramatically bolster their companies’ long-term profitability in the process.Substantiate the business case for sustainability. Gary Pfeiffer, CFO at DuPont, described one of his roles as “sweeping up after the elephant parade”. His chief executive, Charles Holliday, has made a mantra of sustainability, pushing the idea that DuPont should shift from making petroleum to biotechnology-based products, for example. Mr Pfeiffer’s job is to apply a financial reality check to this and any other visionary ideas about sustainability.Sustainability is not philanthropy; if there is no profit payback, your company should rethink its commitment. CFOs such as Mr Pfeiffer play an important role in making sure their companies’ investments in sustainability produce results.Measure the results from sustainability initiatives in financial terms. In his role as chairman and chief executive at PepsiCo, Steve Reinemund has shown his commitment to diversity. But diversity is not just a public relations exercise or merely an ethical choice: it brings competitive advantages to PepsiCo in the creation of new products, penetration of growing markets, and access to the best employee talent. The company measures the financial benefits of diversity and has pegged them at more than $100m.Now PepsiCo’s senior vice-president for finance, Matt McKenna, has helped to develop a CapEx Sustainability model whereby capital investments of more than $10m are systematically screened and measured for environmental, social and financial results. This powerful “triple bottom line” analysis ensures every big project the company undertakes is sustainable as well as profitable.Communicate the value of sustainability to shareholders. The CFO can play an important role in educating investors about the benefits of sustainability. Alan Schwartz, of Bear Stearns, the securities and investment banking group, said at a conference on sustainability in Washington in 2004 that companies should present sustainability goals the same way Warren Buffett presents Berkshire Hathaway’s annual business objectives: here’s what we are going to do, here’s how we’ll measure it and here’s how you can evaluate our performance this time next year. The CFO is uniquely positioned to explain the logic of sustainability to investors with this kind of straight talk.Sustainability without a real business case is mere philanthropy; without measurement, mere whimsy; without meaningful reporting to shareholders, mere public relations. Today’s best-run companies – and smartest investors – are seeing sustainability for what it truly is: a strategic business driver that will separate the winners from the losers in the next decade. Companies seeking to establish strong, successful sustainability programmes will need the active participation of their CFOs.The writer is author of The Triple Bottom Line – How Today’s Best-Run Companies are Achieving Economic, Social and Environmental Success and How You Can Too"
820;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-10-23T21:25:11Z;Pepsi chief in health drive;;Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s new chief executive, has vowed to accelerate the group’s shift towards healthier products and continue its rapid expansion outside the US.Addressing investors three weeks after taking the helm, Ms Nooyi predicted more of the strong growth that has made PepsiCo one of the world’s best-performing food and drink groups over recent years.She pledged to remain faithful to the strategy pursued by her predecessor, Steve Reinemund, who is retiring.But she warned that PepsiCo must continue adapting to rapidly changing consumer habits, including soaring demand for healthier products.Consolidation in the retail sector and rising inflation were other challenges that increased pressure on the group to become more efficient and competitive, Ms Nooyi said.“Our overall strategy does not require change at this point,” she said. “But we will be responsive when the market calls for it.”Under Mr Reinemund, PepsiCo focused on growth in international sales and healthier brands as US consumers shifted away from its two flagship products: Pepsi-Cola soft drinks and Frito-Lay salty snacks.More than two-thirds of PepsiCo’s US sales growth this year has come from brands classified as “healthier”. These include Quaker cereals, Gatorade sports drinks and low-fat crisps that are baked.Ms Nooyi, previously chief financial officer, promised increased research and development to accelerate the flow of healthier new products and brands.The group’s latest offering is apple and berry flavoured crisps containing real fruit.More than half of Pepsi­Co’s profit growth this year has come from outside the US, led by emerging markets such as China and Russia.Ms Nooyi said international growth had “only just begun”.She expressed confidence in meeting the group’s long-term target of mid-single-digit percentage growth in revenues and low double digit growth in earnings.Predicting “sustainable growth long into the future,” she said: “We are realistically confident that we can and will deliver.”
821;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-10-18T10:35:26Z;CIO as communicator: Way with words now a vital skill;;As chief information officers becomes more integral to businesses, they not only have to learn about their company’s strategy, but be able to articulate it as well.In the 1980s, IT bosses were still familiar with the smell of the soldering iron. Today, they need soft skills and a way with words.Ken Harris, CIO of Shaklee, a Californian company producing natural nutrition, skincare and vitamin products with a turnover of $500m, has worked for Gap, Nike and PepsiCo.He has recently implemented customer relationship management (CRM) software from RightNow technologies at Shaklee. RightNow is one of a growing number of suppliers that allows users to operate software as a dial-up service, subscribing to the system by usage and leaving the actual running and operation to the original vendor.“My role has morphed into that of a communicator over the past 25 years, ” says Mr Harris. “When we decided to use the RightNow software, we got the senior business people together and said to them ‘Here is a tool and anyone can use it’. The whole discussion that followed was about our business and where it is going.”Mr Harris notes that an effective CIO communicates with multiple constituencies, including his suppliers.He talks of “vendor management”, the art of keeping a dialogue with different vendors open, as a skill he has acquired. “And you have to be able to let people see that a new idea will make their life easier, so your job involves more and more internal salesmanship.”Nigel Underwood was CIO at logistics group Excel, and now holds the same job at DHL Logistics. Managing IT after an acquisition is about making staff realise integration is about people and their expectations, he says.His first concern was that IT staff should feel part of a structure instead of thinking that their world had been taken over and they had lost control.“You start with the internal audience, you open lines of communication for feedback. It is not just about soft communication skills, but about how you plan ahead and manage the deployment of those skills.”Mr Underwood, a mathematics graduate, summarises his work as “99 per cent ‘I for Information’ and only 1 per cent ‘T for technology’. I try not to talk in acronyms, and I remember that communication is a two-way process. My role is to educate and coach.”He uses his membership of The Infrastructure Forum (TIF), a professional body for European IT directors, to compare notes with contemporaries.“We have learned to position ourselves so we get an insight into the whole business remit.”Organisations like this can help top up skills developed via media training aimed at teaching the CIO to explain his work to readers of non-technical publications.But the divide between the CIO and his fellow board members still exists, according to business adviser, Accenture.California-based Accenture partner Gary Curtis works with clients evaluating the IT implications of mergers. He says formal training can make a big difference to the way the CIO is perceived by his colleagues and a broader audience.“Look at the kind of coaching a chief executive gets. There is a lot of ongoing public relations training. But it is still rare to see that at the CIO level.”Recruiting CIOs with a background in anything other than technology and a track record in clear communication is one option.However, given the scarcity of such individuals, Mr Curtis suggests being realistic: “They may learn about communications along the way, but if not, they should be trying to go out and acquire world-class business communications skills.”He concedes that only a very small proportion of CIOs fit this bill, but at least they constitute “a growing faction”.If nothing else, as the role of IT shifts within companies, the CIO needs to be a good communicatior, if only to explain why this job still matters so much.

Each charge carries a maximum of one year in jail.Mr Crawford’s indictment and guilty plea marks another blow to a Bush administration official, and highlights continuing scrutiny over conflicts of interest.The charges filed by federal prosecutors in federal court in Washington clarify Mr Crawford’s sudden resignation as FDA chief in September 2005. His resignation came less than three months after the Senate confirmed his nomination by the president to lead the FDA, a powerful regulator overseeing 25 per cent of US gross domestic product.Before his nomination he served for three years as acting FDA commissioner and deputy commissioner.According to the indictment, Mr Crawford lied from 2003 to 2005 about stock and options held by himself and his wife in companies with significant interests in FDA decisions. These stocks included Kimberly-Clark, a consumer products maker, PepsiCo, the soft drinks maker, food group Sysco, and retailer Wal-Mart.The indictment also details how US obesity regulation could have been affected by an alleged conflict of interest between Mr Crawford’s finances and a policy committee he chaired.In 2003, Mr Crawford was chairman of the Obesity Working Group (OWG) at the FDA. The group produced policy recommendations the next year, including new rules for food and soft drink labels’ calories, carbohydrates and contents.“During the entire period from the formation of the OWG . . . Crawford and his wife owned 1,400 shares of PepsiCo stock worth a minimum of about $62,000 and 2,500 shares of Sysco stock, worth a minimum of about $78,000 . . . Shareholders had a financial interest in the OWG’s conclusions and recommendations,” the indictiment said.Mr Crawford is also accused of making false statements on federal financial disclosure forms.

Aeon’s shares gained 3.6 per cent to Y2,760 and Daiei 3.7 per cent to Y1,955. After the market closed Aeon confirmed it would hold talks about buying a 15 per cent share.Strong results reported by US consumer companies such as McDonald’s, PepsiCo and Costco reinforced the Fed’s commentary that consumer spending was rising in the US, acting as an impetus for Japanese consumer goods and retailing shares.Matsushita Electric Industrial, maker of Panasonic brand electronics, rose 2.9 per cent to Y2,635 and Hitachi rose 1.3 per cent to Y699. Rival Sony climbed 3.7 per cent to Y4,760, benefiting from a ratings upgrade to ”overweight” from “equal weight” by Morgan Stanley.Bucking the trend, game machine maker Sega Sammy plunged 7.7 per cent to a new low of Y3,100 despite raising its earnings forecasts, as investors focused on disappointing sales of pachinko machines.Among other retailers, Seven & I, operator of the 7-11 convenience store chain, climbed 2.6 per cent to Y3,880. Discount chain Don Quijote gained 7.2 per cent to close at Y2,310, with help from a ratings upgrade to “outperform” from “neutral” by Credit Suisse.Fast Retailing, Asia’s biggest clothing retailer, however, lost ground despite reporting a 19 per cent improvement in annual earnings and forecasting another 10 per cent gain next year. Fast’s shares slid 2.9 per cent to Y11,240 after Mizuho Securities downgraded it, citing the recent rise in the share price.Shares of mid-sized banks did well after the Bank of Fukuoka said it was in merger talks with Kyushu-Shinwa Holdings. Bank of Fukuoka’s shares rose 2.3 per cent to Y896 and Kyushu-Shinwa soared 10.6 per cent to Y156. Chiba Bank gained 1.9 per cent to Y1,058 and Bank of Fukushima rose 3.4 per cent to Y150.The Mothers board of smaller growth stocks surged 5.3 per cent to 1,140.02 at the end of a turbulent week.

825;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-10-12T18:25:51Z;PepsiCo;;Keeping the fizz in a bubbly story is never an easy task. PepsiCo has yet again edged ahead of market expectations with its latest results. Investors, however, were unimpressed. For a change, shares in Pepsi have been trailing those of arch-rival Coca-Cola so far in 2006.That has more to do with the sparkling rating of Pepsi’s shares, at 21 times 2006 earnings, than its operating performance. While third quarter profits were flattered by a slightly lower tax rate, 11 per cent underlying year-on-year growth is not to be sneezed at. Pepsi remains one of the few established food and beverage companies that deliver volume and revenue increases above economic growth pretty consistently.Ever since it spotted health issues as long-term threats to carbonated soft drinks and salty snacks almost a decade ago, investing in innovation and adding slightly more wholesome items has been at the core of its strategy. That continues to pay off, in spite of the occasional blip. The weakness in North American beverages, for example, followed a very solid first half. Recent price increases at its Tropicana juices in the face of rising orange prices seem to be sticking. Meanwhile, key inputs, such as aluminium cans, should start getting cheaper, allowing Pepsi to rebuild margins, even as it increases discretionary marketing spend.Still, the fact that it has already had to boost promotional investment in North American beverages suggests Coca-Cola is finally getting its act together – making it harder for Pepsi to steal effortlessly its old foe’s lunch money. Growth continues to come mainly from its international operation, which is already its largest unit and where margins have traditionally been lower. Indra Nooyi, Pepsi’s new boss, would be ill-advised to change its basic approach and looks unlikely to do so. Unfortunately, that may not be enough to quell the insatiable thirst of investors.
826;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;In the boardroom: Redressing the gender imbalance;;"Alison Wheaton has the curriculum vitae of a classic high-flyer: a degree from Cornell, an MBA from Wharton, and a career that encompasses Morgan Stanley, Pepsi-Cola International and Bass. But Wheaton, an American who has made her home in the UK, lacks one thing that would set the seal on her distinction: a directorship with a leading company on the London Stock Exchange.So, on a hot early autumn day, she is travelling across London by taxi to see a well-connected man at the top of British business who can help her achieve her goal.Neatly dressed in a brown trouser suit, complemented by discreet pearl earrings and necklace, Wheaton admits to feeling “a little nervous…but mostly just really looking forward to it”. The business leader on whom she is about to call is Sir John Parker, 64-year-old chairman of National Grid, one of the world’s largest utilities companies. In his other big corporate post as chairman of P&O, he led the sale of the shipping and ports operator to DP World of Dubai earlier this year. Sir John has been Wheaton’s mentor for the past two years. “To be honest I couldn’t believe my luck in getting him,” says Wheaton, 42, who is director of property and information technology for Mitchells & Butlers, Britain’s largest managed pubs group. “He is very warm and easy to talk to and very structured in his thinking, which is why we hit it off at our first meeting. It’s people like him who will help to make the difference.”The “difference” she is talking about is a redressing of the gender imbalance in Britain’s boardrooms. Wheaton is part of a unique experiment that will help determine whether voluntary measures can be as effective as quotas in feminising the white, middle-aged male profile of top boards. It will be a challenge. In Norway, where quotas are being introduced, the number of female board directors in top companies has jumped from 22 per cent to 29 per cent in the past two years, according to a survey by the European Professional Women’s Network. Over the same period, leading UK companies have seen only a slight rise from 10 per cent to 11.4 per cent.The driving forces behind the UK initiative, known as the FTSE 100 Cross-Company Mentoring Programme, are two professional women who together decided that action was needed: Peninah Thomson, a partner at Praesta, an executive coaching firm that is funding the programme; and Jacey Graham, an independent consultant and former head of diversity strategy at Shell International.With support from government ministers and business schools, they have persuaded 29 chairmen and chief executives of FTSE 100 companies - including Niall FitzGerald of Reuters, Peter Sutherland of BP, Baroness Hogg of 3i and Philip Hampton of J Sainsbury - to mentor up-and-coming women in non-competing companies with the aim of helping them secure suitable directorships. Launched two years ago, the programme has attracted attention from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands and is being modelled in France. The World Bank has shown interest in the initiative as a means to further equal rights for women.The mentoring sessions are by their nature private. Today, however, Wheaton and Sir John have agreed that I can be a fly-on-the-wall at their meeting. Wheaton has had reservations about going public, but decided it was important to show how useful a “tremendous mentor” could be. “I also try to think about it from the point of view of: If I were a bloke, what would I do? A bloke, presumably, would stick his head above the parapet.”We arrive around noon at the headquarters of National Grid, just off Trafalgar Square, and are shown to the waiting area outside Sir John’s office. There is a party atmosphere as a group of other women arrive, greeting each other enthusiastically. It transpires that they are personal assistants whose bosses are all members of the same committee, and they are gathering for an all-female get-to-know-you lunch. Given our rather different reason for being there, it is an ironic reminder of the gender segregation that persists in significant parts of the jobs market. Wheaton has her mind on other things. She has a typed list of subjects she wants to raise: what size of company and what sector should she be aiming for? How can she best approach the chairman of her own company for advice? Is this a good moment to renew her rounds of the headhunters?She is ushered in for a preliminary chat. Ten minutes later, I am invited to join them in Sir John’s unostentatious office overlooking the National Gallery. He runs the 45-minute meeting in a calm, businesslike manner, inquiring in his soft Northern Irish accent what progress she has made since their last session in May.They briefly discuss the failed bid for Mitchells & Butlers by Robert Tchenguiz, the property investor. Then she explains how she has gained useful experience from her company’s recent acquisition of 240 Beefeater and Brewers Fayre pub-restaurants from Whitbread. She speaks briskly, using her hands for emphasis.Sir John asks what she has learned from her experience on the board of the London Development Agency (LDA), which is responsible for the economic development of the capital. Has she avoided the trap that many executives fall into of being too hands-on? She believes she has, by offering feedback rather than solutions and by focusing on governance.Then they broach the all-important subject of networking, at which women are often said to be at a disadvantage since so much of it takes place in the pub, over evening dinners or on the golf course.“I know I suggested you visited two or three headhunters,” says Sir John, whose notes on the table in front of him are hand-written. “I think it’s time to follow that up. My experience is you need to keep visiting and talking to them about opportunities and how the lessons you’ve learned from the LDA are equipping you to be a more rounded non-executive director.”Wheaton says: “The other thing I’d like to do is refresh my cv, given what’s been going on in my day job and at the LDA, and if you don’t mind I’ll send that back through.”“I’ll be very happy to run my eye over it,” he says. “I encouraged you to look at the target sectors that you were interested in. Has that changed?”As well as retail and consumer products companies, she says she is now thinking about property and construction.“I think that’s a very natural sector to add on,” Sir John concurs. “If you can set the camera lens a bit wider, that’s a good thing. I think the FTSE 250 or 350 is a great place to start. Then you can gravitate towards the FTSE 100 in due course. You’ve some very exciting companies in the 250, and you get almost closer to the business, which is very good learning experience.”Has she been on a development course for non-executives, he asks. “There are also some good conferences that gather together a lot of people from the sector, be it retail or property…I guess you haven’t done a lot of that.” Wheaton says she has not, although she has represented Bass and M&B at the Confederation of British Industry and made helpful contacts that way.Without Wheaton having to ask, Sir John then suggests she also seek the advice of Roger Carr, who not only chairs Mitchells & Butlers, but also Centrica, parent of British Gas, and is deputy chairman of Cadbury Schweppes. Carr is mentoring another woman in the cross-company programme, so he is known to be sympathetic.Wheaton says she has bumped into Carr in the lift and they have compared notes on his role as a mentor and hers as a “mentee”. He has already offered to meet her when she feels the need. “So I think now is probably the right time…I was keen to get your views on how to best approach that with Roger,” she says.After discussing this, Sir John seems pleased. “In the short time we’ve known each other, I really feel you’ve become much more focused on what you’re after. You’re preparing yourself well. There are no quick fixes. You have to wait for the right opportunity and be prepared to keep knocking at the doors of a few headhunters. I’m absolutely confident you are a great fit, for a consumer-facing organisation in particular.”The mentoring session is over. There has been no time for small talk, but they chat while the photographer takes some pictures and discover they are both keen sailors. I ask Sir John if his role extends to putting in a good word to his contacts on her behalf. “In introducing Alison to a few of the headhunters, I’ve made my views about her known and will continue to do that,” he replies. “And I will be very happy, when she’s in close contact with a particular company, at the interview stage, to be a referee.”Does he think the old boys’ network lives on? “No, I think the whole recruitment process for boards has become much more transparent. Most searches for non-executive directors involve a headhunter, so it’s not left to a few chaps getting into a corner after a board meeting and saying: Would Joe Able-body be a suitable choice to come on this board?”Nonetheless, he accepts it is hard for women to gain access to male-dominated networks. “That’s why the females have to get in amongst us, make themselves known and let people be aware that they are interested in becoming non-executive directors.”Sir John expects Wheaton to find a suitable directorship in 12 to 15 months. Other women on the programme are also gaining visibility, according to Peninah Thomson. One has been short-listed for a FTSE 100 board. Another has been appointed to her own company’s board and a third has won a big promotion to a global operations role. Two have taken up public sector appointments. Several headhunting firms are offering feedback and career-management.A couple of the women have decided they do not want non-executive directorships after all. Given the time and effort it takes, not to mention the risks and challenges that now face anyone appointed to a big board, perhaps that is not surprising.Wheaton is not one to baulk at barriers, however. Before heading to see Sir John, we meet for a cafe latte on the waterfront near Tower Bridge and she explains how she arrived at her current job in the very male world of pub estates and IT. “I’ve always had to work hard, so the idea of having to work hard to get a non-executive position doesn’t put me off,” she says.Wheaton was born into a lower middle-class family in Colden, an appropriately named town in upstate New York “where winter starts in October and ends in April”. She was the first person in her family to go to university, winning a place at Cornell that was funded by scholarships and loans. While studying government and economics, she came to the UK on an exchange programme with the London School of Economics and did a stint as an unpaid assistant to Margaret Beckett, then Labour’s shadow health minister, now UK foreign secretary.Having sworn she would never work in banking, she then did just that, joining Morgan Stanley during the 1980s Bonfire of the Vanities era on Wall Street. Rather than the traditional analyst route, she entered on a programme for Ivy League graduates to work in the back office, acting as a counterweight to the risks involved in the financial instruments that were emerging at the time. She was one of only two women.After her MBA, she joined Pepsi and settled in the UK with her British husband, a chartered accountant, whom she had met at the LSE. They have no children, but enjoy the company of their young nieces and goddaughters. “Time just got away from us. I did an MBA. We were both trying to establish careers, and the next thing we knew we were in our mid-to-late 30s.” Living in the UK also meant she was 3,500 miles from home and the support of a family network.She joined Bass in 1997 as strategic director of its pubs division for the challenge. She quickly gained operational experience and was offered the property portfolio just before M&B was spun off from Bass in 2003.“I had men working for me who were older than me and didn’t appreciate having to work for a woman who didn’t know anything about property. I won them over slowly, mostly by helping make their objectives clearer. One very senior guy who’d worked there for 22 years said the last two years were the most enjoyable because he’d been able to be so effective.”A little more than two years ago, she was approached by Jacey Graham to take part in the cross-mentoring programme. It was good timing. “I was feeling I’d like to stretch my wings.”After the session with Sir John has finished and we have left his office, I ask her why she is so determined to secure a non-executive post on a big company. “For two simple reasons,” she says. “One, because it will add to my skillset, and the other because I think I can make a contribution. I once spoke to a headhunter who said there are two types of non-executives, one after money, and the other after influence. He said: I think you’re after influence.”Not everyone likes the idea of the mentoring programme. Some female observers have raised concerns that it is a bunch of male big shots talking down to women about the best way to make progress. Wheaton’s view is that it would be good if more female non-executives were involved as well, but that women have to take advantage of what is on offer. “We’re going to have to be mentored by men until more women are in these positions.”Does she believe the programme will result in a rebalancing of Britain’s boards? “I don’t think it’s the whole answer,” she says, before heading off into the busy traffic for her next meeting. “But it’s an important piece of the puzzle.”"
827;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-10-06T09:45:51Z;Routes to the top: Follow the money;;"When PepsiCo named Indra Nooyi - a woman, born in India, who still routinely wears a sari and who used to front an all-female rock band - as its chief executive-designate in August, it was always going to draw comment. “Ms Nooyi will become the world’s most important female chief executive,” said The Economist.Not much was written, though, about her chosen route to the top. Before she became chief executive, Nooyi was the president and chief financial officer of the soft drinks and food company - and this despite the fact that she is not a professional accountant. Her undergraduate degree, from Madras Christian College in India, was in chemistry, physics and maths; she earned a master’s in finance and marketing from the Indian Institute of Management in Calcutta; and she also holds a master’s in public and private management from the Yale School of Management. Her progress to the boardroom of PepsiCo was via several other positions (including at Asea Brown Boveri and Motorola, on whose board she still sits), and a stint in management consultancy.This career route is less unusual than may be thought. As the finance director of Lloyds TSB, Helen Weir is arguably Britain’s most powerful female chief financial officer. Like Nooyi, she has an undergraduate degree in maths (in her case from Oxford), and a postgraduate degree in management (an MBA from Stanford), plus a management accountancy qualification from her time at Unilever. All of which no doubt helps when you are managing the finances of a bank capitalised at ₤30bn.In another striking similarity to the new PepsiCo chief executive, Weir spent her early career in management consultancy, with McKinsey. Wanting to move from her advisory role into a management position within a company, she put her hand up for a job at the DIY retailer B&Q, as finance director of its new warehouse division. From there it was a swift move to B&Q’s overall finance director, and subsequently to group finance director of Kingfisher, which was at that time B&Q’s parent company and a FTSE 100 constituent.Perhaps inevitably Weir has, just like Nooyi, been held up as a role model for women. She sees how her success may help spur on more women to the boardroom door, saying in an interview with The Times last month that: “It’s important to encourage women to think that you can make it into a senior role in the organisation.” It seems the gender issue, however, has hardly crossed her mind: “No one’s treated me differently because of it,” she said, “and frankly I don’t think they’d get away with it.” This is not a surprising view from a woman described recently by a financial analyst as “no shrinking violet” and as having “a warrior quality”.Last month Weir won the Harper’s Bazaar/Chanel Businesswoman of the Year award, an honour bestowed on women who have made it up the corporate ladder and into the highest echelons of business life. Now in its fourth year, the award has previously gone to Bibiana “Bibie” Boerio at Ford, Vivienne Cox at BP, and Sian Westerman at N.M. Rothschild. In all four cases the winners have strong financial pedigrees. Boerio, currently managing director of Jaguar and a long-serving Ford staff member, has held several finance positions, including Ford’s director of strategy and finance for international operations, and executive vice-president and chief financial officer of Ford Credit, as well as being parachuted previously into Jaguar as director of finance when it was first acquired by Ford.Cox, executive vice-president of gas, power and renewables, and integrated supply and trading - a part of BP that, were it separately listed, would be a FTSE 100 constituent in its own right - is the only female member of BP’s executive committee. Her undergraduate degree (like Weir’s, from Oxford, and, like part of Nooyi’s, in chemistry) was followed by a masters in the same subject. It led her to BP, where she moved into its finance function very early on, becoming part of the team that masterminded the privatisation of the company.Sian Westerman, a law graduate from Birmingham University who qualified as a solicitor with Slaughter & May, chose early to switch career to corporate finance, and was the first female investment banker in N.M. Rothschild’s London office.Lucy Yeomans, the editor of Harper’s Bazaar and chairman of the award’s judging panel, says that while there has never been a conscious effort by the judges to prefer women with a background in finance, she was not surprised when the coincidence was pointed out. “Financial skills are an essential business tool, and all these women have succeeded in business to a degree that would be the envy of anyone, male or female.”It would be a strong bet to say that, when making their decision about Nooyi, the directors of PepsiCo would have been favourably impressed by her knowledge of the company and her ability to understand its every facet: her job as president and chief financial officer was described as being responsible for “all of PepsiCo’s corporate functions, including finance, strategy, business process optimisation, corporate platforms and innovation, procurement, investor relations and information technology”.Kathleen O’Donovan, a former FTSE 100 finance director who used to hold a non-executive position at the Bank of England and now performs the same role at several of the UK’s largest companies, believes that finance can help women reach the top, particularly because of the overall business view that it delivers. “Finance as a career route has two big advantages,” she says. “It’s technical, so if you know your stuff you can establish credibility quickly; more importantly, it pervades all aspects of an organisation’s activities, so it really is ‘access all areas’. While this can apply to both men and women, the significance of credibility and access for women making their way in hitherto male-dominated organisations should not be underestimated.”Jeremy Rickman of Russell Reynolds is a respected head-hunter who specialises in finding talented chief financial officers for some of Europe’s most successful companies. Rickman, himself a chartered accountant and former finance director, says that the quality of the female candidates he sees keeps rising. “More and more women are making their mark as finance directors, and I would expect this to continue,” he says. Russell Reynolds also has a strong board practice that searches for chief executives, and Rickman is well aware that the financial officers he finds today are very likely to move to the top job in the future. “If you look at some of Britain’s most successful chief executives, male or female, many of them have held finance posts along the way.”Certainly that is what is expected of Helen Weir, who on winning her award was tipped by The Times as “almost certain to become one of the FTSE’s few female chief executives”. Liz Airey, the former finance director of Monument Oil & Gas and now, like O’Donovan, a multiple operator with positions that include senior independent non-executive director at Amec and non-executive chairman of technology company Zetex, says finance can be a stepping stone for a variety of careers, including that of chief executive. “The right individuals will be easily able to make the transition from the chief financial to the chief executive role, but even if you don’t want to do that it opens such a wide range of career options in either the public or private sector. In my case it has enabled me to develop the plural career that I now have.”In the UK, the woman with the most high-profile plural career, as cited by the Cranfield “Female FTSE Index”, is 53-year-old Alison Carnwath. Aspirant female non-executive directors can take heart: Carnwath’s undergraduate degree is not in maths or chemistry, but in German and economics, and she didn’t go to Oxford or Cambridge, but to the reassuringly redbrick University of Reading. Also, she has never worked in management consultancy and does not have an MBA. However, Carnwath did qualify as a chartered accountant with Peat Marwick Mitchell, becoming an investment banker in 1980. She spent 20 years building that part of her career before resigning to take up directorships that currently include Land Securities, Friends Provident, Gallaher and Man Group - all FTSE 100 constituents.Elsewhere in Europe, the same pattern emerges. Many of the women playing a role on supervisory boards of companies in the FTSEurofirst 300 have finance backgrounds and/or qualifications, and quite a few have legal qualifications. Julius Baer Holdings has one of each - Beatrice Speiser is a prominent Basle lawyer, while Monika Ribar, a former KPMG employee, has worked in the finance function at the quoted logistics company Panalpina since 1991, making chief financial officer as it went public in 2005. Ribar is of particular note because on October 1, the same day that Nooyi took over at PepsiCo, she became chief executive at Panalpina. In an interview with the Swiss online journal Moneycab at the time her appointment was announced, Ribar claimed that her career had not been planned. The decision to focus on finance had been one of natural inclination, rather than the conscious decision that it was for Weir and Nooyi: “I like reading figures and interpreting them,” she said.It was not surprising, then, to learn that when Kinnevik (the Swedish conglomerate whose largest shareholder is the Stenbeck family) had to replace its chief executive this year, it did so with Mia Brunell, previously chief financial officer of Modern Times Group, a Kinnevik portfolio company in the entertainment sector that is listed on the Swedish stock exchange. And what should we expect in the future from Ghislaine Mattlinger, appointed chief financial officer at PagesJaunes in February this year, and at 38 one of the youngest financial officers in the FTSEurofirst 300? No doubt she will be making chief executive at some point, there or elsewhere. She, too, doesn’t lack role models in France - Patricia Barbizet, now the vice-chairman and director of PPR, and with a place on several other boards besides, built her career in finance from the treasury function in Renault, via being chief financial officer of Renault Credit and chief financial officer of the Pinault Group.Commentators regularly complain about what they perceive to be the lack of female representation in the boardrooms of Europe. Both the Cranfield “Female FTSE Index”, and Women on Boards: Moving Beyond Tokenism, published by the European Professional Women’s Network, give the impression that the glass ceiling is thicker than ever. They both express concern about the “pipeline” of senior women managers, and stress the need for women to get out and network more, both internally and externally.Finance is the obvious answer to both these challenges. Indeed, there are increasing numbers of women choosing to study for formal financial and legal qualifications. While the proportion of female members of the six chartered accountancy bodies worldwide inched up between 1999 and 2004 from 22 per cent to 27 per cent, according to the Financial Reporting Council, it is more encouraging to look at the statistics covering recent entrants to the profession. Between 2000 and 2005, the proportion of women qualifying in the Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales rose from 38 per cent to 42 per cent.In any event, finance positions in companies provide opportunities for both internal networking (every part of the business, as Donovan points out, has to be involved with finance) and external (plenty of chances to meet investment bankers). Helen Weir endorses the view that a professional qualification will aid ambitious women: “Every senior manager I know is very comfortable with numbers - they can look at a profit and loss account or balance sheet and understand what it’s saying. Having that capability is a very important prerequisite for making it to the top of a business. Not all executives have a professional finance qualification, but I think it’s a great place to start.”Of course, not every woman who ends up as the chief executive of a public company has started life as an accountant or a lawyer, and some of them have deliberately chosen not to take that route. Belinda Earl, who was appointed chief executive of Debenhams at the age of 38 and is now the chief executive of Jaeger, studied economics at university but turned down a training contract at Arthur Andersen to take up a place on the Harrods graduate training scheme instead. Two years later, in 1985, she moved to Debenhams, working her way up through the ranks to take charge of merchandising and trading, and finally the whole company.Earl sees no shortage of talented women in her current company and takes heart from the quality of those coming through. “There is no shortage of talented females in Jaeger.” But even she stresses the importance of a good grounding in finance. “I would encourage individuals who are keen to climb the corporate ladder to gain not only an appreciation of, but really a full grounding in finance, not just the standard balance sheet, or profit and loss, but a complete awareness of business levers. Retailing, from running a store through to buying and merchandising a product area, requires all of these skills.”The overall lesson seems to be that if you are a woman and you want to make it in the corporate world, go out and get yourself a career in finance.And what about the future? The women to watch are Weir, Mattlinger - and Naina Lal Kidwai. A non-executive director at Nestle, Kidwai has all the qualities of a future chief executive of a significant company. Since February this year she has been chief executive of HSBC in India, a business of some size in its own right. And look at her pedigree - not yet 50, she was born in India, got an undergraduate degree in economics, qualified with Price Waterhouse Cooper in 1980, and has since pursued a 25-year career in banking - interrupted only by taking two years off to become the first woman from India to get an MBA from Harvard. Could she be the next chief executive of HSBC?Nooyi’s appointment may be drawing lots of comment now, but she should enjoy her time in the sun - there are plenty of others coming up behind."
828;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-10-01T21:04:36Z;Permira abandons Britvic offer;;Permira, the private equity group, on Sunday abandoned at the last minute a planned takeover offer for Britvic, the soft drinks maker that floated last year.Permira said it did not intend to make an offer for the drinks group but reserved the right to bid in the next six months if it gained approval from management, or another bidder emerged.The reasons behind Permira’s decision to abort its takeover plans remained unclear Sunday night. The group has built up a 2.8 per cent stake in Britvic and had been expected to table an offer on Monday. It was expected to put a price tag on Britvic of up to £600m: a 20 per cent premium to the current market capitalisation.The statement from Permira followed weekend speculation that a bid was imminent.A Britvic representative thought the private equity company may have been deterred by positive reaction to a trading statement on Friday. The group’s shares, listed last year at 230p, rose above the flotation price for the first time in six months, closing up 5 per cent at 231¾p.Britvic, which sells brands including Pepsi, 7UP and Tango, signalled that trading had improved after a tough start.The group had seen demand for its fizzy drinks dry up as health-conscious consumers ditched them in favour of fruit juices and water.The company issued its third profits warning in three months in May and reported a sharp drop in interim profits.But Britvic said on Friday that the hot summer and new products such as mineral and fruit-flavoured water brands had helped sales rebound. Britvic has been subject to takeover speculation in recent months.PAI Partners, the French private equity group, was understood to be looking at the group.A potential stumbling block is that any deal would require the support of PepsiCo, which holds a 5 per cent stake in Britvic.
829;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:23:06+0000;Indian state lifts ban on Coke and Pepsi;;Coca-Cola and PepsiCo on Friday won a significant legal victory when a court in the Indian state of Kerala lifted the Communist government’s ban on the sale and manufacture of the iconic drinks following a revival of a long-running pesticide scare.The court’s judgment will have a far-reaching impact for two companies, as they still face partial bans, notably in schools, hospitals and other government buildings, in six other states. It will also help allay concerns of foreign investors.The two firms had told the Kerala court in a petition that the ban was unconstitutional and produced studies asserting that their products were safe to consume. Lawyers for the Kerala government had argued the ban was justified to protect consumers.Coca-Cola welcomed the judgment. “We are gratified that High Court of Kerala has set aside the illegal orders of the Government of Kerala,” it said. “We will immediately take necessary steps to make Coca-Cola available across the state of Kerala.”Marketing consultants say the two US companies have been victims of “populist brand-trashing” at the hands of politicians adept at whipping up hostility to western multinationals and opportunistic campaigning tactics by non-governmental organisations.The long-running controversy over “pesticolas” began in 2003 when the Centre for Science and the Environment, a Delhi-based NGO campaigning against contaminated groundwater, highlighted dangerous levels of residual pesticides in well-known soft drinks brands.The controversy re-ignited this summer when the CSE published new findings showing that colas continued to contain more pesticide than would be permitted under Indian food safety standards that were finalised this year but have yet to come into force.At around $1.29bn, annual sales of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo products in India account for only a minuscule part of their global business but the CSE report and state bans have cut into local sales and hurt their reputation among many consumers.In a study funded by Coca-Cola, scientists from the Central Science Laboratory, an executive agency of the UK’s Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, said they detected none of the pesticides found by a New Delhi-based NGO.Frank Lavin, US undersecretary for international trade, had warned that the bans, which he said smacked of unfair treatment of foreign companies, would damage FDI inflows at a time when India was “working hard to attract and retain foreign investment.“

Kerala’s literacy rate soared above 90 per cent in 2001 from 55 per cent in 1961, compared with around 65 per cent for India as a whole.“Kerala may be a small state but it is a key target market for us, just as it is for any other company operating in India,” said Rohit Kumar, public sector country manager for Microsoft India. “We respect the choices of our customers but believe that we offer products at very affordable prices to educational institutions.”Sanjiv Kataria, a consultant to the IT industry, said Kerala’s promotion of open source software was as much driven by a shortage of funds as by ideological antipathy to Microsoft.“The state is starved of cash and the alternative is to delay the push into computer-aided education.”Executives at Microsoft, which has been trying to clamp down on rampant piracy in India, said there was now “no meaningful difference” in price between the products it sold to schools and colleges and free software. It sells Windows XP Pro to educational institutions at $25-$30 per personal computer, Mr Kumar said.Education is a vital market for Microsoft India, in a country which has set it-
self the target of training 200,000 teachers and 10m students over the next five years.Ravi Venkatesan, chairman of Microsoft India, says there is a “large opportunity for entrepreneurs who crack the code on how to get a small share” of education spending in India."
831;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
832;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Forget the salary, look at the ego;;Note to Indra Nooyi and Jeffrey Kindler: keep your picture in your annual report small and the use of the pronoun “I” to a minimum.With their companies in a state of transition, the freshly minted chief executives of food and drinks group PepsiCo and Pfizer, the drug maker, may not devote too much attention to the size of their mugshot or the beginning of their sentences. But such details can offer investors a rare and somewhat disturbing glimpse into a CEO’s psyche and their company’s future – at least according to a new study into the narcissistic tendencies of corporate America by Arijit Chatterjee and Donald C. Hambrick of Pennsylvania State University*.Their findings – presented at this week’s annual meeting of the Academy of Management in Atlanta – start from an observation that is obvious to anyone who has ever dealt with CEOs: their egos are bigger than most. But the study goes further, linking the level of their self-absorption to their companies’ strategies and performance.That is where the size of annual report pictures and prominence of personal pronouns come in. By looking at such “variables”, as well as the length of a CEO’s entry in Who’s Who and their pay, the academics argue that the corporate chieftains with supersized egos favour grandiose and higher-risk strategies.Such CEOs often eschew mundane tasks such as cost control, market analysis and people management, in favour of big-bang moves such as acquisitions, large-scale product launches and aggressive international expansion. In sporting terms, they can hit big but they can also miss big.The link between a CEO’s ego and extreme company performance has intuitive appeal. Would General Electric have launched a blockbuster bid for its rival Honeywell and fought an acrimonious and ultimately doomed battle with antitrust regulators over it without Jack Welch at the helm? Could the merger between AOL and Time Warner have turned out differently without the presence of Ted Turner – who once allegedly remarked: “If I only had a little humility, I’d be perfect” – as the enlarged group’s biggest single shareholder?How many people remember that Dennis Kozlowski was known to the business world as “Deal-a-Day-Dennis” before the sobriquet changed to the “disgraced former Tyco chief executive”? Indeed, recent corporate excesses were arguably driven by executives’ narcissistic belief that they were so powerful they could doctor the books and get away with it, or so valuable to the company that they deserved a $6,000 shower curtain.In a post-Enron era that has led legislators and watchdogs to codify external scrutiny of management into an array of audits and financial metrics, a CEO’s mind and vision may be the variables that got away. The problem is that one man’s egomaniac is another’s visionary and investors have no way of precisely gauging a CEO’s vision or weighing up their egos. When it comes to drawing the line between those two overlapping and contrasting leadership qualities, academic methods are of limited help.Photos of Carlos Ghosn, superstar CEO of both France’s Renault and Japan’s Nissan, feature prominently in those companies’ annual reports (French sleeves rolled up in the former, straight-backed as if about to bow in the latter). But it would be a brave investor who classified him as a narcissist rather than a visionary.It is up to the boards to step into this knowledge breach, armed with the confidence that keeping in check the hubris of their number one guy (or gal) is as important as ticking boxes on the Sarbanes-Oxley spreadsheet – especially at a stage of the business cycle when bold moves may be penalised. With the US and global economies slowing down, geopolitical conflagrations spreading and commodities’ prices stubbornly high, this seems no time for Bhags – the “big hairy audacious goals” popularised by Dick Snell, boss of the engineering group Federal Mogul in the heady 1990s.The gloomy business outlooks from icons such as Wal-Mart, the anaemic results of fading stars such as Yahoo and the chronic underperformance of a bellwether stock like GE all point in the same direction: profit growth and new opportunities are hard to come by for established players in developed economies. Similarly, unexpected mishaps at companies long admired for their strategic prowess – BP, Apple, Dell – suggest that being the darlings of management consultants is no protection against operational pitfalls.This business equivalent of the fin de siècle , with most participants aware of the coming end of a prosperous era but unable to predict its exact timing, calls for CEOs with steady nerves, a willingness to do the boring bits and downsizeable egos: more bashfulness and less Bhags.CEOs entranced by the allure of risky strategies and transformational takeovers should remember that in the Greek myth Narcissus wastes away, unable to avert his gaze from the pond reflecting his beautiful, and doomed, features.*It’s All About Me: Narcissistic CEOs and Their Effects on Company Strategy and PerformanceThe writer is the FT’s US business editor
833;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-08-25T13:44:50Z;Teenage kicks;;"“Parents, brace yourselves.” With those words, Oprah Winfrey introduced news of a teenage oral-sex craze in the US. In Atlantic Monthly, Caitlin Flanagan wrote “The moms in my set are convinced - they’re certain; they know for a fact - that all over the city, in the very best schools, in the nicest families, in the leafiest neighborhoods, 12- and 13-year-old girls are performing oral sex on as many boys as they can.”Are they right? National statistics on teen fellatio have only recently been collected, but the trend seems to be real. Professor Jonathan Zenilman, an expert in sexually transmitted infections at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, reports that both the adults and the teenagers who come to his clinic are engaging in much more oral sex than in 1990. For men as recipients it’s up from about half to 75-80 per cent; for women, it’s risen from about 25 per cent to 75-80 per cent.In some quarters that might be regarded as progress, but how you feel about it probably depends on whether you are a teenager or a parent of teenagers. I am neither but, as an economist, I feel uniquely qualified to opine on why it is happening.Schoolchildren are now bombarded with information about the risks of sex, particularly HIV/Aids. Oral sex can be safer than penetrative sex: it dramatically reduces the risk of contracting HIV and reduces the effects of some other sexually transmitted infections (although you can still pick up herpes, warts and thrush). An infection that might have made a girl infertile instead gives her a sore throat.The rest is basic economics. When the price of Coca-Cola rises, rational cola-lovers drink more Pepsi. When the price of penetrative sex rises, rational teenagers seek substitutes. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that even as the oral-sex epidemic rages, the Centre for Disease Control, a US government agency, reports that the percentage of teenage virgins has risen by more than 15 per cent since the beginning of the 1990s. Those who are still having sex have switched to using birth-control methods that will also protect them from sexually transmitted infections. Use of the contraceptive pill is down by nearly a fifth, but use of condoms is up by more than a third. The oral-sex epidemic is a rational response to a rise in the price of the alternative.Now this is a glib explanation. A real economist would want a tighter hypothesis and serious data to back it up. That economist might well be Thomas Stratmann, who with the law professor Jonathan Klick has pushed the idea of the rational teenage sex drive. Their hypothesis is that if teenagers really did think about the consequences of their actions, they would have less risky sex if the cost of risky sex went up. They discovered a very specific source of that higher risk: in some US states there are abortion-notification laws, which mean that teenagers can’t get an abortion without their parents being informed. If teenagers are rational, such laws would discourage risky sex amongst teens, relative to adults.Klick and Stratmann claim to have found evidence of exactly this. Wherever and whenever abortion-notification laws have been passed, gonorrhoea rates in the teenage and adult populations start to diverge. When it becomes more troublesome to get an abortion, teenagers seem to cut back on unprotected sex.This suggests that teenagers think that one of the most serious consequences of an unwanted pregnancy is that their parents will find out. If teenagers are avoiding unsafe sex, it may not be for the best reasons."
834;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-08-24T09:13:30Z;Rexam profit squeezed by aluminium;;"Rising aluminium and energy costs has hit margins at Rexam, although the packaging company is still investing $100m (£53m) on two new drinks can factories in Brazil and Russia.Good weather in the early summer months, along with the World Cup in Germany, boosted can sales in Europe.Rexam, which spends some £1bn a year on aluminium, has tried to mitigate the impact of an average 35 per cent increase in the cost of the metal in the first six months.Cost increases in the US are passed directly through to their customers, which include Coca-Cola and Pepsi.Rexam, however, has hedged the remaining third and largely European part of its aluminium spend for 2006.The company said it would start renegotiating contracts with ""our European customers later on this year"" for 2007, which is still only partially hedged.Margins were hit in the US after Rexam signed a less favourable contract with one of its biggest customers, widely believed to be Coca-Cola.Rexam said it wouldbuild a second Russian can-making factory in Chelyabinsk in the Urals.It is also opening a factory in Manaus, Brazil, in the middle of the Amazon rain forest, to make the can tops that are manufactured separately to the rest of a drinks can.The cost pressure on the world's largest maker of aluminium cans was masked by a £55m swing in its favour on exceptional items. That helped boost pre-tax profit to £170m (£119m) in the six months to June 30.Turnover rose 18 per cent to £1.85bn (£1.57bn).The interim dividend is up from 7.52p to 7.9p and earnings per share were 22.5p (13.3p), boosted by a lower-than-expected tax charge.Shares in Rexam rose 38½p to 549½p on Thursday.FT Comment*JPMorgan Cazenove summed up Rexam's interims neatly as ""a solid set of results delivered in spite of considerable cost headwinds"". Analysts are expected to tweak full-year forecasts because of the lower tax charge, leaving Rexam to deliver earnings per share of about 42p. This puts the shares on a forward multiple of just under 13, at a slight discount to its two US peers. That looks about right."
835;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;Transcript: Centre for Science and Environment;;"International Finance News, a Shanghai-based daily business newspaper owned by the People’s Daily Group and a partner newspaper of the Financial Times, has recently interviewed Shachi Chaturvedi, spokesman for the Centre for Science and Environment’s Media Resources Centre.The CSE, a Delhi-based non-government organisation, released a report on August 2 claiming sodas made by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo contained high levels of pesticides. The report has led to a ban on sodas made by the two companies in several Indian states.The following is an edited transcript of the interview.International Finance News: Why did CSE choose colas made by the two companies to do the study? How long did it take CSE to do the study?Shachi Chaturvedi: These two companies control the whole market for soft drinks in this country. Local brands like Campa, Limca, Thums Up have all been bought by these two companies. So there is actually no other company operating in the soft drinks sector.The study on pesticides in water and soft drinks started with the study on pesticides in packaged water in February 2003. After we released this study we received numerous mails and letters from consumers saying that if bottled water had pesticides, what about soft drinks. So we decided to check soft drinks and released the study in August 2003.After this study, the Parliament of India set up a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) to look into the matter. The JPC in February 2004 said that the CSE report was correct and directed the government to set standards for soft drinks in the country. The government established numerous committees to look into the “scientific” details of the matter. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), the authority that sets standards for all products in the country, did finalise standards for soft drinks after 20 meetings but the ministry of health and the soft drink companies blocked the standards form being legally notified and implemented. So it is status quo since then.We decided to check whether the products were meeting the proposed BIS standards and found that the brands of both the companies had 11.85 parts per billion of pesticides, 23 times higher than the proposed BIS standards.For a detailed chronology see the following link: http://www.cseindia.org/misc/cola-indepth/cola2006/events.htmIFN: What standards did CSE use for the study? Are they different from the standards used in the US or in the EU? As we all know, CSE is the only organisation to have released a report on pesticides contained by soft drinks. Do you think it is difficult for researchers in other countries to do similar studies?Shachi Chaturvedi: As I said above the BIS had finalised standards for soft drinks but had not been legally notified due to blocks by the soft drink companies and the ministry of health. So we decided to check whether these soft drink brands were meeting the proposed BIS standards.The US and the EU already have stringent standards for all products including soft drinks. These governments also regularly monitor whether companies are complying with these standards. The regulatory authorities in these countries are strong enough to fine and ban these products from the market if they do not comply with standards. In fact in the 1990’s Coca-Cola had to withdraw a complete batch from the markets in Denmark, when some people fell ill after consuming their products. In 2004, Coca-Cola withdrew its brand of bottled water, Dasani, from UK when the Food Standard Agency found that Dasani might have broken guidelines designed to protect shoppers from misleading marketing.However, unfortunately, in India we neither have stringent standards nor agencies competent enough to regulate standards for products. Even if we do have standards, monitoring is not regular. Moreover, MNC’s in India have acquired huge status and clout within the political circles and amongst the common people’s mind. Hence it is difficult to hold them accountable. In fact, most MNC’s have huge clout in almost all third world countries and hence flout norms blatantly.IFN: The cola companies said many products made in India contain much higher levels of pesticides than permitted levels for soft drinks. How do you comment on this?Shachi Chaturvedi: World-over standards are set based on the impact these pesticides can have on human health. First the amount of pesticide in the diet of the people is calculated. Then according to the diet of the people, it is decided how much pesticides people should be exposed. This is also based on the nutrition that people get from the diet.So other products, that the cola companies say have more pesticides than soft drinks, are vegetables, milk, water, fruits, and juices. These products are essential for human body. If they give you pesticides they also give you nutrition. That is why the standards set for them allow more pesticides in them because they are an essential part of the diet. But colas don’t give any nutrition and they are not part of our essential diet. Hence they should not be allowed any pesticide residues in them.Moreover, two wrongs don’t make a right. Yes a whole lot of other products in India are heavily contaminated with pesticides. But that doesn’t mean that colas can have pesticides in them. The pesticide contamination in all products, including colas, has to be minimized. The government has to set standards, including in colas. Consumers pay for these products and buy them because of the company’s guarantee of quality. Hence the company has to provide the consumers with safe products.The objective of the study is to reduce pesticides in our food and water, including soft drinks.IFN: India’s health minister said that committees had been set up to try to set limits for pesticide levels in carbonated beverages, fruits and vegetable fruits. In your opinion, how much space is there for the maximum residue limits to be lowered?Shachi Chaturvedi: India’s health minister, Anbumani Ramdoss, has been prevaricating the standard setting process. As you will read in the link provided above, there have already been 20 meetings of the Drinks and Carbonated Beverages Sectional Committee or FAD, 14 of the BIS, to set the standards for soft drinks. This committee consists of experts, representatives of the companies, consumer organisations and representatives from the government as well. This committee has already researched extensively on various aspects of standard setting. So we think there is no need for the ministry of health to set up more committees to fix standards. The standards have already been fixed by the BIS, they only need to be legally notified.IFN: It has been reported that Indian farmers use colas as pesticide. Is that true?Shachi Chaturvedi: In December 2004, there were reports of farmers mixing colas in pesticides to spray on their crops. Then in September 2005, there were reports of legislators in the state assembly demanding subsidy on cola drinks so that farmers can use them as pesticide on their farms. But there have been no reports after that.IFN: Some people said that their (the cola companies) actions in India have contributed to the depletion of local aquifers. How do you comment on it?Shachi Chaturvedi: There have been cases in Plachimada, Kerala, where a Coca-Cola plant was depleting the local aquifer by withdrawing huge amounts of water for producing soft drinks. The plant was set up in 2000 and within a year the groundwater started to decline. This lead to an acute drinking water crisis in the villages in the vicinity. The villagers started the agitation against the plant and forced the local administration body (Panchayat) to not renew the license to the company. The case went to the high court. Finally the plant has been shut down.Mehdiganj, a village 20km from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh faced similar problems. The agitation started there because the plant there was dumping its toxic sludge on agricultural fields rendering them infertile. But the most pressing problem was depletion of ground water by the company’s plant.In Kala Dera village, on the outskirts of Jaipur in Rajasthan, the same problem persists where the Coca-Cola plant is depleting groundwater, leading to severe water crisis in the villages around.IFN: PepsiCo’s advertisements mention levels of pesticides allowed by the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act under the health ministry. Does that mean soft drinks inevitably contain pesticides? Does this only happen in India or does it happen everywhere?Shachi Chaturvedi: The standards allowed by the health ministry are old and outdated. The standards just say that pesticides should be below detectable limits; there are no quantities set to it. As I said above, the BIS has already set standards and the government just needs to notify and implement them. Pesticides will be inevitable if the companies fail to clean up their product and the government continues to delay the setting of standards. Countries like US and EU already have standards and a monitoring system, through which they ensure that the soft drinks manufactured there are safe. But in most third world countries, there are no stringent standards hence pesticides will be there in the products.IFN: According to the study by CSE, do the pesticides in the soft drinks come from the local aquifers or from other raw materials?Shachi Chaturvedi: There are basically three ingredients in soft drinks – water, sugar, a secret formula. We know sugar is not the source of pesticides. In the meetings of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, the companies themselves had said that they treat their sugar with a hot carbon treatment process, which eliminates all impurities including pesticides. Moreover the government here had tested about 500 samples of sugar and said the same thing.The formula that the companies use is a secret and we don’t know what it consists of. There is a possibility that the pesticides are coming from groundwater, because of the indiscriminate use of pesticides in the country.IFN: How do soft drink makers, especially Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, package their sodas in India, in glass bottles or in plastic bottles?Shachi Chaturvedi: Soft drinks are available in both glass bottles and plastic bottled. They have a label that gives information about the bottling plant. In miniscule fonts they print information about the date of manufacture and that the product has caffeine. It also gives a short list of the ingredients.IFN: Some Indians have asked the cola companies to exit the Indian market. At the same time, the Western media considered it a form of economic patriotism. How do you comment on it?Shachi Chaturvedi: Ban from the market is not what CSE had asked for at anytime of our campaign. We want the government to set standards and ensure that the companies abide by these standards. At no point of time we said that the soft drinks should be banned. Our tirade has been against the government, because the government is delaying setting standards.The Indian consumer has a right to have a clean product. We are paying the companies for the soft drinks we consume. It is the companies’ responsibility to clean up their products. But more than that it is the government’s responsibility to ensure that the companies provide safe products to the consumers.IFN: What will be the next step by the CSE?Shachi Chaturvedi: Our next step will be to put pressure on the government to legalise the standards that have been set by the BIS and implement these standards. At a larger level, we want the government to minimize the amount of pesticides in all food products and regulate the use of pesticides by setting a pesticides policy. The government for now is just doing a knee-jerk reaction by banning the colas. Banning them is not the answer. Setting standards is."
836;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-08-23T10:44:18Z;India refutes claims of pesticide in sodas;;India’s health ministry has found no evidence of high levels of pesticides in Coca-Cola and PepsiCo soft drinks, refuting a report by a Delhi-based organisation that threw the country’s cola industry into disarray earlier this month.But the non-governmental organisation at the heart of the controversy, Centre for Science and Environment, has hit back saying the government “bats for cola companies”.The spat highlights India’s lack of regulation. Food standards finalised in March have still not been implemented. The political backlash against the US companies also has the potential to disrupt flows of US and other foreign investment to India.A quarter of India’s 28 states have imposed partial or total bans on Coke and Pepsi drinks since the CSE produced its report on August 2. The two companies, which have 60 per cent and 38 per cent of the market respectively, say they are victims of a campaign by opposition and leftwing parties to embarrass a Congress government for cultivating ties with the US.Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss told parliament late on Tuesday that an expert committee found CSE’s report flawed and its methods for testing colas inconsistent.A balanced approach “has not been followed while undertaking the scientific review”, the government report concluded.However, Sunita Narain, director of CSE, in a statement: “It is very unfortunate that the minister has decided to toe the company line,” said “The minister of health is clearly more concerned with industrial health – and not people’s health.”Communist-run Kerala, which has banned all production and sales, on Wednesday said it would not move to lift its ban.CSE’s report alleged that Coke and Pepsi soft drinks contained 27 times the amount of pesticide permissible under the food standards drawn up in March. It called on New Delhi to bring into force those standards, which were drawn up by the Bureau of Indian Standards after more than two years of consultation with industry.CSE alleges the standards’ introduction has been delayed by corporate lobbying.“The only thing we’re looking for is regulation,” Ms Narain told the Financial Times. “The companies and government are trying to derail the process.”Coca-Cola has agreed to meet CSE to discuss “how we together might further engage with the Ministry of Health to develop and finalise criteria for pesticides residues and the associated validated testing methodologies,” it wrote in a letter to the NGO last Wednesday.Three years ago, CSE issued a similar report saying colas contained high levels of pesticides based on EU benchmarks.Business industry groups have expressed “extreme dismay” over the turmoil caused by the CSE report and the pall it casts on foreign investment in India.
837;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-08-21T17:50:06Z;Another step on the path to IT’s top 10;;Almost a year ago LogicaCMG was approaching another big acquisition with some trepidation.That summer had seen a wave of protectionist rhetoric from French politicians worried that Pepsi was going to launch a bid for Danone, the flagship food group – not the ideal climate for Logica to go after Unilog, one of France’s leading technology companies.In the event, the fears of Martin Read and his team were unfounded. The logic of consolidation in the IT services sector was such that his €931m ($1.2bn) bid for Unilog was accepted by the target’s management and met with no stirrings of “economic patriotism” from the country’s government or media.The logic continues today. Multinational companies are keen to have fewer IT suppliers and want those that remain to be able to serve them cheaply and globally. Established western IT providers such as IBM, Accenture and Logica are also having to cope with the rise of low-cost Indian rivals.Wanting to play a key role in the consolidation, Logica has set a long-term target to become a top-10 IT services company. Monday’s announced acquisition consolidates it as Europe’s second-largest company in the sector by market value after CapGemini of France.Investors have not always supported the acquisition policy with unfettered enthusiasm. The company’s shares are below the level they were trading at this time last year and, although prone to intra-day volatility, they have remained stagnant over the past few years, underperforming CapGemini and Atos Origin, the other large European competitors.Mr Read was phlegmatic on Monday in the face of a 7.5 per cent fall in Logica’s share price. “It was inevitable with a deal like this that you would get a lot of hedge fund activity,” he said. He pointed out that the shares had fallen on news of the Unilog deal before recovering as integration proceeded.The more sceptical shareholders will now hope that the boundaries of the empire stay fixed for some time. “Investors tend not to forgive companies that overpay,” said Hans Slob, an analyst at Rabo Securities.But Mr Read is unflinching in his determination to enter the global top 10 of IT services companies, dominated by US heavyweights such as IBM. “We’ve been on a journey,” he said. “When I started with Logica 13 years ago there were 3,000 people. This will take it to 40,000.”The company’s issues are not all related to scale. In Germany, Logica has only recently started to turn a profit, helped by the integration of Unilog’s profitable business in the country. There is no obvious quick-fix takeover target that would speed up an improvement.Apart from high-end IT services in areas such as electricity trading and anti-money laundering for central banks, Logica also has a wireless division serving mobile phone operators, which many analysts fear does not make a good fit with the rest of the company and does not generate sufficient profits. Mr Read, though, is in no rush to sell.Mr Read sees the threat to Logica and the wider industry coming from India, where companies such as Tata Consulting and Infosys are already larger than their Anglo-Dutch rival.“It’s particularly refreshing to see a company like Logica expand beyond our shores,” said one person close to the deal yesterday. Observers are divided on whether this patriotic view makes sound business sense.
838;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-08-21T16:56:15Z;PepsiCo’s number cruncher must look beyond the figures;;Comment on this columnLipsmackin’. That was the market’s reaction to the announcement from PepsiCo last week that its current chief financial officer, Indra Nooyi, was to take over as chief executive from Steve Reinemund this October. Having served as CFO for the past five years, helping to steer PepsiCo’s strategic repositioning, Ms Nooyi seems well placed to take on the top job.This appointment ticks so many of the boxes scrutinised exhaustively by politically correct observers – and viewed with suspicion by professional sceptics – that the most important aspect of the news risks being overlooked.Yes, I have noticed: Ms Nooyi is a woman, now one of only 11 female CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. Nor has it escaped my attention that she is Indian, born in what was then Madras (now Chennai). At 50, she is at an age where some senior executives feel the hot breath of age discrimination at the back of their necks.What really matters about Ms Nooyi’s well-received promotion is that she has made the increasingly common move from the finance department to being in charge of the whole show. No longer sidelined as a mere “bean-counter”, the CFO or finance director is often seen as a quasi-deputy chief executive, in at the heart of all the big decisions, exercising a huge influence that reaches beyond the balance sheet. Companies as diverse as Southwest Airlines, International Paper, Harley-Davidson and Halliburton all have their former CFOs in place as CEO. Oracle’s chairman, Jeff Henley, was once its CFO. According to CFO magazine, as of last October almost one-fifth of Fortune 500 companies had a former CFO as CEO.The increased importance of the CFO role reflects the speed, volatility and sheer muscle of the investment community. In spite of ongoing unhappiness in boardrooms about the “tyranny” of quarterly reporting, no executive is under any illusion about the consequences of failing to hit the numbers. When a vacancy arises for a new chief executive, who better, shareholders might feel, than the person who has spent the past few years delivering on those financial targets?CFOs have often developed a sharp awareness of the risk factors that play out in different markets. They have been in the room listening to explanations when things have gone wrong. They are familiar with the sort of complexity global business brings with it today. “You don’t have to have been a CFO to make a good CEO”, the head of one of the UK’s “big four” accountancy firms tells me, “but it helps.”What is the downside here? There is clearly a danger that a former CFO will be tempted down the financial engineering route, too interested in the numbers and insufficiently sensitive to the broader needs of the organisation. Any narrowness of approach will hinder attempts to build lasting and sustainable growth.Mergers, disposals and acquisitions may well form an important part of a corporate strategy, but they are not a substitute for researching and developing new products, or investing in staff (who are, incidentally, people and not depreciating “assets”).But this is the good news about PepsiCo’s new boss. Ms Nooyi is – and this is not in any way meant to sound disrespectful – a bit of a fox. I mean she is a fox and not a hedgehog, according to the definition offered in the seventh century BC by the Greek poet and soldier Archilochus: “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.”Business leadership today calls for the fox’s agility and breadth of experience rather than the hauteur of the hedgehog. The best CFOs know this. Norman Lyle, until last year group finance director of Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong, explained it once in these terms: “The CFO will have to deal with ambiguity. Things are not black and white. To have sound business judgment means that they need to have a comprehensive understanding of the business they are operating in. They need a deep and broad knowledge. There can be no ivory towers any more. The CFOs have got to get out and talk to people.”This rather chimes with what my father has spent much of the past 30 years trying to tell me: that I should aim to be a “Jack of all trades, and master of one”. (I will save the letters editor some trouble by acknowledging that I clearly have more work to do on both sides of that last comma.)Finance must not become too mighty or too proud. As John Connors, former CFO at Microsoft, put it: “When I hear a strategic plan has come out of the finance function, I know that that is a stock to avoid.” Seeing the face of John Mayo, former finance director of GEC/Marconi, smiling out of a newspaper last week was a reminder that even the most highly regarded financial brains can get things terribly wrong if their grand vision is not tempered with realism and sound judgment.It is also worth pointing out that in 1999 CFO magazine’s “most creative financial officer of the year” award went to Enron’s Andrew Fastow – who was not, incidentally, a certified public accountant, any more than the similarly scandal-hit Ahold’s former CFO Michiel Meurs was.As everyone knows, it takes two men to fill the gap left by one good woman. That is what is happening at PepsiCo, with Indra Nooyi’s former responsibilities being taken up by two male colleagues. Perhaps for once the uniformly positive market reaction is well founded. This is one CFO who knows what the numbers mean, but understands that they can never tell the whole story.Comment on this columnstefan.stern@ft.com
839;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Key challenge awaits new Pepsi chief Nooyi;;Indra Nooyi, chief executive-elect of PepsiCo, attributes her success to the fact that, as an India-born woman, she has always had to work harder than others to progress in corporate America.Something similar could be said about the group she is about to take control of.As the junior partner in one of the world’s fiercest business rivalries, PepsiCo has spent decades fighting for an advantage over Coca-Cola.Just as Ms Nooyi eventually reached the top of the corporate ladder, PepsiCo’s efforts have also been rewarded.Last December, its market capitalisation overtook Coke’s for the first time, signalling a shift in power between the cola giants.PepsiCo has been outperforming Coke for the past several years as its diversified portfolio of beverages and snacks has proved more robust than its rival’s cola-dominated business.“I’m extremely fortunate to be assuming my new role at a time when PepsiCo is in such a terrific position,” Ms Nooyi said, following her appointment this week to replace Steve Reinemund, who is retiring.“Our businesses are performing well and under Steve’s leadership we have constructed a very solid strategic foundation.”But, having seen Coke’s fortunes decline so rapidly from the height of its powers in the 1990s, Ms Nooyi knows that in the Cola War, the biggest enemy is complacency.With investors accustomed to the strong growth and steady management delivered by Mr Reinemund – net profits grew by 70 per cent during his five years in charge – Ms Nooyi’s ability to surprise Wall Street lies mostly on the downside.Analysts seem convinced that she will maintain the momentum, reassured by her central role in the group’s recent success as chief financial officer and de-facto deputy to Mr Reinemund.Bill Pecoriello of Morgan Stanley said he had the “utmost confidence” in Ms Nooyi to “lead the organisation into many more years of solid performance”.Ms Nooyi has not yet spoken publicly about her plans but she is expected to remain faithful to current strategy, which she helped shape.PepsiCo was built around the twin pillars of its two main brands: Pepsi-Cola soft drinks and Frito-Lay salty snacks. But the group recognised in the late 1990s that both its flagship brands were on the wrong side of the shift by consumers towards healthier products.In response, PepsiCo launched a wave of innovation and acquisitions designed to broaden its portfolio and improve its health profile.First came the acquisition of Tropicana, the fruit juice brand. Then, in 2000, the group bought Quaker Oats, maker of cereal and Gatorade sports drink, after its proposed merger with Coke collapsed.More recently, Frito-Lay has focused on low-fat products, such as baked crisps, while Quaker cereal and rice bars have reduced dependence on salty snacks.Mr Reinemund launched a voluntary labelling system to identify healthier brands and ordered that at least half of all investment in innovation and advertising must be focused on healthy products.Analysts cite PepsiCo’s speedier response to changing consumer habits as one of the main reasons for its outperformance of Coke, which still relies on fizzy drinks for 80 per cent of sales.But Tom Pirko, president of BevMark, a beverage consultancy, says Ms Nooyi must do more. “PepsiCo is still too reliant on sugar and fat.”Arguably Mr Reinemund’s greatest legacy is the group’s fast-growing international business. PepsiCo traditionally focused on the domestic market, with only a third of revenues coming from outside the US compared with 70 per cent of Coke’s. But surging sales in emerging markets have become the strongest source of growth.Ms Nooyi – the group’s first foreign-born chief executive – is likely to sharpen the focus on international expansion. One of her biggest decisions will be whether PepsiCo needs to make another large acquisition.An obvious target would be Danone, the French maker of yoghurts and Evian bottled water, which would strengthen the group’s international presence and bolster its range of healthy products.Pepsi considered a bid last year before being scared away by opposition from French politicians. Could Ms Nooyi, known for her tough character and bold deal-making, try again?
840;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-08-16T00:43:35Z;Indian-born Pepsi CFO takes helm;;Steve Reinemund, the man who has led PepsiCo through one of the most successful periods in its history, is to retire, clearing the way for Indra Nooyi, the group’s Indian-born chief financial officer, to replace him as chief executive.Mr Reinemund’s decision to step down came sooner than investors had expected but Ms Nooyi had long been viewed as his natural successor, having played a central role in the group’s restructuring over the past decade.Her promotion will cement Ms Nooyi’s status as one of the most powerful foreign-born women in corporate America and remove the risk of her being poached by a rival company.“Having worked side-by-side with Indra for many years, I am convinced she is more than qualified and clearly ready for her new role leading PepsiCo,” said Mr Reinemund.Ms Nooyi, 50, will become only the fifth chief executive in the group’s 41-year history when she takes the job in October. Mr Reinemund, who will remain chairman until next May, said he was retiring to spend more time with his family.“We do not believe that the transition presents any risks or signals any problems at PepsiCo,” said Caroline Levy, analyst at UBS. “Investors have been speculating for years about when Ms Nooyi may step into the top role.”During Mr Reinemund’s five years at the helm, PepsiCo’s net profits grew by 70 per cent and its share price increased by more than half – taking the group’s market capitalisation above that of its rival Coca-Cola for the first time.Analysts praised Mr Reinemund for embracing the shift by consumers towards healthier food and drinks, in spite of the threat it posed to the group’s flagship cola and Frito-Lay snack business.PepsiCo has diversified into a range of healthier beverages, including Gatorade and Tropicana, and added more nutritious and low-fat products to its snack portfolio.But Mr Reinemund’s greatest legacy is arguably his strengthening of PepsiCo’s international business, which was once the US group’s weakest link but is now its largest and fastest-growing division.The appointment of an Indian-born chief executive could improve sentiment towards PepsiCo in India, where the group’s soft drinks been banned in many states following a contamination scare.But PepsiCo said planning for the succession had been under way for months and the timing of the announcement was a coincidence.
841;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-08-14T20:55:45Z;PepsiCo;;Pepsi drinkers were once encouraged to embrace the “choice of a new generation”. Investors now seem ready to do exactly that with the appointment of Indra Nooyi as PepsiCo’s new chief executive. In her 12 years with the company, Ms Nooyi has been instrumental in redirecting Pepsi’s resources towards high-growth areas, such as sports drinks and low-fat snacks. This helped contain investor disappointment about the slightly premature departure of Steve Reinemund after just five very successful years in the top job.Much of this is down to teamwork. Shares in Pepsi, the traditional underdog when it comes to carbonated soft-drinks, have consistently beaten those of arch-rival Coca-Cola for almost a decade. Although the snacks and drinks maker occasionally raised eyebrows by paying full prices for acquisitions, its move towards healthier products has paid off handsomely.Pepsi also spotted the potential for hiring people from more diverse backgrounds earlier than most companies. Recent executive departures highlight that it has done well in fostering internal talent, people who are highly employable elsewhere. Having grown up in India, Ms Nooyi epitomises that early emphasis on trying to be truly global. This may prove helpful, for example, in India given recent populist concerns.With Pepsi’s strength now well understood, Coke stepping up the pressure and Pepsi’s shares trading at 21 times prospective earnings, Ms Nooyi may struggle to provide much of a fizz for its stock soon. As one of the world’s highest-profile women chief executives, she is also likely to attract a great deal of attention in the event of any mis-steps. Given the rise of women within many companies over the past decade, however, others are bound to follow swiftly.
842;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-08-14T17:23:55Z;UK agency gives all-clear to Indian Coke;;A UK government agency has become embroiled in Coca-Cola’s battle to defend its consumer franchise in India against allegations its flagship drink contains 27 times the maximum amount of pesticide permissible under new standards.In a study funded by Coca-Cola, scientists from the Central Science Laboratory, an executive agency of the UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, on Monday said they had detected none of the pesticides found by a New Delhi-based non-governmental association.The Indian soft drinks industry, dominated by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, has been thrown into turmoil by claims from the Centre for Science and the Environment that locally made colas contain on average 24 times maximum levels of pesticides. “We are pleased to say we detected no residues of the four pesticides allegedly found in the products by the CSE,” said Prof John Gilbert, science director at the CSL, at a press conference in New Delhi.One-quarter of India’s states have imposed partial or total bans since the CSE produced its report on August 2 in a backlash against the two multinationals that has taken on political overtones. Communist-run Kerala has banned production and sale altogether.“When India is working hard to attract and retain foreign investment, it would be unfortunate if the discussion were dominated by those who did not want to treat foreign companies fairly,” said Frank Lavin, the US undersecretary for international trade.The CSE said that raising the threat of stopping foreign direct investment was “a shameful act” of desperation.“This is a case of how large and powerful corporations are misusing their power to pressurise our government.”It called on the Indian government to bring into force new standards that were finalised in March after more than two years of consultations with industry but whose introduction, it alleges, has been delayed by corporate lobbying.The CSE accused the UK laboratory of bias in using samples provided by Coca-Cola, rather than ones bought in the market, and alleged that Coke’s decision to rely on a foreign laboratory to test its products was patronising and racist.“We work for a variety of different customers and are an objective source of information,” said Alison Wilson, agency-co-ordinator of the CSL. “We ensure that results are done to the best possible standard and let them speak for themselves.”Neither Coke nor the CSL would disclose the sum paid to the CSL, except to say the work was undertaken on commercial terms.
843;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Coke and Pepsi canned;;Many more Indians will soon go thirsty if the bans on the products of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which together hold a near-total monopoly of the Indian fizzy drinks market, spread much further. Already a quarter of India’s 28 states have banned the sale – and Kerala has also stopped the manufacture – of Coke and Pepsi products on the grounds that they use water contaminated with pesticides. So far the US companies are losing the public relations battle with local non-governmental organisations and populist politicians whose efforts could disrupt flows of foreign, especially US, investment to India.That much of India’s groundwater is contaminated will come as no surprise. Its green revolution left farmers very dependent on pesticides. But the evidence on precisely how the purity of Coke and Pepsi products in India relate to local or international standards has been very confusing. The Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, which commissioned the tests on the US companies’ products, says their cola drinks contain pesticide residues that are 24 times higher than those permitted under new standards. However, these standards are not yet in force. For their part, the US companies say they comply with “stringent international norms”, including those required by the European Union, and “applicable national regulations”, clearly meaning those still in effect in India.Coke and Pepsi are sticking to their guns, though they must be very aware of the damage this kind of row can do to their brands, as Perrier, the French bottled water company, found in 1990 when it eventually had to admit the presence of benzene in products that had to be recalled from around the world.One reason for standing firm is the increasingly political overtones surrounding this case. For it is striking that most of the states banning the US companies’ products are controlled by communist or opposition parties. They have every incentive to embarrass the Congress-led government about its cultivation of closer ties with the US, particularly on the two countries’ proposed nuclear co-operation deal that opponents claim sacrifices India’s political autonomy. But the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry yesterday warned the sales bans could damage the country’s ability to attract foreign investment, and specifically asked Kerala to review its peremptory ban on production.Coke, for one, is famously sensitive about revealing the ingredients of its products, as India’s supreme court has ordered it and Pepsi to do. But the US companies clearly need to produce some independent test results for their products fast or risk losing their huge Indian market. As for Indian NGOs, they are right to attract attention to their country’s basic water problems, but wrong to drag company brands through the mud in the process.
844;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-08-10T16:53:03Z;Coke and Pepsi bans extended in India;;A quarter of India’s 28 states have announced partial or total bans on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in the wake of fresh concerns over pesticide levels in soft drinks.More bans are expected in the coming days in a political backlash against the US companies that has the potential to disrupt flows of US and other foreign investment to India.The US has urged Manmohan Singh, India’s prime minister, to take the lead in resolving the crisis, according to one person close to the situation. “There’s been government contact and there’s going to be more government contact because the potential impact this could have on the investment climate is very serious,” he said. “These are world class and symbolic US companies getting kicked”.Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, two southern states, on Thursday joined Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh in banning the sale of Coca-Cola and Pepsi products in and around publicly funded schools and government offices.Kerala, a southern stronghold of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), on Wednesday became the first state to impose a total ban on the making and selling of the cola majors’ products.“We have decided to ban the production and distribution of Coca-Cola and Pepsi with immediate effect,” said Kerala’s newly-elected chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, an 83-year-old Communist Party of India (Marxist) stalwart.Kerala is also expected to withdraw operating licences from Coca-Cola’s Plachimada plant, closed by village council order since 2004, and Pepsi’s plant at Kanjikode, where the companies have been producing the Kinley and Aquafina water brands.Kerala currently accounts for about 5 per cent of the 500m cases of soft drinks sold annually in India. The state once represented nearly 10 per cent of the $1.6bn market before a controversial 2004 campaign in 2004 against water depletion in the village of Plachimada brought down sales.The states acted after a Delhi-based NGO, the Centre for Science and the Environment, last week released a report showing Indian colas contain on average 24 times permitted pesticide levels.But the two companies say they are victims of a campaign by opposition and leftwing parties to embarrass a Congress government for cultivating close ties with the US.Industry analysts said most Coke and Pepsi products are consumed in India’s biggest cities – Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai – which have yet to be directly affected by the bans.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have run advertisements in newspapers insisting their products are safe and conform to global as well as Indian standards, but have otherwise refused to comment on what they say is an industry-wide matter.Coke, which returned to India in 1993 after being forced out in the late 1970s, has 60 per cent of the domestic market, compared to 38 per cent for Pepsi and 2 per cent for local producers.Both companies argue their colas contain insignificant levels of pesticides – present in the groundwater used in soft drinks – compared to those found in milk, eggs and most meats.B. Prabhakar, president of the Indo-US Chamber of Commerce, said the bans will “send the wrong signal to companies thinking about investing in India”.The Confederation of Indian Industry warned on Thursday night that the bans would do great damage to India’s image and credibility with international investors.“We are a law-abiding country and government actions have to be driven by the rule of law and in the overall public interest,” said R. Seshasayee, the confederation’s CII president.
845;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Aramark board agrees $6.3bn buyout;;Aramark’s board on Tuesday agreed to a sweetened $6.3bn management buyout of the US food-service group, five years after it was taken public by Joseph Neubauer, chairman and chief executive.Philadelphia-based Aramark is expected to generate revenues of around $11.6bn this year, with two-thirds generated from food and beverage sales at schools, hospitals and sports stadiums.The company also manages food outlets and supplies uniforms and other clothing, and a key contractor at last year’s Olympics in Athens, building on its experience in supplying 14 Major League Baseball stadiums.The latest proposal highlights both the larger scale of private-equity purchases and the move into more service-orientated businesses from the core of manufacturing transactions in recent years, highlighted by the recent offer for HCA, the hospital operator.The cash offer from Mr Neubauer, a former PepsiCo executive who joined the company in 1979, and a group of private-equity investors of $33.80 represents a 20 per cent premium on the proposal they made in May.The consortium aims to close the transaction in late 2006 or early 2007, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.Mr Neubauer, who emigrated from Israel 40 years ago, controls 40 per cent of the class A voting stock.He became chief executive of in 1983 and led another management buy-out a year later to fend off a hostile take-over bid for the company, then known as ARA for the company, then known as ARA Services.While Aramark has generated cash flow in line with net earnings – forecast at around $280m this year – its stock price has lagged peers such as Cintas and Servicemaster, generally trading around the $25 float price.“The original offer had been expected to flush out rival bids, and Aramark’s board appointed Credit Suisse to review the proposal from Mr Neubauer, backed by the private equity units of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, as well as Thomas H. Lee Partners, Warburg Pincus and CCMP Capital.The proposal also involves the assumption of $2bn in debt.Aramark is due to report third-quarter results on Wednesday.

However, many analysts and some shareholders believe Baugur’s bid undervalues the company.The rumour in the Square Mile was that three former retail executives had approached a leading investment bank to see if they will provide backing for a 165p-a-share offer.HoF shares eased 0.2 per cent to 137½p.Takeover rumours were also swirling round Britvic, the maker of Robinsons fruit juices. Its shares jumped 7.8 per cent to 206p amid talk of an approach from 5 per cent shareholder PepsiCo a private equity group. Britvic owns the UK license to produce Pepsi.However, traders said a more plausible explanation for the rise was talk that the recent heatwave had boosted sales of Britvic’s products. Indeed, a similar line of thinking saw Andrews Sykes Group, the air conditioning specialist, marked 6.8 per cent higher at 140½p.In the wider market, leading shares suffered a sharp reverse in the wake of Wall Street poor overnight performance, which continued on Friday.The FTSE 100 finished 51.2 points, or 0.9 per cent lower at 5,719.7, while the FTSE 250 settled 93 points, or 1 per cent, lower at 9,114.2. The falls capped a volatile week for the market, during which the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 rose 0.2 and 0.4 per cent respectively.Market turnover reached 2.7bn shares, swollen by heavy trading in with Standard Life, off 0.7 per cent at 249p. More than 107m Standard Life shares changed hands as index tracking funds scrambled to buy stock ahead of the life assurer’s inclusion in the MSCI index on Monday.The mining sector led London lower amid concerns China’s voracious appetite for metals and minerals could slow after its government increased the commercial bank reserve requirement in an effort to slow economic growth. That news saw Vedanta Resources fell 4.3 per cent to £12.46, Antofagasta lose 4.8 per cent to 389½p and Rio Tinto slip 3.8 per cent to £26.63.Elsewhere, a Goldman Sachs “sell” recommendation and concerns over slowing economic in the US, its main market, saw Wolseley, the building supplies company, close 4.8 per cent cheaper at £10.79.Cadbury Schweppes, off 1.1 per cent at 518p, was also under pressure, on rumours that it would take a £30m hit to cover the fallout from the Dairy Milk salmonella outbreak. The Health Protection Agency said Cadbury was to blame for the recent outbreak of salmonella in the UK.PartyGaming underscored its reputation as the FTSE 100’s most volatile stock. Shares in the internet casino and poker operator, which fell 7.4 per cent on Thursday, bounced 10.9 per cent to 96¾p after its chief executive Mitch Garber said he was not concerned about the US indictment of rival BetonSports, suspended at 122½p.“The characteristics of the indictment are very far away from what PartyGaming does. PartyGaming intentionally does not take US telephone bets on sport,” he said.Northern Foods improved 0.3 per cent to 81¾p after ABN Amro said RHM, the maker of Hovis bread, should make an all-share bid for the struggling food manufacturer.“Significant synergies are on offer while the enlarged scale would boost clout with retailers. We estimate returns and earnings per share accretion would be excellent at over 100p per Northern shares, “ ABN said as it upgraded Northern Foods to “hold” from “sell”.Misys improved 1.9 per cent to 237¼p amid rumours that one of the bidders circling the software company had tabled a 275p-a-share offer. However, traders were sceptical that anyone would make a bid before Misys announces its full-year figures next Thursday.On the downside, Ultra Electronics slipped 5.4 per cent to £10.40 as investors had their first chance to react to Thursday’s after hours news that the company is not in takeover talks with Italian aerospace company Finmeccanica.However, the fact that Ultra did not surrender all of Thursday’s 15 per cent gain led analysts to conclude that there is no smoke without fire. Merrill Lynch said a bid made strategic sense. “Finmeccanica is interested in communications acquisitions and Ultra is in tactical radios and battlespace IT,” the broker said.Elsewhere, CSR, the wireless chip designer, shed 7.5 per cent to £10.28 after second quarter profits from US rival Broadcom Corporation came in below expectations.Among the small caps, Isoft dropped 10.1 per cent to 55½p as investors digested Thursday after hours news of accounting irregularities.Of new issues, Sylvanian Resources made a good Aim debut.

geopolitical uncertainty and record oil prices rattled investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 11,000, losing 1.5 per cent, or 166.89 points, at 10,846.29.The S&P 500 lost 1.3 per cent, or 16.31 points, at 1,242.29, with every sector in the index losing ground. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.7 per cent, or 36.13 points, at 2,054.11. The Nasdaq has lost 3.5 per cent in the past two days.Retail was in focus with Wal-Mart losing 2.2 per cent to $44.16 after Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”. It is now at its lowest level since October and has fallen 6 per cent this year.Other retailers also suffered as investors grew worried about consumer spending. JC Penney shed 4.9 per cent to $64.78, while Nordstrom lost 5 per cent to $34.19. Federated Department Stores slid 3.9 per cent to $34.55.Crude reached record levels once more on the back of the heightened tensions in the Middle East, forcing Nymex futures close to $77 a barrel.Joseph Battipaglia, chief market strategist at Ryan Beck, said investors were concerned about the increased geopolitical risk.“You throw more risk into the equation, and that pushes prices down,” he said. “If Israel’s action against Lebanon becomes a multilateral war, then all bets are off, but we’re not near that. This week it’s just a matter of people becoming defensive.”Media stocks were heavily sold, and the S&P media index had its worst day since May 2004. Walt Disney lost 4.1 per cent to $28.70 on reports of plans to lay off workers and cut its annual output of films by half.Tribune shed 2.6 per cent to $31.50 following the release of second-quarter earnings that were well below analysts’ expectations.The transport sector came under pressure, with airlines affected by higher oil prices. The Dow Jones Transportation Average has fallen more than 4 per cent in two days.UAL lost 7 per cent to $28.62 and AMR fell 8.2 per cent to $24.99. Expeditors International was down 4.4 per cent to $52.30.Pepsico was a bright spot in the gloom, gaining 1.6 per cent to $62.07 after it reported better-than-expected second-quarter profit, boosted by sales of non-carbonated drinks.Electronic Arts climbed 2.2 per cent to $43.52, after the company announced that six games were in development for the Nintendo video games console. Other tech stocks did worse. Yahoo slid 3.5 per cent to $32.23 and Texas Instruments fell
3.2 per cent to $28.29.Steel slumped as US steelmakers called for action against Chinese subsidies to its steel industry. Nucor dropped 8.2 per cent to $49.78 and Steel Dynamics lost 5.3 per cent to $59.72. US Steel lost 5.4 per cent to $65.50."
848;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-07-06T23:32:00Z;Cigarette makers breathe a sigh of relief;;The history of US litigation is strewn with superlatives and highly charged emotions, but there is little doubt that Thursday was Big Tobacco’s biggest day in court.The decision by the Florida Supreme Court to uphold a previous ruling and reject a $145bn punitive damage award claim against some of the biggest US cigarette makers lifts a huge financial and legal threat for the industry.Although the outcome of the so-called “Engle” case was expected – partly because the requested damages were so high – Thursday’s ruling puts an end to years of uncertainty for companies, investors and even plaintiffs.“For the most part, the court has done what we wanted them to do,” is how William Ohlemeyer, associate general counsel for Philip Morris USA, summed up Big Tobacco’s mixture of relief and elation at the Florida ruling.But if the end of Engle is likely to neuter once and for all the potential for class action lawsuits and their astronomical damage claims, the decision was no slam dunk for Big Tobacco.Aside from confirming damages worth some $7m to two of the 700,000 plaintiffs, the court left the door open to individual lawsuits against the tobacco companies provided they sue them within a year.“This is not a complete victory for the tobacco industry,” said John Coffee, an expert on tobacco litigation at Columbia University Law School. “It will be Chinese water torture, drop by drop.”Indeed, Stanley Rosenblatt, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, said that some of the court’s findings, namely that smoking is harmful and that the companies marketed “defective and unreasonably dangerous” cigarettes, could help future individual cases.“The job of plaintiffs’ lawyers will be much easier in future cases,” he said.But even if tobacco companies are hit by a raft of smaller cases – a prospect they claim is unlikely – they have avoided a pay-out that would have bankrupted the whole industry.“The industry is still looking at significant but not lethal liability, particularly in the area of low-tar cigarettes,” where plaintiffs have had considerable success using state consumer protection laws, said Jonathan Turley, of George Washington University law school.The point was not lost on investors, who sent the share prices of the main companies involved – Philip Morris owner Altria, Reynolds American and Carolina Group, the tracking stock for Loews Corp.’s Lorillard Tobacco – higher.Altria investors had other reasons to look forward to the Engle verdict. The company has been waiting for a resolution of legal disputes to spin off its 87.6 per cent stake in Kraft Foods.Altria declined to comment on Thursday but its chief executive Louis Camilleri has indicated that a positive Engle verdict would remove a roadblock to the break-up.Although a pending Justice Department investigation into Big Tobacco, and Philip Morris’s hint it might appeal against part of the Engle verdict, could further delay the spin-off, Wall Street analysts are expecting it before the end of the year.According to Goldman Sachs, a three-way split of Altria, into Kraft, Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International – one of the options considered – could add 26 per cent to the market value of the companies.The Altria board has already paved the way for a sale with last month’s ousting of Roger Deromedi as chief executive and his replacement with Irene Rosenfeld, a food-industry veteran who returned to Kraft after a two-year stint running PepsiCos snack food division.Ms Rosenfeld is expected to accelerate the efforts to boost growth in sales and earnings. In order to achieve those goals, she could hit the acquisition trail.Wall Street bankers have long expected that once Kraft was free of the Altria link, it would look at take-overs, taking advantage of a share price no longer affected by the prospect of litigation risk.Among the most commonly mentioned targets is Danone, the large French yoghurts maker which was unsuccessfully pursued by PepsiCo last year. This would allow Kraft to expand away from more traditional products such as processed cheese into higher growth products such as yoghurt.Ironically, Big Tobacco’s ability to survive litigation over the nefarious effect of smoking could prove a boon for investors in dairy products popular among health-conscious consumers.Additional reporting by James Politi and Lauren Foster in New York and Doug Cameron in Chicago
849;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-07-06T23:01:11Z;Secret recipe to FBI sting’s success;;In early May, an envelope arrived at PepsiCo’s headquarters in Purchase, New York, bearing the insignia of the company’s fierce rival: Coca-Cola.Inside was a letter claiming to be from a high-level Coke official offering to sell “very detailed and confidential information” about the company to PepsiCo.On Thursday, three defendants appeared in federal court in Atlanta, accused of stealing trade secrets from Coke and attempting to sell them to PepsiCo for $1.5m.The trio, including one Coke employee, were arrested on Wednesday following an FBI investigation.The apparent security breach is a rare lapse for Coke, which has famously kept its original cola recipe – the so-called “secret formula” – locked away for 120 years in an Atlanta bank vault.Joya Williams, who was executive administrative assistant to Javier Sanchez-Lamelas, Coke’s global brand director, is charged with having stolen dozens of confidential documents and a sample of a new drink from the company’s Atlanta headquarters.Video surveillance captured Ms Williams rifling through corporate files and stuffing the documents and drink sample into her bag, according to prosecutors. She was fired by Coke on Thursday.The letter touting the items for sale was allegedly written by Ibrahim Dimson, a 30-year-old New Yorker whose connection to Ms Williams, 41, is unclear.The alleged scam was based on an assumption that PepsiCo would jump at the chance to buy secret information about its rival. But, in a rare outbreak of goodwill between the cola giants, PepsiCo immediately told Coke about the approach and forwarded the letter to Atlanta.Within days, the FBI was alerted and a sting operation was under way to catch the alleged conspirators.According to the FBI, an undercover agent called the telephone number given in the letter and entered negotiations with a man called “Dirk” – later identified as Mr Dimson.Examples of the Coke documents were faxed to the undercover agent to prove their authenticity and he wired a $5,000 down payment to “Dirk” in return, according to the authorities’ account of events.The men agreed to meet at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson airport on June 16 to complete the deal. During their encounter, the agent handed “Dirk” a Girl Scout cookie box stuffed with $30,000 in notes.In return, the agent allegedly received an Armani bag containing Coke documents marked “highly restricted” and a glass bottle filled with the new drink.A further $45,000 payment was promised once the beverage was tested.As the sting drew towards a close, the undercover agent offered $1.5m for an additional list of items that “Dirk” claimed to possess.The agent arranged to complete the transaction last Wednesday but instead the FBI arrested Mr Dimson, Ms Williams and a third alleged conspirator, Edmund Duhaney, of Decatur, near Atlanta. The two men were held in custody following Thursday’s court hearing, while Ms Williams was released on bail. A second hearing was scheduled for next week.Neville Isdell, Coke’s chief executive, offered “sincere appreciation” to PepsiCo for raising the alarm and said a review of internal security policies was under way. He said protecting intellectual property was becoming more important to the company as it stepped up innovation as part of efforts to diversify beyond soft drinks.Coke has developed a raft of new products over the past two years, including a coffee-flavoured cola and various energy drinks, and it plans to introduce several more over coming months.David Nahmias, US Attorney, said the Coke case proved the government’s determination to defend intellectual property.The trial promises to be one of the most high-profile of its kind since Congress passed the 1996 Economic Espionage Act in1996, that strengthened laws against corporate spying and intellectual property theft.Companies are sometimes reticent about alerting the FBI to security breaches because of fears that more trade secrets would be exposed in court than through the original leak.Greg Jones, the FBI special agent in charge of the Coke investigation, said he was “very pleased with the level of co-operation provided by Coca-Cola”.Coke joins a long list of companies to have fallen victim to theft of trade secrets.An engineer for Gillette, the razor maker, was jailed for more than two years in 1998 for faxing information about a new product to rivals.In 1997, Volkswagen agreed to pay General Motors $100m to settle a dispute involving thousands of documents obtained from a former GM executive, when he defected to the German carmaker.
850;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;SABMiller enters energy drink sector;;SABMiller has made its first serious move into the fast-growing energy drink sector by acquiring the Sparks brand from the US’s McKenzie River for $215m in cash.The London-based brewer also got the Steel Reserve brand, a lager with 8.1 per cent alcohol by volume, as part of the deal.Sparks is an alcoholic energy drink containing caffeine, taurine, guarana and ginseng.John Sicher, editor of US newsletter Beverage Digest, said the acquisition was a smart move because it gave the brewer an established brand in alcoholic energy drink category.“We are starting to see some real development in alcoholic energy drinks,” Mr Sicher said. Consumers were increasingly using energy drinks as mixers, particularly with vodka, he added.The energy drink market is expected to grow rapidly as consumers seek alternatives to beer and traditional soft drinks.Goldman Sachs forecasts that energy drinks could account for up 35 per cent of the US beverage market’s total profit growth over the next five years, and that the market could triple in volume to more than 300m 192-ounce cases by 2010.The non-alcoholic energy drink market is dominated by privately-held Austrian group Red Bull, which controls 34 per cent of the US market, according to Beverage Digest.It is followed by Monster (owned by Hansen Natural), Rockstar (privately-owned), Full Throttle (owned by Coca-Cola) and SoBe No Fear (owned by Pepsi).SABMiller said it hoped to use its Miller networks to improve distribution of Sparks and Steel Reserve. The brands are mostly available in urban convenience stores.It has also formed a partnership with McKenzie River to develop new products.The move comes as other brewers and drinks companies try to develop the alcoholic energy drink category.Rockstar has developed Rockstar 21, an alcoholic version of its core energy drink brand, while Anheuser-Busch created the Tilt brand (a malt beverage with caffeine, guarana, and ginseng) last year.SABMiller’s Miller Brewing subsidiary has also tried to make a push into the market, recently launching Mickey’s Stinger, a caffeineated malt beverage extension of the Mickey’s brand, in three US states.SABMiller has been struggling with declining sales of its Miller beer brand amid aggressive competition on prices from rival Anheuser-Busch.In March, SABMiller said full-year North American profits, which account for 14 per cent of group earnings, fell 7 per cent.
851;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-06-26T18:03:50Z;Deromedi forced out as Kraft Foods’ CEO;;Roger Deromedi was on Monday ousted as chief executive of Kraft Foods, the world’s second-largest food company, after presiding over two big restructurings aimed at reinvigorating its sluggish performance.He is succeeded by Irene Rosenfeld, who spent more than 20 years with Kraft and General Foods before joining Frito-Lay, the snack food division of PepsiCo, in 2004 as chairman and chief executive.The move comes as parent Altria Group prepares for a potential restructuring, including spinning off its 87.6 per cent of Kraft shares to Altria shareholders, and reflects frustration at the pace of progress in boosting sales and profit growth.“While the fundamentals of the business continue to improve, we are confident that Irene will accelerate the execution of Kraft’s growth strategy, build value for shareholders, and lead Kraft when it becomes a fully independent company,” said Louis Camilleri, Altria’s chief executive and chairman of the Kraft board.David Palmer, analyst at UBS Investment Research, told clients this was “the strongest signal yet that Kraft would be spun out of Altria”, possibly “by year-end”.Kraft said Mr Deromedi had “mutually agreed with the board to leave the company to pursue other interests”. He took over as sole chief executive in late 2003 – ending an unwieldy dual-CEO structure that the company briefly experimented with.The maker of Ritz crackers and DiGiorno frozen pizzas has battled high commodity costs and private label competition. By the end of 2008 it will have cut about 14,000 jobs and closed up to 40 plants.Christopher Growe, analyst at AG Edwards & Sons, said in a reasearch note that it appeared Ms Rosenfeld was returning to Kraft to “accelerate” the restructuring programme and sales and profit growth, “which have been lagging”.In her previous stint with Kraft Ms Rosenfeld oversaw the integration of the $19bn Nabisco acquisition as president of Kraft’s North American business.At Frito-Lay, she earned respect for maintaining solid growth through a challenging period of increased raw material costs and heightened consumer concern about health and obesity.She cut hundreds of jobs as part of a cost-saving drive and introduced a range of reduced calorie versions of its most popular snacks, such as Lay’s potato chips and Doritos tortilla chips.Her departure is a blow to PepsiCo, where she was considered a rising star and potential successor to Steve Reinemund, chief executive.PepsiCo said Ms Rosenfeld would be succeeded by Albert Carey, a 25-year group veteran who was most recently group president of sales.
852;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-06-04T17:34:47Z;HP has high hopes for high-end moves;;Seated at a conference table in San Diego, California, Vyomesh “VJ” Joshi can barely conceal his excitement as he picks up a computer mouse to demonstrate Hewlett-Packard’s latest piece of high-tech gadgetry.“This is the first time we’ve done a live interview with this thing,” says Mr Joshi, head of HP’s imaging and printing group, the $80bn computer company’s most profitable business.Although he is sitting 500 miles away, the images and sounds projecting from the screens embedded in the wall of the “Halo” room in HP’s Silicon Valley headquarters are so sharp and lifelike that Mr Joshi might as well be sitting across the table.Halo, HP’s new high-end video conferencing system, is one of a series of innovations that Mr Joshi’s engineers have brought to market this year as part of an ongoing attempt to transform HP’s imaging and printing group. Companies such as General Electric, PepsiCo, and BHP Billiton pay HP a hefty one-time installation fee and service charges to run Halo over a custom-built internet backbone.Along with Halo, Mr Joshi this year introduced a line of in-store photo kiosks to boost the company’s photo printing offerings, which include at-home photo printers and Snapfish, an online photo storage and printing service HP bought last year.Last week, at a conference in San Francisco, Mr Joshi outlined plans for HP to begin offering printing services to cater for the huge increase in user-generated content online.The company is also launching a direct challenge to Xerox and other companies in the office copier market by marketing networked, multi-function laser printers that can also copy documents.All this is a long way from the inkjets and laser printers that make up the core of HP’s imaging and printing business, and that is how Mr Joshi likes it.“We want to take our technologies and go after completely new businesses,” he says.Two years ago Mr Joshi launched a restructuring of the company’s imaging and printing group, which last quarter accounted for almost 30 per cent of HP’s $22bn in total sales. In 2004, HP’s vaunted “razor and blades” printer strategy – in which the company sold printing hardware in order to profit from sales of high-margin ink – was beginning to come under pressure from rivals such as Dell, Lexmark and makers of generic printer ink.Now, says Mr Joshi, the imaging and printing group is well on its way towards its goal of 5 per cent revenue growth this year, with profit margins of 13-15 per cent.Peter Grant, an analyst at Gartner, says that combining HP’s traditional strength in hardware with innovative services such as in-store photo printing, networked multifunction printers, and Halo, should allow HP to find new growth by bringing more of its technologies to bear on solving customer problems.In the enterprise market, says Mr Grant, “more businesses are interested not so much in owning the equipment but linking up with a partner or having HP manage it directly”.HP is also pursuing a services-based approach in its push to offer printing services to amateur photographers and other creators of user-generated digital content.Mr Joshi last week outlined a broad vision of how HP plans to use the internet to connect people to different kinds of printing services.Snapfish, the company’s online photo site, already allows people to print photos at home or order prints online from a retailer.Soon, Mr Joshi says, a family back from holiday could be able to get directly in touch with a professional printer to turn hundreds of vacation photos into a hard-bound coffee table book, using the internet as a portal.HP has plans to offer small businesses a similar service. By using the internet as a portal, small companies could soon be able to connect with professional printing shops to place orders for homemade marketing materials, such as brochures and posters.For the time being, Mr Joshi is coy about what kind of online services portal he has in mind.“Stay tuned,” he says.
853;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;European Comment: A pause for reflection;;European Union leaders have given themselves an extended “pause for reflection” on the adoption of a grand constitution, after French and Dutch voters last year rejected Valéry Giscard d’Estaing’s European dream.Euronext managers and investors would be well advised to do the same.For not everyone shares the enthusiasm of Euronext boss Jean-François Théodore for merging the Paris-based pan-European bourse with the New York Stock Exchange. Many rightly consider the proposed transatlantic merger really a NYSE takeover. Others cannot understand the hurry to consolidate. After all, Euronext is only five years old and even Mr Théodore admits this is young for picking a partner and getting married.But then there is the problem of all those impatient hedge funds that have invested in Euronext and Deutsche Börse, its Frankfurt-based rival.Some are still keen to see the two merge, although they are having second thoughts as a result of the siren calls from Wall Street.With the rival New York Nasdaq muscling into the London Stock Exchange, politicians in France and Germany are becoming worried that Europe, rather than creating its own champion, risks abdicating its bourses to the Americans. Granted, there was little they could have done to protect their exchanges from the new breed of aggressive financial investors that built up large, if not dominant positions in the two big continental exchanges.Senior French officials admit they continue to prefer that Euronext and Deutsche Börse combine. After all, these businesses certainly qualify as strategic assets – far more so than, say, a yoghurt maker such as Danone, which Paris has been defending tooth and nail against any PepsiCo bid.If the hedge funds, anxious for a quick exit out of their investments, had not been breathing so heavily down the necks of both Euronext’s and Deutsche Börse’s managements, these officials believe Paris and Frankfurt could still work out an acceptable compromise. All the more so now that Deutsche Börse’s Werner Seifert – and his designs on London – has gone and been replaced by the more accommodating and pragmatic Reto Francioni.The hedge funds would now like to see a bidding battle between the NYSE and Frankfurt intensify with one of the two sides, presumably the Americans, making a knock-out offer. Yet there are those who believe there could still be a neat way out of this developing auction if Paris decided to wield its secret weapon.The Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) has long been regarded the “armed wing” of the French Treasury. As part of its strategy of “economic patriotism”, the government has urged the CDC to invest its considerable funds in acquiring defensive stakes in vulnerable French blue-chip companies. The CDC is now about to be handed a €7bn cheque for disposing of its 35 per cent stake in the Caisse d’Epargne to allow the French savings bank to combine with the Banque Populaire mutual group.Why not, some suggest, encourage the CDC to spend some of this cash to acquire a large stake in Euronext – say 20-25 per cent – to counter the hedge funds? With other French traditional institutional investors joining in, it should not be too difficult to build a blocking stake.Then, according to this intriguing script, Euronext would be able to remain a stand-alone company, the hedge funds would be put in their place and everybody would be able to indulge in a salutary “pause for reflection”.Eurotunnel finally seems to be digging itself out of its debt hole. Not only has the Channel Tunnel operator clinched the financing of its restructuring with Goldman Sachs, Macquarie and Barclays, but it has prompted Citigroup to make a last-minute counterproposal.At such a late stage in the game, the Citigroup move smacks of spoiler tactics and appears to have little chance of success. It nonetheless underlines the growing interest being shown by big players in infrastructure projects.Only on Wednesday General Electric and Credit Suisse announced they were joining forces to invest in such projects, claiming that the infrastructure market in the industrialised world alone could be worth $500bn over the next five years and twice as much in the developing world.If Eurotunnel must still be considered one of the riskier plays, the likes of Goldman Sachs are clearly banking on the old principle that it is usually the original investors who get burnt, while the second bunch, who come to the rescue, reap the financial rewards.
854;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-05-25T08:34:52Z;Britvic issues third profit warning;;"Britvic delivered its third profits warning in three months on Thursday as it suffered a £5.3m interim pre-tax loss after profits of £20.8m in the comparable period.Shares in Britvic closed 17¾p higher at 222p, however, with analysts attributing the rise to speculation the company could be a takeover target for a private equity firm.The soft drinks manufacturer said that demand for fizzy drinks had not recovered as expected and that prices were likely to remain weak for the rest of the year.It said the full-year outcome would be ""modestly below"" market expectations for after-tax profits of £40m.Sales revenues of Britvic's fizzy drinks - which include the Pepsi and Tango brands - fell 9 per cent to £159.8m in the six months to April 16, and sales revenues of still drinks dropped 1 per cent to £153.7m.The drop in fizzy drink revenues was due to lower sales volumes, down 7.2 per cent, and lower prices.Britvic said the fizzy drink market had shown no signs of improvement, with sales falling 14 per cent in the past four weeks. Analysts said recent supermarket price cuts on Coke had hurt sales of Britvic brands such as Pepsi.Analysts at Deutsche Bank, which co-led Britvic's flotation in December, yesterday cut their rating on the company.Paul Moody, Britvic's chief executive, said he remained confident about the outlook for soft drinks.Group turnover fell to £323.6m (£343.1m) and losses per share were 2.6p (earnings of 6.4p). An interim dividend of 3p is declared.FT Comment* Britvic has continuously disappointed the market since it floated at 230p a share. Analysts say it is hard to predict future sales, given that the market for fizzy drinks is expected to continue declining. However, they say that Britvic has healthy cash flow and that at a p/e ratio of 10.5 times full-year estimates for 2006, the stock is considered cheap."
855;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-05-22T18:37:09Z;European Comment: Paradoxical economic patriotism;;A year ago, the idea that PepsiCo was thinking of mounting a bid for the national yoghurt-maker Danone brought the French government out in spots. It led prime minister Dominique de Villepin to launch his now famous policy of economic patriotism to protect French industrial champions.But what is this policy? Even Paris these days gives the distinct impression it does not really know itself. Take Monday’s bid by the New York Stock Exchange for Euronext, the France-based pan-European stock exchange.Though the government has not endorsed the NYSE offer, it appears to be warming to it as an alternative to a merger between Euronext and Deutsche Börse, despite the rhetoric of reviving the old Franco-German relationship.Yet when it comes to Arcelor, the government is still resolutely hostile to Mittal Steel’s takeover bid.And what about Alcatel’s proposed merger with Lucent of the US? The government did not hesitate to give its blessing to this transatlantic combination. At the same time, it is continuing to erect barriers against possible rival bids for Suez to protect the merger of the Franco-Belgian utility with Gaz de France. Only on Monday, it suggested introducing a golden share to protect what it claims are strategic gas assets.The incoherence of the government’s industrial policy has been further highlighted by its decision to force the Franco-German EADS aeronautical group to reconsider the closure of a loss-making French aircraft maintenance subsidiary. A few weeks earlier it twisted the arm of the Japanese Toyal group to switch the construction of a new French plant at Pau to another area for purely local political reasons.Granted, the government, weakened by its climbdown on labour reform and the Clearstream scandal, is anxious to avoid renewed labour strife, undermining even further its chances in next year’s presidential and general elections. But such intervention is hardly going to reassure the foreign companies that the government is again trying to attract.There is a cynical explanation to this French paradox. The government is merely adopting an à la carte approach to economic patriotism, protecting French champions when it suits it and promoting mergers when these appear to offer the lesser of two evils.Hence the apparent contradiction of tolerating the NYSE while objecting to Mittal Steel. But then Paris stands a far greater chance of retaining and even enhancing its influence at the expense of Frankfurt as a European financial centre if it combines with the NYSE. If it were to merge with Deutsche Börse, it fears Frankfurt would further reinforce its dominance in Europe.This begs the question of what shareholders should think. But then economic patriotism, in one form or other, has become a global paradox, not just a French one.On the face of it, Monday’s Ahold verdict exposes a growing transatlantic divide on punishing white-collar crime.For the prosecutors and the Dutch shareholders’ lobby, the sentences dished out to the former chief executive and chief financial officer of the Ahold supermarket group seem offensively mild. After all, the affair was regarded as one of Europe’s biggest financial scandals and Holland’s own Enron.The two main defendants in the Ahold trial only received suspended jail sentences and fines of €225,000 each. Compare this with the possible 30-year jail terms former Enron executives are facing in the US - not to mention the 25-year prison sentence handed down to former WorldCom boss Bernard Ebbers.But is the use of tough US-style sanctions the best deterrent against corporate fraud? It is unclear. For these days in the US most white-collar criminal cases are settled out of court and the culprits happily continue in business. In Holland, and Europe in general, the sanctions may be milder but a criminal record will normally disqualify you from conducting normal business. Which is worse?
856;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list.

Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry.

857;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:10:33+0000;Burger King in TV web link-up;;Burger King, the second largest hamburger chain in the US, next week will kick off a marketing campaign on MySpace.com to tap the growing audience for online social networks.In one of the biggest such moves by a large advertiser, Burger King will sponsor a special “Have it your way” page – reflecting the company’s marketing slogan – where MySpace users will be able to download free episodes of , the hit television series that starts a new season next week. MySpace.com, the social networking site Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp bought last year, has nearly 80m registered users. It has recently won advertisers such as Pepsi, Toyota, Coca-Cola and others seeking to attract its prized young users who are harder to reach with traditional television advertising.“Advertiser interest in reaching this audience is growing by the day,” said Richard Greenfield, analyst at Pali Research, which predicts revenues of more than $200m for MySpace by the end of the year.After its sale to News Corp for $580m, the group is under pressure to show that it can make money out of its huge audience without driving them away.MySpace.com plans to create a social network around where users can discuss the drama, put up their own content and download other episodes for $1.99 each.“We’re giving consumers what they want with the choice of free shows – wherever and whenever they want to watch them – and the ability to talk about those shows in the social networking environment of MySpace,” said Gillian Smith, senior director for media at Burger King Holdings.Ross Levinsohn, president of Fox Interactive Media, the News Corp division that includes MySpace, said it would “help his story” that big advertisers such as Burger King were “embracing user-generated sites such as MySpace”.The announcement comes during the annual negotiations between US television broadcasters and advertisers. For the first time this year, broadcasters and cable networks are pitching for the billions of advertising dollars by highlighting their ability to reach internet and on-demand audiences alongside traditional viewers. Disney’s ABC, for example, is offering free episodes of its top shows on abc.com and has required the advertisements to be interactive. Disney, Fox and others offer downloads of programmes via iTunes.“The key really is what’s the right messaging [in different media] so that we don’t alienate the audience,” said Donna Speciale, president at Mediavest, a big ad buying agency.

In December, the company’s market capitalisation fell below that of PepsiCo, its fierce rival, for the first time.Mr Allen, chief executive of Allen & Co, a family-owned New York investment banking company, is one of Coke’s most influential board members.
859;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-05-03T22:56:39Z;Companies agree to ban on sale of fizzy drinks in schools;;The world?s three largest soft drink companies on Wednesday agreed to ban most soda sales in US public schools and distribute only lower-calorie and nutritious beverages in an effort to tackle soaring rates of childhood obesity.Nearly 35m students will be affected by the new guidelines, established by the American Heart Association and former President Bill Clinton?s charitable foundation, and agreed to by Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cadbury Schweppes.The move comes a month after Republicans and Democrats joined forces to propose the first bipartisan bill aimed at purging vending machines in US schools of fatty snacks and fizzy drinks.Virtually all US high schools and 83 per cent of elementary schools have vending machines.A recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed there was ?a significant increase? in the rate of overweight children and adolescents from 1999 to 2004. Eighteen per cent of boys and 16 per cent of girls were considered overweight, up from 14 and 13.8 per cent, respectively.The guidelines announced on Wednesday limit beverages to 100 calories, except for certain milks and juices, according to the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, established through Mr Clinton?s foundation.?This is an important announcement and a bold step forward in the struggle to help America?s kids live healthier lives,? said Mr Clinton. ?These industry leaders recognise that childhood obesity is a problem and have stepped up to help solve it.?Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cadbury voluntarily agreed to the new guidelines along with the American Beverage Association. Elementary schools will soon sell only water and 8oz, calorie-capped servings of certain juices with no added sweeteners, as well as fat-free and low-fat regular and flavoured milks. Middle schools will apply those standards with portion sizes increased to 10oz.High schools will also be allowed to sell bottled water, diet and unsweetened teas, diet sodas, fitness water, low-calorie sports drinks, flavoured water, seltzers, light juices and sports drinks.Dawn Hudson, president and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola North America, said there were ?no short-cuts to solving the obesity problem? and the company was ?delighted? its products ?are part of the equation?.
860;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Cadbury acquires Dr Pepper/Seven Up bottler;;"Cadbury Schweppes on Tuesday said it had acquired the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, the largest independent bottler in the US, from the Carlyle Group, a US private equity group.The acquisition will give Cadbury greater control over the distribution of its US soft drink brands, which include Dr Pepper and Snapple.Cadbury has a 45 per cent equity stake in the bottling group, with most of the remainder held by Carlyle.Cadbury and Carlyle bought the privately held group for $283m in cash and $408m in debt in 1999.Cadbury – the third-biggest soft drinks manufacturer in the US behind Coca-Cola and Pepsi with a 17 per cent share of the fizzy drinks market – said it would pay $353m for the 55 per cent stake in the independent bottler it does not already own.The acquisition “gives us greater control over the distribution of our brands; improved operating efficiencies and customer service; and greater access to faster growing water and energy drinks,” said Todd Stitzer, chief executive, of Cadbury.The purchase will add to growing signs of restructuring in the US beverage industry, as soft drink companies rethink their relationship with the bottlers that produce and distribute their products.Beverage companies are seeking greater consolidation among bottlers in response to mounting pressure from powerful retail chains such as Wal-Mart for suppliers to become more efficient.By gaining greater control of its distribution network, Cadbury could negotiate with retailers directly.About 24 per cent of its fizzy drinks are distributed by the Dr Pepper bottling group, with much of the rest distributed through bottlers part-owned by Coke or Pepsi.Some analysts say that combining its manufacturing and distribution operations may also make it easier for Cadbury to eventually spin off its US beverages arm
and use the cash to make acquisitions in confectionery.Although the US beverages operations have been recording healthy growth over the past two years, and generate cash for Cadbury, the company has identified confectionery as its main growth business globally.Cadbury’s claims to be the world’s biggest confectionery company, with a market share of about 10 per cent, putting it ahead of Mars, Nestlé and Hershey.Cadbury has been diversifying away from chocolate confectionery in recent years and has been moving more heavily into sugar confectionery such as chewing gum.Cadbury is keen to challenge Wrigley’s dominance of the global gum market."
861;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-04-13T11:21:43Z;InBev increases stake in Argentine brewer;;InBev, the Belgian-based beermaker, on Thursday said it would pay about $1.2bn to substantially increase its stake in Quinsa, the Argentine brewer.InBev, which was formed through a tie-up in 2004 between Interbrew of Belgium and AmBev of Brazil, will raise its stake in Quinsa to about 91 per cent from 57 per cent, giving it a larger share of the fast-growing Latin American markets.The Belgian brewer, which is buying the stake from Beverage Associates, is increasing its stake through AmBev.In 2004, AmBev purchased its initial stake in Quinsa, making it the leader in Argentina.The producer of Beck’s, Stella Artois and Brahma has snapped up acquisitions in emerging markets as consumers in western Europe and North America drink less beer in favour of spirits and wine.Interbrew’s $11.2bn merger with AmBev gave the Belgian brewer access to Latin America and made it the world’s biggest brewer by volume. The deal has helped to boost beer sales and offset difficult conditions in developed markets.However, InBev faces fierce competition in the Latin American market after rival SABMiller last year bought Colombia-based brewer Bavaria in a $7.8bn deal.InBev, which since its creation has proportionally included Quinsa’s results, said it will fully consolidate the Argentine brewer once the purchase is completed.Quinsa is the leading brewer in Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay and also has a presence in Chile. The company also has bottling and franchise agreements with PepsiCo.Shares in InBev were up 1.5 per cent at €38.78 in early afternoon trade in Brussels.
862;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-04-04T18:49:31Z;Britvic joins an ignominious band of companies that have fared poorly after high-profile IPOs;;After Britvic, the soft drinks group, disappointed the market for the second time in the five months since it floated, the fizzing beverage some investors will be reaching for today is likely to contain an aspirin.Britvic has joined an ignominious band of companies that includes PartyGaming, the online gambling group, RHM, the food producer, Micro Focus, the software provider, and Jessops, the camera retailer.For all four, a high-profile IPO was swiftly followed by bad trading news.Worse, with its share price sliding yesterday to 210p, Britvic shares are trading about 8 per cent below their issue price – a not uncommon fate for Aim companies but an embarrassment for a main market stock.Such cases inevitably prompt questions about whether a particular float was overpriced and how the upbeat outlook contained in the IPO prospectus could be undermined so quickly by events.When Britvic, then owned by InterContinental Hotels Group, Whitbread, Pernod Ricard and Pepsi, floated in December 2005, there was ­little sign of the troubles ahead. Though Britvic’s 230p issue price was in the middle of the expected range, the number of shares offered at the float was increased shortly before the IPO to meet demand. With a trailing price/earnings multiple of about 10 times – a discount to the European beverages sector and the FTSE All Share – Britvic’s valuation looked undemanding.Apart from Pepsi, which retained its 5 per cent stake, the pre-float Britvic shareholders sold down their stakes when 75 per cent of Britvic’s shares were listed in the IPO. The shares duly gained a modest 2 per cent on their debut in a falling market. They later rose as high as 280¾p.But on March 2, the shares plunged 20 per cent in a day after Britvic warned that its 2006 profit would be at the low end of expectations.It said consumers were spurning carbonated drinks for health reasons.In yesterday’s update, the downturn in carbonated sales was still taking its toll. But Britvic also cited higher energy and raw material costs. This later explanation may prove the key to the future direction of Britvic shares. For observers argue that it is only when markets accept that managements face factors outside their control that they will swallow warnings so soon after floating.Whether an increase in such basic overheads at the company in the month since its last update is viewed sympathetically is not yet clear.Certainly, anyone looking for a pattern among under-performing IPOs will be hard pushed to find an obvious culprit.The companies in question were floated by different banks: Britvic was floated by Deutsche Bank and Citigroup, PartyGaming was handled by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and the global co-ordinators for the Micro Focus float were UBS and Goldman Sachs.The companies themselves operate in different sectors and have cited reasons ranging from a consumer downturn, in the case of Jessops, to company-specific problems, in the case of RHM and Micro Focus.Others have tried to lay the blame for underperforming floats at private equity investors, who are accused of pushing for unsustainable IPO valuations in order to maximise returns. But when KPMG looked at 16 floats worth £100m or more in 2004 and 2005, it found no evidence of this.Furthermore, at Party­Gaming, it could be argued that there were disagreements over its valuation even before its float, though that did not prevent it being heavily oversubscribed.Whatever the dearth of evidence, the most obvious suspicions in underperforming floats are likely to attach to those where investors or founders sell out at the IPO, not long before problems surface.It will indeed be of little comfort to Britvic shareholders that investors in Whitbread and IHG can look forward to the proceeds of those two companies’ well-timed exits from the soft drinks group.Neil Austin, a partner in KPMG’s corporate finance team, says: “Psychologically, people are always more nervous when investors are selling everything or significantly at a float. But investors can’t have it both ways. Investors want to ensure there is a sufficient free float in a company, which may require some investors to sell even if they don’t want or need to. And with private equity owners, people know they are going to want to exit eventually, so if they don’t do that at the IPO, that can create an overhang on the shares.”Nevertheless, underperforming recent floats should consider themselves on probation.Mr Austin adds: “One mistake, particularly if it is the first mistake, may be bad but the share price generally adjusts. If you have two, that is when you can get into a situation where a company is marked down as accident-prone and it can take you a long, long time to recover.”
863;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-04-04T07:56:22Z;Fizz goes out of Britvic soft drink sales;;Britvic on Tuesday attempted to restore some of the sparkle to its brands, saying that earnings were expected to be in line but it added that branded revenues were down 3.4 per cent year-on-year as consumers opted for healthier options.Shares dropped by 4 per cent in early trade in London to 207¼p.The downward trend was more marked in the carbonates or fizzy drinks division, which saw a decline in branded revenues of 7.3 per cent over the 24 week period to March 19.The soft drinks company that last month saw shares plummet after a big fall in sales of fizzy drinks, said the consumer trend towards “better for you” that was evident in post Christmas trading had continued into March.It added that operating margins for the half year were set to shrink by about one percentage point as energy and input costs increased.The statement on Tuesday may stoke concern over whether Brivic will see enough growth in stills to offset the decline in carbonates, which currently account for about half of its business and include brands such as Pepsi and 7UP, which it licenses from Pepsi in the UK.Britvic said: “We have yet to see a recovery in the total carbonates market but there are signs that the rate of decline in sales of full sugar carbonates, the most affected category, is stabilising.”Britvic added the overall stills market continued to show growth, with branded revenues up 1.3 per cent over the period.The company cited a late Easter, unseasonably cold weather and “recent structural changes in the customer base”, such as the change in ownership of KwikSave supermarket stores, as factors contributing to the sluggish performance.Britvic was not immune to other cost pressures from higher input and energy costs affecting businesses which, it said, would push first half earnings before interest and tax margins down by 1 percentage point on last year.Paul Moody, chief executive, said: “We continue to focus on driving revenue through core brand activity, successful new product launches and increasing our average realised price.”He added the company was focusing on reducing costs, with a full year target of at least £10m, improving its cash position and reducing working capital. “We continue to maintain a strong market share performance in many of our key categories and look forward to a stronger second half.”Branded revenues strip out the effect of Ben Shaws water brand acquisition.The carbonated soft drink market is in decline, with less carbonated drinks expected to be sold this year than last year. The total soft drink market in the UK is expected to increase only 1 per cent in 2006, according to to Canadean, the beverage researcy firm. The soft drinks market’s average annual growth is just 2 per cent over the past five years.However, drinks such as energy drink Red Bull are growing strongly along with youghurt drinks such as Danond’s Bio Activia.Although Britvic is manufacturing healthier kinds of drink products, such a Tango Clear, which have no added sugar, but contain sweeteners, it doesn’t manufacture fresh fruit juices or yoghurt drinks, nor does it have a strong presence in bottled water.The company will next update the market at its interim results on May 25.
864;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-03-17T15:00:37Z;French assembly approves poison pill law;;France’s national assembly has approved a law allowing companies to use “poison pill” defences against takeover bids. The move triggered charges of protectionism, but lawyers said it left French companies more vulnerable than similar measures expected elsewhere in Europe.The law, to be approved by the Senate next week, reflects rising alarm among political and business leaders about the risk of foreign raids. These sharpened after rumours of a bid for the French food group Danone last year, and grew with Mittal Steel’s bid for Luxembourg-based Arcelor.The government has rushed to get the law passed so companies can include poison pill provisions in their agendas for this year’s annual shareholder meetings. With majority shareholder approval, they will be able to issue extra shares, making bids more expensive and encouraging friendly talks.However, the law may come into play before then, as one of its amendments could affect the bid battle between Gaz de France and Italy’s Enel over Suez, the Franco-Belgian utility.This so-called “Danone amendment” puts into French law a version of the “put up or shut up” rule from the UK takeover code, forcing a potential bidder to either confirm or deny a bid rumour.This allows regulators to hold a company to its word, by either forcing it to launch an offer, or preventing it from bidding for a set period to be decided by the AMF market watchdog.When introduced in October, this amendment was initially designed with the rumours of a bid by PepsiCo for Danone in mind. But lawyers said it could now be used by the French regulator to force Enel to end weeks of uncertainty over whether it intends to counter-bid for Suez.Christophe Clerc, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling who was closely involved in preparing the law, said there were three groups of countries emerging, each with different ways of adopting the European takeover directive’s various opt-out clauses. Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland were expected to allow poison pills to be put in place without shareholder approval and before a bid is launched.Elsewhere, the UK, Austria, Sweden, Finland and the Czech Republic would only allow poison pills once a bid is launched and if shareholders approve it. He said France was in an “intermediary” group, including Hungary and Belgium, requiring shareholder approval but allowing poison pills in anticipation of a bid, though they would only be exercised if the bidder also benefited from them.More than half the shares listed on France’s CAC-40 blue chip index are held by foreign investors. In some cases foreign ownership is as high as two-thirds, and several companies with big free floats, such as Société Générale and Vivendi Universal, are the subject of frequent bid rumours.
865;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:23:06+0000;John Kay: The crunch in the long war of the crisps;;Every man, woman and child in Britain spends, on average, about £50 ($85) a year buying 150 packets of potato crisps. A typical packet contains around 200 calories, mostly carbohydrate and fat, and is a staple item in a school lunch box.Jamie Oliver, a British celebrity chef, launched a televised crusade to teach children to eat more nutritious food. This led the government to appoint Dame Suzie Leather to bully the nation into better eating habits. Last week, she demanded that crisps be banned from the nation’s schools.Globalisation is only slowly eroding national differences in eating habits. In the US, crisps are known as chips and may be made from corn rather than potato. Chips in Britain are what Americans call French or freedom fries, according to inclination. After several beers, British consumers eat these doused with salt and vinegar wrapped in old newspapers. These are Anglo-Saxon tastes. Crisps eaten in Britain account for about half of total sales within the European Union. Southern Europeans might munch on an olive, while only a Belgian would snack on frites with mayonnaise.Dame Suzie’s enemy is the Pepsi Cola Corporation, global market leader in crisps and chips. PepsiCo’s US dominance was achieved in the 1960s when it acquired Frito corn chips and Lay potato chips. In Britain, PepsiCo emerged as the clear winner of four decades of crisp wars last month. The only remaining substantial rival called in administrators.Crisps are a product of bad times. Elmer Doolin of Texas and Herman Lay of Nashville both launched their chip businesses in 1932 in the depths of the Great Depression. The popularity of crisps in Britain dates from postwar austerity, when butchers sought substitutes for scarce meats. For my generation, the packet of Smith’s crisps with a portion of salt wrapped in blue wax paper is an indelible childhood memory. The groundsman sold crisps to schoolboys in sodden sports kit, the crisps soggy and the salt caked. The salt could never be dispersed evenly without breaking the crisps.In 1961, Imperial Tobacco, diversifying in response to the health concerns over their principal product, purchased Golden Wonder and the first crisp war began. The new owners invested in technology and in brand advertising, creating crisps in many flavours and packaging that repelled moisture. Within a few years, Golden Wonder had displaced Smith’s as market leader and those blue packets of salt had disappeared.In 1986, Imperial was acquired by Hanson, which quickly disposed of peripheral businesses. Golden Wonder was bought at auction for a price far higher than the previously estimated value of the business. The purchaser was Dalgety, better known for its animal foodstuffs. PepsiCo instead bought a smaller company, Walkers, and the second crisp war broke out. Walkers received technological and marketing support and, when a fire disrupted Golden Wonder’s production, gained the market leadership it has since retained.Dalgety concluded that selling products for humans was hard, limited its investment and finally sold Golden Wonder to a management buyout. That was the moment PepsiCo chose to launch an iconic advertising campaign, featuring Gary Lineker and other soccer players. In 2006, the Golden Wonder team retired to the dressing-room.The business lesson of the crisp wars is that success in these markets demands genuine skills of brand and category management. Two large companies that had acquired these capabilities in other markets were able to deploy them rapidly and decisively in the sale and distribution of crisps in Britain. The apparent market dominance of Smith’s and Golden Wonder disappeared in the face of this assault.Imperial Tobacco and PepsiCo supported their strategies with investment in brand advertising, technology and new plants, but the amounts involved were not large in relation to the size of either these companies or the market they served. Effective business strategy matches organisational capabilities to market opportunity. In different phases of the crisp wars, first Smith’s, then Golden Wonder and finally Walkers had the strategy for the times.www.johnkay.com
866;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Vaccines alliance aims for double dose;;"Imagine if all those painful childhood vaccinations could be administered in a single jab, a one-stop shot that would offer protection from multiple diseases without the trauma of repeated nerve-wracking visits to the school nurse or local doctor.In 1994, that was precisely the long-term dream of two of the world’s largest pharmaceutical groups when they created a joint venture in Europe designed to develop and market a vaccine to offer protection against six infections.It is hard to envisage Coca-Cola and Pepsi joining forces to sell their competing drinks, or an alliance between Kraft and Danone over rival foods. It seems still less likely in the pharmaceuticals industry, where intellectual property is guarded fiercely and extensive co-operation is rare.Yet, in a pioneering and unusual structure formed 12 years ago, two companies with very different cultures and traditions did precisely that. Ever since, the group now called Sanofi-Aventis, based in France, and Merck of the US have each held half of the equity.“We had a hepatitis B vaccine that was very robust, and they had all the others,” recalls one former top Merck executive. “Their hepatitis B candidate was not robust enough, and we didn’t have enough strength in our other products. Merck had a very strong marketing arm in Europe for drugs but not for vaccines.”The result was Hexavac, launched in 2000, which also offered protection for whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus, polio and haemophilis influenzae. It is one of nearly 30 vaccines for adults and children covering 18 diseases that have been jointly developed and marketed across Europe by the two companies over the past decade.Sanofi Pasteur MSD (SPMSD), as the 50/50 entity is called, has first right of refusal on vaccines in the early stages of development at either parent company and, if it takes them on, conducts later-stage clinical trials, brings them through regulatory approval to market and distributes them across Europe. In almost every case since, it has done just that, generating €700m ($836m) last year in sales.Didier Hoch, who runs SPMSD, argues that it provides the best combination of both its owners’ skills, a useful sharing of risk and a healthy dose of its own unique strengths, too.“The joint venture gives us good knowledge of Europe,” he says. “You need a strong understanding of how the system works in each country. It’s clear that it’s less expensive than with only one company. Of course, you have to share the profits too.”Mr Hoch is sitting in his office in Lyon, France’s gastronomic capital, stressing the considerable autonomy his company enjoys.Merck’s headquarters are in Pennsylvania and even the sprawling site of Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines subsidiary of Sanofi-Aventis that
is his other proprietor,
is on the other side of the French city.“It’s easier to manage two companies than when you have a single shareholder,” he says. “We try to have the best of both systems, but in fact we have our own system while making sure it is ­compatible.”He suggests that his approach to financial reporting is closer to that of Merck, which has traditionally been more relaxed about integrating its system. In its long-term planning, he says SPMSD owes more to Sanofi-Aventis.Of SPMSD’s total 1,000 staff, many come from neither parent company and all are strictly employed by the joint venture, to which they owe their loyalty. Secondments from the shareholders are rare.“It’s very interesting for them to have products from both companies and not contact with just a single interlocutor,” Mr Hoch says, stressing that their main office, with just 300 people, keeps the business flexible and decision-making rapid.One reason for the joint venture is arguably that until very recently vaccines were the orphan of the drugs industry, and a not particularly profitable sub-sector in which companies felt an obligation to continue but no great need to go it alone for commercial reasons.While medicines command high prices and can often be sold in similar ways around the world to treat disease, vaccines have tended to be low priced and struggled with widely varying attitudes and approaches country by country.That is beginning to change. A crisis in supplies of seasonal flu vaccine in the US in late 2004 after production problems at the manufacturer Chiron highlighted how far the industry had been pared back. That was even before fears of a bird flu pandemic brought the subject to the fore.Today, flu vaccine prices are rising again, and a newer generation of products offers considerable promise. SPMSD is awaiting European approval for a vaccine for rotavirus, for example, as well as for HPV, the primary source of cervical cancer. In the future, there is scope for vaccines not just as preventative tools, but as potential treatments for cancers, Alzheimer’s disease and other illnesses.In a fast-changing environment, some rival vaccine producers question how far the joint venture still makes sense. “There are tensions now because Merck has most of the newer technologies and adjuvants [chemicals that boost vaccine efficacy] and Sanofi is weaker,” says one, notably referring to the HPV vaccine Gardasil.“There is no tension,” retorts Arne Naveke, spokesman for SPMSD. “There might be ups and downs, but these things move in waves over time. In the past, Sanofi had some better vaccines and it developed the new meningitis products on the market.”Ironically, Hexavac, the six-vaccines-in-one dose that triggered the joint venture, is currently under a cloud. It was suspended at the end of last year by European
regulators, not because of side-effects but over concerns that the hepatitis B component simply did not offer long-term protection. An investigation by the regulator, with the companies, is under way.Mr Hoch concedes that “the European dream” of putting so many com­binations in a single vaccine has faded, with the recognition of the complexities involved. In the long-term, he hopes there will be a shift towards greater homo­genisation across Europe.For now, there are widely varying national recommendations on vaccines, ­schedules for immunisation and approaches for re­imbursement which are more the result of local cultures than “justified by the ­epidemiology”.Meanwhile, he believes that the logic of the joint venture, which is reviewed each time there are significant changes at either company, is strong. “From time to time a separation is ­discussed, but I am not ­worried.”The next general review is in 2024. Judging by the ­evolutions in the vaccines sector, not to mention the likely evolutions at Sanofi-Aventis and Merck, it may well be scrutinised again long before then."
867;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-03-02T20:08:35Z;Flat lines as the fizz goes from pop;;"When Paul Moody took the helm of Britvic last year at its flotation, he stressed he had no plans to change the company’s long-term strategy of focusing on existing brands.But Thursday’s dramatic market reaction to the company’s trading statement has raised questions over whether a slow and steady approach will work.Food and drink companies around the world are rushing to make changes to their product portfolios in a race to keep up with consumers’ tastes.Nestlé, one of the world’s biggest food companies, has decided to make nutrition a key element of every food product that it makes and it is investing heavily in research and development.Meanwhile, small companies such as Innocent Drinks have moved into fast-growing categories such as smoothies, catching some of the bigger drinks producers by surprise. US soft drinks producer Pepsi has responded to this challenge by snapping up small companies such as PJ Smoothies for its portfolio.The question for Britvic is whether it can adapt its portfolio fast enough to remain competitive. Nearly half its business is in carbonated soft drinks, a market that is in decline as consumers increasingly shun sweet and sugary drinks.Richard Hall, chairman of Zenith International, the beverage market research firm, said: “Four of the fastest-growing soft drink categories worldwide are iced tea, sports drinks, energy drinks and functional drinks. The existing market leaders have created premium brands alongside high growth. This is where many in the industry are investing much of their thinking.”In its IPO prospectus last year, Britvic stressed that growth in the soft drink industry would be driven by so-called “still” drinks such as fruit juices and bottled water, rather than carbonated soft drinks.“We have seen that trend coming,” Mr Moody said.However, investors are worried whether Britvic will see enough growth in its stills business to offset the decline in carbonates. “There is a credibility issue,” one investor at a large institutional fund manager said.The UK grocery market continues to be dominated by carbonated drinks. With £892.5m in sales last year, Coca-Cola is the country’s number one grocery brand, according to research by AC Nielsen. Pepsi, whose UK brand is owned by Britvic, is the 11th-largest brand with sales of £225.5m and growth of 5.4 per cent last year.Overall, however, the carbonated soft drink market is in decline, with less carbonated drinks expected to be sold this year than last year. The total soft drink market in the UK is expected to increase only 1 per cent in 2006, according to Canadean, the beverage research firm .The soft drinks market’s average annual growth is just 2 per cent over the past five years.Growth in other drinks categories is offsetting the decline in carbonates. Energy drink Red Bull grew 12.8 per cent last year to £124.1m; water brand Volvic increased 17.6 per cent to £129.9m; and yoghurt drink Danone Bio Activia jumped 68.6 per cent to £55.1m.Although Britvic is creating healthier kinds of drink products – such as 7UP Free and Tango Clear, which have no added sugar, although they do contain sweeteners – it isn’t in yoghurt drinks, or fresh fruit juices. Nor does it have a strong presence in bottled water.Some 50 per cent of Britvic’s business is in carbonated soft drinks, such as Pepsi and 7UP – two brands that it licenses from Pepsi in the UK.The other half is in “still” drinks, such as Robinsons squash and Britvic juices.Mr Moody argues that the fall in demand for Britvic’s carbonated soft drinks is in line with the broader market, and that the company is either holding or growing share in the still market. The company said the sales drop was in the “the high single digits” in January and February.Total grocery sales of carbonated soft drinks fell to £200m in the first seven weeks of the year compared with £214m for the same period a year earlier, according to AC Nielsen.The total market for soft drinks increased to £659m in the first seven weeks of 2006 compared with £632m last year.However, Britvic only has a tiny position in growing areas of the still market such as bottled water.It recently launched the water brand Drench for teenagers and plans to introduce two other water brands, Pennine Spring and a Fruit Shoot water brand for children.Robinsons squash makes up about half of Britvic’s portfolio of still drinks. Sales of the brand fell last year amid strong competition from retailers’ own-brand labels. Grocery sales of Robinsons – which is the ninth biggest UK brand in terms of retail sales – dropped 0.4 per cent in 2005 from £265.6m to £264.4m, according to AC Nielsen.Robinsons has a 45 per cent share of the squash market, while own-label brands take 30 to 35 per cent. In its prospectus, Britvic said prices for own-label squash had been cut over the past 18 months and that these products had “gained market share at the expense of Robinsons”.Britvic has been trying to reverse this decline by urging consumers to buy Robinsons by undertaking promotional campaigns, such as two-for-three deals.Yet, as Mr Moody admits, sales are growing faster than profits."
868;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-03-02T14:21:01Z;Britvic plunges after warning on soft drinks;;Shares in Britvic dropped more than 20 per cent yesterday after the soft drinks company said 2006 earnings would be “at the lower end” of market expectations as consumers continue to turn away from carbonated drinks in favour of healthier beverages.Paul Moody, chief executive, told Reuters that “the decline we have seen this year in January and February has been more severe than anything we have seen in the past,” referring to weakness in the overall UK soft drinks market.However, the UK company, which controls the Robinsons, Tango and Britvic brands, said: “If the soft drinks market shows recovery over the balance of the year as we anticipate, we remain confident of delivering earnings within market expectations, albeit at the lower end.”The company, which is the the second-biggest soft drinks producer in the UK after Coca-Cola, has been focusing on healthier drinks as consumers demand sugar-free drinks and less additives.Yesterday, Britvic said that sales of its carbonated brands – except those with no added sugar – had slowed since Christmas. However, non-carbonated drinks showed growth.The company said it expected new lines within its water range and a further £4m ($7m) of cost savings to boost second-half growth.Britvic floated in December with three of its four shareholders – InterContinental Hotels, Whitbread and Pernod Ricard – selling their stakes. Pepsi, the fourth shareholder, kept its 5 per cent stake.Britvic shares, which debuted at 230p in December, yesterday fell 23 per cent to 210½p.
869;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-02-22T18:43:38Z;Arab companies cash in on cultural sensitivities;;Middle East-based companies are increasingly focusing on consumers who want products that conform to Islamic ideals, and their success has prompted US marketers to fight back with their own ‘culturally sensitive’ brands.Mecca-Cola, which was set up in 2002 to offer an alternative to Coca-Cola, continues to expand after it profited from boycotts and anti-western feeling in the region due to the invasion of Iraq.“Sales are going well and they are increasing every year - it is not just a fashion wave,” Tawfik Mathlouthi, founder of Mecca-Cola, says. Last year the company sold 1bn litres worldwide and according to Mr Mathlouthi, it is the third world brand for cola after Coca-Cola and Pepsi.Mr Mathlouthi hopes to bring Mecca-Cola, whose labels resemble those of Coca-Cola, back to the UK. Distribution had stopped after problems with suppliers. Other European countries with large Muslim populations including Italy, Spain, France, Holland and Germany sell Mecca-Cola, as well as the Middle East, Malaysia, Bangladeshi, Pakistan and North African countries, Mr Mathlouthi says.Cultural differences between the Middle East and the west have heightened consumers’ awareness of companies that offer goods for Muslims and local groups are responding with growing success to a market which wants more Islamic products rather than the traditionally preferred American or European items.In 2003, the Syrian-based company, Newboy Studios launched the Fulla doll. Since then Fulla has pushed Barbie out of the market in the Middle East.“Fulla is number one in the Gulf. We sell nearly 70 dolls everyday here. We only sell one or two Barbies a day,” Apesamir Musa, store manager at Toys ‘r’ Us in Cairo, says.Fulla comes with her own pink felt prayer mat and is dressed in a black abaya or robe complete with matching headscarf. She has a more modest bosom than Barbie and keeps herself well covered up. Fulla retails for 60 Egyptian pounds - less than half the price of Barbie.Fawaz Abidin, brand manager of Fulla at Newboy Studios, expects sales to increase by 30 per cent in 2006.“We have identified with the needs of the market. We have studied the market and the culture. Whenever there is room to reflect what the consumers want we translate it into a product,” Mr Abidin says.Higher levels of disposable income have also made other products such as mobile phones attractive to consumers.Ilkone Mobile Telecommunications, based in the UAE, identified a gap in the market and in 2004 launched the i800, the first mobile phone for Muslims.The phone offers exact prayer timing anywhere in the world, it can tell users where Mecca is and provides the entire text of the Holy Koran with an English translation.Malik Farafad, service manager at Ilkone, is pleased with the positive feedback the company has had. The group is currently developing models for both the low and high ends of the market with more Islamic features on them.“Companies are now catering for the choice, circumstance and demand in the market,” says Professor Rodney Wilson, who specialises in Islamic trade at the school of government and international affairs at Durham University.“These products have been successful. And people are already starting to copy goods like the Fulla doll with a cheaper version called Pulla. This is an indicator that Fulla is doing well. It is a growing market,” says Jane Kinninmont, managing editor of the Middle East and Africa department at Business Monitor International.She says that brands such as Mecca Cola have yet to seriously threaten the dominance of the US beverage companies, “which enjoy much greater technological sophistication and economies of scale”, however.Moreover, the experienced marketers at major US firms are fighting back, trying to reposition themselves as brands that are in touch with local culture and identity. “For example, PepsiCo’s sales are recovering since it launched a series of ads featuring Middle Eastern sports stars rather than the global celebrities it has traditionally hired.”Dr Bassam Fattouh, academic director of international management for Middle East and North Africa at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, says that local companies will only be able to retain customers if they offer high-quality goods at the right price.This will ultimately be more important for consumers than whether products are based on Islamic ideals, he says.
870;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-02-08T22:04:53Z;Food companies go own way on labelling;;Food companies are attempting to thwart UK government plans to promote certain kinds of food labels by implementing a nutritional labelling scheme to ward off criticism that their products encourage obesity.Danone, Kellogg, Nestlé, Kraft and PepsiCo are to follow the lead of Cadbury Schweppes and Masterfoods UK and put labels with “guideline daily amounts” for calories, fats, saturated fats, sugar and salt on products’ packaging over the next few months.The companies want to protect themselves against government proposals for labelling that they believe will “demonise” certain kinds of foods.In November the Food Standards Agency, a government body, said it was considering recommending a “multiple traffic light” labelling system that would use colours to show if foods had high, medium or low levels of fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt.The government wants companies to provide more information on the nutritional value of their products to help consumers decide what foods are healthy to eat.Food manufacturers, which have no legal obligation to adopt the government’s recommendations, say the traffic light labelling proposals are simplistic and patronise consumers. Kellogg said the GDA system would allow consumers to make their own decisions.The FSA had investigated a GDA system but the multiple traffic light scheme performed best. It will announce its final recommendation next month.Consumer groups have at-tacked the manufacturers’ move, arguing that food companies should have waited for the FSA’s final consultation before going ahead with their scheme.Which?, the consumer lobby group, has written to the chief executives of Danone, Kellogg, Nestlé, Kraft and PepsiCo, asking them to reconsider their decision. “A medley of different labels in the shops will only increase confusion and damage any opportunity to reduce the incidence of diet-related disease,” the letter said. “We believe that your actions have betrayed the needs of consumers.”The National Consumer Council was also critical. “The timing suggests this is a cynical move to derail the FSA’s steady progress towards an industry-wide agreement,” it said.Retailers such as Tesco and J Sainsbury have already introduced their own labelling systems. Tesco uses nutritional “signposts” based on the GDA scheme, and Sainsbury has a colour-coded “wheel of health”. Unilever is also to introduce a GDA-based scheme.
871;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-02-08T21:26:43Z;Cisco and Pfizer lift the mood on Wall Street;;Wall Street ended sharply higher on Wednesday as technology stocks were lifted by an upbeat outlook statement from Cisco and pharmaceuticals gained after Pfizer announced a possible asset sale.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 108.86 points, or 1 per cent, to 10,858.62, while the S&P 500 added 0.9 per cent to 1,265.65. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,266.98.Cisco Systems, the world’s biggest maker of networking equipment, rose 7.2 per cent to $19.40 after John Chambers, chief executive, was unexpectedly upbeat about third-quarter sales. This came after the company reported, following the close on Tuesday, a 1.8 per cent fall in fiscal second-quarter net profit. Cisco had been hit by the cost of compensation expenses related to employee stock options.“Cisco maintained 10-12 per cent full-year revenue guidance, which we believe is more comfortably achievable given the broad-based demand uptick,” said Nikos Theodosopoulos, strategist at UBS.Elsewhere among technology stocks, Dell, the computer maker, rose 6.2 per cent to $31.52 after broker Sanford Bernstein upgraded it to “outperform” from “market perform”. The broker said Dell was capable of delivering between 13 and 15 per cent earnings-per-share growth for several years to come.Rival Hewlett-Packard climbed 5.4 per cent to $32.01, while IBM added 1.4 per cent to $80.80.Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials gained 3.1 per cent to $20.10 after Banc of America upgraded the stock to “neutral” from “sell”, in anticipation of a surge in orders for flash memory chips.Pfizer helped boost the pharmaceuticals sector after it said it may sell its consumer products division, which includes such brands as Listerine mouthwash and Sudafed cold remedies. Analysts said the unit might be worth more than $10bn, and the stock rose 5.7 per cent to $26.37.Johnson & Johnson, seen as a potential bidder should the unit come up for sale, gained 3.2 per cent to $58.60. Procter & Gamble added 0.3 per cent to $59.47.PepsiCo, the food and drinks group, gained 0.7 per cent to $57.28 after it reported a 12 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net profit thanks to overseas sales growth and strong gains in snack items and non-carbonated drinks sales.The results were in line with market expectations, and the company said it would aim to buy back $3bn in shares over the coming year.General Motors was the biggest faller on the Dow, off 3.6 per cent to $21.99 after Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to “sell” from “hold”, citing a number of uncertainties.The broker’s analysts were “disappointed” by the limited cash savings targeted in the company’s restructuring plan.
872;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-02-08T20:31:11Z;Lex: PepsiCo/Coca-Cola;;Sometimes, being a generation ahead really does pay. PepsiCo’s one-time slogan never quite gave it leadership of the fizzy drinks market, but the company itself has benefited from positioning itself for the future. In sharp contrast to arch-rival Coca-Cola, it spotted the trend towards healthier eating and drinking early on. That has helped deliver consistently solid results for Pepsi even when it decides to boost spending.Its fourth-quarter performance is a case in point. The drinks and snacks company invested heavily in marketing and cost reduction, and also had rising input costs to contend with. But Pepsi again made up for it, thanks to strong demand, especially for salty snacks, sports drinks and water. Low-fat potato chips may not be everyone’s idea of a healthy meal, but that seems to do little to reduce the appetite for new varieties.The trouble is that investors too tend to be keen to try out something new occasionally. If all sorts of things might be good for you upon closer inspection, Coke itself is certainly starting to look more tempting than it has for a while. For a change, it seems to have got off to a solid start to the year. While meeting its goals for 2006 looks challenging, few investors are as yet giving it the benefit of the doubt. By stepping up marketing and innovation spend, it should at least give Pepsi a run for its money in fizzy drinks. All this may be enough to secure some relative strength.But at 18 times this year’s earnings, Coke’s shares are only a touch cheaper than Pepsi’s. Its core fizzy drinks business is no longer the growth engine it once was. Competition for the sorts of healthy acquisitions both companies need is fierce. It is difficult to see their investment appeal as anything more than a small addition to one’s diet.
873;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Pepsi profits up as emerging markets surge;;Surging business in emerging markets helped PepsiCo increase fourth quarter net income by nearly 13 per cent, highlighting the increasing importance of overseas growth to the beverage and snack food group.PepsiCo’s US businesses, including Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker cereals, also delivered strong results as the group reinforced its status as one of the world’s best-performing food and drink producers.Net profits were $1.1bn, or 65 cents a share, compared to $985m, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier, in line with Wall Street expectations.PepsiCo has earned a reputation for the reliability of its earnings growth in recent years as the group’s steady performance has contrasted with the more erratic results of its beverage rival Coca-Cola.The group forecast “continued strong performance” in 2006, with mid single-digit volume and revenue growth.PepsiCo has traditionally been heavily focused on its domestic US market but international revenues have grown to more than a third of the group total following a period of rapid expansion overseas.International sales were up 16 per cent, led by snack growth in Mexico, Russia and India and beverage growth in the Middle East, China and Argentina.Revenues from Frito-Lay, maker of salty snacks such as Cheetos and Lay’s, climbed by 13 per cent, signalling an increase in momentum following a series of more sluggish quarters.North American beverage sales were also up by 13 per cent, as soaring demand for non-carbonated products, such as Aquafina bottled water and Gatorade sports drink, offset slower growth in carbonated soft drinks.Quaker, known for its wholesome cereals and snack bars, enjoyed the fastest growth, as the consumer shift towards healthier foods helped lift sales by 20 per cent.Total revenues were up 15 per cent at $10.1bn, compared to $8.8bn a year ago.Steve Reinemund, chief executive, said the results were particularly pleasing when set against the increased commodity costs that have been putting the group under pressure in recent months.The biggest disappointment was decline in Walker’s, the group’s large UK snack business, amid a softening in the British economy. On Tuesday, Coca-Cola also complained of weakness in the UK.Fourth quarter results included the benefits of an extra week of earnings compared to the previous year, offset by restructuring costs at Frito-Lay.
874;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;John Plender: The strategic yoghurt policy, then steel;;The French yen for hostile foreign bidsThe irony in the French protectionist outcry at Mittal Steel’s hostile bid for Arcelor is that no industry better illustrates the debilitating impact of economic nationalism than steel. US producers were once the giants of the world steel industry. Yet successive US administrations gave in to protectionist lobbying. The result was a prolonged decline in efficiency.Today US Steel, the one-time American leader, so far lags behind Mittal and Arcelor that it is not a serious operator in the global game. Other great US names were forced into bankruptcy.A further irony is that French objections centred initially on the Anglo-Saxon abruptness of Mittal’s hostile bid. Yet Lakshmi Mittal is scarcely to be equated with perfidious Albion, given that he is India-born, with offices in London, a quote in Amsterdam and a two-tier capital structure of the kind so prevalent in France. Strange, too, that Thierry Breton, the French finance minister, objected chiefly to Mittal’s takeover etiquette, given the number of hostile bids launched by French companies in foreign markets. St Gobin and BPB, LVMH and Gucci, Lafarge and Blue Circle Industries – I could continue.But then many in the French government wanted a strategic yoghurt policy last year to stop a threatened bid by PepsiCo for Danone. In a country where the dairy industry is a matter of national security and the so-called social model delivers unemployment only just below double figures, chutzpah is par for the course.In fact, economic nationalism sits very uncomfortably with a cross-border takeover market. In much of continental Europe we have a new kind of divorce between ownership and control. Because funded occupational pensions are rare, a majority of the share capital of the larger quoted companies in Germany and France is owned by foreigners. A case in point is Germany’s Linde, 58 per cent owned by North American and British investors, which wants to take over British BOC, most of whose business is outside Britain. The same divorce is probably now under way at Arcelor, where hedge funds and arbitrageurs are reckoned to have 20 per cent or more of the equity. The American locusts are on the march.Of the current spate of bids and rumoured bids, the only one to give real grounds for concern would be a Gazprom bid for Centrica. In the light of Russia’s and Gazprom’s recent actions in Ukraine, there would undoubtedly be a serious security of supply question. Elsewhere, security is neither here nor there.Red and still tapedThere is a curious symmetry in the way both the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority have recently tried to reduce red tape, only to discover that supposed beneficiaries were shocked at proposed changes. It underlines the difficulty of rolling back bureaucracy. So much of it now comes from the European Union that it cannot be undone and plenty more of it is there for a good purpose.Responses to calls for bright ideas for deregulation are invariably disappointing. I think the answer is for big companies, City institutions and the FSA to give employees substantial financial bonuses for simple, discrete, practical proposals for scrapping specific legislation and rules. To spend more time than necessary on an inherently tedious subject requires a real incentive.Rethinking strategySome serious debunking is to be had from a new book by business academics Julie Froud, Sukhdev Johal, Adam Leaver and Karel Williams on the impact of capital market pressure on big company strategy.* A flavour of it comes in a verdict on General Electric, where their analysis of accounting numbers over 20 years suggests that no-growth blue chip industrial businesses were run for profit and to maintain GE’s AAA credit rating, which was then used to expand GE Capital. That, in turn, generated sales growth and earnings at GE Capital at the expense of a declining return on capital employed. This is pleasantly at odds with the usual hero worship applied to Jack Welch, the former GE boss, and performance assessments based on crude earnings figures.The academics’ verdict on private equity is similarly trenchant. The business model, they argue, is just like used car trading, where capital is borrowed from the bank, the car auction purchase is always cosmetically cleaned up – though not mechanically fixed up – and the aim is a dealing profit over and above the cost of borrowed money.As for captains of industry, the conclusion is: “Set against our evidence that giant firms grow no faster than GDP while CEO pay has risen much faster, top managers in giant firms appear to be an averagely ineffectual officer class who do, however, know how to look after themselves.”Sweeping? Maybe. But it is certainly thought provoking.* Financialization and Strategy, Routledge, £29.99.
875;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-01-30T22:51:56Z;World Cup offers investors a sporting chance;;"It’s a big question for many large companies but most sports fans do not care. Does commercial sponsorship of big sporting events yield any benefits to the corporations who are doing it?Official sponsors of this year’s soccer World Cup in Germany have paid up to €45m each for the privilege of becoming an official partner of the tournament and seeing their names beamed into billions of television sets around the world for a month.Now, thanks to a handful of investment products developed by JPMorgan, some investors in Germany and elsewhere will be at least as interested in the fortunes of the sponsors as in their national team.The investments will allow them to take a shot on whether the corporate sponsors will benefit from their participation.Distribution of the first of these products – a two-year note whose capital investment is guaranteed – begins in banks and savings institutions in Germany next week, and in Austria from February 13.It will allow investors to wager that eight of the 15 official partners of the World Cup will perform better on the stock market than their nearest competitors.The basket of sponsors comprises Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch, McDonald’s, Deutsche Telekom, Fuji Photo Film, Adidas-Salomon, Continental and Yahoo.For investors to get an annual coupon above their guaranteed cash back, those eight companies will have to outperform their competitors who are not World Cup partners: PepsiCo, Heineken, Yum! Brands, Telecom Italia, Eastman Kodak, Nike, Goodyear Tire and Google.Daniel McNeill, a product structurer in the bank’s exotic and hybrids group, said the idea came from JPMorgan’s German marketing team, which wanted a locally themed product that added in World Cup sponsors.Mr McNeill’s team said they thought that a similar product could be sold more broadly to investors across Europe and beyond.JPMorgan has developed at least three other products that allow investors to bet on the Dax index of blue-chip German stocks, on the basis that the tournament will bring the country an economic boost, or on the performance of the eight tournament sponsors.However, in initial market soundings, the outperformance product appeared to be the favourite in Germany.JPMorgan bankers say it benefits from the association with the World Cup. But retail investors have also displayed preferences for shorter-maturity products in recent months and like the outperformance – or “alpha” – feature of the instrument.The products are structured using equity derivatives, from which JPMorgan makes its profit. Distributors are expected to take a commission of up to 1.5 per cent. The notes will be sold in minimum €1,000 denominations, but most retail investors are expected to invest up to €50,000.The coupons are subject to a cap of 12 per cent at the end of the first year and
24 per cent at the end of the second year.Though it has no retail distribution arm, JPMorgan has developed a significant business structuring retail products for the German and Austrian markets. Over the last four years, it has structured and sold about 300 separate products through retail banks there, its bankers say.But it is not the only bank trying to tap into World Cup fever. Other banks are getting in on the act too, with products that, for example, pay out rewards if the German stock market beats the Brazilian market over the course of the tournament, or the year."
876;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-01-29T19:24:48Z;France fearful over deal’s effects;;In those rare moments when France allows itself to feel a sense of pride about its position on the world economic stage, Arcelor is often cited as a symbol of industrial success, along with EADS the Franco-German aerospace group.After decades of restructuring, billions in investment and thousands of job losses, France was the driving force behind an industrial merger bringing together French, Spanish and Belgo-Luxembourg steel interests that created a successful world champion.So Mittal Steel’s hostile €18.6bn ($22.65bn) bid for the company has come as a severe shock in France, where Arcelor is still considered a “flower of French industry”, despite its European pedigree.Within hours, politicians and union leaders were urging prime minister Dominique de Villepin to stop Mittal acquiring Arcelor, which employs almost 30,000 people in France.Even the nominally liberal finance minister Thierry Breton, the former head of France Telecom, voiced his concerns “about the way in which this takeover offer has been carried out, particularly with regard to its hostile nature”.Politicians remember all too vividly the experience of letting Alcan of Canada acquire Pechiney, the aluminium group.Despite repeated pledges on jobs, Pechiney sites have been shut down and the experience of a foreign hostile bid remains a bitter one for many in France.But it is unclear what the government can do to stop Mittal’s approach.It owns no shares in Arcelor, and privately many admit it wants to avoid another Danone affair. The political furore unleashed last summer, when PepsiCo of the US was rumoured to be interested in buying the French yogurt maker, was widely seen to have damaged the country’s business reputation.But the bid has also raised anxieties elsewhere. In Spain, union leaders and at least one regional government have expressed concerns about job cuts at Arcelor’s six plants.In Luxembourg, where Arcelor is the largest private employer, the economics ministry said that up until now it had been happy with Arcelor’s social and industrial model.But it was unclear what effect the Mittal offer would have on Arcelor’s employment or investment in the country.Mr Mittal is expected this week to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg’s premier.Winning the government’s support could be important to Mr Mittal as Luxembourg is Arcelor’s single biggest shareholder, with a 5.6 per cent stake.
877;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-01-24T22:18:17Z;Soft drink producers bow to pressure;;Soft drink producers will on Wednesday announce a voluntary ban on advertising to children throughout Europe in response to rising fears about childhood obesity.The measure is part of a wide-ranging code of practice agreed by Unesda, an association that represents the €38bn European non-alcoholic drinks industry, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.Soft drink producers have been under pressure to agree tougher self-regulation since Markos Kyprianou, the European Union’s health and consumer affairs commissioner, threatened the industry with EU legislation if it failed to curb advertising to children.The Unesda proposals, seen in advance by the Financial Times, will be reviewed on Wednesday at a meeting of the EU obesity “platform” - a forum set up by Mr Kyprianou last year to encourage dialogue between the European Commission, the food and drink industry, and health and consumer groups.Other measures agreed by soft drink producers include a ban on sales in primary schools and an increase in choice of beverages, including water, juices and low-calorie brands, in secondary schools.Unesda will pledge that school vending machines should be free from company branding and instead show images and messages promoting healthy lifestyles.The group will also make a commitment to increase nutritional information on packaging, widen choice of serving sizes and support health education programmes.A person close to Unesda said the industry aimed to meet its new commitments by the end of this year.Unesda’s initiative comes five months after the American Beverage Association, which represents the US soft drink industry, announced voluntary restrictions on sales in school vending machines.Health campaigners are likely to be sceptical about what difference Unesda’s proposals will make because some of the measures are already observed by the main soft drink producers.Coke and Pepsi, for example, have a longstanding policy of not advertising to under 12s.Critics say soft drink companies can still target children via indirect marketing, such as endorsements by sports or pop stars and product placement in films and TV.Soft drinks are widely viewed as a significant cause of obesity because a typical 12oz serving contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar - the entire recommended daily intake for an adult.Beverage producers have argued it is unfair to make them a scapegoat for a problem that has multiple causes, including reduced physical activity.But the industry, led by Coke and Pepsi, has gradually accepted the need to make concessions in order to avoid having more draconian regulations imposed. In a presentation delivered to the EU obesity “platform” ahead of Wednesday’s meeting, Unesda said it “recognised its responsibility to play a positive role in tackling these [health] problems, together with other relevant actors”.The CIAA, the food industry’s umbrella group in Europe, came up with a set of voluntary commitments last November, while insisting that obesity was caused mainly by sedentary and unbalanced lifestyles.Mr Kyprianou is expected to give his final assessment on whether the voluntary measures go far enough around March.A spokesman for Mr Kyprianou last night said the Commission was “very happy’’ that soft drinks companies were coming forward with their own self-regulation plans.
878;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-01-23T18:47:24Z;Is ‘it’ the future of advertising?;;A few years ago, the argument could be made that the BBDO Worldwide advertising agency just wasn’t made for these times. It could still create flashy television commercials – it was the agency, after all, that accidentally set Michael Jackson’s hair ablaze at a shoot for Pepsi – but that began to seem rather quaint given the growing importance of other media.Today that argument does not wash. BBDO, the largest advertising agency in the world’s biggest marketing services group, Omnicom of the US, is on a roll. In the last year, it has won more than $1bn in new accounts (measured by client spending), adding such names as Ebay, Bank of America, and Motorola to a client roster that included General Electric, Pepsi and Gillette. If it had not been for the defection of Visa to another Omnicom agency, TBWA\ Worldwide, its year would have been nearly perfect.The results have raised the question of how BBDO has done it, and when Andrew Robertson, its chief executive, and David Lubars, its North American chief creative officer, give their answer, the remarkable thing is that it can be summed up in a word.It is “it”.The “it” in question is an example of what Mr Lubars calls a “reductionist nugget” – the Holy Grail of the new BBDO. By that, he means an idea so powerful, yet so adaptable, that it can be used as the basis of a marketing campaign that works in any medium – a television commercial, a website, a word-of-mouth campaign, an outdoor poster or even a package design.BBDO developed “it” in response to the creative challenge posed by one of its new clients, Ebay – the online marketplace that is itself a symbol of the “new economy”.“They are a very complicated client,” Mr Lubars says. “They don’t make or sell anything. Other people use them. They are like an enabler, a host. What they do is like air or gas.”BBDO’s campaign began with a similarly nebulous quality. For several days last autumn, BBDO promoted “it” itself. Posters of a brightly coloured “it” began to appear on city streets. A website came to life with video evidence of the global popularity of “it”. The message was emphasised in television advertisements that featured an unnamed actor stepping aside to reveal “it” – the letters “I” and “t” perched on a pedestal like a work of art in a museum.“Introducing the new It,” the actor said with all the gravitas of a supporting player in a soap opera. “With sleek design and incredible handling, it can turn on a dime. It can hold up to 2,500 of your favourite songs. It can cook anything from succulent chicken to chateaubriand. It doesn’t lose suction. It was designed by German engineers and developed in Sweden by renowned Japanese scientists. It has over 17,000 lines of resolution. It.”It was only several days later that the public was let in on the joke. “Whatever it is, you can get it on Ebay,” the advertisements said now, still treating the word “it” – rendered in the typeface of the Ebay logo – like a product itself.“We have given them a physical manifestation of the cerebral thing that they do,” Mr Lubars said. “What is ‘it’? ‘It’ is anything. Then ‘it’ became TV. ‘It’ became print. ‘It’ became online. ‘It’ became guerrilla [marketing]. ‘It’ became all these things because an idea can go anywhere.”The Ebay campaign only began running in the US at the end of last year, but officials of the online company mentioned their marketing efforts as a factor in strong fourth-quarter results, which added to the growing sense of vindication at BBDO.Only a couple of years ago, BBDO was an agency in transition, if not turmoil. Global leadership was turned over to Mr Robertson, then 43, a Zimbabwean-born one-time wunderkind of the London advertising world who had already served as chief executive of its London unit, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO as well as WCRS, another UK agency.Mr Robertson wasted no time in displaying the taste of a new generation, replacing BBDO’s long-time creative leader in New York, Ted Sann, with Mr Lubars, a BBDO veteran who had gone to rival Fallon, where he made his name by helping to create a series of internet films for BMW, the carmaker.Together, Mr Robertson, now 45, and Mr Lubars, 47, look like the stars of a production of The Odd Couple. Mr Robertson is the advertising world’s equivalent of a Brancusi sculpture – stylishly dressed in braces and bold ties, he is so polished he glows. Mr Lubars, by contrast, tends to look as if he has just rolled out of bed.But they are kindred spirits in their belief that BBDO did not need to be fixed, only redirected – an assessment shared by outside analysts such as Lauren Rich Fine of Merrill Lynch. She says creative people at agencies paid so much attention to television because they were encouraged to do so. By changing incentives, agency executives can change behaviour. “I don’t think it’s that hard to take that same creative mind and let it loose,” she says.In that sense, Mr Lubar’s “reductionist nugget” is a creative filter – a test of whether an idea is sufficiently mobile to work in different media.“The insight that forms the work, that’s a timeless thing – great insight, great work, no matter what era,” Mr Lubars says. “[Now], it’s got to have such legs that I can go more than three places. Not everything works in every medium, so that’s hard to do.”One consequence of this focus is that advertising may become more visual. The “it” of the Ebay campaign works both as language and as a sculptural element. “It is a much more visual medium,” Mr Lubars says.Mr Robertson argues that BBDO’s emphasis on cross-media ideas has become common across the creative industries. He says he saw a similar dynamic taking shape during a recent visit to Electronic Arts, the video game-maker based in Redwood City, California.“Guys who are into sounds now – guys who want to make music – aren’t going into the record business,” he says. “All the kids that when we were growing up would have formed bands are now creating soundtracks for video games. The forms are changing. There are many, many more forms.”Mr Lubars says BBDO is working on ways to turn its advertising ideas into entertainment concepts – maybe even situation comedies – and Mr Robertson looks forward to the day when consumers will not just tolerate advertising but pay for it, which sounds implausible until you think about how many people buy T-shirts with corporate logos.“Content can earn time with consumers that you cannot buy – can earn engagement with consumers that you cannot buy,” he says. “You can use that time to change what people do. You can use that time to change people’s behaviour. But it’s got to be really good.”That is wishful thinking, of course. But it may also be one of the big reasons that BBDO has been doing so well in recent months. It is run by real advertising people. Their glass is always half full – and it always tastes better than Coke. Blind taste tests prove it, you know.WHEN THE TV GETS A MIXED RECEPTIONAndrew Robertson, chief executive of BBDO Worldwide, is well suited for life today as the leader of an advertising agency. He thinks I Love Lucy is boring, writes Gary Silverman.Traditionally, advertisers and their agencies liked television shows such as I Love Lucy because they gathered large audiences. At one point, Mr Robertson says, I Love Lucy was watched by 52 per cent of US households.But there was always a flaw in this marketing model. A household television set may have been tuned to a particular programme but this did not mean that everyone in the room was enjoying the show – or even paying attention. Not all people watching Lucy loved her – and that probably made them a less receptive audience for advertisers.“If you happen to watch television late at night you will realise that actually I Love Lucy was pretty boring,” Mr Robertson says. “She had her moments, but it wasn’t worth 52 per cent of the households.”To Mr Robertson, the fragmentation of network television audiences – a product of the rise of the internet and other media – represents an opportunity for advertisers to reach more consumers on their own terms.“What has happened is that technology has made it easier for people to do what they want to do,” he says. “You can look at that as a huge threat or as an opportunity. The threat is you don’t get anything by right. You don’t get consumer engagement just because people are available to you.”The opportunity is to create advertising content that is interesting enough to attract its own audiences. It is a tall order – as anyone who ever watched the title character in I Love Lucy try to break into show business knows. Pleasing the public is tough.“You only get consumer engagement by earning it,” Mr Robertson says. “It’s not about better ads in the break. It’s not about having the best soft-drink commercial in the category. It’s about: I want to engage with you now, for a few seconds, a minute, or hours ideally, and you have the option of going to a million other places by touching a button. If I can create something that is compelling enough, you are going to stay with me. If I can’t, you’re gone.”LUCKY STRIKE OPENS P&G’S DOORThe BBDO Worldwide advertising agency is not only good. It is also lucky.Procter & Gamble’s $57bn acquisition of Gillette last year represented a stroke of good fortune for BBDO, the largest advertising-agency network in the world’s biggest marketing services group, Omnicom of the US.BBDO has produced Gillette’s advertising for decades, but neither it nor any of the other creative advertising agencies owned by Omnicom worked for P&G.That matters because of P&G’s unique position in marketing services. Agencies are keen to work with P&G because it is not only the world’s biggest advertiser, it is the most sophisticated. Working for P&G is a learning experience like no other.By virtue of the Gillette deal, BBDO became a “P&G agency” at an opportune time. Jim Stengel, P&G’s global marketing officer, has been expanding its roster of agencies – for instance, by shifting its Eukanuba pet food brand from the Saatchi & Saatchi unit of Publicis of France to Wieden + Kennedy, the agency behind Nike’s “just do it“ campaign.Mr Stengel also sounds impressed with Omnicom and BBDO. Indeed, at the Association of National Advertisers convention in Phoenix, Arizona, last October, he could be seen locked in friendly conversation with Andrew Robertson, BBDO chief executive.“Bringing Omnicom and [Omnicom chief executive] John Wren and Andrew and [David] Lubars [BBDO chief creative officer in North America] and all[in] is going to make us a better company,” Mr Stengel said.The links between P&G and BBDO have prompted chortling at Omnicom. After all, P&G bought Gillette just weeks after Omnicom’s leading rival, WPP of the UK, paid more than $1.5bn in cash and shares for Grey Global, gaining its first P&G advertising agency in the process. Omnicom pulled off the same trick without doing a thing.
879;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-01-09T19:45:52Z;Golden Wonder decides to packet all in;;Golden Wonder, the crisp maker that invented flavoured crisps in 1962, on Monday went into administration after efforts to sell the company failed. Kroll, the administrators, blamed a highly competitive market, declining market share and pricing pressures for the company’s failure.Kroll is hoping to sell parts of the business and its brand names, protecting some of the 850 jobs, while crisp production is continuing.The company, founded in 1947 by a Scottish baker who used the Golden Wonder variety of potatoes to make crisps, was by 1966 producing the UK’s leading crisp. But rival Walkers, owned since 1981 by PepsiCo, gradually took market share from it, especially since 1995 when Gary Lineker, the former England footballer, appeared in its advertisements. It now dominates the crispGolden Wonder changed hands repeatedly, passing through Imperial Tobacco, Hanson Trust, Dalgety and two private equity firms, leaving it unable to tackle the Walkers threat or find new markets.It was bought in 2002 by the UK subsidiary of the family-controlled Yemeni company, Hayel Saeed Anam Group, but, despite the closure of one factory, losses mounted. In 2004 it lost £10.8m on sales of £87.8m. Kroll said losses in 2005 were “significant”. The group is understood to have a sizeable pension deficit.It was put up for sale in the autumn but its advisers, Grant Thornton, said the losses made it “prohibitive for anyone to pay a going-concern price”.
880;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2006-01-03T18:38:51Z;Brussels threat to overturn French law;;"The European Commission said on Tuesday that it would scrutinise a new French decree that protects certain industries from foreign takeover and warned it could “react” if the provisions were found to violate European Union law.A spokeswoman for the Brussels executive said the decree had not been given the go-ahead in spite of extensive consultations between the two sides in recent months.The decree, which came into effect on December 31, will give the French government the right to veto or impose conditions on foreign takeovers of domestic companies operating in as many as 11 sensitive industries. It puts heavier conditions on bidders from outside the European Union.The decree could also give France a weapon in its fight against the outsourcing of jobs. It allows the government to stop foreign owners of French registered companies transferring production abroad, if they are in any of the protected sectors.The amendment appears to have its roots in the controversial takeover of Péchiney, the French industrial flagship, by Alcan of Canada. In spite of pledges to maintain French jobs and production, Péchiney’s workforce has been scaled back significantly since the takeover in 2003.This has inc-reased French fears of foreign takeovers, which culminated in last year’s public outcry about a rumoured approach for Danone, the yoghurt group, from PepsiCo of the US.On Tuesday the commission said it would now study the decree. “We have to examine (it) to see exactly what sectors are protected and how far it goes. The Commission keeps all its rights to react,” a spokeswoman said.Brussels has the power to challenge member states in court if their national legislation violates European law – for example by illegally restraining the free flow of capital among member states or by violating a company’s right to set up branches in other EU countries.Winston Maxwell, a partner at law firm Hogan & Hartson in Paris, said the French decree had already been watered down to add-ress the Commission’s concerns.“Investors feared that the new decree would give a broad mandate to the French government to implement its vision of ‘economic patriotism’ but in fact the decree’s impact will be fairly limited,” he said.“The biotechnology sector will be most affected and in practice may mean that certain critical research and development activities re-main on French soil.”The French finance ministry said on Tuesday that it was confident the list would comply with EU rules. “You can see that in the sectors we have defined there is no yoghurt,” said a ministry official. The list clarified existing legislation passed in 2003, the ministry said, and made conditions more transparent for foreign inv-estors.The ministry said almost every other European country had laws protecting sensitive sectors from unwelcome foreign takeovers, with the exceptions of Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium.Vincent Brophy, a Brussels-based lawyer with Jones & Day, said there were only limited restrictions on foreign investment – “for example, in cases where there is an overriding public inter-est or in defence matters”.The key sectors are private security, if used, for example in nuclear or other secure installations; re-search or production of products that can be used in terrorist or chemical attacks; bugging equipment; information security; companies providing information technology security to government; dual-use technology for civilian or military applications; cryptology; companies en-trusted with defence secrets; arms; certain sub-contractors to the defence ministry; and casinos, where the government is concerned about money laundering."
881;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-12-30T15:58:08Z;Coke ends year on the better side of earnings;;As Neville Isdell approaches the end of his first full year in charge of Coca-Cola, he has plenty of reasons for satisfaction. Earnings have exceeded expectations for the past four quarters and sales volume is up about 5 per cent – more than double last year’s rate.“I think we’ve had a good 2005,” he told investors at a recent meeting in New York.One year of improvement, however, is not enough to convince sceptical investors that Coke has turned the corner after several years of disappointment.Coke shares have remained stagnant this year while those of PepsiCo, its rival, have risen about 15 per cent. Earlier this month, Pepsi’s market capitalisation grew larger than Coke’s for the first time.Analysts say Coke must prove its recovery is sustainable before investors take a more positive view. “Coke needs to prove that it can string two successful years together,” says Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup.Much will depend on the success of a raft of new products planned for 2006 and a fresh advertising slogan: “Welcome to the Coke side of Life”.Widening Coke’s product portfolio and freshening up its jaded advertising has been among Mr Isdell’s top priorities since taking charge in 2004.Coke has been slower than Pepsi to diversify beyond cola as consumers seek greater choice and healthier options, such as bottled water and juices. Soft drinks account for just 20 per cent of Pepsi’s sales compared with more than 80 per cent of Coke’s.Mr Isdell’s response was to commit an additional $400m of annual investment to innovation and marketing and appoint Mary Minnick, previously head of Coke’s Asian operation, to a new role overseeing the creative push.There have been some early successes, most notably the company’s rapid expansion in the fast-growing, high-margin US energy drink market, through its newly-launched Full Throttle brand and a distribution deal with Rockstar, an independent brand.“This time last year we had less than 1 per cent of the [US] energy drink market,” said Mr Isdell. “Now we have a 20 per cent share and are number two after Red Bull.”Overall, Coke’s non-carbonated beverage volume has grown about 11 per cent this year, led by PowerAde, an isotonic sports drink. New products for 2006 include Tab Energy – an energy drink aimed at women – and a fizzy version of Dasani bottled water.Coke is also trying to revive growth in its core soft drink brands – Coke, Sprite and Fanta.Much of the focus has been on sugar-free brand extensions, such as Coke Zero in the US, and flavour innovations, including Coke Blak, a coffee-flavoured cola that debuts in France next month.But the company has not given up on regular soft drinks. Although demand is declining in many western markets – where concern about obesity is greatest – sales continue to grow in developing countries, such as China, Russia and Brazil.Coke’s global soft drink volume is up 3 per cent this year and 75 per cent of revenues come from outside of North America.The company hopes a new global ad campaign – using the “Coke side of Life” slogan – will increase momentum in 2006.Coke has struggled for years to recreate the magic of its iconic advertising in the 1970s and ’80s, when slogans “The Real Thing” and “Coke is It” became worldwide catch phrases.The company recently appointed Wieden and Kennedy, a US ad agency renowned for its work with Nike, to lead next year’s campaign.Mr Isdell has sought fresh ideas and talent by shaking up senior management. Half of Coke’s top leadership is in new roles since he took charge and 40 per cent of those were external appointments.“The final piece of the puzzle,” said Mr Isdell, is acquisitions. He told investors these were likely to be small, bolt-on deals that helped fill regional gaps in Coke’s portfolio – the model being this year’s acquisition of Multon, a Russian company that gave Coke 25 per cent of the domestic juice market.Having described 2005 as a “reset year”, Mr Isdell is happy for Coke to be judged against long-term targets in 2006, excluding the impact of currency movements.Those targets call for growth of 3-4 per cent in volume and 6-8 per cent in operating profit. “There are still risks out there,” he said. “But we believe we are now stable enough to manage those risks.”Not all analysts are as confident as Mr Isdell. Many believe the company has still not fully grasped the extent of change in the beverage market. And, in the short term, they worry that negative currency movements and weak European consumption will depress next year’s earnings.“We do not believe that 2006 will be a breakout year,” says Corey Horsch, analyst at CSFB.
882;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Britvic float values company at £494m;;Britvic floated on Friday at 230p a share, at the middle of its expected price range, valuing the second-biggest maker of soft drinks in the UK after Coca Cola at about £494m ($862m).The company also increased the size of its offer from about 153m shares to 181m . In November, it set the initial public offering price range at 210p-250p.Three of Britvic’s four shareholders - InterContinental Hotels Group, Whitbread and Pernod Ricard - have sold about 181m shares, or about 84 per cent of the stock issued by the company. Whitbread said it would receive gross proceeds of £117.3m from the sale.Whitbread and Pernod Ricard have disposed of the whole of their interest in the company. InterContinental, the biggest shareholder, sold 77 per cent of its stake and granted an over-allotment option over a further 23m shares. InterContinental said that if it exercised that option in full, disposing of its entire holding, it would result in total proceeds of about £235m.Pepsi, the fourth shareholder in Britvic, has retained its 5 per cent stake. Britvic has exclusive rights to distribute Pepsi brands in the UK for the next two decades. It makes Pepsi and 7UP in the UK, and the brands account for about 40 per cent of its total sales by volume.“We are delighted that the global offer has been so well received and we welcome the new shareholders,” said Paul Moody, Britvic’s chief executive.“The high level of interest demonstrates that investors recognise the potential within Britvic and have confidence in our ability to drive future growth. We look forward to starting life as a public company and to delivering value to our shareholders.”Shares in Britvic had risen 3p to 233p in early trade in London.
883;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-12-07T17:46:37Z;3M taps chief executive after six-month search;;"3M on Wednesday named George Buckley as its new chief executive following a six-month search by the US industrial and technology group.The maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes tapped British-born Mr Buckley, 58, from Brunswick, a US company that makes leisure boats, fitness equipment and sporting goods.He joins with a reputation for financial discipline, having refocused Brunswick on the marine business during his five-year tenure, selling non-core assets and cutting debt built up during an acquisition spree in the 1990s.Associates in the Chicago business community said he was operations driven and not afraid to take unpopular decisions, such as this year’s move to shift production of bowling balls from the US to Mexico.Mr Buckley will start immediately and also assume the chairman and president titles vacated in June when James McNerney left to head Boeing, the aerospace group.Analysts credited Mr Buckley for his stewardship of a highly-cyclical business, whose stock price climbed by 150 per cent while he was at the helm.An engineering graduate from the University of Sheffield in England, Mr Buckley has spent much of his career in the US, first at General Motors and then at Edison Electric.He is only the second outsider to lead 3M, having been chosen above internal candidates including Brad Sauer and Jim Stake, who respectively head 3Ms healthcare and display and graphics units.Robert Morrison, a former PepsiCo vice-chairman who led the company on an interim basis since July, was also seen as a potential contender.""George Buckley is a proven CEO with a terrific blend of strategic, business and analytical skills, and an excellent record of driving both sales growth and operational efficiency in a wide range of global businesses,"" said Mr Morrison in a statement.Mr Buckley will take charge of a company with annual sales of $20bn, four times the scale of his previous employer. He is due to give an investor presentation on Thursday."
884;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Britvic IPO to value drinks group at up to £537m;;Britvic, the UK soft drinks company, will have a market value of up to £537m ($924m) when it floats on the London Stock Exchange later this year.The company, which produces Robinsons and Tango, on Friday set the price range for its IPO, announced earlier this month, at 210p to 250p. This implies a market capitalisation range from £451m to £537m. The company has £320m in net debt.The three largest shareholders in Britvic - InterContinental, Whitbread and Pernod Ricard - will sell 153 million ordinary shares, around 71 per cent of the total share capital. Of that, InterContinental will offer 77 million shares, representing 75 per cent of its interest in the company.InterContinental currently owns 47.5 per cent of Britvic, while Whitbread and Pernod Ricard have 23.75 per cent stakes.Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, the joint bookrunners for the offer, have also agreed up to 15 per cent, or 22.9m, additional shares, will be offer in the case of high public demand.Whitbread has said that it too expects to sell 75 per cent of its interest in Britvic, garnering between £80.3m and £95.6m, excluding the greenshoe option. Whitbread will also receive a special dividend of £23.4m.But Pepsi, which invested in Britvic in 1987, has said it will retain its 5 per cent stake. Britvic distributes Pepsi and 7UP in the UK and will next year take on Gatorade, the fast-growing sports drink. Britvic also has first refusal on any new carbonated drinks developed by Pepsi.Britvic expects to announce the final offer price, and final detail of the number of shares to be sold, on or around December 9.It had previously targeted a public offering between 2005 and 2008 but decided to take advantage of the buoyant market for floatations in the UK this year.Floatations on the LSE have already topped £9bn this year, more than any year since the 2000 boom, lead by UK online poker company PartyGaming that debuted in June valued at £5.16bn.An influx of foreign companies has also boosted the market. Russian and former CIS companies have lead the charge, coming to the LSE in search of an improved international profile and exposure to institutional investors who face restrictions accessing rouble IPOs in Russia.KazakhGold, the parent company of gold miner Kazakhaltyn, on Friday set the offer price for its global depositary receipts at $15, the top end of the $12 to $15 range. The company expects to raise $176m when it floats on December 1 with a market value of $707m.It will be the second Kazakh company to have its primary listing on London’s main market. UK-incorporated Kazakhmys, Kazakhstan’s largest copper miner, is likely to join the FTSE 100 next month having raised £661m on its debut in October.With almost £700m in annual sales, Britvic is Britain’s second-largest soft-drinks maker behind Coca-Cola, which bought Schweppes in the UK from Cadbury-Schweppes in 1999. Cadbury this week sold the European arm of its beverages business to buy-out groups Blackstone and Lion Capital for €1.85bn.
885;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-11-23T00:50:52Z;Punjabi farmers tempted by taste of success;;"If all goes to plan, Mohinder Jeet Singh Ladhra will soon grow more than a dozen acres of Florida’s sweetest and juiciest oranges on his farm in Jalandhar in Punjab state.Like all farmers in the heavily agricultural northern Indian state, Mr Ladhra harvests mostly wheat and rice – India’s two main food staples – on his 72-acre farm.However, four decades of intense cultivation have led to a precipitous drop in the underground water level and accelerated soil degradation.This, and a desire to earn more, have led the farmers to join with the state government and PepsiCo of the US to experiment with planting different varieties of citrus fruit from Florida and California, whose soil and weather are comparable with those of the Punjab.“It solves the water problem and they are saying it is more profitable,” said Mr Ladhra, who has already planted the citrus stock on three acres. He is ready to increase that to 20 acres if the crop is successful.PepsiCo is not a newcomer to contract farming in Punjab, having introduced the state’s farmers, including Mr Ladhra, to the harvesting of higher-yielding US varieties of potatoes, tomatoes, chillis and peanuts over the past 15 years. But this is by far its most daring experiment.For PepsiCo and other western food companies, this kind of supply chain initiative is critical to establishing long-term competitiveness in one of the world’s fastest- growing consumer markets.India is already PepsiCo’s fifth largest market outside the US – Pepsi-Cola beverages and Frito-Lay snack foods generate annual sales of $700m (€598; £409m) in India compared with $264m for Coca-Cola.For Punjab state, 70 per cent of whose gross domestic product is linked to farming, the project could mean a dramatic shift from low-value grains to value-added horticultural cultivation of fruits and vegetables. A quarter of the state’s agricultural revenues could come from citrus by 2015, estimate Punjab officials.“The government wants diversification, the farmers want higher income and the company wants local availability of citrus,” said Abhiram Seth, PepsiCo India’s executive director of exports.PepsiCo imports its orange concentrate for juice sold in India because the home-grown oranges are smaller, bitter and have a thinner skin than western varieties.The US company, through its Tropicana division, is one of two large companies in India’s packaged fruit juice market, which has developed overnight in line with the country’s rapid embrace of western-style consumerism.PepsiCo’s $1.1m contribution to the project is small by comparison with the state government’s $22m investment in citrus farming. But PepsiCo says it is bringing its technical expertise and management skills to the project. Punjab is also setting up two $8.8m fruit concentrate processing plants by late 2006.“The government is looking for a paradigm shift,” said Himmat Singh, managing director of Punjab Agri Exports Corp. “We want to tap into the higher value-added chain.”The Punjab government sold 22,000 trees to farmers this year and plans to sell 250,000 next year, followed by 2m in 2007. The first saplings, planted in 2002, should bear fruit in 18 months.PepsiCo first sold juice in India in 2001 and expects to source all its orange concentrate locally by 2011.For India, the project could offer a clue on how to revitalise agriculture, which is growing at about 2 per cent a year compared with the country’s overall growth of about 7 per cent."
886;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-11-21T20:58:13Z;Chocolate keeps business sweet at Cadbury;;When Todd Stitzer, Cadbury Schweppes chief executive, met with investors in Dallas last month, he assured them that the London-based confectionery company remained committed to the US beverages market.“As long as the American business continues to deliver superior business performance we do not see any reason to exit that business,” he said.Cadbury holds the number three position in the US soft drinks market, after Coke and Pepsi, with a 17 per cent share. Its key brands are Dr Pepper, 7-Up and Snapple tea.But Monday’s sale of Cadbury’s European beverages arm to a private equity consortium for £1.27bn ($2.17bn, €1.85bn) has renewed speculation that the company will eventually dispose of its US beverages operations to focus on confectionery.“This could be the first step in getting rid of their beverage business and becoming a pure play confectionery company,” says Andrew Wood, equity analyst at research firm Bernstein.Cadbury has a 10 per cent share of the global confectionery market, putting it ahead of competitors Mars, Nestlé, Hershey and Kraft.Cadbury’s exit from European beverages had been expected. Cadbury initially tried to get out of it in the late 1990s by agreeing to sell most of its soft drink brands outside the Americas to Coca-Cola. However, the deal was blocked in several European countries by competition authorities, leaving Cadbury with a sizeable European drinks business.Forced to keep some brands, Cadbury made its drinks business bigger, buying Orangina from Pernod Ricard in 2000. But when the unit began hindering growth – Cadbury reported organic growth of 5.9 per cent in the first half but would have recorded 6.6 per cent without European beverages – the company decided it was time to get out.Cadbury’s beverage business is now limited to four markets: the US, Mexico, Canada and Australia. With confectionery sales growing faster than its US beverages sales, analysts believe the company could spin off or sell its remaining drinks operations once it has completed its “Fuel for Growth” cost cutting plan in 2007.Merrill Lynch’s Robert Waldschmidt is among the analysts forecasting a sale of Cadbury’s US beverages arm, and estimates that the business is worth £6.4bn. “We believe that the European beverage disposal sets out a roadmap to the eventual demerger of the US beverage asset.”Ken Hanna, Cadbury’s chief financial officer, insists that the company has no immediate plans for its US beverages operations. “The US business is a very strong, very good business and highly cash generative,” he said. “Our portfolio seems to be what consumers want – lighter, fruitier drinks.”The group has been outperforming Coke and PepsiCo in the US, due largely to strong growth in Dr Pepper at a time when most soft drink brands are in decline amid consumer concern about health and obesity.Cadbury says it plans to use most of the cash it gets from the sale of the European business to pay down some £4.3bn in net debt.But analysts say that the company could also use some of the cash to make acquisitions in confectionery, increasing the distance between it and its competitors – particularly Wrigley, which admits to losing market share in some areas to Cadbury.Mr Hanna concedes that future acquisitions are more likely to occur in confectionery than beverages, although he stresses that investors should not expect another deal as large as Adams, which cost Cadbury $4.2bn. “Most of our investments will be smaller bolt-on acquisitions in emerging markets …and most of them are likely to be based on confectionery.”
887;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:03:45+0000;Cadbury nets ?1.85bn from European sale;;Blackstone and Lion Capital, the buy-out groups, on Monday won the auction to acquire Cadbury Schweppes? European beverage arm for ?1.85bn (?1.27bn, $2.17bn), snapping up some of Europe?s best known soft drink brands.The duo won against heavy competition from rival private equity firms, including the UK?s Permira and PAI of France. PAI had been working with PepsiCo before Cadbury shut the US drinks group out of the process.The business, which owns brands including Schweppes, Orangina, Oasis and TriNa, was acquired on a multiple of 9.5 times forecast 2005 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of ?195m. It is expected to generate surplus cash of about ?160m on sales of ?1bn this year.The deal is the biggest private equity transaction in the European food and beverage industry, according to Dealogic, the global data provider. It also helps Goldman Sachs, which advised Cadbury, keep pole position in the European advisory league tables.Cadbury said it intended to focus on its ?faster-growing confectionary and other beverage businesses?, with sale proceeds used to pay down net debt of ?4.3bn at the end of June.Buy-out groups were attracted by Cadbury?s strong brands, cash flows and margins, and scope to improve management. Cadbury regarded the business as peripheral since an attempt to sell it to Coca-Cola in 1999 was blocked by competition authorities.Javier Ferran, the veteran Bacardi executive who joined Lion Capital this year, will chair the business.Cadbury has agreed a ?92.5m break fee, 5 per cent of the deal?s value, if it does not accept the binding offer. The size of the fee partly reflects the need for the deal to be approved by a works council in France, one of its most important markets.Blackstone and Lion were advised by JPMorgan and NM Rothschild. Debt is being provided by JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America.The financing package totals close to ?1.5bn, and will include about ?300m of loans that will be repaid by selling high-yield bonds next year. Total debt will be about seven times ebitda.The sale is expected to be completed in January.

But PepsiCo, which initially invested in Britvic in 1987, will retain its 5 per cent stake.Paul Moody, Britvic’s managing director, said that while the UK soft drinks company planned to focus on organic growth in domestic markets in the short term, it eventually hoped to take advantage of PepsiCo’s global networks.Mr Moody, who will be chief executive of Britvic after the IPO, said: “To work with [Pepsi] in differentmarkets with some of our brands would be one of the real opportunities of the business.”going forward”.John Gibney, Britvic’s finance director, will retain keep his current position and Gerald Corbett, chairman of Woolworths, will become chairman. Britvic’s board will include four non-executive directors, including Joanne Averiss, a long-term member of PepsiCo’s legal department.Britvic has a small international business but is mostly focused on the UK market. It currently holds the UK distribution rights to Pepsi and 7UP, and next year will distribute Gatorade, the US company’s fast-growing sports drink. It also has the right to distribute any new carbonated drinks developed by Pepsi.Pepsi has been expanding into international markets as it diversifies away from carbonated drinks, and international sales now account for more than a third of its total. salesThis year it bought Punica, a German maker of fruit juices and juice drinks, and it is understood to have been in talks earlier this year about a possible takeover of Danone, the French food group.Britvic is the second-biggest supplier of take-home soft drinks in the UK after Coca Cola Enterprises. Last year Coke sold some 1.7bn litres of soft drinks to consumers to take home, more than double Britvic’s 758m litres, according to ACNielsen, the market research company.The IPO is being led by Deutsche Bank and Citigroup.
889;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-10-25T17:15:25Z;McDonald’s to add nutritional data to packaging;;McDonald’s is set to become the first fast food company to put nutritional labels on hamburgers and milk shakes, after the US group pledged on Tuesday to introduce “easy-to-understand” signs on most of its product packaging from next year.The move underscores how some of the largest food companies are moving to head off rising concern that cheap, fatty foods are among the biggest contributors to global obesity rates.It is also the clearest sign yet that food companies believe there is a competitive advantage in embracing the rapidly growing trend towards “health and wellness” in diets and lifestyles.“What we’re going to start seeing is divergence between some leading companies and others that feel they can ride out the storm because they have such a large consumer demand for products as they are now,” said Derek Yach, associate director at Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity.Kraft, maker of Oreo cookies, last year pledged to stop advertising certain junk foods to children under age 12. Frito-Lay, the snacks division of PepsiCo, flags low-fat versions of its products with a “green spot” logo.Larry Light, McDonald’s outgoing chief marketing officer, said: “We will not sit around watching what others do.” McDonald’s said the new labels would “convert scientific information into a customer-friendly snapshot” of a product’s nutritional value.The labels would use icons and bar charts to show calorie, protein, fat, carbohydrate and sodium levels. The chain had been working on the packaging over the past year, testing the new labels at restaurants in Scotland, Spain, Colombia and Hong Kong.It will roll them out at restaurants in Italy, to coincide with the Olympic Winter Games in February.McDonald’s aims to involve 20,000 restaurants globally by the end of 2006. It declined to say how much it would cost to implement the labels.Michael Roberts, McDonald’s president and chief operating officer, said the move was in line with the company’s goal of “building consumer trust”.Consumer activists in the US have long argued that current food labels on packaged foods are not sufficiently clear, preventing consumers from making informed choices.Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a US non-profit group focused on food and health issues, said the latest move by McDonald’s was “a useful step forward”. But he said it would be more useful if McDonald’s displayed nutritional information on menu boards in restaurants “so that people would have nutritional information before they buy products”.Also on Tuesday, McDonald’s’ popular Chipotle Mexican Grill chain filed for an initial public offering that could raise as much as $100m. McDonald’s owns a 92 per cent stake in Chipotle.

President Jacques Chirac, prime minister Dominique de Villepin and interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy all expressed their concern about Danone?s future.Shares in Danone were down 1.32 per cent in early trade at ?86.25.Danone releases its results on February 15.

He has taken a high profile in the obesity debate, a brave move for an executive whose products are soft drinks and snack foods.Latterly, he’s styled himself as a bit of a marketing guru, launching a book and DVD, The Best Job in the World, about building the Walkers brand.Jon Holmes, the sports entrepreneur who knows Glenn well, said on Wednesday that he was “a good organisational man”.Holmes said: “I cannot think of many people I have come across who could do a job like this any better.”Glenn said on Wednesday that he was “ruling nothing out and nothing in”.Also up for grabs are the roles of chairman and chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, responsible for achieving the construction of venues.As revealed here (Mudlark, August 16), David Higgins, chief executive of English Partnerships, is a leading contender to head the ODA.Huynh Thanh Phong, who fled his native Vietnam in 1979 as a boat person and returned in 1996 as chief executive officer of Prudential Vietnam, has a rendezvous with the Queen.Phong, 39, a Canadian citizen, will be invested on Thursday at Buckingham Palace as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. The OBE recognises his role in enhancing relations between Vietnam and the UK and developing financial services in the region.Mark Tucker, Prudential chief executive, personally recruited Phong in 1996 in Hong Kong where he was actuary for the Asian operations of the Canadian insurance company Manulife Financial. Phong worked for three years laying the foundation for the eventual opening of Vietnam to foreign insurers in 1999. The Pru was one of four pioneers and the only British one. It is now the largest life assurer there, with 1.3m policies and assets under management of nearly $500m (£285m).A senior Canadian business figure is set to play an important part in resolving one of sport’s biggest cases related to doping tests.Yves Fortier, chairman of Alcan and a director of Hudson’s Bay Company and Royal Bank of Canada and other companies, will be one of three judges when the Court of Arbitration for Sport opens a hearing on Friday in Lausanne into the cases of Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou.The controversy involving the two athletes overshadowed the start of last year’s Athens Olympic Games. A ruling in March by an independent tribunal of the Greek Athletics Federation cleared them of charges that they tried to evade doping controls but banned Christos Tzekos, their coach, for four years.The International Association of Athletics Federations appealed against that ruling, leading to this week’s proceedings.Although he clearly knows a thing or two about aluminium ingots, Fortier’s legal credentials are not to be doubted. He has been chairman of Ogilvy Renault, the Canadian law firm, for more than 13 years, concentrating in recent times on the field of international arbitration.He is a past Canadian ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations. In the late 1980s, he served as Canada’s chief negotiator in a fishing dispute with France.David Norgrove must have been extremely pleased this week after a French court decided that he – along with four other former Marks and Spencer executives – was not responsible for failing to follow local laws on staff consultation when the retailer decided to pull out of France in 2001.After all, Norgrove is no longer at M&S.

By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 10,552.78, while the broader S&P 500 index advanced 0.9 per cent to 1,227.86.The Nasdaq Composite index added 1.2 per cent to 2,141.22 with a lot of support from Ebay’s 6.1 per cent rise to $41.30 after analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston said they expected above-forecast results from the online auctioneer.Stocks were also lifted by the news that applications for unemployment benefits dropped after Hurricane Rita last week, while the gyrations of energy prices also attracted attention.In earnings news, PepsiCo rose 2.7 per cent to $56.56 after it reported above-expectations revenues.Research in Motion, meanwhile, saw its shares lose 9.4 per cent to $70 after investors took in its quarterly results and fretted over the growth in new subscriptions for the provider of mobile email services and devices.Its loss was modest compared with that of Cypress Bioscience, which tumbled 56.5 per cent to $5.53 in one of the worst showings at the Nasdaq. This followed news that a study the company did with Forest Laboratories on a fibromyalgia treatment failed to meet its goals. Shares in Forest Labs lost 9 per cent to $38.50.Also lower was Amerigroup, the healthcare services provider that saw its stock tumble 41.6 per cent to $19.81 after it warned investors of a loss in the upcoming quarter owing to rising healthcare costs.In other deal news, E*Trade agreed to buy the BrownCo brokerage division of JPMorgan Chase for $1.6bn in a second important acquisition for the online broker this summer. Shares in E*Trade rose 5.5 per cent to $17.22 while JPMorgan gained 1.3 per cent to $34.35.Two stocks making a debut received a warm welcome from investors on Thursday, with WebMD shares jumping 39.4 per cent to $24.40 on the first day of trading for the online healthcare portal.Also debuting on Wall Street was Global Partners, a fuel distributor, which saw shares surge 7.7 per cent to $23.70 in one of the best showings on the NYSE. However, four other new issues saw widespread selling.Shares in Ford Motor edged off 0.9 per cent to $9.86 following reports of the automaker’s plans to revamp its global supply chain.Cantel Medical, a medical services group, was up 11.8 per cent to $22.10 after it reported a 48 per cent jump in quarterly profits.
893;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Gatorade powers up growth at PepsiCo;;PepsiCo said “phenomenal” volume growth in the group’s Gatorade sports drink helped drive a better-than-expected 17 per cent increase in underlying third quarter net profits.Gatorade has become one of PepsiCo’s most powerful brands since it was acquired as part of the $13.4bn acquisition of Quaker Oats five years ago, offsetting decline in the company’s flagship cola brand.The deal has allowed PepsiCo to secure more than 80 per cent of US sports drink sales, one of the fastest-growing parts of the beverage market as health-conscious consumers shift away from sugary soft drinks.Gatorade’s success has come to haunt Coca-Cola, which had the opportunity to buy Quaker but walked away from the deal before PepsiCo stepped in.Coke instead developed its own sports drink, Powerade, which has been gradually winning market share but remains one-fifth the size of Gatorade.Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo’s chief executive, vowed to reverse the decline in Gatorade’s market share, which he attributed to supply shortages as sales exceeded expectations.He said demand was inflated by a summer of record-breaking temperatures in the US that left consumers gasping for cold drinks.Gatorade and PepsiCo’s other non-carbonated beverages, such as Aquafina bottled water and Tropicana juices, increased their US volume by 24 per cent, supporting worldwide beverage growth of 10 per cent.Carbonated soft drink volume was stagnant in the US but expanded internationally, helped by solid growth in sugar-free brands, such as Diet Pepsi.The company’s large snack food business, which includes Frito-Lay in the US and Walkers in the UK, saw its worldwide volume climb 4.5 per cent.Total net profits fell 37 per cent to $864m, or 51 cents a share, because of a one-off tax charge related to the repatriation of $7.5bn of overseas earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act.However, excluding exceptional items, net earnings increased by 17 per cent to 78 cents a share beating the 73 cents consensus forecast by analysts. Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, described the results as “impressive”.Mr Reinemund warned that rising commodity prices following the recent US hurricanes were putting upward pressure on costs. But he was “encouraged” by the company’s momentum entering the fourth quarter.Guidance for full-year operating profit growth was lifted to 9-10 per cent, from the previous forecast of 8 per cent.International sales continued their rapid expansion, with revenues up 17 per cent. PepsiCo has traditionally focused on its domestic market but international sales now account for more than a third of the total.Performance was strongest in developing markets such as India, Turkey, Russia and China. The company’s two largest international markets, Mexico and the UK, remained sluggish.Total revenues grew by 13 per cent to $8.18bn.
894;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-09-27T20:29:43Z;Wall St steady despite slide in confidence;;Taser International, the stun gun maker, saw its shares lose 13.1 per cent to $6.35 after it said the Securities and Exchange Commission was stepping up an investigation of the company to the point where it could subpoena documents.The decline came as Wall Street stocks proved that hope springs eternal by closing virtually unchanged in the wake of a report showing consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low.The report was the first evaluation of the impact of recent hurricanes on American consumers. It raised the prospect of slowing consumer expenditure in an economy that owed much of its recent expansion to the resilience of consumers and their willingness to borrow.David Rosenberg, economist at Merrill Lynch, noted this week that consumer discretionaries have been the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year and warned investors that there was a risk of disappointment next year, given that consensus forecasts see the sector as having the best earnings prospects in 2006. On the Dow Jones Industrial Average, initial declines in those stocks with more direct exposure to consumer spending patterns mostly faded away by the close. Thus, Wal-Mart, the retailer, was less than 0.1 per cent off at $43.10, while Home Depot lost 0.1 per cent to $38.39. McDonald’s lost 0.8 per cent to $33.01.By the close, this background saw a 0.1 per cent advance in the Dow to 10,456.21, while the S&P 500 index was flat at 1,215.66. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.2 per cent to 2,116.42.The day’s other data report appeared to do nothing to help sentiment, showing that new homes sales fell in August. However, homebuilders recouped some of their earlier losses.The news sent the Dow Jones US home construction index 0.6 per cent lower, with Toll Brothers down 1.6 per cent to $43.28. KB Home gave up 1.9 per cent to $72, Centex lost 0.8 per cent to $63.40 and DR Horton gave up 0.2 per cent to $35.50.Lennar, which reported above-expectation quarterly results after the Monday close, was 0.1 per cent off at $57.Other stocks in the news included ExxonMobil, which closed unchanged at $64.62 and Chevron, off 0.1 per cent at $64.18. The two oil groups received a downgrade and an upgrade respectively from analysts at JPMorgan.Meanwhile, in deal news, the shares of WellChoice rose 7 per cent to $75.51 after reports that WellPoint, the largest US health insurer, was set to acquire the company. WellPoint was 0.1 per cent lower at $75.01.News that profits grew by 7.3 per cent at Pepsi Bottling Group pushed the company’s shares up 3.1 per cent to $28.46.Movie Gallery, a DVD-rental chain, was 13.9 per cent lower at $11.04, not far from a fresh low point after the company announced that it would suspend its quarterly dividend in order to pay down debt. The stock is down almost 42 per cent for the year.Blockbuster, a rival, was down 1.3 per cent at $4.51.Netflix, which rents DVDs via the internet, improved by 1.4 per cent to $24.30.
895;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-09-27T17:40:18Z;Fruits of the rainforest in a profitable harvest;;For centuries the residents of Maués, a tree-covered area the size of Belgium tucked into a bend on the Amazon River, have cultivated a bright-red, caffeine-loaded berry called guaraná. Legend tells of guaraná’s potent aphrodisiac and medicinal powers and explains how it sprang up in the footprints of a pair of young lovers as they fled their warring tribes.At harvest time in November, the red berries pop open to reveal white pulp and black seeds that look like thousands of curious eyes.Locals pick the berries, then slowly toast the seeds in skillets to remove all traces of bitterness. Finally they are ground to a fine powder or pressed into bars, which can later be dissolved in water.“My father drank it every day, just like my grandfather, without sugars or sweeteners,” says Sidney Leite, the mayor of Maués. “It doesn’t taste great that way, but it definitely gives you energy.”The fruit’s energy-giving qualities have made it a popular ingredient in energy drinks around the world. Now, though, a new guaraná venture demonstrates how smart Brazilian producers are trying to add value at home and sell branded ­products overseas.AmBev, the Brazilian beverage company that buys most of the guaraná produced in Maués, uses it to make Guaraná Antarctica, the top-selling soft drink that is something of a national passion. The company has recently set its sights on introducing its Guaraná Antarctica brand to consumers around the world.version of a guaraná soft drink that has become a true national passion in Brazil over the years.Other Brazilian companies have seen the attractions of an export strategy. In the coffee industry, where Brazil has been a top exporter of unroasted beans for three centuries, roasting companies such as Café Bom Dia are making forays into the US market and selling branded coffee on grocery store shelves. Natura, a cosmetics company that works with local communities to produce natural resins for lotions, is looking beyond Latin America.AmBev gained control of Guaraná Antarctica five years ago – along with two-thirds of Brazil’s coveted beer market – when a new management team at Rio de Janeiro brewer Brahma took control of Antarctica, a family-run São Paulo brewer, and merged the two rivals. About a year later, in 2001, AmBev started exporting guaraná to Portugal, and soon after it entered Spain and Japan. Then the company turned its attention to acquiring beer assets across Latin America and quickly became the largest brewer in the region and the fifth largest in the world.AmBev surprised some Brazilians last year by surrendering control to go global, folding itself into Belgium’s Interbrew to form Inbev, now the world’s largest brewer. AmBev, however, continues to trade shares on the São Paulo Stock Exchange and answer for its own business in the Americas. Its managers at home are now aiming to ­capitalise on the uniquely Brazilian qualities of their drink to win new customers, initially in Spain, Portugal and Japan. So while part of the team has finessed its way onto the global brewing stage, executives at home say plans to export guaraná remain intact and they’re still studying ways to enter the competitive soft drinks market to introduce this uniquely Brazilian product to the world.“It is one of our priorities within the company,” says Rodolfo Coelho, the director of AmBev’s International Soft Drinks division. “We feel very strongly that we have a great potential product, but because it’s such a huge and competitive market we want to do it right.”To succeed would mark a special triumph for both AmBev and also Brazil. Like supermodel Gisele and football great Ronaldo, guaraná is a potent symbol of national pride at a time when Brazil is struggling to move beyond a political crisis and consolidate the economic gains of recent years.“Guaraná is a product that’s just Brazilian all over,” says Tatiana de Abreu Sá, the executive director of the Amazon Basin region for Embrapa, the government agricultural research ag-ency. Embrapa estimates that more than two-thirds of guaraná output currently goes to make soft drinks. Best-selling brands after Antarctica include Kuat and Jesús, both owned by Coca-Cola.Yet the obstacles are tremendous. The global soft drinks industry is dominated by such companies as Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Cadbury Schweppes. All command huge marketing budgets and have brisk innovation schedules for introducing new products to consumers.Another challenge lies in the small but very profitable “energy drink” segment of the global soft drinks market. Energy drinks are sold in small volumes at a premium price and infused with vitamins and stimulants such as sugar, ginseng, caffeine and taurine, a metabolic compound said to enhance caffeine’s effects. With the exception of Austria’s Red Bull, which pioneered the market when it licensed a recipe in Asia and introduced it to western Europe in 1987, most energy drinks contain guaraná.The segment could pose a serious challenge to AmBev’s ambitions. AmBev is working hard to distinguish its soft drink from the pack by emphasising its use of traditional guaraná from Maués – for others, while scrappy new players in the energy drink segment are trying to reduce, guaraná is typically reduced to the level of a mere ingredient. For all the legend surrounding it, scientists say the guaraná’s active ingredients are basically caffeine.“People who have made caffeine the focus [of energy drinks] are barking up the wrong tree. They just don’t understand the category,” says Rodney Sacks, chief executive of Hansen’s, a California-based natural drinks company that is making inroads into the segment with its Monster and Lost energy brands.With or without guaraná, experts agree that the ­window for entering this high-margin new business is rapidly closing.John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, predicts the category will be dominated within a year or two by four companies: Red Bull, Hansen’s, Coke together with Rock Star, and Pepsi.AmBev’s position is that it simply isn’t planning to market its guaraná brand as an energy drink. Rather, it aims to position it in the much larger soft drinks market. “We don’t want to be an energy drink for a number of reasons, and our heritage is one of them,” says Mr. Coelho.That may be true, but at home in Brazil AmBev began marketing its own kind of energy drink just last year. The brand, called Antarctica ZON (pronounced zone), is being billed as an all-guaraná pick-me-up and its slogan is straightforward. “ZON: Guaraná Antarctica with a lot more guaraná.” AmBev describes the product as something all-natural and milder than a typical energy drink but with more zip than traditional guaraná Antarctica.Mr. Coelho says AmBev has no plans at the moment to introduce ZON overseas. Nor are there any definite plans to start introducing its original Guaraná Antarctica brand to markets beyond Portugal, Spain and Japan. “What we’ve learned – and this is the reason for the speed we’re going – is that this isn’t just one of those mainstream flavors. Guaraná is unique.”That there might be growing interest in natural Amazon products like guaraná is the hope of Embrapa’s Ms de Abreu Sá, who says foreigners have always looked to Brazil’s rainforest as a source of unique natural materials with potential economic value.“Amazon exports have always been . . . raw natural resources. Right from the beginning, cacao represented nearly 100 per cent of exports and then of course there was rubber. . . we had cashews in the 1960s and then, from the 1970s, we started to see mining.”Today, minerals are the region’s largest single export and provide a large source of export revenue for Brazil as a whole. Thanks in part to the discovery of a world-class mine on the edge of the rainforest in Pará state, Brazil’s Companhia de Vale do Rio Doce has become the largest iron ore producer in the world.Guaraná production and other smaller scale efforts can also depend de-pends on the participation of private companies, says Ms de Abreu Sá, especially in areas like the Amazon Basin, a vast expanse of river-crossed rainforest much of which is inaccessible by rail or road. Local governments and communities often lack the financing to advance projects on their own.In Maués, AmBev has helped sustain the guaraná culture by pledging to buy the fruit at a fixed price. The promise was partly a cost-control move after overplanting in the 1980s caused guaraná prices to surge and crash.Even so, without AmBev, Maués growers might be undercut by cheaper producers nearer to transportation routes. And the tradition of toasting and grinding seeds into powder might fade. “AmBev plays an important role [in the community],” says Sydney Leite, the mayor of Maués. “ I always joke with them that they should do more to publicize the fact that they use the best quality guaraná.”Indeed, tapping into guaraná’s all-natural rainforest appeal is an essential element of AmBev’s strategy. “This is not one of those brands you just throw on the shelf. We’ve been doing extensive consumer research on how best to communicate its roots, its heritage and its authenticity,” says Mr ­Coelho. “We’re not going to tweak anything.”Some believe that rapid changes in the soft drinks business in the past decade have created opportunities for a company with the right strategy and brand.“Look at the Red Bull model. It is not about a low-cost, mass-market product. They incubated the business and really created some strongholds,” says Tom Ward, president of ­Auctive, a beverage consultancy in Boston.But there may be a final hurdle for AmBev, and that is its close relationship with Pepsi. AmBev is among the world’s largest Pepsi bottlers outside the US. Pepsi, in turn, has distributed Guaraná Antarctica for AmBev overseas.Pepsi introduced its own brand of guaraná soft drink, Josta, in 1996 and then discontinued it three years later. “Though it had a loyal fan base, it was a niche brand and its appeal wasn’t broad enough to succeed in our system,” Pepsi said in a statement. Then in 2001, Pepsi acquired SoBe, a Connecticut-based company that sells teas and juices infused with ingredients such as ginseng and ­guaraná. Today SoBe has two lines of energy drinks, Adrenaline Rush and No Fear.Would Pepsi want AmBev to distribute a guaraná soft drink in markets where it might compete with its own products? “We have a very strong partnership with AmBev and we try to keep an open mind on every potential opportunity,” says Pepsi.Working with Pepsi to introduce guaraná to new markets is “one of the options”, says Mr Coelho. “But we have to make sure we align Pepsi’s interests with the bottler’s interests and our interests. If we don’t, it could jeopardise a launch,” he adds.So far, there is no sign that Pepsi will be marginalised as AmBev dissolves into Inbev in coming years. Less than a year after the takeover in July, Inbev finally divested a majority stake in German Coca-cola bottler Bremer inherited three years ago. It also forged an agreement with Pepsi bottler PepsiAmericas to distribute Beck’s in Poland.For guaraná, there will always be 180m enthusiastic consumers in Brazil. The nation is already the world’s third largest soft drinks ­market and its population is growing more rapidly than that of western Europe. For the inhabitants of Maués, their local speciality will be in high demand in years to come.FACTORS FOR SUCCESSThe success of AmBev’s launch of Antarctica Guaraná on the world market depends on several key factors:■ Branding that emphasises the “natural” sourcing of its guaraná – from the heart of the Brazilian rainforest■ Antarctica will not be marketed as an energy drink – a crowded market■ The resolving of possible conflicts with Pepsi, a key customer in its bottling arm
896;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:23:06+0000;Observer - Europe;;More calls for le patriotisme économique in France: not to consumers this time but business magnates themselves. Thierry Breton, the finance minister, echoed prime minister Dominique de Villepin’s refrain on a visit to the lion’s den of Wall Street on Monday.Having noticed the tendency for US bosses to display the stars and stripes, Breton told a breakfast meeting: “I would like more French CEOs to have French and EU flags in their offices. It is important to be patriotic.“In the 21st century, it is extremely important that we recognise our history, our culture, where we come from,” he added.Not that he advocated protectionism, he said. Danone, for whom a rumoured bid by Pepsi created outrage in the French elite, was not on the recently published government list of strategic assets.Nevertheless, the US had gone too far in allowing its industrial base to move to China. France wanted to keep an industrial base, Breton said.Admitting that his most immediate task was reducing the deficit (something shared with the US) he stressed how politically unrewarding it was. As a former chief executive of France Telecom, he was a “specialist”, he joked.Brown humourGordon Brown’s bid to be the next British prime minister is warming up. The chancellor of the exchequer not only spent on Monday telling delegates at the Labour party conference about his vision for the best new thing since New Labour – a “renewal of New Labour” – but also took time out to tackle another possible obstacle to high office: his reputation for being a bit a dour and, dare one say, joyless.Nothing could be further from the truth, Brown told the BBC. Of course, conceded the son of a Sottish protestant minister, when you’ve got your hands on the public purse there is a need to appear prudent.But the truth is that “people who know me privately know that I am as able to laugh and joke as everyone else” (ie Tony Blair).Many of those present behind closed doors at Ecofin meetings would disagree. But then maybe fellow EU finance ministers have never been counted as friends.Whether future heads of government will get a cheerier reception remains to be seen.Tipping pointThe scales of justice in Cyprus seem a bit unbalanced. Observer’s man in the Nicosia coffee shop is wondering why Christodoulos Tselepos, head of the competition authority, was sacked the moment he was accused of complicity in forgery. His offence, it seems, was to ask for the minutes of a board meeting to be written up after the event.Tselepos’s case is in marked contrast with that of Dina Akkelidou, the former Cyprus health minister who now advises Markos Kyprianou, the EU’s health commissioner.Akkelidou was found guilty of interfering with judicial procedures – she asked the judge in a drugs case to treat the defendant leniently – but was allowed to stay in office until the conviction, which has now been overturned on appeal.Could politics somehow have been a consideration? Akkelidou is an influential member of Akel, the Cyprus communist party that is the senior partner in the current coalition government. Tselepos, on the other hand, was appointed by the previous right-of-centre government.Or was Tselepos just too zealous in his efforts to crack down on Cyta, the public telecommunications operator, which has been accused of abusing its dominant market position? The competition authority, unsurprisingly, is not very popular with Cyta’s pro-Akel management.Swiss BernieBernie Ecclestone, the controversial Formula One ringmaster, has apparently decided to elevate his sporting ambitions by purchasing a Swiss ski resort aptly named “Glacier 3000’’.Ecclestone and two other investors have agreed to fork out SFr5m ($3.9m) to save one of Switzerland’s most ambitious but unprofitable glacier skiing projects. It includes an extravagant high-altitude restaurant build by Mario Botta, the renowned Swiss architect, which was supposed to help attract Ecclestone and other jetsetters holidaying in neighbouring and glamorous Gstaad, but has proved a costly flop.At 74, the Briton is probably more interested in taking the air than taking to the piste. But he knows a bargain when he sees one.Several years back he bought the troubled Paul Ricard motor racing circuit in southern France and turned it into an upscale convention centre. Even if he can’t repeat that success, trying could take his mind off the monotony of F1.Tessy caseCongratulations to Henri, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, who is about to become a grandfather.The court announced tersely last week that his 19-year-old son Louis is becoming a father. In the traditional spirit of Luxembourger openness there was no mention of the mother.The unmarried woman is Tessy Antony, a 20-year-old who is the daughter of a local roofer and has been serving in the Duchy’s army.Given that Tessy has even done a stint with Nato troops in Kosovo, she can certainly be expected to put a good fight should her new ducal relatives prove less than accommodating.StalledInvestors seem about as keen on a grand coalition of German car companies as they do on a grand coalition of its main political parties.Shares in Porsche, which is considering taking a 20 per cent stake in rival Volkswagen, dropped 10 per cent on Monday, while VW’s hardly budged.
897;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-09-22T18:10:51Z;De Villepin stands by calls for ‘economic patriotism’;;Dominique de Villepin, France's prime minister, has urged his compatriots to rally behind his concept of “economic patriotism” to ensure they compete more effectively in a globalising world.“I am absolutely convinced that France has exceptional assets and has nothing to fear from international competition. But our forces must by united, organised, and mobilised so that we have the will to win together, business chiefs, social groups, the state, and workers,” he said in an interview in Les Echos newspaper. French talk of economic patriotism has provoked concern at the European Commission and in international boardrooms, amid fears that Paris could be lurching back towards protectionism.This summer, French politicians, including Mr de Villepin, warned PepsiCo, the US group, not to launch a hostile takeover bid for Danone, the publicly owned French foods company. The government is also drawing up a list of 10 strategic industries to be shielded from foreign ownership.However, Mr de Villepin rejected the idea that “economic patriotism” was a protectionist idea, saying France was only introducing the same arsenal of economic weapons used in the US and elsewhere. “I do not see why this idea of economic patriotism is modern in the US and outmoded in France,” he said.Mr de Villepin contradicted Les Echos' assertion that Danone was a global company. “I do not believe it. Danone's bases are in France: its milk collection and water sources are in France. The culture of the enterprise and its management remain profoundly French,” he said.He said he would introduce further fiscal measures to boost employees' shareholdings in their own companies, increasing the domestic ownership of French-based stocks.This month, Lindsay Owen-Jones, chairman of L'Oréal, the Paris-based cosmetics group, said that much of the political rhetoric about protecting French companies appeared to be incompatible with EU law. Mr de Villepin also responded to criticisms of France's weakening public finances, saying it was normal for budgetary policy to emphasise growth and jobs when oil prices were near $70 a barrel. But he added that France would stick to its commitments to keep this year's budget deficit below 3 per cent of GDP.
898;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:23:06+0000;Danone chief defends foreign bid furore;;Franck Riboud, the chairman and chief executive of Danone, has defended the protectionist outcry in Paris that followed speculation about a possible foreign bid for the French food multi-national.Danone’s share price surged in July after a burst of political chest-beating lent credibility to suggestions that PepsiCo was eyeing the group. President Jacques Chirac, prime minister Dominique de Villepin and interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy all expressed their concern about Danone’s future.Mr Riboud gave just one interview during the episode. However, Danone has now published on its website a series of written questions and answers on the topic – ostensibly aimed at employees – in which Mr Riboud said there was “nothing shocking” about the backlash.He said: “It is the duty of governments and political representatives in all parts of the world to do what they can to see that the decision-making centres of large businesses stay in their home countries. There is nothing shocking about that. I don’t think there was anything out of place in the way the French government and politicians showed concern over the possibility of a hostile bid.”While declaring that “the regulatory framework in France is one of the most liberal in Europe”, he added: “Every country in the world protects its priority sectors in one way or another.”However, at the same time he maintained that Danone did not want special treatment. “I have no desire to see regulatory defence measures, and I do not want to take cover and hole up in some sort of fort behind artificial walls.”Mr Riboud continued: “There have been no talks with PepsiCo and there are none now. I have read reports in a couple of newspapers saying that representatives of the two companies had at one time over recent months been in talks about some mysterious project for a tie-up. That is completely untrue.”Mr Riboud also ruled out an attempt to build an alliance of French shareholders controlling a 34 per cent blocking stake in the group.Danone shares fell 3.2 per cent to €90.95 on Wednesday. They peaked at €96.25 in July.
899;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:23:06+0000;French case of bossnapping;;"Hewlett-Packard has followed American compatriot Pepsi in attracting the wrath of the French establishment. While the drinks group was warned off yoghurt maker Danone, the computer company is under pressure to scale down its plan to cut 1,240 jobs.President Jacques Chirac has appealed to Brussels for help, while HP’s European boss will meet the employment minister next week, no doubt to face more political lobbying.But should Mark Hurd, HP’s recently appointed chief executive, be considering catching the next flight from California to Paris to try to defuse the growing political storm over the job cuts, he should first consider the fate of Bruno Vergobbi.In a worrying sign for any chief executives with operations in France, Vergobbi, head of state-owned ferry company SNCM, was this week apparently taken hostage by hardline CGT union officials while holding negotiations on a boat off Marseilles.Vergobbi spent Tuesday night “illegally confined” aboard the Méditerranée, a ferry blocked from travelling to Algeria by its striking crew, according to SNCM. The CGT denies he is being held against his will.Since joining HP, the tennis-playing Hurd has cultivated the image of a daring boss who likes a challenge, telling Observer recently: “I like to compete and try to win. I like the adrenaline of the game.”He’d certainly get that from a match with angry French union officials.Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s ambitious interior minister, likes to lecture his countrymen about the need to reform their failing social model and embrace the forces of global capitalism.But perhaps the presidential wannabe will be more sympathetic towards his elder brother Guillaume, who this week filed for bankruptcy at his small upholstery business, Tissage de Picardie.As head of the French textiles association, Sarko senior lobbied hard for quotas on Chinese imports and blames globalisation for the difficulties at his company, employing 85 staff in the Somme region of northern France.Indeed, Guillaume has had a tough year – running an unsuccessful split-ticket campaign with ex-finance minister Francis Mer to become co-heads of the Medef business federation.He says he expects “to be given some lessons” by critics of business bosses after his latest setback. Yet at least family ties should mean there will be no irritating lectures from his younger brother about the benefits of global capitalism.While Peter Mandelson, the European trade commissioner, may have few friends in the French textile business he has found one in China, in the shape of trade minister Bo Xilai.In an interview with state news agency Xinhua this week, Bo praises his negotiating partner to the hilt for the role he played ending the bra wars a fortnight ago.“The fact that Mandelson was willing to come to Beijing was a demonstration of goodwill of itself.“Particularly admirable is his understanding of oriental culture. He even knew that Zheng He set out for his expeditions to the western oceans in 1405,” he glowed.Bo also saluted his friend’s stamina. “He began the talks before he had time to overcome his jet lag,” he said. Meanwhile, Chinese vice-minister
Gao Hucheng insisted on taking part despite a bad back. Indeed, Observer hears the two sides stood throughout as no-one wanted to be first to sit.“Mandelson is my opponent in negotiations as well as my friend,” said Bo.The ex-British minister must have brushed up his Chinese history on the flight over. If Zheng’s voyages west had been followed up, the Chinese may have discovered Europe, rather than vice versa, says Mandy’s bookworm. “It’s a nice trade parable, a historical echo,” he says.Observer readers will recall the excitement, tinged with scepticism, that swept Italy recently when word spread that the next James Bond film might show the debonair agent driving a humble Fiat Panda.It now seems he won’t (his preferred vehicle is, of course, the snazzier Aston Martin). Still, when it comes to cars and the Italian police, truth is stranger than fiction.Italy’s highway patrol this week acquired its second Lamborghini sports car, intended for use in high-speed chases and medical emergencies.When they received their first Lamborghini last year, the police found teenagers begging to be arrested so they could spend a few minutes in it.This time, policemen have been queuing up for training courses in how to drive a car that zooms from zero to 100km an hour in four seconds and has a top speed of three times that. At a cool €50,000, the price may raise eyebrows at a time of a booming Italian budget deficit.Fortunately, both cars were donated by the Nando Peretti foundation, a charity named after a late Italian oil magnate.An interesting new tack from José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, on Wednesday.After accusing the leaders of its
25 member states of attacking the European project, he launched a savage attack on the Commission himself.Many laws it had proposed were absurd, there was too much regulation for the sake of it, it had failed to communicate and the acquis communitaire body of EU law was too long-winded and needed revising.Hardly news to encourage its 20,000 staff to follow their leader. How had they taken to his message? “He spoke to them last week and used more delicate language,” says Observer’s mole in the ranks."

This was the index’s highest closing level since May 17, 2002.Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax index, which sharply underperformed European markets after the inconclusive outcome to the weekend’s elections, rose 0.8 per cent to 4,962.86.Danone, the food group, gained 2.5 per cent to €93.95 as it remained the subject of takeover speculation, with two US companies – Kraft Foods and PepsiCo – in the frame. The latter was on Tuesday rumoured to have appointed investment banks Morgan Stanley and UBS as advisers to instruct it on any potential bid.Car stocks pushed higher as the sector recorded the strongest earnings momentum in the past month, according to data from research company FactSet. It said analysts revised their earnings per share forecasts for the European auto sector for 2005 to growth of 22 per cent, after having predicted only 10 per cent at the start of the year.German carmakers had suffered on Monday as hoped for employment reforms were seen being delayed by the political stalemate following Sunday’s elections. But looking at recent vehicle registrations data, Dorothee Hellmuth of Lehman Brothers felt: “German manufacturers were the clear winners over the past two months thanks to their new product line-up and the strength of their home market in August.”DaimlerChrysler, which reached a three-year pay deal with its Canadian workers on Tuesday to avert a strike, rose 2 per cent €41.95. BMW, which said it would buy back up to 29.23m shares or 3 per cent of its stock in its first ever buyback, added 2.5 per cent to €37.89. BMW was upgraded on Monday by Goldmach Sachs to “outperform” from “in line”. Volkswagen added 3.1 per cent to €47.22 and Porsche rose 3.2 per cent to €685 after forecasting increased German sales of its sports cars in the year ending July 2006.Deutsche Postreclaimed some of the previous session’s losses conceded after it confirmed its €5.47bn offer for Britain’s Exel. Fears of a bidding war faded, in spite of talk that other logistics groups may yet make a move.“UPS and Fedex may still be running the numbers over Exel and could come forward with a bid,” said one trader in London.Karl Green at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein however, concentrated on the attractive synergies. “Tax synergies and the longer-term strategic benefits suggest the acquisition will not destroy shareholder value,” he said. The shares ended up 1 per cent to €19.72.Deutsche Postbank, 50 per cent owned by Deutsche Post, rose 2.8 per cent to €45.81. Handelsblatt reported Deutsche Post chief executive Klaus Zumwinkel as forecasting that Deutsche Postbank would complete its purchase of German mortgage lender BHW Holding AG by the end of the year.Beiersdorf, the German maker of Nivea skin cream, added 2.4 per cent to €99.50 after Financial Times Deutschland reported that London-based private equity company Apax Partners was bidding for its BSN medical subsidiary.Denmark’s Moller Maersk, the world’s biggest container shipping company fell 3.1 per cent to DKr65,400 after UBS cut its rating to “reduce” from “buy” and lowered its target price to DKr60,000 from DKr70,000. The investment bank warned of slowing freight flows and higher capacity growth.AGF, the French insurer, reported a better-than-expected 8.5 per cent rise in first-half net profit. The company said it planned a significant dividend increase of 25 per cent to €3.25 per share.Separately, there has been some recent speculation that AGF’s parent, Germany’s Allianz, was likely to seek a buyout to fully take over its French peer. This followed Allianz’s move to buy out minority shareholders in RAS, its Italian subsidiary, last week.Shares in AGF were up 1.9 per cent to €78.55, while Allianz gained 0.8 per cent to €106.19.ASML, the chip making equipment maker, fell 1.6 per cent to €13.84. The Dutch company said it still expected third and fourth quarter shipments to fall. Peter Wennink, chief financial officer, said clients were cautious about ordering the company’s kit as demand was uncertain given the higher price of oil and weaker consumer spending.
902;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:23:06+0000;French minister seeks to soothe fears over protectionism;;Thierry Breton, France’s finance minister, on Monday sought to allay concerns about rising protectionist rhetoric in his country by saying that Paris was following the lead of the US in promoting economic patriotism and defending strategically important companies.Amid a political controversy about the threat of foreign takeovers of French companies, Mr Breton said the government was still finalising its list of strategic sectors but that it would be limited to defence and national security.“In the US there are lists of strategic sectors, which shocks no one and is seen as normal, particularly when it concerns sovereignty in terms of security, defence or internal protection. Well, the European Commission has not only authorised but encouraged [member] states to do the same,” he told the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris.“Of course, people have fun talking about the Gallic cockerel, etc, but that is not the reality. This does not mean protectionism or isolationism, it simply means there are moments when we can mobilise for the national account.”Last week, Charlie McCreevy, the European Union’s internal market commissioner, warned that he would sue the French government if it tried to block foreign takeovers without proper justification. “We will be vigilant as a Commission that this will not be allowed, because it would spell the end of the free market as we know it,” he said.Mr McCreevy’s remarks followed the publication of preliminary proposals from the French government to defend 10 industrial sectors, including casinos, and inflammatory rhetoric from French politicians warning PepsiCo, the US group, not to launch a hostile takeover of Danone, the French yoghurt maker.According to Les Echos newspaper, France’s State Council, which advises the government on legal issues, has also expressed concerns about whether the government’s draft decree conforms with EU law.Eric Morgan de Rivery, a partner at Jones Day, the international law firm, said the government needed to define clearly what sectors were affected and introduce transparent and proportionate procedures. “Until we have the text it is difficult to know whether it is really going to be another show of protectionism or whether it will be reasonable,” he said.“The Commission is nervous because the French have a pretty bad record of protectionism. But I hope they [the French government] know better now and they will do no more than other civilised nations.”
903;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-09-16T16:49:24Z;Eurofirst hits 40-month high on bid speculation;;European stocks maintained their upward momentum this week as bid and merger activity continued to buoy the markets and oil prices adopted a steadier tone.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended yesterday at a 40-month high of 1,213.86, up 0.6 per cent on the day and 0.6 per cent on the week.German stocks, however, were buffeted by uncertainty about the outcome of tomorrow’s general election. The Xetra Dax index, which ended last week above 5,000 for the first time since May 2002, quickly relinquished that level and fell sharply during the week, only to rally yesterday. The benchmark finally settled at 4,986.50, down 0.4 per cent over the five-day period.Takeover speculation provided several talking points. French food group Danone rose sharply as the market took the view that the French government was dropping its efforts to shield the company from predators.Talk earlier this year of a possible bid by Pepsico prompted President Jacques Chirac to vow to defend the company’s independence.But Francois Loos, French industry minister, said yesterday Danone must provide its own defence against a possible bid. The shares rose as high €94.85 before easing back to end at €92.60, up 2.3 per cent on the day but off 0.2 per cent on the week.The insurance sector saw some sharp moves this week after Germany’s Allianz unveiled plans for radical changes to its structure, including the buyout of minority shareholders in RAS, its Italian subsidiary.The news sent shares in RAS up by 6.6 per cent to €18.82 and prompted talk Allianz could make a similar move on AGF, the French unit of which it owns 58 per cent. AGF shares rose 8.7 per cent to €77.15 while Allianz fell 1.9 per cent to €107.Takeover rumours also lifted Thales, the defence electronics group, amid rekindled talk of a bid from aerospace group EADS did the rounds. Thales shares rose 2.2 per cent to €38.44 while EADS edged up 0.4 per cent to €28.30.TDC jumped 10.5 per cent to DKr338 following reports that two separate private equity groups were preparing to table bids for the Danish telecoms group.Forestry and paper put in one of the week’s best sectoral performances despite some negative analyst comments.Mathias Carlson at Deutsche Bank said the second-half outlook for the sector was gloomy. “Demand has eased significantly in North America year-to-date, and there are clear signs of a slowdown in Europe too, in our view,” he said. “An abundance of price hike announcements have hit the tape over the last two months. However, we don’t believe the price increases will stick.”But his remarks did not stop UPM-Kymmene rising 5.1 per cent over the week to €16.92 and Stora Enso gaining 4.1 per cent to €11.54.Nokia climbed 3.2 per cent to €13.49 after it raised its third quarter sales and profit forecasts.The upgrade prompted positive broker comments on the stock, with JPMorgan raising its rating from “underweight” to “neutral” and Deutsche Bank reiterating its “buy” stance on the Finnish mobile phone maker.
904;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-09-16T11:47:34Z;Danone at centre of fresh political row;;Danone found itself at the centre of a fresh political row on Friday after a member of the French government urged shareholders of the multinational food group to decide for themselves the fate of the company.The comments from François Loos, the industry minister, threw into doubt earlier statements from the French government that suggested the owner of Evian and Volvic water was considered a national “jewel” and would be defended from foreign takeover at all costs.But speaking on a French radio programme on Friday Mr Loos said: “I think that it’s up to Danone and its directors to find the appropriate capital structure needed to deal with these situations.” He was answering a question about the latest rumours that Nestlé, the Swiss food group, was considering a bid for its French rival.This appeared to fly in the face of comments from the government in July when a takeover by PepsiCo, the US soft drinks group, was mooted. News of those talks pushed Danone shares 16.5 per cent higher in a matter of days and led senior members of the French government to jump to the defence of the dairy food maker.Dominique de Villepin, prime minister, earlier this year called Danone a national “jewel”. Nicolas Sarkozy, interior minister, said ministers could not stay inactive in the face of a hostile bid, saying it would mobilise key shareholders to block any such offer. Jacques Chirac, the president, declared that he was remaining “particularly vigilant” over Danone’s future.The latest comments from Mr Loos came a day after Charles McCreevy, the European Union’s internal markets chief, said he was considering suing the French government over its proposed ban on foreign takeovers in some industries. In an interview in Rome on Thursday night Mr McCreevy said the move would “spell the end of the free market as we know it” and would not be allowed.He told the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore there was a growing inclination towards protectionism in France, Germany and many other member states.In recent weeks Mr de Villepin’s government had suggested ring-fencing certain industries in France in an effort to protect them from hostile foreign takeover. Previously Danone had thought to be among the companies included in this list.The fresh takeover talk helped push Danone shares as much as 4.7 per cent higher to €94.85.
905;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-09-02T09:21:18Z;Lombard: Cadbury to sell European drinks;;In Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the underdog orphan, Charlie, comes up trumps. In the real world of chocolate-makers, underdogs suffer a more brutal fate.Cadbury Schweppes on Thursday formally confirmed it plans to sell its European drinks arm, which includes brands like Orangina and Schweppes.The move makes sense. The division has looked a bit of an orphan ever since 1998 when Cadbury tried to sell it – as part of its soft drinks business outside the US and France – to Coca-Cola. That deal was blocked by regulators and, while Cadbury has bulked the business up, it has struggled to produce top-line growth.In the first half, sales fell one per cent on a like-for-like basis and profit 6 per cent. This contrasts with Cadbury’s impressive ability to grow sales in confectionery and its US and Australian beverage businesses.Europe may prosper more in the hands of a more nourishing parent. Antitrust issues rule out Coke as a possible buyer. PepsiCo is likely to take a look, especially if it sees little hope of buying France’s Danone.But the likeliest buyer is a private equity house. The business has good brand names, strong cash flow conversion, 20 per cent margins and controllable costs. Carlyle Group is rumoured to be interested.As for price, without a trade buyer offering synergies, it may struggle to get above 8 or 9 times earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation, or a little north of £1bn.The proceeds will give Cadbury greater financial flexibility, for example with acquisitions, but will be used initially to cut net debt, stretched by the Adams acquisition.There are fresh rumours that Cadbury could buy Carlyle’s stake in the US bottler of its Dr Pepper and Seven Up brands over the next few months. It may be a little too neat to see that as the financial flipside of the European sale. But such a deal could be a distant gleam in the eye of Todd Stitzer, Cadbury’s chief executive. There would be logic in getting stronger control over the route to market at a sensible price.Cadbury’s first priority will be to strengthen the US business but, longer term, a more fundamental question may loom: is it the best use of its capital to stay in beverages as a distant third to Coke and Pepsi?PrudentialNews that Prudential is close to setting up a new joint venture in China to sell retail investment products – it already sells life assurance there – provides an intriguing backdrop to the strategy review promised for next month by Mark Tucker, the Pru’s new chief executive, who used to head the Asia operations.The retail deal is unlikely to be Mr Tucker’s baby. In China, births like this take years of negotiation. But it is likely to intensify speculation among analysts that Mr Tucker may relax the 2006 deadline set for the Asian business to return cash to its parent, instead stepping up investment in that fast-growing market and perhaps covering less of the waterfront in the extremely competitive UK market.HMV bitchfestYo!

906;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-09-01T19:42:47Z;Cadbury to sell European soft drinks business;;Cadbury Schweppes is to dispose of its European beverage arm in a sale expected to fetch between £1bn-£1.1bn ($1.8bn-$2bn), as it seeks to focus on its more profitable confectionery and US beverage businesses.The sale of the European business, which consists of carbonated soft drinks, mineral waters and still drinks, was announced on Thursday and had been expected after Cadbury recently put it under review.The European operations are one of the least profitable parts of Cadbury's business, accounting for just £45m of the group's £517m in underlying profits in the first half of the year.Todd Stitzer, Cadbury's chief executive, said: “The potential for growth and value creation is greater in the group's other operations.” A formal auction, arranged by Goldman Sachs, is expected to attract both private equity and trade buyers.Analysts say PepsiCo may be among the trade buyers to look at the business. PepsiCo has recently been expanding its international beverage business, although it has also been diversifying away from carbonated drinks into healthier beverages such as fruit juices.The Cadbury beverage business includes fruit drink brands such as Orangina, TriNa and Oasis, which are considered to be at the healthier end of the soft drink market. Coca-Cola is not expected to be among the bidders. It made an attempt to buy some of Cadbury's European beverage brands in 1999 but was blocked by anti-trust authorities.In recent years, Cadbury has developed the business through acquisitions, including La Casera in Spain and Orangina in France.But the operation, which derives some 85 per cent of its sales from France, Spain and Germany, has suffered from weak economic conditions in Europe. Underlying operating profits fell 6 per cent in the first half of the year compared with the same period a year earlier.Weakness in the European beverage operations has slowed Cadbury's growth. It reported organic growth of 5.9 per cent in the first half but said it would have reported growth of 6.6 per cent if results from the European operations been excluded.Cadbury is understood to want to retain its American beverage business, which owns the Dr Pepper, 7Up and Snapple brands. The business had underlying profits of £277m in the first half and has almost 18 per cent of the US carbonated soft drinks market.Cadbury said that it would use proceeds from the European sale to pay down debt, which stood at £4.3bn in mid-June. Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service yesterday said it expected “a slight improvement” in Cadbury's credit profile on the sale.
907;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
908;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-08-30T22:08:47Z;Food companies target health conscious consumers;;"Before Coca-Cola released an American brand, Minute Maid, into the UK market earlier this summer, the company spent nearly two years trying to understand what British consumers wanted.It discovered that the British wanted something a little different from Americans. As a result, while American Minute Maid orange juice is made from concentrate and water; in the UK, it contains no concentrate – just fresh juice.Coke’s move reflects a growing awareness among food companies that British consumers want more fresh fruit juices, bottled water and specialist health drinks.The UK’s leading food and beverage producers know they must be more innovative and offer products that can offer some kind of health benefit.Patricia Macnamara, director of new beverages at Coca-Cola Great Britain, says: “Consumer demand and changing lifestyles are fuelling demand for greater choice. Juice, water and no- or low-sugar drinks are an important part of this.” That’s a huge opportunity for us as we can offer innovation to meet increasingly personalised tastes and needs.”Indeed, says Michael Steib, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, “companies are taking [changes in consumer tastes] quite seriously”. He adds that many are reconsidering their long-term strategy rather than just spending more money on research and development. “It’s clearly a matter for the chief executive or chairman.”Britvic, one of the UK’s biggest soft drinks and cordial producers and the owner of the Pepsi and 7UP brands in the UK, is among those trying to adapt. “Consumers have become more savvy and want a range of drinks,” it says.The company, first established as the British Vitamin Products Company in the mid-Nineteenth century, is considering a public offering sometime before the end of 2008. InterContinental Hotels Group owns 47.5 per cent of it and Allied Domecq and Whitbread each have 23.75 per cent. PepsiCo owns the remaining 5 per cent. Britvic has introduced “no added sugar” varieties to its juice, soft drink and cordial brands. One of these new varieties, Tango Clear – which is targeted at 18 to 35 year-old women – is among its most successful product launches to date, the company says.Similar to Coke, Britvic has also been rebranding some of its products to promote certain attributes.Coke this year replaced its “lite” range of soft drinks with a “Z” range after market research showed that there was more emotional appeal in the language and imagery of the phrase “zero added sugar” than in the terms “diet” or “light.”Britvic has similarly got rid of 7UP Light and created 7UP Free to emphasise that the drink is sugar-free, colour-free and caffeine-free.Meanwhile, food companies are focusing more closely on the nutritional value of their products. Consultants say this marks a significant change from past practice, when companies would concentrate on brand extensions when they wanted to introduce new products or change existing ones.“Instead of using colours and flavours as a way of differentiating products, you’re seeing more differentiation on the ingredient side,” says Kathy Brownlie, programme manager of the food beverage ingredients practice at Frost Sullivan, a consulting firm.For example, Unilever has released a yoghurt drink under its Flora pro-activ brand that contains plant sterols. These are naturally occurring molecules found in nuts, seeds, oils and grains, which are claimed to help lower cholesterol.Unilever has also introduced three kinds of new fruit and vegetable drinks under its Knorr Vie brand. Analysts say these have been a success.In the future, Unilever also expects to change the composition of its ice-creams. It has already introduced reduced-fat versions of its Magnum and Carte D’Or Lite brands, and is now exploring using fruits high in vitamins, such as acerola [a red fruit that resembles a cherry].Unilever is looking at technology that would allow it to develop smaller particles of the fatty oils contained in ice cream. It says this would allow it to create ice creams that taste rich but contain low amounts of fat.Nestlé, too, has been cutting back on fat and salt in its products. It says it has taken all artificial ingredients out of its Ski yoghurt range and removed artificial ingredients and flavours from its Rowntree confectionary range.The supermarket chains have made similar changes to some of their own-branded products. J Sainsbury, for example, now sell ketchup with reduced sugar and salt.Still, many companies are grappling with how to create healthy products without compromising on taste. Nestlé’s Half Caff Nescafé, a type of instant coffee, is aimed at coffee drinkers who want to reduce their caffeine intake but don’t want to drink instant coffee. The product has 50 per cent less caffeine than regular Nescafé.Cadbury Schweppes believes one way of assuaging consumers’ health concerns is simply to change its portion sizes.Simon Baldry, managing director of Cadbury Trebor Bassett, says: “The consumer wants the ability to self-control but doesn’t want to compromise on taste.”This year, Cadbury’s UK arm withdrew the “king-size” versions of its Crunchie and Boost chocolate bars. It has also recently started selling thinner versions of Cadbury Dairy Milk, Cadbury Dairy Milk Mint Chips and Bournville chocolate bars.The company claims the new bars allow consumers to eat real Cadbury chocolate “while keeping control of the calories.”Clearly, food and drink companies have spotted a market opportunity and are chasing it for all it is worth. Yet, anybody who has tried to find fruit yoghurt without added sugar knows that the industry has further to go."
909;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-08-29T18:29:44Z;A new mix in the melting pot;;Seen from the slope of St Michael’s cemetery, the rusting smokestacks of the steelworks of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania rise like pipe organs in the afternoon light – a monument to the industrial engine that drew generations of Europeans. The gravestones in the cemetery, with inscriptions in German, Slovak, Polish, Hungarian, Italian and other languages, tell of the immigrants to this melting pot the town who lived and died in another language, pursued the dream that hard work in hot mills would lead to a better life.Even though Bethlehem Steel – the company that built the Golden Gate bridge and the steel skeletons of many of the buildings on the Manhattan skyline – closed its mill here 10 years ago, the city still draws immigrants seeking the American dream: a house with a yard, a place where their children are safe and schools where they can advance.Today’s immigrants, however, are mostly Latino – people like such as Jorge Reyes, a technician who came to Bethlehem five years ago from Mexico at the invitation of a cousin. “I had always worked in electronics factories in Tijuana, and I wanted something different, something safer, even if I had to carry boxes in a warehouse,” says Mr Reyes.Hispanics like Mr Reyes made up 18 per cent of Bethlehem’s 71,000 residents in 2000. They include Puerto Ricans who settled there in the 1970s, Dominicans seeking jobs and education and a stream of very recent Mexican arrivals. The town’s Latino pulse is evident in the multiplicity of tiny shops selling tortillas and plantains and agencies helping migrants wire money to their families back home. Mi Tierra, the first “Spanish” grocery store in town, displays Coke and Pepsi in its shop windows, a mountain of Coke in one picture window and a mound of Pepsi in the other, but down the aisles are a United Nations of sugary beverages – coconut-flavoured Coco Rico from Puerto Rico, Country Club Merengue from the Dominican Republic, cidery cider-flavoured Sidral from Mexico and Postobon red cola from Colombia.And as it is for Bethlehem, so it is for America. Between 1990 and 2000 the US’s Hispanic population grew by 61 per cent: this year, America’s 41m Latinos overtook blacks to become the nation’s largest minority, according to projections by the US Census Bureau. Part of this growth is due to immigration – especially from Mexico, from where 21m US Latinos trace their ancestry. Each year an astonishing 600,000 undocumented Mexicans – equivalent to 60 per cent of those entering Mexico’s workforce – come to the US in search of work, according to analysis by the Pew Hispanic Centre in Washington DC.This flood of immigrants, both legal and illegal, is feeding demand for workers in the economically vibrant parts of the US. They skin chicken breasts and bone turkey thighs in the poultry processing plants of North Carolina, whose Hispanic population quadrupled in from 1990 to 2000. In Georgia, entire Mexican villages staff carpet and textile mills. Even icy Alaska has 26,000 Latinos from at least 13 nations, drawn to work in fisheries and canneries. Last year, recently arrived Hispanic immigrants secured nearly 1m new jobs, more than one-third of the total employment growth for the year, the Pew centre reported.Such huge immigration is stirring a political debate, particularly in US border states such as Arizona, about how and whether to restrict immigration, as detailed in the Financial Times yesterday. But there is more to the immigration debate than wrangling over the desirability of tougher border controls. A town such as Bethlehem shows how it is changing the face of US states far away from the traditional centres of Hispanic immigration. It also poses the sensitive question of whether the burgeoning “Latino” culture, which which brings together so many different Spanish-speaking groups, is acting as a barrier to Hispanic immigrants’ assimilation into“white” or “ “Anglo” America.Samuel Huntingdon, the Harvard academic, caused a furore last year with a book that warned that Hispanic immigrants threatened to “divide the United States into two peoples, two cultures, and two languages”. Mr Huntingdon wrote: “Unlike past immigrant groups, Mexicans and other Latinos have not assimilated into mainstream US culture, forming instead their own political and linguistic enclaves – from Los Angeles to Miami – and rejecting the Anglo-Protestant values that built the American dream.”Certainly the determination to integrate is not universal across Bethlehem, among either its Latino population or their English-speaking counterparts. The north of Bethlehem still retains the flavour of the Moravian community that settled here in 1741 after fleeing Saxony, Europe, making Bethlehem its missionary base for North America. From the leafy north, which rises steeply from the river, south Bethlehem – the main Hispanic area of town – is invisible. Ask directions in north Bethlehem to an address in south Bethlehem, and the answer will likely be, “I can’t help you. I don’t go there.” There is also a cultural division: at community meetings, complaints are made that the Hispanics play their music too loud. Some Latinos grumble that the “Anglos” retain a Germanic coldness and that discrimination abounds.The first Latinos came to Bethlehem in the 1920s, recruited by steel managers who thought that people who grew up close to the equator could better withstand the heat of the blast furnace – the literal melting pot.There are signs of mixing. Maria Delgrosso, who came from Mexico with her family in 1958, is a descendant of one of the first Latino steelworkers. Married to an Italian who worked at “the Steel”, she chose to raise her children in an English-only household to spare them the years of effort that it took her to blend in. Now, her three grown children – only one of whom went to college – chide her for not giving them the chance to have been be bilingual. “They knew to be proud of their heritage”, she says, “but I didn’t want them to suffer with English the way I had.” Even though research shows children benefit from the challenge of being raised bilingual, she thinks she might make the same choice again.Earlier this year the Touchstone Theater in south Bethlehem highlighted the bilingual nature of the community this summer in a massive street production of Don Quixote in which Sancho Panza spoke in Spanish and other cast members in English. “We’re giving people the experience of hearing a play in two languages,” Mark McKenna, who played Don Quixote, told the Morning Call newspaper. “I hope people crave those difficult conversations about cultural understanding. I hope they crave more diversity in their life.”Carlos Fuentes, the eminent Mexican novelist, says that for the most part Mexicans in the US the return of Mexicans to the lands that were once theirs is a “re-conquest,” to be welcomed. And, he insists it could do their American hosts some good. “There’s a qualitative difference in the way assimilation happens. It does happen as Mexicans adapt. But they “don’t want to lose their language or their customs and they don’t want to lose their cuisine. And they are creating the necessity for bilingualism in the US. Most Americans are monolingual. Monolingualism is a curable disease.”A place such as Bethlehem also poses the question of whether today’s immigrants will find it easy to integrate and prosper without the heavy industrial jobs that gave a leg-up to earlier generations of immigrants. Many migration analysts believe the US economy’s “hourglass” shape – with jobs increasingly concentrated either in the well-paid “knowledge economy” or the low-paid service sector but not in middle-income manufacturing employment – poses a problem for immigrants.“In Bethlehem, years ago, you could make do with a strong back, and with some skills you could enjoy a middle-class income after 20 years in the steel mill,” says Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Centre. “The classic evolution across three generations, from peddler to plumber to professional, worked when you had the industrial economy to provide the middle rung. Immigrants start at the bottom, but they need somewhere to go.”Across the US economy almost all foreign-born Hispanics, and two-thirds of native-born Hispanics, were concentrated in the low-skilled sectors. According to Pew, most new immigrants found work in construction, professional and business services and eateries and lodging. the hotel and catering industries. There is a different pattern for native US-born Hispanics, whose job growth comes from for whom the retail and wholesale trades, health care and education are the fastest-growing sources of new jobs. However, the manufacturing sector – the traditional middle rung on the ladder to a middle-class income – shed jobs for Hispanics. who There is no decline in the disparity of wealth: Hispanic families still hold just 9 per cent of the wealth of white families.With the decline of the steel industry, which gave so many early waves of immigrants their start, Bethlehem and the surrounding Lehigh Valley has relied on its proximity to New York and Pennsylvania, and on new highways and an airport, to become a transportation hub and distribution centre for the east coast. Bethlehem is just a two-hour bus ride to midtown Manhattan and is even closer by car to jobs in New Jersey. In addition to the warehouses, Latino immigrants are also finding work in meatpacking plants, in all-Latino construction crews, in landscaping, in foundries and in the burgeoning service sector: cleaning, cooking and caring for children and the elderly.This is powerfully demonstrating the role for education required for economic advancement. Without the unionised jobs in heavy industry, the credential required of immigrants to enter into the middle class and leap to the top of the “hourglass economy” is at least a couple years of college, says Mr Suro.Victor Nee, a sociologist who directs the Centre for the Study of Economy and Society at Cornell University, believes Hispanic immigrants have been slower to assimilate partly because of their large numbers but also because they entered with less education and skills than earlier immigrants. Among Hispanics from the Caribbean – the majority of those in Bethlehempopulation, – 55 per cent lack a high school degree diploma compared with just 7 per cent of non-Hispanic whites.“Remember that in American history, it was never expected that the first generation of immigrants would achieve the ‘American dream’. They came to sacrifice and establish the basis for the success for the second and third generations,” Mr Nee says. His research shows substantial lateral mobility that is “lateral” and “horizontal”, say from picking strawberries to jobs that involve gardening landscaping and blue collar-jobs, which are better compensated and improve immigrants’ working and living conditions.Tony Ianelli, president of the Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce, says that the regional economic recovery is starting to translate into economic success for Latinos. “We’re seeing a lot of growth of small businesses, and we get the sense that the established Latino community has matured and is ready to become part of the leadership,” he says, referring to the creation of a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. “The community has grown in numbers and is more sophisticated economically.”With no high schools on the south side, The education system is the ultimate source of integration for Bethlehem’s school-age population, 30 per cent of whom are Hispanic. Alex Trujillo, of Puerto Rican origin, whose grocery store in Bethlehem has catered to waves of Hispanic immigration for 47 years, believes “They are looking for opportunities to develop, but within their own Alex Trujillo, the store owner who has catered to waves of Hispanic immigration for 47 years. “They are looking for opportunities to develop, but within their own culture.” culture.” Trujillo, the grocery store owner, says that the educational differences even out by the third generation: he He is proud of his son, a lawyer, who is raising his two children bilingually.For many, economic advance remians elusive.Erica Sutherland, professor at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, who runs a resource group for migrants, sees some educated Hispanics migrate even in the knowledge that their lack of English will prevent them from using their skills.Hispanic immigrants are also participating in the American dream in ever greater numbers by buying themselves a home. Nationally, Latinos are buying homes faster than any other group. Last year nearly 50 per cent of Hispanics owned their homes, up two percentage 2 percentage points over the previous year and 8 percentage points above the level in 1995, according to the US census.“The data show that immigrant communities, once they have been in the country for 30 or more years, buy homes at a greater rate than native-born Americans,” says Walter Molony of the National Association of Realtors.Notwithstanding the dream – and the reality – of US home ownership, many Latino immigrants maintain closer links with their home country and some are planning plan for their an eventual return. Many Mexicans, for example, use savings from several years’ work to buy homes and vehicles in Mexico. They can now even take out mortgages in the US secured by a home south of the border. Those who still have their Mexican voting papers are allowed to vote in next year’s presidential election and can already had the right to vote in state and municipal elections.Language also offers a potent difference. Second-generation Hispanics hold on to Spanish and are often virtually bilingual, unlike many of the immigrant groups that preceded them. But it is necessary to beware of over-generalisation. In Bethlehem, it tends to be harder to get second-generation Hispanics to speak Spanish than English – although they maintain a grasp of their parents’ language. And some Hispanics, like the librarian Maria DelGrasso, go out of their way to raise their children solely in English.It is possible to argue that today’s Hispanic immigrants maintain such close links to their culture simply because they can. Sergio Bendixen, a leading pollster who migrated to the US from Peru, suggests that these improved modern communications changed the nature of assimilation. International phone cards of the type sold in Bethlehem’s Hispanic groceries enable callers to bypass long-distance charges and pay pennies per a minute to stay in contact with home.“You can’t compare them with groups of migrants who came 30 or 40 years ago, when the best you could do is send a letter or two a year,” Mr Bendixen says. “Now you are talking about migrants who are talking to their family every day. It’s a completely different dynamic.”Even without the benefit of modern technology, Mexicans always had the advantage over European migrants that they could easily go home. Mr Fuentes, the novelist, and social commentator, suggests this is a critical distinction. “They didn’t come over the ocean, they came by land,” he says. “It’s an enormous difference. It’s where the language is rooted and the customs are already there and the historical memory is there.”For Mr Reyes, the American dream remains alive – even though his goal of a safer environment was not realised. He badly injured his arm in a workplace accident chewed up his arm three years ago. Now he and his family rely on the income of his wife, who cleans hotel rooms. Yet Mr Reyes maintains the move north has been worthwhile. “Even with a good job, I wouldn’t have been able to afford a house [in Mexico] on $70 a week,” Mr Reyes says. “It is my children who will benefit.”Puerto Ricans, says Mr Trujillo, have long taken advantage of having US citizenship to move back and forth between the island and the US mainland. Immigrants from the Dominican Republic and the length of Latin America, he says, come to settle. “Dominicans and Central Americans don’t want to go back”, he says. “Del progreso a la pobreza, nunca se regresa – from progress to poverty one never returns.”IMMIGRATION IN PENNSYLVANIA• The foreign-born population of Pennsylvania grew 38 per cent between 1990 and 2000• In 2000 the foreign-born made up 4 per cent of the state’s total population• Of the total foreign born in Pennsylvania in 2000, 36 per cent were from Asia and another 36 per cent from Europe.

910;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-08-29T18:02:49Z;Lex: French takeovers;;France's unique brand of capitalism is alive and well. With European mergers booming once more, fuelled in part by the exploits of French companies overseas, Paris is throwing up barricades at home.François Loos, French industry minister, has revealed that his government is drawing up a list of “strategic” industrial sectors it wishes to shield from foreign takeovers. This list threatens to be rather long. Mineral water and yoghurt will clearly be on it, since Danone has been declared a strategic asset following talk of a bid by PepsiCo. Nickel, too, must feature, since Mr Loos described Eramet, a nickel miner reportedly fancied by the Brazilians, as “even more strategic” than Danone. Foreign bidders should probably assume that anything they might want to buy will be on the list. That way they can save themselves the bother of reading it.French companies can hardly be in favour of such a high-handed industrial policy, since it could hurt their international ambitions. Nor does it make economic sense. An open market in corporate control is essential for a well-functioning economy. If French companies create value, they will thrive as independent entities, even without government protection. If they do not, a takeover foreign or domestic is often the best way to salvage some value for shareholders, employees and taxpayers. France's political double standards will only damage the interests of the very people the government claims to be protecting.
911;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-08-18T17:58:46Z;Soft drinks producers act to deflate calls for regulation;;"In the late 1970s, US schoolboys consumed more than twice as much milk as soft drinks. By the late 1990s, the average boy was drinking nearly three cups of sugary soda every day, but little more than one cup of milk.Health campaigners cite two main causes for the change: more aggressive marketing of soft drinks to children, and increased availability of the product in schools. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the industry giants, started using more youth-culture imagery and celebrities to promote their brands. And they struck lucrative revenue-sharing deals with education authorities to place their vending machines in schools.Now, as levels of childhood obesity and diabetes soar throughout the developed world, activists are pushing for tougher regulation of the industry's relationship with its young consumers.Their campaign scored a victory in the US this week, when producers pledged to restrict sales of soft drinks in schools. The measures followed a similar agreement last year in Canada, where fizzy drinks were replaced with water and juices in elementary and middle schools.These voluntary steps reflect a shift by an industry previously reluctant to acknowledge health concerns surrounding its beverages. Producers have long insisted that a lack of physical exercise is the main cause of childhood obesity, and complain it is unfair to target soft drinks above any other food or drink consumed in excess. But with the average US teenage boy consuming about 15 teaspoons of sugar from soda every day, the industry has accepted it cannot avoid all responsibility.By agreeing to voluntary restrictions in schools, the cola giants hope to head off the more draconian regulations that campaigners want. In some US states and parts of Europe, however, the concessions have come too late.<>French lawmakers voted last year for a nationwide ban on school vending machines, and the law comes into force next month. In the UK, legislation to regulate marketing of so-called junk food and drink to children is under consideration.In the US, at least 14 states have passed laws designed to improve nutrition in schools. Most of these new laws contain rules on school vending machines.The industry hopes that its new schools policy in the US will convince the remaining 36 states that it can be trusted to regulate itself.“We understand that parents want more control over what their younger children consume in school, and we want to support them with this policy,” said Susan Neely, president of the American Beverage Association, the industry lobby group, in a speech to the National Conference of State Legislators this week.Under the new rules, only water and fruit juice will be sold in elementary schools; sugary soft drinks will not be sold during school hours in middle schools; and at least half the choices in high school vending machines must be healthier options.Critics were quick to pick holes in the pact. They said the ban on soft drinks in elementary schools simply formalised a policy that Coke and Pepsi already observed. The large majority of school sales are made in high schools, where sugary beverages will still be available throughout the day.Jeanette Longfield, co-ordinator of the Campaign for the Children's Food Bill in the UK, says the measures show that self-regulation does not work. “The industry needs to look like it is doing something, but it is completely cynical.” Defending revenues is only part of the reason why soft drink companies are so keen to remain in schools. Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest Coke distributor, says schools account for less than 1 per cent of North American sales. Arguably more important is the marketing access that schools provide to young consumers whose brand loyalties are still being formed.Revenues from vending machines have become an important source of funds for US schools, and Coke and Pespi have often sweetened the contracts with additional payments to support sports teams or build new facilities.One of the few school systems to have voluntarily banned soft drinks is the Chicago Board of Education, but its experience might be viewed with caution by other school systems.Last October Chicago decided not to renew a five-year contract with Coke, worth a reported $21m (€17m, £11.6m). Instead, it struck a deal worth $6.4m with a smaller distributor of water and juices. But enterprising pupils quickly found a way around the ban, setting up a black market in illicit snacks and soda."
912;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:00:25+0000;Coke and Pepsi agree limits on school sales;;"Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and other US soft drink producers have agreed voluntary restrictions on sales in schools, amid mounting pressure on the industry over its role in childhood obesity.Under the new policy, soft drinks will be withdrawn entirely from elementary schools and face restrictions in middle and high schools.The measures mark a significant shift in approach by an industry that has sometimes appeared reluctant to acknowledge health concerns surrounding its drinks.“Childhood obesity is a serious problem in the US, and the responsibility for finding common-sense solutions is shared by everyone, including our industry,” said Susan Neely, president of the American Beverage Association, the industry group which brokered the deal.The agreement is sure to increase pressure on Coke and its peers to take similar action in Europe, where campaigns are underway in several countries to ban soft drinks in schools.Unveiling the new policy on Wednesday, Ms Neely said producers would in the future sell only water and fruit juice in elementary schools; would no longer sell full-sugar soft drinks in middle schools during the day; and would make sure no more than half the choices in high school vending machines were soft drinks.Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a pressure group, welcomed the measures but said they did not go far enough. She said the industry was mistaken if it believed the new policy would halt the campaign for a more widespread ban.At least six US state legislators have voted to limit soft drink sales in schools, and several more are considering action.Health campaigners argue that soft drinks are among the main causes of the obesity epidemic sweeping north America, where 16 per cent of children and teenagers are overweight, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention."

Since April, €34bn of overseas bids have been made by France Telecom, Suez, Pernod Ricard and Saint-Gobain. Francophobes will find plenty of ammunition. All four are run by executives with traditional Polytechnique educations.Two of the deals were wrapped in rhetoric about size and European champions. Last month's hysterical reaction to the rumoured purchase of Danone by PepsiCo even provided a familiar whiff of political double standards.Yet the acquirers' real devotion looks distinctly Anglo-Saxon: belief in the power of debt. Including proportionate net liabilities assumed, the offers are 82 per cent debt funded. All four were justified on earnings per share accretion (which is flattered by debt financing). Only Pernod Ricard also highlighted economic returns.This conviction in the virtue of leverage is currently shared by the market, which has responded positively to the deals, and by the private equity industry. But as with all acquisitions, creating long-term value may be a challenge. After all, on a weighted basis, the four acquirers traded on 14 times historic clean earnings before their offers. Their collective bids valued the targets at 20 times.
914;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:23:06+0000;Suez sets out vision with Electrabel bid;;Suez, the French water and energy group, yesterday bowed to investor pressure and launched an €11.2bn ($13.8bn) cash-and-share offer for minority shares in Electrabel, Belgium's largest electricity generator.Setting out his ambition to create a “Franco-Belgian energy market leader in Europe”, Suez chief executive Gerard Mestrallet said the offer would create value for both companies' shareholders.“A group that is entirely harmonised can move further and faster in implementing synergies,” he said.However, Mr Mestrallet's decision to buy in the 49 per cent of Electrabel that Suez does not already own is a clear reversal of policy. As recently as May, he said he remained comfortable with the structure of the Electrabel holding.The group has said it has been able to exploit opportunities in the energy sector through its holding in Electrabel, which last year accounted for more than half of Suez net profits.Eric Knight, of activist investor group Knight Vinke, yesterday welcomed the news as a vindication of the campaign he has led since the beginning of the year to push Suez either to spin off Electrabel or buy in the minority shares. “What they have done is what we wanted them to do,” he said. “I am convinced if we had not spoken out we would still be sitting on this situation in three or four years' time.”Mr Mestrallet denied he had succumbed to pressure, saying now was the logical time to take the step. Europe's energy markets were deregulating and Suez's financial position was robust.However, Suez is likely to face strong local opposition to its bid for a full takeover of one of Belgium's most important companies.Jean-Claude Marcourt, the economics minister of the Walloon regional government, said authorities would seek to ensure Suez retained its energy headquarters in Belgium. In a jibe about the French government's recent efforts to shield Danone from a possible takeover by PepsiCo, Mr Marcourt added: “Electricity is certainly more strategic than yoghurt.”Suez is offering €322 in cash and four shares for each Electrabel share, valuing the Belgian group at €410 a share based on Monday night's closing price. Mr Mestrallet said the offer was a good one for Electrabel shareholders, representing a 14.8 per cent premium to the shares on July 22, before rumours of Suez's interest spurred a sharp rise in the Belgian group's shares.To finance the deal, Suez plans a €2.5bn rights issue at some time over the next 12 months.Mr Mestrallet said the deal would be earnings neutral in the first year and 7 per cent enhancing by 2007.
915;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-28T07:06:13Z;France Telecom earnings beat expectations;;France Telecom on Thursday unveiled first-half profits ahead of expectations, a day after the group confirmed its much anticipated €8.9bn ($10.7bn) acquisition of Amena, Spain's third-largest mobile phone operator.The telecom group said net income more than trebled to €1bn from €3.4bn on sales up 2.3 per cent on a pro forma basis to €23.7bn.The group, which said it had seen growth across its internet and mobile phone units, had a big improvement in its operating performance, up from €4.3bn to €6.5bn. During the six months to June 30, France Telecom increased its mobile phone customers by 16.3 per cent to 66.7m, while broadband customers rose 80 per cent to 6.4m.France Telecom confirmed its targets of full-year operating income of €18.5bn.On Wednesday Didier Lombard, chief executive of France Telecom, dealt a thinly-veiled rebuke to his government's growing protectionism by applauding Spanish politicians for allowing his group's acquisition of Amena,“It is very important to know there is no government opposition,” said Mr Lombard, as France Telecom unveiled details of the deal.His comments appeared to be an implicit criticism of the French government for launching a barrage of protectionist rhetoric in response to this month's rumours about a possible bid by PepsiCo of the US for Danone, the French food and drinks company.Dominique de Villepin, French prime minister, emphasised his desire to guard against foreign takeover bids by promising to reinforce the “independence” of French strategic companies. “We must regroup our forces to defend France …many countries already have effective means to defend their businesses. We must do the same.”In contrast, Mr Lombard said he spoke with José Montilla, the Spanish industry minister, before launching the Amena bid. He was told Madrid would not intervene in the auction, but would react favourably to a bid from a foreign industrial group. The French boss travels to Spain today. His comments are likely to well-received in Spain, where the socialist government of José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is keen to establish its market-friendly credentials. However, at Telefónica, whose chairman Cesar Alierta was closely aligned with the former centre-right government, there is a feeling that France Telecom, still largely state-controlled, has an unfair advantage in a fully-liberalised market.The French group will buy 80 per cent of Amena for €3.4bn in cash and €3bn in shares to be issued via a capital increase reserved for Amena shareholders after the August holidays.The deal includes €2.4bn of debt and €1.7bn of tax credits. It is expected to close by mid-November.Mr Lombard's apparent criticism of the French government is surprising as it is France Telecom's biggest shareholder, with a stake that will be diluted to about 33 per cent by the Amena deal.French politicians have achieved a rare unity in their public denunciation of a possible foreign takeover of Danone. Mr Lombard was credited with shaping much of France's modern industrial policy as scientific and technical director at the ministry of research and technology and then head of industrial strategy at the finance ministry in the 1980s and 1990s.
916;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Tax break lets IBM repatriate $9bn;;IBM plans to repatriate $9bn of foreign earnings during the current quarter, the latest US multinational to take advantage of a tax break offered by Washington. The information technology group will record a one-off tax charge of $450m in its third quarter earnings.Under the American Jobs Creation Act, US companies bringing foreign earnings back into the country this year will be taxed at only 5.25 per cent, compared with a 35 per cent standard rate.The tax break was designed to stimulate the US economy by encouraging companies to bring home capital parked in low-tax juristictions. Wall Street analysts estimate that US companies could reptriate about $500bn by the end of this year, when the preferential rate is withdrawn.IBM in February said it planned to repatriate $8bn. Earlier this month, it told investors the total would be about $9bn.The largest such move so far is by Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals group, which is bringing $36.9bn back into the US, resulting in a $1.7bn tax charge.PepsiCo, the foods group, on Friday said it would record a third quarter tax charge of $475m arising from the repatriation of $7.5bn. Lexmark, the printer company, on Tuesday announced quarterly earnings including a $53m tax charge, equivalent to 42 cents a share.The charges reflect the fact that companies repatriating earning will pay more tax in the current year than they would have done if the money remained offshore.Critics of the legislation have questioned whether it will create jobs as intended. Companies do not have to detail how the money will be invested in order to get the tax break. Qualifying uses of the money include research and development, capital investment, pension funding and acquisitions.
917;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-25T20:47:10Z;Confusion over PepsiCo intentions for Danone;;"Danone shares fell 7.5 per cent on Monday after the AMF, France's stock market regulator, said it had received confirmation from PepsiCo that it was not preparing a bid for the food multinational.However, PepsiCo last night denied that it had directly discussed Danone with the AMF, leaving a lingering uncertainty about the situation. It insisted it had only confirmed that it was in compliance with all rules governing mergers and acquisitions.Asked for clarification, the AMF accepted that Danone had not been directly mentioned by PepsiCo, but maintained that the US company's statement amounted to a confirmation that it was not preparing a bid.Danone's shares rose 16.5 per cent last Tuesday and Wednesday as speculation hardened that PepsiCo might bid. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the US soft drinks and snacks group had engaged investment banks Morgan Stanley and UBS to advise on a possible takeover move.However, political opposition also gathered pace as French ministers denounced the possibility of a foreign purchase of what Dominique de Villepin, prime minister, described as a national ""jewel"". Danone, the world's leading producer of fresh dairy products, has a strong position in the biscuit and bottled water markets, owning the Lu, Evian and Volvic brands. Nicolas Sarkozy, interior minister, said ministers would mobilise shareholders to block any such offer.A person familiar with the situation said PepsiCo was taken aback by the negative reaction.Danone shares fell €6.65 to €81.80 on Monday. They had already dipped 5.2 per cent on Thursday after Franck Riboud, Danone chairman and chief executive, said there had been no recent contact with PepsiCo or any other foreign suitor."
918;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-25T19:29:16Z;European Comment: Fortress Italy foils big bank heist;;"Fortress Italy has beaten off the Dutch and Spanish barbarians trying to prise open the Italian banking market, but it is a castle that is crumbling from within. If ABN Amro and BBVA had succeeded in buying Banca Antonveneta and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, they would have cut fees and injected a long-overdue competitive spirit into Italy's banking system.Now that they have been forced to throw in the towel, Italians will be stuck with outrageously high bank charges and disgraceful levels of inefficiency. It is not just bad for Italian consumers, it is bad for the recession-mired Italian economy.Surely it will be a long time before another foreign bank thinks of assaulting the fortress - certainly not while Antonio Fazio is governor of the Bank of Italy.Yet there may be a silver lining in this shoddy affair. Enlightened businessmen such as Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the head of Confindustria, Italy's employers' association, know how damaging this has been to Italy's international image.He said as much last Friday - and it is clear that Domenico Siniscalco, finance minister, thinks the same. Even more interesting is that Romano Prodi, the centre-left opposition's candidate for prime minister in Italy's forthcoming national election, says the Bank of Italy governor should serve a fixed term rather than being appointed for life. If that happens, Mr Fazio and the cause of Italian protectionism may have won this battle, but they will lose the war.French farceMeanwhile Thierry Breton, France's finance minister, has been left to tidy up the mess made by his political colleagues last week after they piled in to warn PepsiCo off any attempt at bidding for Danone. He insists that all foreign bidders are welcome in France. But if there is one lesson out of the events of both Italy and France in recent days it is that fear of change still runs deep.As long as politicians court popularity with jingoistic nationalism, neither country will be able to take the steps towards openness and reform that they both so badly need.But Dominique de Villepin, French prime minister, should be particularly careful about the signals he is sending. He has been charged with getting France back to work, and for that he needs cash.So he has decided to sell the rest of the state's interests in the country's three motorway operators, and stakes in the Parisian airports authority and the electricity utility, EDF.But even he couldn't resist the national fervour last week when he insisted he would ""defend France's interests"", in the face of a bid for Danone.The state has no shares in Danone, and with just 13 per cent of its workforce in France, the dairy and biscuits group can hardly be described as representing strategic interests.The Danone fiasco has cost the French government a good deal in credibility. It will almost certainly cost it even more in hard cash. Investors are likely to demand a deep discount if they are to be tempted into buying shares in companies that have greater claims to represent France's strategic interests.Deutsche boonOne sunny day does not mean summer has arrived, but the economic clouds that have hung over Europe recently may be shifting. Today should see another improvement in German business sentiment, according to the Munich-based Ifo institute.A more upbeat mood would support the European Central Bank's case that economic activity in the eurozone should pick up in the second half.Optimism has been helped by euro weakness, a sense that the world economy will continue to do well and that German elections in September will boost structural reform. China's currency revaluation could also help improve sentiment.It would still be wise to be cautious. Ifo's survey might simply signal a ""bottoming out"" of confidence, and predicted upswings in Germany's economy have often proved false.On a trade-weighted basis, the euro's decline this year has been less than in dollar terms - and might be reversed.Meanwhile, Beijing's modest revaluation does not remove the competitive threat facing Europe.September's elections will only be a starting point for reviving Germany's economy. A survey by insurer Allianz has found Germany ""bringing up the rear"" of the four biggest eurozone countries on meeting ""Lisbon agenda"" goals to boost economic performance.european.comment@ft.com"
919;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-22T19:38:08Z;Lombard: Touch of corporate-style retail therapy;;European takeover wave gathers strengthIf there is a more than normal glint in the eye of the City’s investment bankers these days, it is probably not because they are thinking of their retreats to Tuscan and Sardinian summer villas. Rather, it stems from the huge fees that they expect to earn in the second half of this year as European takeover activity intensifies.This week has brought a foretaste, with reports that PepsiCo may bid for Danone of France while in the UK the past two days has brought a putative £3.5bn bid for BPB, the plasterboard manufacturer, from Saint-Gobain and talk of a family buy-out at Monsoon.After three flat years, following the collapse of the equity market, European merger and acquisition activity has picked up sharply in the first half of this year but City bankers say this is nothing compared to the volume and size of deals now near the end of the pipeline.The wider market is gearing up as well. There are signs of hedge funds devoting more resources to merger arbitrage in the expectation that the swing of the cycle has far to go.The UK, with most industries relatively consolidated, is likely to be less on the receiving end of any bid boom than continental markets, though some sectors, such as retailing, could still see a fair amount of action.Why is this happening now? Bidders could have picked up assets much more cheaply two years ago when share prices were low. But many potential predators were then repairing their own balance sheets, focusing on improving core operations, and not keen to use their own lowly-priced equity. Investors were suspicious of bids, with fresh memories of the daft deals of the late- 1990s and Marconi-like crashes.Animal spirits, as the bankers say, were in short supply among chief executives. Now, with share prices higher and corporate bond spreads low, they are starting to feel feisty.That is comforting if you own shares in a target but worrying if you hold stock in a predator. For history suggests 50 to 70 per cent of takeovers end in failure and are often driven by egotistical empire-building rather than a focus on return on capital.One senior City investment banker observes that a significant number of chief executives want to do a deal now because they can see their time running out and want to leave their mark on the business. The danger is that they will overpay – and the mark they leave is a black one. But there is no stopping the cycle. As the same banker, gleam in eye, notes: “We all need a little retail therapy.”High street bargainsWell, perhaps not everyone: retailers’ trading statements and results have made gloomy reading over the past week. Yet, amid descriptions of trading as “difficult,” “tougher” and “very challenging”, came figures showing high street sales in June 1.6 per cent ahead of June last year.The messages are not as mixed as first appears. One factor behind the bounceback is that some chains brought forward their summer sales.That hardly indicates confidence and with good reason: the outlook includes higher costs, from rents to wages, and fiercer competition for what consumer demand there is, as high street space passes from poor performers such as Allders and Littlewoods to smarter operators such as Philip Green.The market has priced much of this in, with the general retailing sector usually underperforming the FTSE 350 since the start of the year. The gap has now widened to slightly more than 10 percentage points. Despite the enormous press coverage of the sector, general retailers are a fairly small part of the stock market, judged by market capitalisation, and not an essential investment category.But for those who want to stay invested, one option is a flight to quality – groups such as Next and GUS that are likely to outperform even when times are hard.Alternatively, when sales slow, companies being turned around might benefit from their greater scope to cut costs. However, picking winners and losers here can be high risk. Even retailing executives may not possess the talent to distinguish between groups with effective and deliverable strategies and those without. It is far easier to spot bargains on the high street than in high street shares.Monsoon weddingPeter Simon, chairman of Monsoon, is a brilliant retailer but unsuited to be the head of a public company. He hates the limelight, the cost and what he calls “corporate governance bollocks.” So it makes sense that he has belatedly seen the light and is mulling a bid for the 24.6 per cent that his family does not already own.But what a shame he did not think this clearly two years ago. That was when he launched a controversial tender offer (which largely failed) for 20 per cent of the shares at 140p and infuriated hedge funds as he moved to the less liquid Aim. A full bid then of about 180p would have probably been accepted. Now he may have to pay around 380p – and negotiate with those hedge funds. Mr Simon does not do humble pie but this comes close.
920;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-22T19:21:15Z;Ironies of French resistance to PepsiCo;;“They shall not pass.” It can be only a matter of time before the rallying cry of the French military during the battle of Verdun in the Great Warfirst world war is once again heard – this time to defend Danone against the threat of a hostile bid from PepsiCo.France’s politicians have found rare unity over the the need to defend the country’s flag-carrier in the global food and drink industry against any assault by a US invader. Pepsi has yet to launch a bid, but the mere fact that it is thinking about one has set French hearts aflutter.The two companies embody their national cultures. Danone sells bottled Evian spring water, promoted for its purity, and probiotic yoghurts it says that do good things to “intestinal flora”. Pepsi makes the sweet soft drinks and junk food snacks blamed for increasing obesity in the US and elsewhere.It is not quite so straightforward, of course. Danone is also big in biscuits, which make a contribution to expanding waistlines. Pepsi sells Tropicana fruit juices bursting with vitaminsgoodness and Quaker Oats, whose breakfast cereals and wholefood snacks boast health benefits.Yet, success for the US group would be seen as another political defeat for France after the loss of the 2012 Olympic Games to London. And Franck Riboud, Danone’s chief executive and son of its founder, said it would put at risk its the company’s culture and identity. He has won the backing of Dominique de Villepin, the aristocratic prime minister, who said the government would defend French interests. Nicolas Sarkozy, the interior minister who hopes to run for president in 2007, said a hostile bid should be blocked. Not to be outdone, by his younger challenger, President Jacques Chirac broke off on a visit to Madagascar to promise to be “vigilant and mobilised” against the threat.The defence of national champions is a particularly French obsession. A similar campaign last year persuaded Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, not to bid for Aventis against Sanofi, a French rival. There was also soul-searching over the fate of Rossignol, France’s famous ski manufacturer which was bought in March by Quiksilver of the US.France’s national champions think nothing of snapping up the cultural assets of other countries, however. Pernod Ricard, for example, has an enviable selection of Scotch and Irish whiskies, Australian wines and Mexican tequilas. Jean-Marie Messier’s Vivendi empire absorbed Universal Studios of the US, while Danone only recently disgorged HP Foods and Lea & Perrins, makers of two iconic British sauces. Those other countries tend to have a more relaxed attitude to foreign ownership of companies, unless they are essential to national security. At the height of the 1990s stockmarket boom, Americans raised no objections when UBS of Switzerland bought PaineWebber, the Main StreetUS brokerage. Quintessentially US brands such as Skippy peanut butter fell into Anglo-Dutch ownership when Unilever snapped up Bestfoods. But when unemployment is high or self-confidence low, the definition of national security expands. The US, for example, is agonising over the merits of allowing China National Offshore Oil Corporation to buy Unocal. It also paused over the recent sale by IBM of its personal computer business to China’s to Lenovo. of China earlier this year.Yet it is hard to stretch the scope of national security to cover bottled water and dairy products – even in a country noted for its devotion to gastronomy. The irony is that until quite recently, Danone was concerned to downplay its French roots and highlight its global status. Mr Riboud, for example, was an early exponent of shareholder value in a country that came late to the idea that companies should act in the interests of their owners. In 2001, he told the Financial Times FT that the company was “no longer a Franco-French group: we’ve just 23 per cent of our sales in France now”.One reason for snubbing France then was that far from being seen as a national champion, Danone had come under sustained attack for closing two French biscuit factories, with the loss of 570 jobs. Consumers boycotted its products, declaring with nearly nine out of 10 people judging it unacceptable for a profitable company to make people redundant. The then-socialist government changed the labour lawslaw to make such closures harder.Four years later, Mr Riboud has been transformed from villain to national hero, fighting to defend what one minister called “one of the jewels of our industry”.In such a febrile atmosphere, few in France will question whether this is a battle that needs to be fought. But why, for example, would the US group do anything to undermine Danone’s culture if it had paid a fat premium to acquire it? Would Pepsi ownership not enhance Danone’s clout by strengthening it in markets such as the US where it has recently faltered? And why should the French company’s shareholders not reap the rewards of its success? The mere rumour of a Pepsi bid raised Danone’s share price to a record high – up more than 27 per cent at one point.Such arguments are likely to receive short shrift in France – just as in 1916, when few questioned the wisdom of expending hundreds of thousands ofnumerous French lives to defend a salient of negligible military value. Defending the independence of Danone has no better justification, but as with Verdun offers an opportunity to bolster France’s morale at a time when the country feels it is facing defeat on many fronts.The author is the FT’s chief editorial comment writer
921;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-22T17:14:42Z;Eurofirst rises slightly over volatile week;;A volatile session on Thursday, marked by a second series of attacks on London’s transport system and Chinese currency revaluation, overshadowed a week that otherwise would have been dominated by three pivotal European market events.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 settled on Friday at 1,164,53, up less than 0.1 per cent.Nokia, the Finnish telecoms handset maker, which along with Sweden’s Ericsson reported second quarter results on Thursday, was the week’s biggest faller. Although the company extended its market share to 33 per cent from 32 per cent, its bid to cement its position as world leader had a detrimental effect on profit margins as higher marketing costs and a lower average selling price bit.On Friday, ABN Amro, Lehman Brothers and Smith Barney cut their earnings estimates, while UBS cut its target price to €16 from €17. JPMorgan downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “neutral”, and analyst Mark Davies-Jones said: “As we had feared, pressure on ASPs [average selling price] and margins more than offset the benefits of higher phone volumes in the second quarter.”He added that the stock looked vulnerable to further falls. Over the week, the shares fell 12.7 per cent to €12.90.Ericsson, by contrast, reported a strong set of results. Tim Boddy, strategist at Goldman Sachs felt this was unjustified: “We continue to believe that Ericsson is a classic example of an underappreciated industry leader that has delivered a genuine transformation in cash returns.”The stock reversed most of Thursday’s gains on Friday to stand just 0.6 per cent higher on the week at SKr26.60.During the first half of the week speculation that PepsiCo of the US was poised to make a bid drove Danone, the French food group, more than 16 per cent higher over two days. This was later tempered by comments from Franck Ribaud, chief executive, that he would fight to maintain the company’s independence. The stock, however, remained one of the best weekly performers, up 10.7 per cent to €3.42.Friday marked the deadline for bids for Italian banking targets Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Banca Antonveneta, and as had been widely expected, both BBVAof Spain and Dutch group ABN Amro pulled out following months of opposition from Italian business leaders and institutions. ABN Amro ended the week up 1.6 per cent to €21.16, while BBVA was up 3.5 per cent at €13.64. BNL fell 0.9 per cent to €2.67, and Antonveneta fell 5.5 per cent to €25.10.Generali jumped 5.7 per cent to €27.28. The Italian insurer looked likely to sell its 8.7 per cent stake in BNL to Unipol, after a withdrawal by BBVA. Shares in Unipol dropped 1.5 per cent to €3.08.Banca Monte dei Paschi di Sienacontinued to rise as investors were thought to be building stakes in the company, should it become a target in any consolidation of the banking industry. Shares surged 18 per cent to €3.42.

For all their efforts to fend off the enemy, the ramparts of the eurozone's two largest economies are showing more cracks.In France, the government is racing to the rescue of Danone, throwing all its weight to block a rumoured bid by PepsiCo on its national food champion. But Paris also admits it can do little to prevent a takeover.In Germany, politicians are calling for action to stop the ""locusts"" of foreign capitalism stripping the country of its assets.Chancellor Gerhard Schröder is on record saying nobody should count on him to ""Americanise German society"".For all her reforming zeal, his conservative rival Angela Merkel has carefully stopped short of embracing the new capital market culture.But the rearguard action has to a large extent already been lost in France. Privatisation, now being accelerated, and the dilution of cosy core shareholdings designed to protect privatised groups have made corporate France vulnerable. Yet this has not stopped large French companies thriving.Germany is resisting longer. But the Volkswagen scandal has underlined the limits of the system.For too long, corporate Germany has lived under the illusion that ""we are the best, we are profitable, we employ thousands of people, we are great exporters, and we do not need to worry about capital markets"".But even the biggest companies need these markets to borrow, hedge and raise equity. Not to mention a more open market for corporate control to punish bad management.Good SamaritanBernard Arnault is having to play the Good Samaritan. For his LVMH luxury conglomerate can hardly afford its own version of the public relations fiasco that followed the decision of Marks and Spencer to close its flagship Parisian store and pull out of France a few years ago.The maker of Louis Vuitton bags and Dom Perignon champagne this week announced the closure for six years of La Samaritaine, the iconic Parisian department store LVMH bought four years ago during its diversification into distribution.The famous Art Deco store is in need of a makeover after building inspectors last month said the building was no longer safe. But the store's 1,350 employees have accused the luxury group of using the safety issue as a cynical excuse to close La Samaritaine.Their unions also claim the works could have been carried out in phases, thus avoiding a complete closure. They suspect LVMH of speculative designs on the landmark property, including redeveloping it into a luxury hotel.Nonsense, says LVMH, keenly aware of the damage the affair could have on its reputation in France. There was no alternative but to close the store.To try to reassure employees of what once was considered one of the capital's most paternalistic institutions, LVMH will unveil today a ""very generous"" package of measures for staff with the promise of new jobs for all.Recently named France's richest individual, Mr Arnault cannot afford to play the Bad Samaritan.Carat cartelThe demand for diamonds is booming and far outstripping supply.But dealers in Antwerp, a key cutting centre for diamonds, say one company is continuing to benefit unfairly thanks to its powerful grip on global diamond supply.BVGD, an association grouping 150 Belgian dealers, has just lodged a formal complaint with the European Commission competition authority against De Beers for anti-competitive practices.De Beers faced a similar EU antitrust investigation some years ago over its strategy of selling diamonds to a select group of trusted traders. The company made several proposals to amend its practices and Brussels cleared it in 2003.The Antwerp dealers claim these measures have proved ""completely insufficient and ineffective"".They accuse the company of having misled the Commission and continuing to abuse its dominant position.De Beers dismisses the charges, claiming the diamond market has become ""extraordinarily competitive"".But with De Beers controlling about two-thirds of world rough diamond supplies sold to around 80 hand-picked dealers, it is high time EU trust-busters took another look.european.comment@ft.com"
923;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-21T17:19:10Z;DS Waters hits quarterly profits at Danone;;Danone's first-half net profits fell 37 per cent to €347m ($420.9m) after it was forced to set aside €200m to reflect the continued deterioration of its US water cooler joint venture, DS Waters.The setback helped deflate the French food multinational's share price, which had surged 17 per cent over the previous two days in the expectation that PepsiCo, the US cola and snack maker, might bid for the company. They closed down 4.7 per cent to €87.85.The French establishment continued to make it clear that any foreign bidder for Danone, the world's biggest dairy company, could face a potent protectionist response.France's President Jacques Chirac said he was remaining “particularly vigilant” over Danone's future, stressing the importance of defending France's “industrial competitiveness” and the strength of its companies.Nicolas Sarkozy, interior minister, told French newspaper Le Monde that the government “could not stay inactive” in the face of a hostile bid for Danone, saying it would mobilise key shareholders, such as the state-owned Caisse des Dépôts, to block such an offer. France's recent rejection of the European constitutional treaty raised fears among business people that the country's leaders could adopt more protectionist policies.Overall, Danone's sales rose 2.9 per cent to €6.437bn in the first half, having been held back by changes to group structure. On a like-for-like basis, the sales growth was 6.5 per cent after an acceleration in the second quarter, when 7.6 per cent growth was posted.Franck Riboud, chairman and chief executive, was unavailable for comment. But in an interview given to Les Echos, the FT's sister paper, he said Danone had not received any approach from PepsiCo. However, he said he was willing “to fight” for Danone's “independence” and “culture”.In the event of a bid, Danone only needs to create a shareholder alliance representing 34 per cent of its capital to fend off an unwanted suitor. However, it is already a big owner of its own shares. After buying back more shares, Danone's shareholding has risen to 7.4 per cent, it disclosed yesterday, up from 6.5 per cent at the end of last year.The €200m provision against a reduction in the value of DS Waters, a joint venture with Japan's Suntory, comes just six months after Danone said that it would take a charge of €450m in its 2004 accounts to reflect its disappointing performance.Danone said it was in advanced talks to sell its stake in the business, which has suffered from the increasing tendency of customers to buy cheaper water coolers.

But gains following good results from Ericsson and Essilor were pared after Nokia’s second-quarter numbers failed to impress.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended up 0.2 per cent to 1,164.80.Nokia’s shares were knocked 10.1 per cent lower to €13.22 after the Finnish mobile phone maker disappointed with numbers that barely matched expectations, let alone strongly surpassed them, as many had hoped. The Finnish company also disappointed on third-quarter guidance, failing to meet market expectations on sales and earnings per share.Swedish rival Ericsson, however, beat forecasts with its quarterly pre-tax profit and sales, and raised its assessment of growth in the full year. Shares gained 2.7 per cent to SKr27.Richard Windsor of Nomura said the results were “buoyed by strength in emerging markets and increasing demand in professional services”, but kept a “sell” rating in the belief the cycle had peaked.Essilor International led the Eurofirst 300 gainers list as it rose 4.7 per cent to €60.80. The maker of optical lenses reported a 6.7 per cent rise in first-half sales after a “vigorous” recovery in Europe and continued growth in Latin America and Asia. The company also said it was confident about the remainder of the year.SAP, the German business software maker, beat expectations on license sales and operating income, and said its four-month average market share in the US was 41 per cent. However, investors were disappointed it only re-iterated its forecast for full-year software revenue growth of 10-12 per cent.“While these are good numbers, and management has executed well, we see better value elsewhere in the sector,” Mark Bryan of Deutsche Bank said. The stock fell 1.4 per cent to €145.50.Danone, the French dairy and food group, reported a “robust” first half. John Parker at Deutsche Bank hailed the dairy division’s performance as “excellent” but Andrew Wood of Sanford Bernstein felt it was “continuing to shows signs of a slowdown”. The numbers were overshadowed again by takeover speculation surrounding the company.Chairman Franck Riboud said in Les Echos, a sister paper of the Financial Times, that he had received no approach from PepsiCo, but was taking the threat seriously.After putting on 16 per cent in two days, the stock was down 5.2 per cent to €87.85 as investors took Mr Riboud’s comments to mean the company would oppose a PepsiCo bid.Banca Antonveneta shares fell 2.9 per cent to €25.74 on worries that ABN Amro will abandon its bid for the Italian bank on Friday, when the offer expires. BBVA’s bid for Banca Nazionale del Lavoro also expires on Friday. Both non-Italian bidders face domestic counter-bids. BNL eased 0.5 per cent to €2.695.Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena added another 4.5 per cent to €3.33 on continued speculation that real estate investors were building a stake. Its three-day gain stands at almost 15 per cent.Investment bankers were queuing to raise their price targets on Swiss drugmaker Roche after Wednesday’s session, during which the company reported strong results and announced that governments around the world were being advised by the World Health Organisation to stock up on its Tamiflu drug in the event of a serious outbreak of bird flu.Lehman Brothers lifted its target on Roche to SFr156 from SFr153 and maintained its “equal weight” rating, while UBS raised its target to SFr200 from SFr182 and held its “buy” rating. Finally, Credit Suisse upped its target price to SFr188 from SFr150, while confirming its “outperform” rating.“Project BioShield II proposes the need for a stockpile of anti-virals for a rapid response to a flu pandemic,” said Merrill Lynch in a research note. “This has particularly benefited Roche’s Tamiflu, as France, the UK, New Zealand and Norway have all placed orders.”The shares gave up early gains to slip 0.9 per cent to SFr170.50.Deutsche Post rose 4.2 per cent to €20.19 ahead of its July 28 first-half results. “DPWN has underperformed remarkably peers Exel and DSV and has significant upside due to very low valuations,” Tue Oestergaard of WestLB said.
925;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-20T21:00:32Z;Wall Street bounces back after GM disappointment;;Shares staged a strong recovery on Wednesday after Wall Street was knocked off course by an unexpected loss from General Motors and disappointing results from two leading tech companies.Before the start of trading, GM reported a financial performance that even the car marker’s chief executive described as “very disappointing”, sending shares down 0.7 per cent to $36.58.The markets then spent much of the first half of the day in negative territory as results from Yahoo and Intel raised concerns about revenue growth.Intel made a slight recovery but was still 4.4 per cent down at $27.44 after the chipmaker announced earnings on Tuesday that satisfied expectations on Wall Street. Margins, however, were less than expected.It was a similar story at Yahoo, which hit earnings forecasts but missed revenue targets. The internet search engine saw shares close 11.5 per cent down at $33.40. Google also fell 0.7 per cent on the news, down to $312.Analysts said the market had become overly-sensitive to poor earnings figures and that recent upward momentum would be sustained.“The earnings numbers have been getting better and better all week and that has raised expectations too high,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist, at Wells Capital Management. “Even when Yahoo met expectations it still got hit. But despite the bad headlines the market is basically unchanged.”By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had recovered and up 0.4 per cent at 10,689.15. The S&P 500, which had been down 0.3 per cent, was up 0.5 per cent at 1,235.2 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent at 2,188.57.Alan Greenspan helped dispel the market’s suddenly bearish mood when he testified to Congress. The Federal Reserve chairman said the outlook for the US economy was good and that the central bank should keep tightening interest rates.The S&P 500 was also bolstered by a good performance from the world’s largest biotechnology company. Amgen saw its share price jump by 15 per cent to $81.17 after reporting a 38 per cent increase in second-quarter profit and raising its full year forecast.PepsiCo shares slipped after Dominique de Villepin, the French prime minister, condemned speculation that the soft-drink maker was ready to take over Danone, the French food group.Mr Villepin said he would defend the interests of one of the “flowers of our industry”. Danone shares rose in Paris, while PepsiCo’s fell 1.7 per cent to $54.60.Eastman Kodak fell 2.2 per cent to $28.10. The world’s largest photography company announced its third consecutive quarterly loss, saying it would cut 10,000 more jobs.Maytag shares fell 11 per cent to $15.61 after Chinese company Haier announced it had given up trying to takeover the US appliance maker. Shares in Whirlpool, which offered $1.35bn earlier in the week, were up 0.9 per cent at $76.10.
926;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-20T20:48:59Z;European Comment: Russian rush dampens Shell debut;;"Investors on Wednesday were queueing to buy shares in Russian gas company Novatek and to dump the new unified Royal Dutch Shell on their London market debuts.This may seem puzzling, given Moscow's efforts to regain control of its energy industry and what should have been a red-letter day for the Anglo-Dutch major.The reason behind this odd reversal of roles is that Shell must still convince the markets it can resolve its reserve problems, along with the $10bn additional hit it is taking on its flagship Russian gas project.As for Novatek, whose $1bn share offer has been 10 times oversubscribed, it is regarded as one of the fastest-growing and most profitable Russian energy companies.Yet some investors are far from enthusiastic over the Russian IPO, especially Total. The Novatek share offer is likely to reduce even further the French major's chances of acquiring a 25 per cent stake in the Russian company.Total is still waiting for clearance from the Moscow authorities to complete the deal, announced last year. It has warned it would probably walk away in the event an IPO left insufficient shares to close its transaction.Without Novatek, Total risks missing its 4 per cent average annual production growth targets. Its difficulties point to the obstacles all the majors are encountering in their attempts to buy smaller companies in a high oil price environment. If these difficulties persist, they are likely to revive talk of a Total-Shell mega-merger as the best way forward.Swiss GuardThe political chorus grew even louder in Paris on Wednesday as more ministers and opposition leaders joined the national campaign to discourage PepsiCo from taking a pop at Danone.With the markets still betting on a hostile bid - sending Danone's shares even higher - the French establishment is scrambling to defend its food champion. All eyes are now on Switzerland, in the hope that Nestlé will come to the rescue if PepsiCo makes a move.The Swiss multinational is France's favoured white knight to keep Danone in European, if not French, hands. Peter Brabeck, Nestlé's boss, is familiar with Danone's Franck Riboud as both sit on the L'Oréal board.Nestlé operates, and would doubtlessly be interested, in all three of Danone's businesses - dairy products, water and biscuits.A friendly takeover would make the Swiss group the overwhelmingly dominant world player in dairy and water, while making its relatively small biscuits business a worldwide leader.All this would inevitably raise huge competition issues. Yet notwithstanding these antitrust risks, analysts believe Nestlé - for all its legendary caution - would clearly be seriously tempted, if invited, to make an offer.Fortunately, French politicians have short memories. A year ago, the Swiss were hardly France's most popular business associates. First Novartis managed to upset Paris by proposing to enter the Aventis takeover battle, then Nestlé threatened to sell or shut down another French icon, Perrier.New cropLike the good farmer he is, René Carron is rotating his crops at Crédit Agricole.After four challenging years that included its stock market debut followed by the acquisition of Crédit Lyonnais, the chairman felt the ""green bank"" needed a new chief executive to take it forward.Georges Pauget, a Crédit Agricole veteran currently in charge of Crédit Lyonnais, will now take over in September. But he has already been given responsibility for the bank's development plans, to be announced in the autumn.His appointment was welcomed inside and outside the group, with investors hoping the management shake-up would help revive what has been one of Europe's worst performing bank stocks.Jean Laurent, the outgoing chief executive, will continue as chairman of the bank's investment arm. But his change of role is likely to improve the atmosphere in the executive suite.Relations between Mr Carron and Mr Laurent were never easy. They were not helped by Mr Laurent's initial reluctance to buy a stake in Crédit Lyonnais, until Mr Carron stepped in and bought the bank under BNP Paribas's nose.Insiders say Mr Carron and Mr Pauget are very close. This should restore the necessary internal consensus to allow the new chief executive to embark on the challenge of developing the bank's international dimension. With banking consolidation growing in fashion across Europe, the timing could not be better.european.comment@ft.com"
927;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-20T20:48:30Z;Nestlé lines up ultra-low refinance;;Nestlé, the Swiss food maker, has taken advantage of the high levels of liquidity swirling around Europe’s loan markets to refinance a chunk of its debt at a price lower than anything seen for at least a decade, bankers have indicated.The group is in the process of agreeing two credit lines totalling €3.2bn from Citigroup and Deutsche Bank that will pay the bankers a fee of a mere 2-3 basis points.That, in turn, will imply that the company’s overall cost of borrowing will be just 7.5bp-10bp over Libor, with the precise cost depending on the amount of credit line used.This ultra-cheap borrowing is not necessarily entirely representative of the entire market, bankers say, since Nestlé is one of the few companies rated AAA by credit agencies.However, the deal provides further evidence of the excess liquidity present in European loan markets and the degree to which this is continuing to reduce the cost of borrowing for companies, particularly in the investment grade sector.Bankers warn that these easy borrowing costs are likely to continue for the next few months, given the European Central Bank has shown little readiness to start raising interest rates and investment grade companies are reluctant to raise their borrowings to fund investment or acquisitions on a significant scale.Some investment bankers hope this picture will change later in the year, if more mergers and acquisition activity occurs.These hopes have been boosted in recent days by speculation that PepsiCo is considering a bid for Danone – a move that has also ignited debate about Nestlé’s own acquisition plans.However, in practice European M&A activity this year has been lower than bankers had hoped. Consequently, much of the investment grade loan syndication activity has been driven by refinancing, rather than M&A.
928;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-20T19:39:07Z;Lex: Danone;;Takeover rumours are mouth-watering, especially once they appear credible enough to make politicians panic. But Danone's share price has risen almost 30 per cent during the past two weeks alone. Anyone offering a bid premium on top of that is likely to suffer from indigestion.Thursday's interim results should show healthy sales growth. But underlying profits could be much less impressive, in spite of last year's disposals and likely lower depreciation charges.Over three years, capital expenditure as a percentage of sales has fallen by a quarter, even as growth accelerated. Scale benefits aside, two possible reasons are that Danone delayed investments or that capital intensity decreased. That suggests either shrinking barriers to entry and a margin squeeze or rising capital expenditure. Given the threats from discount retailers, it might be both.Would-be bidders, such as bête noire PepsiCo, should avoid extrapolating recent trends, especially on cash-generation. Not that much of a deterioration is needed to make Danone look unappetising. The perennial takeover candidate is already trading at 22 times optimistic consensus earnings for 2005. That is quite high by any sane standard the odd food deal during the millennium bubble not withstanding. Add the risks of a French consumer backlash, political resistance and a managerial exodus, and it will take more than a few probiotic yoghurts to rebalance a buyer's intestinal flora.
929;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-20T17:05:51Z;Mobile makers and oils weigh on Eurofirst;;European stocks suffered moderate losses on Wednesday as the oil and telecoms equipment sectors came under pressure.The FTSE Eurofirst fell 0.3 per cent from its three-year highs to 1,163.02.Nokia, the world’s biggest mobile handset maker, fell 2.2 per cent to €14.70 and Ericssonshed 1.5 per cent to SKr26.30 after US peer Motorola only managed to meet expectations with its quarterly earnings.Other European technology stocks were down for much of the day after Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, and Yahoo, the internet service provider, disappointed with their quarterly results.However, chipmakers Infineonand STMicroelectronicsmanaged to recoup early losses to both finish 0.1 per cent higher at €8.54 and €14.92 respectively.ASML, the Dutch chip making equipment maker, leapt 3.5 per cent to €14.70 on hopes of more orders from Intel after the semiconductor manufacturing giant increased its 2005 capital expenditure budget again.RTL, Europe’s biggest television broadcaster, topped the FTSEurofirst leader board. The shares rose 6 per cent to €59.35 after buying out UBM’s minority stake in the UK’s Channel Five for £247.6m.Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, led the pharmaceuticals sector higher with a rise of 3.8 per cent to SFr171.60.It reported that first-half net profits rose 4 per cent on sales growth for cancer treatments and its Tamiflu influenza drug.The results beat expectations, but the share price really took off when Bill Burns, chief executive, revealed that more than 25 governmentshad placed orders for Tamiflu in preparation for a potential bird flu outbreak in humans. This came after advice from the World Health Organisation.Swiss biotech group Seronorose 2.6 per cent to SFr864 after second-quarter net income beat analysts’ expectations.Altana, the German drug and chemical group, rose 2.3 per cent to €42.74. Sales of Protonix, made by its US partner Wyeth using an Altana drug, climbed 17 per cent in the second quarter.French food and dairy group Danonerose 5.8 per cent to €92.65, taking its two-day advance to 16.5 per cent, after the FT said Morgan Stanley and UBS, the investment banks, were understood to have been appointed to advise PepsiCo, the US soft drinks company, on a possible takeover.“We do not believe a bid above €100 [a share] is feasible or likely,” said Robert van Brugge at Bernstein. “Assuming a stand-alone value of €80 per share and $500m in synergies, we estimate PepsiCo could bid up to €96 per Danone share.”Meanwhile, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Sienahit a three-year high on mounting bid speculation.A group of property developers switched out of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and into Monte Paschi on Monday, hoping a new bidding war might emerge.Monte Paschi shares rose 4.8 per cent to €3.195, taking its two-day climb to more than 10 per cent.Credit Agricolewas up 3.1 per cent to €22.69 after announcing the appointment of Georges Pauget as chief executive to replace Jean Laurent.Oil stockscontinued to behave counterintuitively to oil price movements, falling despite a midday rise in crude. A trader ascribed this eccentricity to Royal Dutch Shell’s move to a single entity listing with a larger index weighting, causing “a lot of funny movements as fund managers have to buy into the Royal Dutch Shell line and out of other lines”.Royal Dutch “A” shares in Amsterdam were off 1.2 per cent to €25.40, while the “B” shares in London were 1.7 per cent lower at £18.08. A bearish report on the level of US crude stockpiles in the afternoon pushed oil futures lower and left the sector as the biggest negative pull on the Eurofirst 300.Cepsa of Spain fell 2.9 per cent to €39.90 and Statoil of Norway dropped 1.6 per cent to NKr136.50.Volkswagen climbed 1.6 per cent to €41.60 as Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein raised its price target to €46 from €40.“VW is currently in the best position it has been in since the beginning of the ‘90s to undergo comprehensive reform – both from a fundamental business perspective and with regard to its substantial corporate governance deficits,” said analyst Arndt Ellinghorst.BMW added 0.3 per cent to €39.42, and DaimlerChrysler added 0.3 per cent to €35.59 after below consensus second quarter results from US peer General Motors.OMX, the Nordic and Baltic bourse owner, fell 3.4 percent to SKr92.50, as lower orders for the struggling Technology division disappointed investors.
930;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-20T17:01:08Z;French pledge to defend Danone;;Dominique de Villepin, the French prime minister, on Wednesday issued a veiled warning to any potential foreign bidders for Danone, declaring that the food multinational was one of France’s industrial “jewels” and adding that his government would strive to defend “the interests of France”.The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that PepsiCo had appointed investment banks Morgan Stanley and UBS to advise on a potential takeover of Danone, whose shares had previously surged following rumours that the cola maker would bid.Danone’s products range from yoghurt and biscuits to Evian and Volvic bottled water. Having risen 10.2 per cent on Tuesday, Danone shares rose by as much as 9.9 per cent on Wednesday, hitting a high of €96.25 before falling back slightly.The possibility of a bid for Danone by PepsiCo has met a hostile response from politicians, such as Laurent Fabius, the former prime minister, and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former finance minister.Mr de Villepin did not refer directly to PepsiCo.On Wednesday, Jean-Louis Borloo, the employment minister, said the government would do all that it could to oppose a hostile bid, although he added that PepsiCo’s interest was nothing more than a rumour.A person close to Danone denied a suggestion that chief executive Franck Riboud - who has in the past said he wanted Danone to remain independent - had lobbied the government to scare off PepsiCo.Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein estimated that PepsiCo could afford to bid up to 96 per share, based on an assumption that it could save $500m a year through purchasing Danone.A person close to Nestlé dismissed suggestions that the Swiss company could become a white knight bidder for Danone, saying European competition regulators would block such a move. It is also understood that Unilever is not interested in making large acquisitions at the moment.Danone’s statutes contain a poison pill provision that means that any bidder would have to own at least two thirds of the company’s shares for it to be able to exercise voting control over the business. Below this point, the shareholder’s voting rights are limited to 12 per cent.Danone held a board meeting on Wednesday in advance of reporting half-year results on Thursday. The results could feature an update on the future of DS Waters, its disappointing US water cooler joint venture. Last month Danone warned that it might have to cut the unit’s value again, having already announced a €450m charge in January.
931;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-19T19:31:27Z;European Comment: France defends Danone;;"The rumours will simply not go away. Danone shares surged on renewed talk that PepsiCo was preparing a hostile bid for the French food group.Long regarded an unassailable national champion, the yoghurt, Evian water and biscuit maker - with a free float of 86 per cent - has been a potential takeover target for the past three years.Speculation has now reached a level where French politicians are taking fright - further stoking rather than damping the market's frenzy.Patrick Ollier, head of the National Assembly's economic affairs committee, is so ""angry"" and ""worried"" that he promises Danone will be defended tooth and nail by French institutional investors such as the state Caisse des Dépôts. He claims finance minister Thierry Breton is taking a personal interest in the matter.All this has a familiar protectionist ring that has grown louder ever since Canada's Alcan swooped on metals champion Pechiney two summers ago.This is nonsense, of course. Danone may be an industrial symbol, but France now accounts for only 22 per cent of its business, a portion that is falling. Nor has it had any inhibition in shutting poorly-performing domestic operations.In a global world, you win some and you lose some. Paris cheered Pernod Ricard's recent takeover of UK-based Allied Domecq. It may have to accept, one day, a foreigner swallowing its national yoghurt maker.Aspirin bondsInvestors in search of a little more yield in the current low interest rate climate are showing growing appetite for hybrid bonds.Although banks were the first to issue deeply subordinated bonds that combine features of debt and equity, more and more European industrial groups are turning to these instruments to strengthen their balance sheets.In the past three years, only three European companies - Michelin, Linde and Casino - issued hybrids. But last month alone, three companies placed similar bonds, suggesting the market is taking off.Confirming the trend is the ease with which Bayer this week placed its €1.3bn hybrid issue, after receiving orders for €6bn.Companies find these bonds attractive because they have the advantages of a capital increase without diluting shareholders or putting their credit ratings at risk.So what are the risks for yield hungry investors? As deeply subordinated bonds, they are the first to be hit in the event of default.The company can also defer coupon payments and there is no guarantee, in Bayer's case, that the German company will exercise its option to buy back the 100-year bonds after 10 years.That said, the inventor of aspirin is hardly a high-risk proposition, and its Aspirin bond investors are unlikely to have to rush to the medicine cabinet.Air pollutionThe aviation lobby appears to have succeeded in delaying European Commission plans for cutting aircraft pollution.Brussels is today expected to unveil long-awaited proposals to reduce aircraft emissions as part of its commitment to combat climate change. These have now been postponed until the autumn, pending further consultations.Airlines, aircraft manufacturers and engine makers have all argued against imposing excessive levies on an industry already burdened by heavy taxes, high fuel costs and security charges.They claim new technology is already reducing air transport pollution. And they point the finger at Europe's fragmented air traffic control system and congested airports for causing long delays on the ground and in the air.That may well be so. But the problem will not go away. Brussels warns that, unchecked, aircraft emissions will exceed all other polluters combined by 2025.Flying jumbos rather than a multitude of smaller aircraft is one solution. At present, larger aircraft pay proportionately bigger airport landing fees than smaller ones when it should be the other way round.Even better would be to set anti-pollution targets taxing aircraft only if they breach established thresholds. This would accelerate the withdrawal of older airliners. By also providing incentives to go below the thresholds, manufacturers would be encouraged to develop even cleaner aircraft and engines.european.comment@ft.com"
932;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
933;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-19T18:04:54Z;Danone stock rises on Pepsi takeover talk;;Danone shares leapt 14 per cent on Tuesday as French politicians fanned takeover speculation by noisily declaring their opposition to the idea of a foreigner swooping on brands that range from Evian and Volvic water to Lu biscuits.The French dairy and water company's shares have been buoyed recently by stubborn rumours that it could be a target for PepsiCo. The US maker of Pepsi Cola has already been forced to deny it had built a small stake in Danone.Danone shares closed at €87.60, valuing the company at €23.5bn ($28.3bn).Patrick Ollier, a member of parliament from the ruling UMP party, who also chairs a parliamentary economic affairs committee, was the first politician to give weight to the rumours of a takeover attempt.On Monday evening, he claimed on television that the threat to Danone's independence was such that Thierry Breton, French finance minister, was taking a keen interest.He also claimed that French institutional investors such as Caisse des Dépôts would support Danone if it came under attack. The finance ministry and Caisse des Dépôts declined to comment on Tuesday.Mr Ollier told Les Echos, the French sister paper of the Financial Times, that takeovers of French “jewels” by foreigners were “scandalous”, adding that would particularly be the case if the maker of Pepsi was to buy Danone, “the symbol of dairy products and French quality”.Dominique Strauss-Kahn, one of the most popular socialist parliamentarians and a former finance minister, said a hostile takeover from the US would be a “direct attack” on the identity of many French people.However, Renaud Dutreil, the minister for small and medium-sized companies, was quoted by Reuters as saying: “The government does not have the right to interfere in the affairs of private companies.”PepsiCo on Tuesday stood by its earlier statement denying that the group had built a stake in Danone but declined to comment on whether it did want to bid.“There is too much smoke in the air for there not to be any fire,” said Tom Pirko, president of BevMark, a beverage consultancy. “This is a deal that should be done and can be done.”Analysts have long speculated that either PepsiCo or its rival Coca-Cola could attempt an acquisition of Danone. Coca-Cola on Tuesday declined to comment and Neville Isdell, chief executive, has said the company was not looking to make a large acquisition. But analysts said Coke could be drawn into a bidding war for Danone if PepsiCo made a move. Kraft has also been seen as a potential suitor, with Nestlé touted as a “white knight” bidder if one of its rivals made a move.

The shares had edged back in the two weeks since it denied the soft drinks company had made an approach, but speculation was rekindled after it was thought French finance minister Thierry Breton was concerned about a possible takeover. By the close, Danone was off its highs to sit 10.2 per cent firmer at €87.60.The company reports on its first-half performance tomorrow, and is expected to announce around 6 per cent like-for-like sales growth and stable operating margins. Analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston said: “We believe the shares are currently trading above their fair value of €75 a share. However, it is our view that they are currently driven more by reported bid speculation than operational performance.”There was also speculation that, should PepsiCo acquire Danone, Numicomight be in line to purchase its babyfood division. Shares in the Dutch food company were up 3.5 per cent to €34.25.Sanofi-Aventis, the drugmaker, announced sales growth of 6.5 per cent in the second quarter, a little below expectations, knocking the shares 0.6 per cent to €70.Also in the pharmaceuticals sector, Bayer, the German drugs and chemicals group, said that second-phase trials showed that its stroke-treatment drug was effective and safe. Shares rose 0.5 per cent to €28.74.Morgan Stanley said it was assuming coverage of Merck at “overweight”, with a price target of €69, as it expected Erbitux, the cancer drug, to be a “strong performer”.“We are forecasting earnings growth of 41.6 per cent to €136m,” said analyst Andrew Swift. “Growth will be driven by strong sales in liquid crystals and Erbitux, combined with improved operating margins.” Shares rose 1.3 per cent to €68.Electrolux, the world’s leading electrical appliance maker, rose 5.1 per cent to SKr175.50 on relief that the Swedish company had stuck to its outlook despite slightly lower-than-expected quarterly earnings.Soaring steel prices and higher raw material costs dragged its second-quarter pre-tax profits slightly below consensus forecasts.High steel prices worked wonders for the metal’s manufacturers, however. Arcelor, the French group, gained 3.8 per cent to €17.29, ThyssenKrupp of Germany added 1.6 per cent to €14.88, while Corus Groupclimbed 3 per cent to €0.68.“We expect steel prices to pick up from recent lows due to further supply-side discipline in the third quarter,” said Edward Maravanyika, strategist at Goldman Sachs. “Given that steel stocks traditionally move upwards one or two quarters ahead of the steel price, we could see a short-term bounce in steel equities lasting into the fourth quarter”Munich Re, the German reinsurer, was up 3.5 per cent to €92.45 after its US subsidiary American Re increased its reserves by less than originally feared. The company said its second-quarter results would take a €0.4bn hit, but confirmed that it still expected a 12 per cent return on equity after tax for the full year.Greece, for a second successive session, outperformed other European indices. The Athens General index closed 2.5 per cent higher at 3,252.13, a two-day rise of 4.3 per cent. That took the index to a 50-month high, as investors were tempted by its exposure to high-growth eastern Europe.Public Power, the utility, was up 4.5 per cent to €20.28, while OTE gained 3.9 per cent to €16.90 and Alpha Bank rose 4.2 per cent to €23.60.Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena rose 5.3 per cent to €3.05 on speculation it may the next takeover target in the Italian banking consolidation saga.Finnish forestry and paper companies were strong after Goldman Sachs described the sector as “too attractive to ignore”. The broker said it saw a short-term trading opportunity, boosted by post-strike inventory building.Recent lockouts in Finland meant 30 per cent of European paper capacity was shut for seven weeks, Goldmans said. UPM-Kymmenewas up 3.2 per cent to €16.04 and Stora Enso, which was upgraded to “outperform” from “in line”, rose 3.4 per cent to €10.80.
935;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-15T16:49:56Z;Wall St shrugs off hangover of rising oil prices;;For once the markets were not totally in thrall to oil prices during a week that saw a surge of investor optimism after an extended period of worrying that rising energy costs would eat into corporate profits.Instead, the market was energised by better than expected jobs figures and some good earnings results – not least from Apple, which reaped rich rewards from the enduring popularity of its iPod music player system.Owen Fitzpatrick, managing director of Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, said traders had not been as jittery about oil prices as in previous weeks.“The market seems to be taking it in its stride because it is so weather- related. It goes up when a storm is brewing in the Gulf but when it passes oil falls back off again.” Although the rising oil price helped the energy sector, the week finished with uncertainty hanging over CNOOC’s $18.5bn attempt to takeover Unocal.A crucial board meeting by Unocal executives ended on Thursday night with no public statement about the competing bid from Chevron. During late morning trade yesterday CNOOC’s New York listed shares were down 1.6 per cent on the day at $59.90 – down 3.6 per cent on last Friday’s close.Technology and healthcare stocks performed well during the week.Leading the pack were Advanced Micro Devices and Apple. A record five-fold increase in sales of iPods sent Apple shares soaring, up 7.8 per cent at $41.23 compared to last week.AMD reported better than expected profit as strong sales of personal computers and corporate servers offset losses from flash memory chips for consumer gadgets. AMD shares rose 1.3 per cent during the week to $19.18.The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 3.9 per cent to 459.85 during the week on the back of AMD’s results.Intel was up 4.7 per cent to $19.71 over the week while Texas Instruments, which is to publish its results this month, gained 2.3 per cent to $30.42.Amgen, the biotechnology company, rose above the $70 mark, with a 1.4 per cent gain during the week taking it to $70.10 a share.Mergers and takeovers also helped to bolster the healthcare sector with VNU, the Dutch owner of AC Nielsen, agreeing to buy IMS Health in a $7bn deal.VNU was up 3.7 per cent over the week at $12.47 while IMS was up 5.1 per cent at $27.22.It was also a good week for PepsiCo when the world’s second-largest soft-drinks maker reported better than expected quarterly profits due to strong growth in its international business, taking it to $55.71 – a 4.1 per cent gain since last Friday.“All these good results have reassured the market that growth is not going to fall off a cliff,” said Mr Fitzpatrick.Investors also cheered strong economic reports, including a slight narrowing of the US trade deficit, and government data showing retail sales rose 1.7 per cent in June even as inflation remained under control.Among various bits of data released yesterday the government said producer prices had held steady over the last month and the Federal Reserve announced that industrial production rose 0.9 per cent in June, compared to a 0.3 per cent rise in May.By late morning yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen slightly to 10,626.82 and the broader S&P 500 was down at 1,225.57. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2 per cent to 2,148.76.Over the week the Dow was up 1.7 per cent, the S&P advanced 1.1 per cent, after attaining a four-year high on Thursday, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.7 per cent.Among the stocks to disappoint this week was General Electric. Yesterday General Electric announced profits that only met analysts expectations and warned third-quarter earnings may fall short of some forecasts.By late morning yesterday shares in the company had slipped 1.2 per cent to $35.19.Yum! Brands, the owner of Pizza Hut and KFC, saw its shares fall more than four per cent after it lowered its forecast for the year. Across the week its share price fell 1.6 per cent to $51.03.Shares of DreamWorks Animation SKG also took a tumble after the maker of Shrek said it would post a second-quarter loss. The shares dropped 13.8 per cent to $23.10 over the week.
936;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-13T20:24:45Z;Soft drinks 'should carry health warnings';;A US consumer group has called for cigarette-style health warnings on soft drinks, to alert people to the harmful effects of too many sugary beverages.The proposal by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) highlights the increasing pressure on soft-drink producers, such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, over their alleged role in the obesity epidemic sweeping North America and western Europe.In a petition to the US Food and Drug Administration, the CSPI said people–especially young people–needed warning about the risks of obesity, diabetes and tooth decay associated with excessive consumption of sugary drinks.Suggested warnings included: “To help protect your waistline and your teeth, consider switching to diet sodas or water.”The American Beverage Association (ABA), which represents soft-drink producers, said the proposal “patronises consumers and lacks common sense”.Susan Neely, president of the industry group, said labels on soft-drink packaging already provided consumers with detailed information, including quantity of sugar and calories.Soft-drink producers were addressing the obesity issue by offering smaller serving sizes and widening their range of products to include sugar-free versions and water, she added.Concern about obesity is among the main reasons for the recent slump in US soft-drink consumption. Average Americans consumed 18 fewer cans of soft drinks in 2004 than in 1998. For the same period, average calorie consumption per beverage serving declined 16 per cent because of growth in bottled water and diet drinks, according to Beverage Digest trade newsletter.But the CSPI said the average US teenage boy still consumed 1.5 cans of soft drinks each day. Every 12-ounce can of regular Coca-Cola contains 39g of sugar–equivalent to about 10 teaspoons.“Parents and health officials need to recognise soft drinks for what they are liquid candy and do everything they can to return those beverages to their former role as an occasional treat,” said the CSPI.According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the proportion of children and teenagers considered overweight has tripled since 1980 to 16 per cent, while nearly one-third of US adults are obese.
937;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:19:44+0000;Growth in world sales adds fizz to Pepsi;;Stocks rallied slightly on Tuesday afternoon after a morning when the markets were blown off course by surging oil prices and shrugged off strong earning results from PepsiCo and Genentech.After three consecutive days of gains, the S&P 500 retreated into negative territory, but by mid-afternoon the index had recovered to a 0.4 per cent gain at 1,223.86. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed back up to show a 0.2 per cent gain at 10,535.37 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 2,144.78.The markets had earlier taken fright after oil futures for August delivery climbed back to $60.65, down from $61.25 earlier, on news that Hurricane Dennis may have disrupted crude production in the Gulf of Mexico, sparking fears that higher energy costs could eat into consumer spending and corporate profits.US light sweet crude for August delivery was up 42 cents to $59.34 a barrel.PepsiCo, along with Apple Computer and General Electric, is one of the most eagerly awaited results of the earnings seasons, and gained 1.9 per cent to $54.91. The second largest soft drink maker had said that quarterly profits were up more than expected because of strong growth in its international business.Genentech, a biotechnology company, also beat expectations, sending shares up 1. per cent to $84.96.Sarah Hunt, a research analyst at Capital Management Associates, said despite good earnings, news investors remained sceptical about what the rest of the earnings season had in store.“The Genentech results is fairly company specific because the rest of the biotech sector has not been outperforming. We’re in an odd period at the moment, with the market being really choppy but also drifting because there isn’t any economic data out there.”In other corporate news, Sirius Satellite Radio took a 2 per cent tumble to $6.92 after UBS lowered its investment rating on the subscription radio company.Also in the radio sector, Walt Disney shares rose 1.8 per cent to $25.62 on reports that the company was looking to sell its radio stations.Shares in Bear Stearns fell 0.4 per cent to $106.33 after the bank said it may pay $200m or more to settle regulatory charges that it helped hedge funds trade improperly in mutual fund shares.There was also some more bad news for DreamWorks Animation SKG after the studio, which forecast a loss yesterday, was downgraded by both JPMorgan and Prudential Equity Group. Shares in the company fell 0.3 per cent to $23.19.It was a mixed day for America’s restaurant chains. Darden Restaurants, which owns a range of popular eatery chains, was one of the best performers in the S&P500 after seeing its share price gain 4.3 per cent to $33.87. The company announced stronger than expected June same-store sales for its Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants.Wendy’s International, by contrast, fell 2.4 per cent to $46.90 after stockholder Pershing Square Capital Management LP said the country’s third biggest burger chain should sell its Tim Hortons coffee shops and convert company-owned stores into franchises.
938;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-12T12:44:53Z;Pepsi profits rise 13% on strong global sales;;PepsiCo increased net earnings by a greater-than-expected 13 per cent in the second quarter, with strong international growth offsetting weakness in the group’s domestic soft drink business.International expansion has been the brightest part of PepsiCo’s business for several quarters, as the group reduces its dependence on North America, which still accounts for about two thirds of sales.Quaker Foods, the group’s cereal snacks business, also registered double-digit growth in revenues, highlighting the success of PepsiCo’s diversification beyond its flagship soft drinks business.Sales of carbonated soft drinks were down 4 per cent in volume terms in North America as increasingly health-conscious consumers continued to shift away from sugary beverages.Intensified competition from rival Coca-Cola, which has launched a series of new products this year in an attempt to revive its fortunes, put additional pressure on PepsiCo’s soft drinks business.However, total beverage volume increased by 5 per cent because of strong performance by non-carbonated products, such as Aquafina bottled water and Gatorade sports drinks.PepsiCo’s broad portfolio of non-carbonated beverages and snack foods has allowed it to avoid the slowdown in growth suffered by Coca-Cola, which remains more focused on carbonated soft drinks.Total net earnings were $1.19bn, or 70 cents a share, compared to $1.06bn, or 61 cents, in the same period last year. Analysts had, on average, expected 67 cents a share, according to Thomson First Call.Revenues grew 9 per cent to $7.7bn.Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo’s chairman and chief executive, said the results gave him “added confidence” in the group’s ability to meet its target of 10 to 12 per cent growth in earnings per share over the full year.He said the strong performance was achieved despite “significant challenges” created by fierce competition and high fuel prices, which caused a slight drop in operating margins.Addressing investors in a conference call, Mr Reinemund said decline in soft drinks was not terminal and forecast a return to growth once the benefits of new products and increased advertising were felt later this year.Frito-Lay North America, the group’s salty snack food business and biggest division, increased revenues by 6 per cent.Revenues from PepsiCo International, which handles all of the group’s beverage and snack sales outside North America, rose by 15 per cent.India, China and Russia were among the fastest-growing overseas snacks markets, while the Middle East, China and Argentina were among the brightest for beverages. However, Mexico and the UK, PepsiCo’s two biggest international markets, were both sluggish.
939;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-07-08T16:41:48Z;Gaz de France IPO helps bourses rebound;;European stocks rallied strongly on Friday as markets showed their resilience in the wake of Thursday’s bomb attacks in London.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed at 1151.34, up 15.22 points or 1.3 per cent on the day, and 0.1 per cent over the week. The pan-European benchmark hit a fresh three-year closing high of 1,157.21 on Wednesday.Gaz de France enjoyed a storming market debut yesterday as investors scrambled to take part in the the world’s biggest initial public offering for three years.The shares finally settled at €28.50, after opening at €27.80. They were offered at €23.40 to institutions and €23.20 to individuals.The IPO represents the French government’s latest privatisation initiative to reduce its budget deficit.About €4.5bn was raised through the sale of a minority stake in Gaz de France, of which the government will take €2.5bn and the company €2bn. Institutional investors subscribed for 30 times as many shares as were offered.Fiat was another success story on Friday after the company’s chief executive was reported to have given an upbeat presentation to institutional investors.The company declined to give further details.Fiat shares rose 7.8 per cent to €6.27 yesterday, for a weekly rise of 4.5 per cent.Over the week as a whole, the oil sector rose strongly as crude prices continued their record-breaking run.US crude futures hit a nominal all-time high of $62.10 on Thursday before seeing extremely volatile trade.Finland’s Neste Oil was the sector’s standout performer, rising 12.5 per cent over the week to €24.10. Statoil rose 7.5 per cent to NKr147, Norsk Hydro climbed 7.3 per cent to NKr647 and Eni gained 7.3 per cent to €23.Danone climbed 11.7 per cent to €81.25 amid persistent speculation that US soft drinks company PepsiCo was building a stake in the French food group.Danone denied the rumours.And German insurer Allianz rose 2.4 per cent to €97.76 as talk resurfaced that the company was about to sell off its Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein investment banking arm.Some in the markets suggested Deutsche Bank as a possible buyer.Deutsche Börse, the operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange, added 2.5 per cent to €68.41. WestLB yesterday upgraded the stock to “outperform”. WestLB analyst Johannes Thormann said: “Despite the good performance of the share price during the first half of the year, we still see upside potential.”But it was a grim week for Michelin, the French tyre maker, as investors fretted about the potential impact of higher rubber prices.A report out earlier in the week suggested that the commodity could hit a nine-year high by December due to strong demand from China.Michelin shares tumbled 6.4 per cent to €47.67. German rival Continental fell 2.4 per cent to €58.56.
940;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Leisure and insurance bear brunt of Europe’s losses;;Danone, the French food group, was among the few stocks that managed to salvage anything from a session rocked by news of co-ordinated terrorist attacks on London’s transport system, which left more than 30 people dead and many more seriously injured.Shares rose 3.9 per cent to €75.70 on rumours PepsiCo, the US soft drinks group, was building a stake in the bottler of Evian mineral water and number one yoghurt producer.“There is a sense of pressure on companies that sell to the major supermarkets which demand bulk discounts, that margin maintenance is increasingly hard to return, so the acquisition trail is one way to counter difficult organic growth,” said Stephen Pope, head of equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald. PepsiCo however, denied the rumours.Elsewhere, there were mainly losses, in spite of a brave attempt at a late rally as the main stock indices came off their worst levels of the day. The FTSE Eurofirst was down 1.9 per cent in late trade to 1,135.6, having fallen 4.3 per cent at its lowest point of the day to 1,107.49.The worst hit sectors were leisure and insurance as investors took money out the stocks most exposed to terrorism.Airlines and travel stocks were hit by the perceived damage that such attacks inflict on the tourism industry. Tui, the world’s biggest travel agency, fell 2.3 per cent to €20.59. A spokesman for the company assured investors “we do not believe that it will have a lasting effect on new bookings”.Lufthansa, the German airline, shed 2.3 per cent to €9.95, Air France-KLM lost 1.3 per cent to €12.42, and SAS, the Swedish carrier, fell 1.5 per cent to SKr64.25. Ryanair, the low-cost carrier, fell 2.3 per cent to €6.32.Luxury goods groups and retailers were similarly affected.Pinault Printemps-Redoute of France fell 2.8 per cent to €82.95, Swedish fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz lost 2.2 per cent to SKr272.50, while Christian Dior slid 3.3 per cent to €62.70 and LVMH, the maker of Louis Vuitton goods, was 2.5 per cent lower at €63.50.European insurers were also left counting the cost of the attacks.Of the life assurers Aegon fell 1.8 per cent to €10.76, while Alleanza was down 2.7 per cent to €8.77.Reinsurers, which take on risk considered too volatile for insurers to include on their balance sheets, were harder hit.Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurer, fell 2.4 per cent to €87 in spite of declaring it was not affected by the attacks.Munich and Hannover Re said they were not part of the so-called “terror pool”, a terrorism risk plan organised between the UK government and a number of insurance companies.Hannover Re was nevertheless down 1.9 per cent to €30.60. Among the other re-insurers Swiss Re lost 2.3 per cent to SFr78.10, Scor was 4.1 per cent lower at €1.66 and Converium lost 2.8 per cent SFr10.25.Energy stocks sank as the price of oil responded to the London explosions in erratic fashion. After hitting new record highs early on in the session, crude retreated by more than $5 on worries about the impact on air travel and economic growth of an increased terror threat. Any reduction in travel, as was seen after the September 11 attacks in 2001, would curtail demand for crude.Worst hit were Royal Dutch down 2.7 per cent to €54.90, Norsk Hydro 2.9 per cent lower at NKr619.50 and Statoil 2.1 per cent lower at NKr140.50.Nestlé outperformed the sliding market, falling 1 per cent to SFr328.25, after Merrill Lynch upgraded the Swiss confectioner and drinks company to “buy” from “neutral”. The broker said the company’s return on invested capital would improve for the first time in two years.“In 2005, Nestlé has increased retail prices in coffee and milk powders, categories where it has pricing power,” Merrill Lynch said in a research note.Deutsche Börse was also among the few stocks on the leaderboard, up 0.1 per cent to €66.91, after Deutsche Bank upgraded its rating to “buy” from “hold” and lifted its price target to €76 from €60.The broker cited strong trading activity in the first half of 2005 for the re-rating. Earnings per share estimates were also increased. Merrill Lynch raised its earnings estimates for the German exchange operator on Wednesday.
941;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:24:36+0000;Pepsi seeks to rebuild as ‘cola war' looms;;As the morning cool of Baghdad dissipates, and the summer sun begins to scorch the pavement, the workers atop a Pepsi truck from Baghdad Soft Drinks don their palm-frond sunhats for the late morning delivery run around nearby Zafaraniya.Security fears are minimal is this predominantly Shia industrial suburb, where residents' sympathies are anti-insurgency. On longer routes outside Baghdad, the truck crews count on ties of kinship for protection, whether against insurgent attacks or apolitical banditry. Falluja and other towns in the dangerous area west of Baghdad are off-limits, however.To continue to work in such an environment, Hamid Jassim Khamis, managing director of Baghdad Soft Drinks, has to believe in the future. His company has the exclusive licence to sell Pepsi products in Iraq, and like other Iraqi businessmen, he worries about security, but believes that the violence is a short-term worry. In the long term, he has other things to think about, and a conversation with him rapidly turns to another subject which is obviously on his mind: Coke.Pepsi's arch rival re-entered the Iraqi market on Friday after a 37-year gap, setting up a joint venture bottling company. Iraq could soon witness a “cola war” between the two US brands.Despite the new competition, Mr Khamis appears happy about the prospect of a two-brand cola universe.“We love competition, and we would welcome such a legitimate competitor,” he says. Authentic local Coke would “raise the standards of the whole market”. It would also break Pepsi's nominal stranglehold on the market, which used to be enforced by Iraq's former Ba'ath party regime.Mr Khamis says his biggest worry now is how to restore the value of the Pepsi brand, tarnished by rampant misuse during 13 years of international sanctions before the US-led invasion two years ago.In a lingering legacy of sanctions busting, more than 10 other manufacturers around Iraq produce similar-looking 225ml returnable glass bottles of Pepsi, 7-Up and Mirinda imitations.Mr Khamis says these producers undermine confidence in his company's prized brands. Through local lawyers, PepsiCo is trying to re-register its trademark in Iraq, hoping for a crackdown on counterfeiters before Coca-Cola starts making “the real thing” locally.But the US-backed government has so far failed to budge on intellectual property protection.In the sanctions years of the 1990s, Baghdad Soft Drinks was among the worst violators. The company originally held a licence from PepsiCo dating back to the 1950s, but promptly lost it after Iraq invaded Kuwait and incurred UN-imposed sanctions in 1990.As Iraq fell out of the global economy, the local Pepsi-maker was forced to replace authentic PepsiCo concentrates with counterfeit varieties smuggled in from eastern Europe.Mr Khamis originally served as managing director during this perdiod in the 1990s, but had to resign after he clashed with Uday Hussein, son of the dictator Saddam Hussein, who muscled into the business and bought a 10 per cent share of the company. But with Baghdad's fall to US forces in 2003, the soft-drink factory witnessed its own, internally driven regime change.While Uday Hussein's stake was frozen, workers forced out his management appointees and Mr Khamis was brought back.The returned managing director now says he feels a strong sense of loyalty to his workers. The current staff of 1,400, split between Zafaraniya and a second factory for canned drinks in New Baghdad, is “an excess”, he admits. But Mr Khamis rules out layoffs unless the rest of the economy picks up.With demand expected to rise with the seasonal heat, he says he would gladly pay overtime to boost production. However, shift work is restricted to daylight hours amid concerns about workers' safety.He says he looks forward to the day when he will need all of his workers, and can run the business round the clock. Soft-drink manufacturing is “always a profitable business”, he says, and is bound to pick up in the years ahead, when conflict diminishes and “social life revives in Iraq”.
942;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-06-22T20:27:21Z;Wall Street edges higher as oil eases;;After a choppy day on the New York market shares edged up slightly by the close after oil prices fell on higher supplies of refined petroleum products.Morning gains led by strong earnings performance in the technology sector were reversed on the release of a government report showing US oil inventories dropped for a third week running. However, shares rallied as oil prices slipped back from Tuesday’s highs and the market digested a fall in long-term interest rates.The technology-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.1 per cent to 2,092.03. The broader S&P 500 index also slightly up at 1,213.90. The the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 0.1 per cent to 10,587.93.While declines in Treasury bond yields tend to make equities relatively more attractive to investors, Ken Tower, chief market strategist at CyberTrader, said it also added to the case that interest rates will rise.“It’s very interesting that the long-term Treasury yields dropped so sharply. It shows there’s a lot of money still sloshing around which is yet to slosh into stocks and it’s another factor that’s likely to keep the Fed on course for rate tightening.”In spite of the market’s ups and downs Jabil Circuit remained the best-performing share on the NYSE. The contract circuit board maker rose 10.5 per cent to $31.42 after it announced higher-than-expected third-quarter earnings and lifted its outlook for the rest of the year. IBM gained 1.1 per cent to $77.23.Eyetech Pharmaceuticals climbed 8 per cent before falling back to $13.44, a 3.5 per cent gain, after the drugmaker boosted its 2005 sales forecast for its vision-loss treatment.Cisco Systems made slight gains on the back of remarks by the internet equipment maker’s CEO, John Chambers, that sentiment on technology spending had improved. The share price was up 0.2 per cent at $19.80.Ford was cause for disappointment again with news late on Tuesday that it had reduced its profit outlook for the year. Its share price fell 4.3 per cent to $10.68.Investors in the car sector were sent running for cover and General Motors dropped 3 per cent to $34.82.Ford’s main suppliers also saw their share prices slip. Visteon dropped 3.6 per cent to $6.42 while Delphi fell 4.2 per cent to $5.06.Morgan Stanley also revealed a drop in quarterly profits of 24 per cent, blaming weak trading and underwriting results. Its shares fell 0.9 per cent to $50.52.Also in the banking sector, shares in Bear Stearns rose 0.1 per cent to $103.03 after the investment bank said it faced a possible Securities and Exchange Commission fine over improper mutual fund trading.News that a ruling by European Union regulators will force Coca-Cola to relinquish some of its space in its vending machines in Europe to competing products nudged its share price down 0.6 per cent to $43.43. Its arch-rival PepsiCo also fell 0.5 per cent to $28.80.
943;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-06-03T14:47:01Z;On Europe: Capitalism sans the sepia tint;;Nestlé shares used to have the cosmopolitan sprawl of a designer clothing chain.The food manufacturer’s shares were listed on the stock exchanges of London, Paris, New York, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Brussels, Zurich, Vienna, and Frankfurt.Now the Swiss company is in the final stages of dismantling its global share network.This week saw the announcement that Nestlé had decided to delist its shares from Euronext Paris and the London Stock Exchange.This continues a process of rationalisation that has seen the group quit exchanges in Japan, Holland, Belgium, Austria and Germany in recent years.The retreat will leave Nestlé with a listing only in Zurich, and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in New York.The maker of Nescafé coffee and KitKat chocolate bars is not alone in rationalising the number of stock exchanges on which it has listings.IBM, for instance, decided earlier this year to withdraw from the Tokyo Stock Exchange because of low trading volumes. Apple and PepsiCo have also made the same decision to quit Japan.Nokia delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003 and from Euronext Paris a year later. In 2002, Ericsson announced that it was quitting exchanges in Paris, Germany and Switzerland.The driving force has been the fact that trading volumes have not been large enough to justify the cost of a listing in every market.Nestlé said volumes in Paris and London had been small over “several years”. Now they are equivalent to less than 1 per cent of the volumes seen on its home exchange of Zurich.For Ericsson, more than 99 per cent of trading in its shares was taking place in Stockholm, in London and on Nasdaq.“It really is a tendency to concentrate on the one stock exchange where you have the highest liquidity,” Nestlé said.The old geographic sprawl at Nestlé was partly a function of the way information travelled. It had its roots in an age in which Europeans were forced to take interminable train journeys across the continent rather than zip in and out of secondary airports on discount airlines, cut off from their wireless internet access for just an hour or two.Nestlé said it used to make perfect sense to have a Paris listing to make it easier for French investors to buy shares.Now, in the internet age, geography has become increasingly irrelevant as investors trade electronically on the exchange they like best.“Technology put paid to the need to have your share listing in many different places,” Nestlé said.In the case of London and Tokyo, the listings were more recent developments designed to raise the profile of the company with international investors.Nestlé said that this marketing strategy had succeeded. “However, these international investors didn’t use London or Tokyo.”Instead, they followed the liquidity, and that meant buying shares in Zurich.Martine Charbonnier, executive director of listings at Euronext, said another reason for delistings was the fact that restrictions on big institutional investors buying foreign shares had eased.This had eroded the need for a local quotation in the local currency, while the introduction of the euro had reduced the need for multinationals to have a share presence in each country.She added that the fee paid to the exchange was not the key factor in the recent wave of delistings, saying that the associated cost of communicating with local investors was much more significant.Even then, organisational tidiness rather than overall cost can be the prime motivation for a purge of foreign listings.For the likes of Euronext and the LSE, the challenge is to replace the disappearing minor listings with fresh quotations.To that end, exchanges around the world have been competing keenly to attract fast-growing companies from emerging markets that want dual listings.The London Stock Exchange has focused on India, China and Russia.For those of a sentimental bent, the disappearance of local listings takes the sepia-tinted glamour out of capitalism.“Zurich and New York” may be easier to recite than Nestlé’s old list of stock exchanges, but it doesn’t sound nearly as cosmopolitan.
944;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-06-02T23:40:15Z;PepsiCo to drop Tropicana ad claims;;PepsiCo has agreed to stop claiming that its Tropicana orange juice reduces the risk of heart disease and strokes, after the US Federal Trade Commission said there was no scientific evidence to support the statement.The settlement is embarrassing for PepsiCo because Tropicana is at the forefront of efforts by the beverage and snack food group to establish a reputation for healthy products.Advertisements for Tropicana's Healthy Heart brand claimed that drinking two to three cups of the product every day would lower systolic blood pressure by 10 points within six to eight weeks.Under the terms of its agreement with the FTC, Tropicana is prohibited from making similar claims about the health benefits of its products unless it is supported by “competent and reliable scientific evidence”.“Orange juice contains many nutrients important to a healthy diet, and advertising can be an important source of information about the health benefits of foods,” said Lydia Parnes, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection. “But it is essential that such advertising be truthful. In this case Tropicana's claims went well beyond its scientific support.”
945;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-05-16T17:22:11Z;Marketing giant Publicis starts to think small;;The argument that small is beautiful in advertising is drawing support from an unlikely quarter Publicis of France, the world's fourth-biggest marketing-services group.Publicis is launching a creative agency in Paris that will try to respond to the recent success of smaller advertising shops in winning global assignments.The rising profile of these smaller agencies is ironic, coming as it does at the same time that giant communications groups such as Publicis have been created to serve multinational clients.Publicis officials said they believed that most big clients still wanted a big agency partner. But there were also enough big companies that preferred an alternative to justify the creation of a smaller agency under the Publicis banner, they said.“It's not a contradiction despite the fact that it looks like one,” said Maurice Lévy, Publicis chairman and chief executive.“It's one of the paradoxes, and we love paradoxes at Publicis, that have allowed us to be at the top of innovation.”The new marketing agency, named Marcel, after Publicis founder Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, will be run by Frédéric Raillard, 34, and Farid Mokart, 38, an award-wining creative team that worked most recently at Omnicom's Goodby Silverstein agency in the US.Their work has included advertisements for companies, including Pepsi and Microsoft-Xbox, as well as a well-known music video, Rock DJ, for Robbie Williams, the UK pop star.Mr Lévy said he decided to use two creative people to headthe agency, rather than business managers, as is often the case, as a sign that “we are creating something totally new”.The rise of the smaller agency with a global perspective comes at a time of crisis in advertising. Agencies fear their traditional weapon, the 30-second television commercial, is losing its influence and they are casting about for replacements.The result is increasing complication. There are more ways of delivering advertising, such as via the internet or mobile phones, and less confidence in the industry that consumers are paying attention.Smaller agencies have won fans by coming up with unlikely solutions, such as the “subservient chicken” website cooked up for Burger King by Miami's Crispin Porter + Bogusky. It has attracted a whopping 418m visitors by giving them a chance to give orders to a man wearing a chicken suit.Mr Raillard and Mr Mokart said they believed that smaller agencies were better equipped to create advertising that works as entertainment and will thereby win the attention of increasingly jaded consumers.“Many of these agencies think like Hollywood,” Mr Mokart said of agencies such as Crispin Porter. “It's high concept.”They said Marcel, which will start with 20 to 30 people, will offer an array of marketing services, from advertising to promotions and website design. The only office for now will be in Paris but the intent will be to serve global clients. It is already working on brands at Nestlé and Allied Domecq.“It's about having all those people in the same place, to have this coherence,” Mr Raillard said. “The agency is where we build a scenario, a strong story, for the brand.”Publicis decided to put Marcel in Paris because the French capital suffers from a shortage of “hot shops”, such as London's Mother, and 180 Amsterdam in the Netherlands.Mr Raillard and Mr Mokart said many French advertising executives preferred to work for well-known names in the agency world, as they did during stints at shops owned by such holding companies as Havas, Publicis and Omnicom.“We want Marcel to shake up the rules in France,” Mr Raillard said.
946;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-05-03T19:03:36Z;Observer - US;;"SEC spoils Debbie's sure thingThe Securities and Exchange Commission had a gentle reminder on Tuesday for eager investors: if a mystery woman named ""Debbie"" leaves a stock tip on your answering machine ""accidentally"", you probably shouldn't act on it.Apparently, two telemarketers have been leaving hundreds of thousands of fraudulent ""wrong number"" stock tip messages. The alleged scam - now the subject of civil charges by the SEC - was simple. A woman calling herself Debbie would leave a voice mail message, making it sound as if she had mis-dialled and was passing a hot tip to a friend.The messages, it turns out, were part of a larger scheme to enable a Texas-based stock promoter to sell about $4.5m in one of the stocks that was touted through a Florida-based broker -dealer.The SEC alleges that Michael O'Grady was paid in cash ""taken from a blue duffel bag during a trip to a Mississippi casino"" to leave the messages and that ""Debbie"" is the wife of one of the promoters O'Grady hired.The scheme ultimately drove up the price of each of the four stocks that Debbie recommended by a combined $179m. Some analysts on Wall Street would no doubt be envious of her track re cord.Appointed at lastRobert Kimmitt, head of global policy at Time Warner, finally got what he wanted: a position in the Bush administration.Since President Bush's re-election in November, Kimmitt, a former ambassador to Germany and managing director of Lehman Brothers, popped up on umpteen lists of candidates for vacant positions.The White House announced on Tuesday that Kimmitt would be named deputy Treasury secretary, filling a vacancy that opened up when Sam Bodman was moved to head the energy department earlier this year.Only Carly Fiorina - the ousted Hewlett Packard chief executive - was considered a possible candidate for as many positions as Kimmitt, whose name was floated for undersecretary of defence for policy, deputy secretary of state, and United States trade representative.Also at the Treasury, assistant secretary Rob Nichols, chief spokesman for Treasury Secretary John Snow, turned in his resignation letter on Tuesday.Dry diveScuba diving has not yet caught on as a hobby in Kabul, the arid mountain capital of a famously landlocked country. Kabul's stir-crazy and heavily protected diplomatic corps generally settles for more mundane pastimes such as drinking, five-a-side football and the odd game of tennis.But Tim Gurney, number two at the British embassy and a qualified scuba instructor with 900 dives under his belt, happily dusted off his wet suit when a colleague asked for diving lessons. The only problem, he said, was the complete absence of water. No matter. Before he knew it, he was teaching 15-hour courses and supervising exams for about 30 expats, including the UK ambassador, at the embassy's parched compound in Kabul.Unfortunately for other aspiring divers, Gurney is leaving Kabul this month. Fortunately for him, he's off to Australia, where there is no shortage of water.Risky pitchmenCoca-Cola should have learned from its rival Pepsi that celebrity endorsements are fraught with risk. Pepsi started the practice in the 1980s, when it recruited Michael Jackson - an association that continues to embarrass the company years after it severed ties.In 1989, Pepsi struck a $5m deal with Madonna only to disown her weeks later because of controversy about a raunchy video. More recently, the company axed an advertisement featuring the rapper Ludacris after complaints about his offensive lyrics.Even David Beckham, the English soccer star once considered a perfect family man, has been tarnished by lurid scandals since accepting Pepsi's dollars.Now Wayne Rooney, one of Beckham's England team-mates, has become the latest member of the cola hall of shame. The 19-year-old Manchester United striker's $1m deal with Coke is reportedly under threat because of his thuggish behaviour on and off the field.Rooney was supposed to represent Coke at a schoolboy soccer event this week but organisers told him to stay away, saying he was a bad example to children.Buoyant BerlusconiSpirits in Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia political party were higher than they've been for weeks after the embattled Italian premier's legal victory on Tuesday at the European Court of Justice.The court threw out a request by Milan prosecutors - some of Berlusconi's least favourite people - to rule against a law passed by his government that partially decriminalised false accounting.Had the ruling gone the other way, it would have been another setback for the premier, who had to resign temporarily last month after Forza Italia crashed to defeat in regional elect ions.But now Berlusconi can concentrate on his latest project - uniting all the disparate forces in his centre-right coalition into one party to see off Romano Prodi's challenge in next year's national polls.Given the recent ructions in Berlusconi's coalition, that would be some achievement. An awful lot will depend on the Northern League, a prickly populist party dedicated to autonomy f or northern Italy.So what does the League think of Berlusconi's project? A cartoon yesterday in La Padania, the League's newspaper, gives some idea. Two men sit round a table discussing the project. ""A single party and a single leader . . . Could be a good idea,"" says the first. ""In Cuba it's worked for more than 50 years,"" says the other.observer@ft.com"
947;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-04-26T16:32:23Z;Safe path in media minefield;;"Faced with a series of noisy protests over the past three weeks, Japanese consumer goods companies could be forgiven for feeling slightly nervous about their Chinese business.Yet while chief executives have been fretting about calls to boycott their products, marketing experts believe there is no need for panic. ""There is no evidence that sales of Japanese consumer goods are being affected in the short term,"" insists Mark Patterson, head of the Asia operation of MindShare, a media buying agency owned by WPP, the marketing services giant.Although he has urged clients to leave their media plans unchanged, Mr Patterson suggests that Japanese companies step up consumer research on the impact of anti-Japanese sentiment.""The problem is that people, particularly in China, will tell you what you want to hear, rather than what they actually buy,"" he says. ""Our experience suggests that most Chinese are not ready to ditch their Japanese mobile phones because of ideology.""Mr Patterson is no stranger to tricky situations. During the 2003 Sars outbreak in China, he advised international clients to shift advertising spending from television and newspapers to online media, because ""people turned to the internet for information and communication"".It is only one example of how MindShare is trying to steer international clients through the minefield that is China's media market.The company, which counts Unilever, Ford, Nike and Pepsi among its clients, boasts a six per cent share of China's highly fragmented media buying market. Last year, the company spent about $700m on behalf of clients, mostly on traditional media such as television, newspapers and magazines.While international media buying groups account for about a quarter of annual advertising spending in China, more than 100,000 small media brokers account for the remainder.This fragmentation has allowed CCTV, the state-owned television network, to become the country's dominant seller of broadcast advertising.To improve its bargaining position, MindShare has emphasised its list of international clients, who tend to spend a disproportionate amount of their marketing budgets on national television campaigns.""CCTV is trying to attract more multinational clients, because they help the network to lift its brand value inside and outside of China,"" says Mr Patterson.Still, for a truly national television campaign, CCTV is only one part of the puzzle owing to its comparatively weak viewing figures in southern China.""There are 2,200 channels and 36 stations, including CCTV, provincial satellite television, provincial terrestrial television and city television,"" says Mr Patterson. ""The biggest challenge for us is to optimise the investment efficiency across these different layers.""Another problem is the lack of reliable media consumption data outside big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. To collect data in the far-flung corners of the country, MindShare has joined forces with an unlikely promoter of market forces - the Communist Youth League of China, which is mandatory for high-school students to join.""Once you go beyond the top 25 cities, you have to use less advanced research tools,"" says Mr Patterson. ""We are paying [Youth League] members to record their media consumption in diaries.""MindShare is also seeking to promote its ability to pool buying power within WPP, which has three competing media buying agencies in China, including the recently acquired Mediacom.""We go into the big annual negotiations with vendors as a group, which allows us to do a deal based on combined market share,"" says Mr Patterson.In China, the group counts Nestlé's Nescafé as well as Kraft's Maxwell House, its arch rival, among its clients. It reflects a global consolidation in the media buying market, which is dominated by four marketing services giants, which include WPP, Omnicom, IPG and Publicis.""One of the big challenges is conflict management,"" admits Mr Patterson.Still, the main challenge is to execute clients' strategies in difficult markets such as China, where salary levels are rising and staff loyalty is dwindling. It does not help that media buying agencies offer ""a lot of scope"" for bribery and corruption.""You have got companies that are spending a lot of money, and you have media vendors who will do all sorts of things to get a bigger share of these budgets,"" says Mr Patterson. ""You cannot stamp out corruption, but you have to develop a reputation for not tolerating it.""According to the company's rules, employees have to declare gifts worth more than Rmb500 ($60). Typical forms of bribery include cards for automated teller machines, houses and cars.MindShare says that it has had to sack corrupt employees ""on a relatively regular basis"". As Mr Patterson puts it: ""By the standards of our business, Hong Kong is extremely clean, while Taiwan and China are not."""

Both oil prices and bond yields have fallen. Oil briefly fell below the $50 mark yesterday for the first time in seven weeks.But these concerns have been replaced by worries over the US economy and consumer demand.After Harley-Davidson disappointed the market by cutting its profit targets for the year on Wednesday, it was the turn of Apple to slide after its revenue growth failed to meet expectations. The Apple setback and an unexpected first-quarter loss from Advanced Micro Devices offset strong results from the likes of Pepsi-Co and Southwest Airlines.World markets were also weighed down by weakness in mining and energy stocks following the fall in metal and crude oil prices this week. By the close of trade, the Dow was down 1.2 per cent, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.4 per cent.European shares were dragged lower by the Wall Street performance despite gains for most of the day on continental exchanges. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dropped 0.2 per cent. Asian shares also fell. The Nikkei 225 index closed 0.6 per cent lower at 11,563.17, its lowest level since February 24.The dollar rose despite recent poor economic news. There were rumours that big investors, including Warren Buffett, were buying back the dollar after taking large positions against it.Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroders, said there was potential for the US economy to hit another “soft patch” in coming months amid high oil prices and increases in interest rates.“Rapidly rising commodity prices can be seen along with house prices as a sign of excess liquidity in global markets. An excess that the Fed will gradually drain from the system in coming months,” he said. “This means that we could see the combination of higher Fed funds alongside lower commodity prices later in the year. Markets would have to balance the implications of higher interest rates against the benefits of lower energy and raw material costs.”

However, performance has improved since the group's overseas operations were restructured into a single international division two years ago.There was also strong growth from PepsiCo's range of healthier products, such as Aquafina water, Gatorade sports drinks and Quaker cereals, as western consumers battle obesity.PepsiCo's diversification into a broad range of drinks and snacks has allowed it to cope better than Coke with the shift by calorie-conscious consumers away from sugary soft drinks.Total net profits were $912m, or 53 cents a share, beating the consensus Wall Street expectation of 50 cents. Revenues were $6.59bn, up more than 7 per cent.Steve Reinemund, chairman and chief executive, said all divisions were performing well, giving him confidence in the outlook for this year.Full-year earnings-per-share guidance was increased by 1 cent to at least $2.60, up 12 per cent from last year.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, said the results showed that PepsiCo's execution remained strong throughout the group.Shares in PepsiCo were up nearly 3 per cent at $55.13 on Thursday afternoon.Quaker Foods, bought by PepsiCo five years ago, increased its revenues by 10 per cent, while sales of non-carbonated beverages grew 8 per cent in volume terms. Carbonated beverage volume, in contrast, fell 1 per cent, with growth in diet brands failing to offset decline in sugary drinks. Total beverage revenues were up 4 per cent and operating profits by 8 per cent.Frito Lay, PepsiCo's snack food business, increased sales and operating profits by 6 per cent, despite a decline in margins because of rising energy and freight costs.Frito is PepsiCo's biggest division, with sales of $2.2bn and operating profit of $539m in the first quarter, outstripping the flagship beverage, which generated $1.8bn of sales and $415m of operating profits.

The Nasdaq Composite put on 0.7 per cent to 2,005.40.Throughout the morning the market had been weighed by news of the US trade deficit in February widened to a bigger-than-expected $61bn, an all-time record. Some market watchers have warned that the rising trend in the US trade gap undermines the sustainability of the economy’s recovery.However, the bulls stepped in after minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Open market Market Committee, the monetary policy body of the US central bank, showed the Federal Reserve was unlikely to tighten monetary policy sooner and harder than anticipated.The minutes said Fed policymakers concluded that “an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time”. In addition, market participants perceived the minutes as an assurance that the Fed would stick to its strategy of quarter-point interest rates increases for the time being.Market participants were expecting to glean insight into the Fed’s intention on interest rates from the minutes. Richard Iley at BNP Paribas said: “We cannot predict how hawkish today’s minutes will be but . . . expect a clear signal that real policy rates remain too low for the FOMC’s comfort against a backdrop of mounting inflation risks.”Stocks in companies that were facing lawsuits for asbestos-related liability saw broad buying after leading senators raised hopes that those liabilities might be capped by legislation.Shares in WR Grace shot up 32.2 per cent to $10.63 while USG put on 24.5 per cent to $43.90.Among the Dow industrials, Boeing declined 1.6 per cent to $58.45 despite reports that Northwest Airlines had ordered 18 of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

He spent most of the 1990s there prosecuting high-profile terrorism cases and, in his recent job, has taken on gang members by charging them with immigration offences.Perhaps the Wall Street gang should not relax just yet.Feminine fizzCould woman power restore the fizz to the troubled soft-drink industry?First Coca-Cola promoted Mary Minnick, head of Asian operations, to a more powerful global role overseeing marketing and innovation. Then, last week, PepsiCo expanded the responsibilities of Dawn Hudson, in charge of the flagship Pepsi brand in North America, to include the group's other carbonated drinks. The changes are part of efforts to reverse declining cola sales as consumers fret about expanding waistlines.Minnick and Hudson are already been talked of as possible future chief executives.

Yet the city is recovering slowly as job creation lags the rest of the US.Trump will be hoping for better times by 2008.

Given that many of the leading players at his wedding - the Archbishop of Canterbury and Tony Blair, prime minister, for example - will probably be in Rome he had little option but to postpone the day.It is payback for the Roman Catholic Church more than 450 years after the English monarchy flung it out of the country.Back in the 16th century an English king intent on divorcing his wife and marrying another woman was prepared to ignore Rome and do things his own way - even to the point of establishing his own church and nabbing many of the assets of the Catholics.There is no such defiance now. The divorced heir to the throne will pay the royal family's last respects to a pontiff who famously had strong views on the sanctity of marriage.Still tastelessFive years ago, at the peak of the dotcom boom, a company called Domain Hypermarket was launched in the UK, auctioning more than 2,000 memorable internet addresses to the highest bidder.One of them was ThePopesFuneral.com, with a reserve price of £15,000 ($28,000). A Catholic Church spokesman condemned the sale as ""callous and exploitative"". But Martin Newman, founder of the start-up, was unrepentant.

952;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-03-16T20:11:23Z;John Gapper: Brands get worst of hard bargain;;"If you go into some stores in Europe owned by Lidl, the hard discounter, you can purchase a unique bottle of water. It is a two-litre container of Vittel mineral water with a slim middle section to make it easier to hold.The bottle is made for Lidl by Nestlé, the Swiss food and drink company that owns the brand. But it is hardly a collectors' item. Each week, 50 train wagons loaded with the bottles leave a Vittel plant in France bound for Lidl's German distribution centre.Lidl's Vittel bottle is evidence of a change in the attitude of food and drink companies to Europe's hard discount chains, led by Germany's Lidl and Aldi. As supermarket sales sag, they are selling brands through outlets they used to regard as hostile territory. ""Three years ago it seemed quite out of the question. Now it looks more like a necessity,"" says Sylvain Massot, a Morgan Stanley analyst.Necessity is the mother of invention, and there is lots of talk about how brands and hard discounters can happily co-exist. Some 5 per cent of Nestlé's grocery sales in Europe last year were through discounters and Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Nestlé's chief executive, says it is ""getting into a very good partnership"".Maybe, but that partnership carries all sorts of risks, from devaluing Nestlé's brands to upsetting supermarkets that charge more for the same items. The meeting of fast-moving consumer goods companies and hard discounters could end like the nursery rhyme encounter between the child and the wild animal: Algy met a bear/The bear met Algy/The bear was bulgy/The bulge was Algy.In the past, the two went separate ways. The hard discount store, pioneered by Aldi, is a small outlet with only 700 to 1,000 lines of stock compared with 100,000 in a big Wal-Mart. The shelves are mostly filled with own-brand goods. Aldi largely eschews brands but Lidl now carries a few to tempt shoppers.Take the Lidl store behind a McDonald's in Bermondsey, south London, which I walked around on Monday. The only still water on sale there was Chambon, its own brand (25p for two litres). Nearby were soft drinks such as its own-brand Freeway cola (39p for two litres) and a pallet stacked with Pepsi-Cola bottles imported from Germany (69p for two litres).A brisk walk up the road is Tesco at Surrey Quays, where two-litre bottles of Pepsi, this time with the standard bright blue label, were on sale for £1.32. In spite of Tesco's value-for-money reputation, that was almost twice the Lidl price. A further short hop on the Underground to Canary Wharf brought me to Waitrose, the supermarket favoured by the British middle classes, where the same Pepsi bottles carried the same price tag.So the Pepsi drinker usually pays much less at Lidl. Why does PepsiCo allow its leading brand to be sold so cheaply? It has little choice. Sluggish economies and high unemployment mean supermarket sales in continental Europe have stagnated. Hard discounters, with their relentless focus on price, now account for 10 per cent of European grocery sales.Nestlé would be less keen to sell Vittel in Lidl if it was doing better elsewhere: its bottled water sales in Europe fell by 8 per cent last year. Similarly, Danone has sold a rising number of yoghurts such as Actimel in France for a decade but it suffered a fall in its market share last year. Both companies have been hit by consumers turning to white-label products instead of the equivalent brands.Food and drink companies make the best of it. Mr Brabeck-Letmathe says that, in spite of the lower retail price, the margin on sales of Vittel through Lidl is as high as it achieves through other outlets. Having such a large order for one item gives it economies of scale in production and distribution. Nestlé can devote a manufacturing line to Lidl's Vittel bottle.Meanwhile, the retail price in a supermarket is not always what it seems. The margins of manufacturers are eroded by temporary price promotions such as two-for-one offers. The cheapest Pepsi on my shopping trip was at Waitrose, not Lidl, because Waitrose was offering two Pepsi bottles for one, which cut the effective price for two litres to 66p.Still, it cannot be good for business for shoppers to see brands routinely being sold more cheaply through hard discounters. Manufacturers concede as much by devising new shapes and sizes for the lines they sell through hard discounters. They do not want shoppers to make a direct comparison with what they are charged for the same brand elsewhere.This trick only goes so far. Two litres of water are two litres of water, no matter which shape of bottle it comes in. Nor can manufacturers rely on shoppers failing to make direct comparisons because they are loyal either to supermarkets or hard discounters. Shopping at Lidl is still regarded as a downmarket activity in Britain but carries no such stigma in other European countries.Manufacturers also risk upsetting retailers. If Tesco allows Pepsi to be sold routinely at half the price just down the road, shoppers may abandon it for hard discounters in the same way that Carrefour has found in France. Local laws have prevented supermarkets cutting brand prices in some markets but the pressure on them to do so is growing.That is why consumer goods companies have kept their distance from hard discounters until now. The depressed state of European retail means they can avoid them no longer. But the partnership of brands and hard discounters will always be an uneasy one. Unless Nestlé is careful, it will suffer the same fate as Algy.john.gapper@ft.com"
953;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Ready to take on gaming giants;;"Vishal Gondal says he was ""surprised by the interest but sensed the fit was right"" between his games company, Indiagames, and Tom Online, the Chinese internet company. The deal was also without precedent: it was the first time an Indian technology company had been bought by a Chinese counterpart.Mr Gondal, a 28-year-old entrepreneur who has been dabbling in start-ups since his school days, is unfazed by the significance of Tom Online's $18m purchase of an 81 per cent share in Indiagames, India's biggest publisher of games for mobile phones. The government has only recently relaxed its resistance to the export of Indian information technology knowhow to China, which it feared it would help rival companies. Indian IT executives - eager for access to the potentially vast market - were relieved by the rapprochement.A child of the dotcom boom, Mr Gondal admits that the politics of Indo-Chinese technology trade were not at the forefront of his mind when Tom Online, part of the business empire of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, snatched Indiagames from under the nose of a slow European bidder in December 2004. ""The Chinese were not even on my radar but I was stunned by their strategic aggression,"" he says.Aggression has been a running theme in Mr Gondal's games - its adversarial titles have included games that pit Pepsi against Coca-Cola, India against Pakistan and citizens against politicians.Now Mr Gondal faces his biggest confrontation. Armed with a rich and well-connected Chinese partner, he is targeting gaming giants such as California's Jamdat and France's Gameloft. ""This is the real battle,"" he says in his bunker - a cramped, dark, office block in Chembur, a Mumbai suburb. Indiagames's Chinese connection brings one immediate benefit: an investment of about $4m for expansion. The company, which earned 86 per cent of its $1.2m sales last year from Europe, will open offices in Los Angeles and London this year.That will place it closer to Hollywood and the European telecoms operators that form part of the mobile-gaming supply chain. Studios license branded characters such as Spiderman for games designed by the likes of Indiagames; Vodafone and other carriers ""host"" the games on their multimedia platforms.Hollywood is a long way from Chembur and might have remained so had Mr Gondal not ""bumped into some suits"" from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the management consultancy, in 2000. The consultants offered to introduce him to new investors, and the result was seed funding of $750,000 from IL&FS Investment Managers and Infinity Ventures, both Mumbai-based private equity funds.""For me,"" says Mr Gondal, a self-taught programmer, ""the arrival of investors was the most valuable MBA education anyone could have."" For the funds, Mr Gondal was a stubborn, creative gaming addict whose ideas would ultimately prevail.Inevitably, they clashed. But, as Mr Gondal recalls, ""I wanted to show them that creative ideas, rather than safe ideas, were also bankable."" The investors were keen to develop Indiagames as a source of ""advertorial"" games, a business model that relied on online games designed around consumer brands. But that model did not survive the dotcom crash. Mr Gondal says the backers subsequently pushed the company towards designing and servicing online games for foreign customers. That made Indiagames an outsourcing arm and, in effect, hostage to overseas clients' unrelenting demand for lower costs.""Servicing gets you stuck at the bottom of the value chain and I didn't want my customer capturing the rewards of my value additions,"" Mr Gondal says.He took his sceptical investors to gaming industry events to persuade them that the greatest opportunity lay in designing proprietary games, not servicing clients' games. ""I wanted my investors to be part of a solution, not the problem,"" he says.Fortunately, he won their allegiance to the new business model at a time when wireless services were growing fast, particularly in the mobile gaming market.Observers believe the market is poised for further expansion as internet usage grows in Asia, where mobile gaming is popular among young people and is creating a lucrative channel for advertising. In India, 12,000 mobile games are sold a day, while the market in China ""will take off in the latter part of this year"", according to Mr Joshua Maa, Tom Online vice-president for wireless operations.""That's why carriers are desperate for a bit of the mobile-gaming action,"" says Mr Ravi Kanodia. As head of Vodafone's mobile games unit, Mr Kanodia signed Indiagames' cricket games for the British market.Mr Gondal regards himself as a risk-taker, coming from a business-oriented family that gave him $20,000 for his first start-up, where he taught programming from his bedroom. Yet he believes timing has been his greatest advantage. ""We may not have the best games but in India we were the first in the market,"" he says.This gave him access to handset manufacturers just as they were recognising the potential for games on mobile handsets.""Chance meetings have been my big breaks,"" he says. At one gaming event in Singapore, Nokia, the Finnish manufacturer of handsets, invited Mr Gondal to design games for a prototype handset.That led to introductions in Hollywood, where he has since signed licensing deals for proprietary games based on brands such as Spiderman, Son of the Mask and Spy Kids. Designing games around these characters falls to Indiagames's 170 graphic artists, sound technicians and 3D modelling engineers.These young technology- literate designers may not have secured top jobs with the elite Indian IT companies but their skills are the basis of Indiagames's creativity.Many have been with Mr Gondal from the start and some own small stakes in Indiagames. He says that as an owner-manager who travels frequently, he has empowered people he trusts ""to do what I would do - take a call on, say, an action sequence in a game and encourage others lower down to do the same. That's crucial as we scale up."" Yet Mr Gondal fears some of the youthful informality of Indiagames could disappear with the arrival of a big corporate partner keen to exploit its new asset and gain a foothold in Europe.He recalls an unhappy period when his seed investors, who sold their equity to Tom Online, appointed an executive from a multi-national to manage Indiagames. It was not a successful relationship, he says.What Mr Gondal lacks - and what he will now gain with the Tom Online deal - is global management experience. He will need it to face two main challenges. First, the industry is consolidating under a wave of acquisitions by Jamdat and Sorrent, a US gaming company. Second, costs are rising as consumers demand more sophisticated games and brand owners extract exorbitant licence fees.Yet he is undeterred. ""Our new owner has the knowledge and discipline of public markets. That's good for us as we face up to new competition and our ultimate goal of a public listing,"" he says."
954;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-02-27T22:49:59Z;Diversified Pepsi emerges from Coke's shadow;;"Nearly 100 years into what is arguably the world's most famous corporate rivalry, Coca-Cola was firmly in the ascendancy over the struggling PepsiCo. It was October 1996, and the cover story of Fortune magazine explained ""How Coke is Kicking Pepsi's Can"". The article quoted Roberto Goizueta, Coke's then chairman, dismissing Pepsi as a spent force. ""As they've become less relevant,"" he said. ""I don't need to look at them very much any more.""Eight years later, everything has changed. PepsiCo has become the investors' favourite, its shares more than doubled since their best of that month, while those of troubled Coke languish below where they stood then. Half the story behind this role reversal is well known. A year after the Fortune article Mr Goizueta died, precipitating a period of management upheaval and sluggish growth from which Coke has yet to recover. Much less attention has been given to how PepsiCo emerged from its rival's shadow to become one of the best performing companies in the food and drink industry.In those eight years, PepsiCo has increased its sales 45 per cent and net profits more than fourfold. While Coke derives all its revenues from beverages, PepsiCo is more diverse. The biggest part of the company is not cola but the Frito-Lay snack food business which merged with Pepsi in 1965. Only two thirds of PepsiCo's beverage volume is carbonated soft drinks, compared with more than 80 per cent of Coke's.Back in 1996, PepsiCo's strategy looked lumbering and unfocused compared with Coke's more simple formula. But that was before Coke and its investors recognised how a declining brand loyalty and increasing health consciousness among consumers would erode sales of its flagship drink. As cola's share of the US beverage market began to shrink in the late 1990s, PepsiCo's diversification started to look the smarter choice. Frito-Lay provided another source of growth, while non-carbonated drinks, such as water and juices, offset the slump in cola sales.PepsiCo's earnings growth was a third greater than Coke's last year at 18 per cent and its sales growth four times higher at 8 per cent. While Coke's beverage volume was flat in North America, Pepsi's grew 3 per cent. ""There is no doubt that Pepsi has the better model,"" says Tom Pirko, president of BevMark, a beverage consultancy. ""If it's raining in one part of the business, the sun is probably shining in another.""PepsiCo is the world's fourth largest food and beverage company, ranking behind Nestlé, Kraft and Unilever. Its sales last year were more than $29bn (£15bn) , compared with Coke's $22bn. Such scale and diversity strengthens the group's muscle in a retail market increasingly dominated by Wal-Mart and its handful of big rivals. PepsiCo has 16 brands that each generate more than $1bn of annual revenues, ranging from Doritos crisps to Aquafina water, and owns six of the 15 top- selling food and drink brands in US supermarkets - more than any other company.""Coke dominated in an era when the supplier was able to dictate terms to lots of small retailers. But now the power is shifting to Wal-Mart and a handful of other big stores that are able to squeeze the suppliers,"" says Mr Pirko. ""Pepsi is in more parts of the supermarket than Coke, so it has more bargaining power.""Coca-Cola's high-rise home in central Atlanta is known in the industry as the Kremlin because of the political intrigue and bureaucratic culture that has pervaded its corridors. By contrast, PepsiCo's headquarters in Purchase, a leafy town outside New York, has the relaxed feel of a university campus. The low-rise building is set in 160 acres of parkland decorated with sculptures and a lake, all open to the public.Sitting at his desk overlooking the park, Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo's chairman and chief executive since 2001, refuses to gloat about the company's success. ""Headlines come and go quickly. If you start believing them, you've got a problem,"" he says. ""I don't think for a minute that we're bullet-proof. We'll have our challenges. But if you continue on the right strategic path we can weather the ups and downs.""Much the biggest challenge facing PepsiCo is consumer concern in North America and western Europe about obesity. A third of adults and one in six children in the US are clinically obese, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The European Commission is threatening to ban advertising of food and drinks to children and the UK is considering a plan to put red warning labels on unhealthy products. In the US, McDonald's is facing a class action law suit from obese consumers - and analysts believe producers such as PepsiCo could also become targets. While PepsiCo was quicker than some rivals to introduce healthy products, the majority remain high in sugar, fat or salt.Mr Reinemund insists the obesity crisis can become an opportunity rather than a threat for companies that embrace consumer demand for healthier food and drink. PepsiCo has introduced its own labelling system in the US to identify healthier products, using criteria set by an independent board of health experts. Already, nearly 40 per cent of sales come from products designated with the the green ""Smart Spot"" given to healthier brands, including sugar-free colas and baked rather than fried crisps. Brock Leach, PepsiCo's chief innovation officer, says most of the company's research and development is focused on healthy products, such as Tropicana-branded fruit bars that will provide nutrition equivalent to that in fresh fruit. Mr Reinemund says at least half of all new products will meet the Smart Spot criteria.PepsiCo's health push is in part designed to head off regulation. But Mr Reinemund says it is already proving good for business. Smart Spot products grew at more than twice the rate of those without the designation last year, providing more than half the company's revenue growth. ""Politicians expect us to be on the defensive when we talk about health and wellness but we're not,"" he says. ""It's a huge opportunity to build new brands and markets.""Mr Reinemund, a lean 55-year-old, has been a keen runner since school and is training for the Paris marathon in April. ""I had retired from marathons but my 22-year-old son challenged me to run it with him,"" he says, clutching a bottle of low-calorie Pepsi One.However, it was Mr Reinemund's predecessor, Roger Enrico, who did most to improve the health profile of PepsiCo's portfolio, by buying two companies known for their nutritional products: Quaker Oats and Tropicana juices. Both brands brought a healthy halo that helps offset the unhealthy image of Pepsi-Cola and Frito-Lay. The deals gave PepsiCo 28 per cent of the juice market, compared with the 17 per cent held by Coke's Minute Maid, and as much as 82 per cent of the sports drink market through Quaker's Gatorade. Coke had been on the brink of buying Quaker but the deal was vetoed by Coke's powerful non-executive directors. ""It was a big mistake by Coke,"" says BevMark's Mr Pirko.Another challenge - and opportunity - for PepsiCo is to strengthen its international presence. Only a third of its revenues came from outside the US and Canada last year, compared with 70 per cent of Coke's. ""Ninety-five per cent of the world's population is outside North America, so we should be generating more than a third of our sales there,"" says Mike White, chief executive of PepsiCo International. ""Our goal is to reach two-thirds of sales and grow at twice the rate of North America.""PepsiCo's international strategy has changed since the 1990s, when the company tried and failed to compete in Coke strongholds such as Germany, Japan and South America. Now the international business is dominated by snacks and concentrated in two main markets - the UK and Mexico, which together generate 40 per cent of overseas sales. Expansion plans are focused on emerging markets, such as China and India, where competitors are not yet entrenched.""Pepsi has learned it has to pick its fights carefully outside America,"" says Michael Bellas, head of Beverage Marketing, a research organisation. The strategy appears to be working: international sales were the fastest growing part of the company last year, with operating profits up by a quarter.One of the threats to PepsiCo's international ambitions is the anti- American sentiment around the globe that many analysts fear is hurting US companies. One in five Europeans plan to avoid buying products closely associated with the US, according to Global Market Insite, a research company. However, Mr White maintains that the Pepsi brand is less ""American"" than others such as Coke and McDonald's and adds: ""Many of our products, such as Walkers crisps in the UK and Kurkure lentil snacks in India, are viewed as local.""Mr White says there will be more overseas acquisitions to accelerate growth. In one small deal last week, its UK arm bought Pete & Johnny, a company credited with introducing crushed-fruit smoothies to Britain. Some analysts argue the most effective way for PepsiCo to bolster its international presence would be to merge with another global consumer products giant, such as Nestlé, Kraft, Unilever or Danone. Speculation has been fuelled by Procter & Gamble's planned acquisition of Gillette, which many believe could spark a rush of consolidation in the sector.Mr Reinemund says he has no plans for a large deal but does not rule one out. ""A lot more has been said about the impact of the P&G-Gillette merger than I think is real,"" he says. ""But there is no doubt that there is a trend towards consolidation. The ability to make productivity gains, particularly in the supply chain, requires . . . financial capabilities and scale.""However far PepsiCo strays from its flagship cola business, the company's rivalry with Coke is sure to remain intense. Pepsi is bracing for renewed conflict as Coke seeks to regain lost ground. Neville Isdell, a Coke veteran, was called out of retirement last May to become the company's fourth chief executive in seven years. He promised to restore the ""iconic status"" to Coke's brand by spending an additional $400m on marketing each year. This is forcing PepsiCo to increase its investment, putting pressure on margins. The company has warned of reduced earnings growth this year because of the competition but Dave Burwick, Pepsi-Cola's chief marketing officer in North America, has a defiant message for Coke. ""We're not only going to defend, we're going to keep on growing our share,"" he says.Both companies are launching a flurry of new products, such as lime-flavoured cola, as they seek to stem the exodus of consumers from carbonated soft drinks while strengthening their presence in the non-carbonated market. Coke's innovations include an energy drink, while PepsiCo is introducing a fizzy version of Tropicana juice. ""We're both playing the same game,"" concedes Mr Burwick. ""It's going to come down to who markets and executes better.""At BevMark, Mr Pirko believes PepsiCo's greater flexibility will continue to be an advantage. ""Pepsi has this young, vibrant, optimistic culture that encourages its people to move fast and take risks,"" he says. ""At Coke, the people always seem to be 10 to 15 years older. It's partly a north-south divide. Coke comes from the conservative south, Pepsi from the easy-going north-east.""But Mr Reinemund says PepsiCo's winning culture owes less to geography and more to 107 years spent chasing Coke. ""Dealing with an enormously powerful competitor has made us stronger,"" he says. ""A challenger in any field has to take risks.""Frito-Lay launches a wider snack attackFor Frito-Lay, the word “snack” is no longer enough. From now on, the future is all about “macro-snacks”.For 40 years the PepsiCo unit has been known largely for its dominant position in potato chips - or “crisps” in the UK, where Frito owns Walkers crisps.But in North America, the company in the past two months has been moving away from the basic salty potato chip produced under its Lay’s brand and tortilla chips under its Doritos and Tostitos brands and into so-called macro-snacks.The term encompasses a range of snack foods that includes biscuits, crackers, candies, nuts and meat snacks such as packaged beef jerky.“It is time now to expand our horizons beyond salty snacks and into the macro-snack segment,” Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and chief executive of Frito-Lay, North America, told analysts last week at the annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Arizona.The move means that Frito is set to compete head-on with some of the largest food companies that already have significant market shares in macro-snacks.They include General Mills, which makes Nature Valley granola bars; Campbell Soup, which makes Pepperidge Farm biscuits and Goldfish snacks; and Kraft Foods with Chips Ahoy! biscuits and Ritz crackers.While Frito-Lay’s move appears bold, the company can in Ms Rosenfeld count on an executive with experience of macro-snacks. She joined Frito last year after being chosen by Steve Reinemun, PepsiCo’s chief executive, to head the shift at Frito after a 20-year career at Kraft.The macro-snacks move is being driven by a need to expand the appeal of Frito’s products beyond men - the traditional target of Lay’s potato chips - and towards families, which are driving rapid growth in the sector.Ms Rosenfeld says: “It is a lot about people’s harried lives, the need for convenience, food on the fly, meals on the run. Our mission is ‘good food for the fun of it’, so we are taking this platform on which our company was built to be a part of the reality that is today’s lifestyle.”Frito has a market share of 65 per cent in the $15bn-a-year salty snacks business in North America. This is up from its share of 45 per cent in 1992, but that only translates into a 15 per cent share of the $90bn-a-year macro-snacks business - an indication, Ms Rosenfeld believes, of the sector’s potential. Frito’s profits grew 7 per cent between 2002 and 2004 to $2.4bn, with revenues up by $1bn over the same period to $9.6bn. But Ms Rosenfeld says it can boost sales and profits by “powering up our mega-brands” - such as the $2.8bn-a-year Lay’s franchise - by extending them into other snacks.A key part of the strategy will be to push into the “health and wellness” sector. This means marketing brands that have sometimes come under attack from health lobbyists as part of a healthy diet. Frito, for example, was the first food company to remove harmful trans fats from its products. And extending this approach, Tostitos, until recently a basic snack for dipping with guacamole and salsa, will be offered in a multi-grain version later this year. Frito will launch “crunchy bars” under its Quaker brand next month.Ms Rosenfeld says: “I believe one of the great untapped opportunities is to take a leadership role in health and wellness.” These kinds of healthier snacks will probably account for about half the company’s product portfolio once the shift into macro-snacks is completed.Another factor in Frito’s favour is its ability to take advantage of two pillars of PepsiCo’s existing sales and marketing infrastructure.One is the decades-old direct store delivery system by which of sales staff, who go into retail stores to ensure aisles are regularly stocked with Pepsi and Frito-Lay products.The other, in place since the 1990s, is to combine Pepsi and Frito-Lay in a single promotional effort, either in a joint display at the end of a supermarket aisle, or as part of larger marketing effort at big events such as the Superbowl.This will allow Frito-Lay to spend much less on promotion as it expands into macro-snacks than if it were relying on its own infrastructure. -Jeremy Grant"
955;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;PepsiCo curbs advertising to children;;PepsiCo, one of the world's largest makers of soft drinks and snack foods, has introduced voluntary restrictions on its advertising to children, in response to rising levels of obesity in the US and western Europe.The company, responsible for brands such as Pepsi-Cola and Doritos chips has also placed limits on the portion sizes of products sold in US schools.The measures are the latest in a series of efforts by food and drink producers to prove they can be trusted to regulate themselves, amid mounting pressure on governments to curb obesity.The European Commission has threatened to outlaw advertising of food and drink to children if the industry does not change its behaviour and the UK government is considering red warning labels on fattening products.PepsiCo executives and officials told the FT that the company was no longer advertising its flagship cola to children under 12 or its Cheetos chips brand to under-eights. The policy has been in place for several months but the company decided against announcing it publicly in contrast to Kraft, another US food group that grabbed headlines in January by saying it would reduce its advertising to children.?Our intent is not to just beat our chests and try to take credit for what we're doing,? said Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Frito-Lay North America, PepsiCo's snacks unit. ?We're just quietly doing it because it's the right thing to do.?She said the company had replaced its fried Cheetos with a lower-fat baked alternative in elementary schools and limited serving sizes for all snacks to 150 calories, rising to 300 calories in middle schools. But critics say food and drinks companies can still target children via indirect marketing, such as endorsements by sports or pop stars and product placement in films and TV.In a series of interviews, PepsiCo executives rejected calls for a blanket ban on advertising to children, arguing it would reduce the industry's ability to help tackle obesity by promoting healthy products and lifestyles.?We don't think banning things is the right way to go because that removes a channel through which we can be part of the solution,? said Steve Reinemund, chairman and chief executive. Indeed, Frito-Lay said it would be increasing its overall advertising to young people through the promotion of its healthier products category, known as ?Smart Spot?.Mike White, chief executive of PepsiCo's international division, said the most effective ways to reduce childhood obesity were to reduce time spent by children in front of TVs and computer screens and provide them with more opportunities for exercise.
956;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:11:08+0000;Cadbury banks on demand for diet drinks;;"Cadbury Schweppes expects concerns about obesity to increase sales of its sugar-free products, even as it continues to defend its famous confectionery brands over criticism from health campaigners.Ken Hanna, finance director, said: ""Diet drinks grew by just under 20 per cent last year. They now account for 23 per cent of our US beverages portfolio, and there is still plenty to go for.""He added new products such as 7 Up Plus, a low-calorie soft drink introduced in the second half of last year, would help propel profits in the company's biggest division during 2005.The group, which on Wednesday announced a 14 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to ?642m, hopes to compensate for a poor performance in European soft drinks in 2004 by launching other new diet products this summer. These include low-calorie versions of its French Biotrina and Oasis beverages. Mr Hanna said 80 per cent of the gum sold by Cadbury Schweppes and the bulk of its Halls soothing sweets were now sugar-free.John Sunderland, chairman, has been a fierce defender of Cadbury's chocolate following a row over a promotional scheme that allowed children to exchange confectionery wrappers for sports equipment.The company, which is celebrating the centenary of its Dairy Milk chocolate brand, has been more embarrassed by bloated overheads than overweight customers, cutting overheads by ?75m in 2004. The company said it was on course to create ?400m in yearly cost savings by the end of 2007, at a one-off cost of ?800m.Pre-tax profits were bolstered by lower exceptionals. Underlying profits before tax, a figure excluding these items and goodwill amortisation, rose just one per cent to ?933m, reflecting dollar weakness. The increase was 8 per cent in constant currencies. Sales rose 5 per cent to ?6.74bn.Todd Stitzer, chief executive, described Wednesday's results as ""no track record, but a very good start"".A final dividend of 8.7p makes 12.5p for the year, payable out of earnings per share of 21.3p (18.2p). ABN Amro, the company broker, forecast underlying pre-tax profits of ?1bn in 2005.Shares in Cadbury, which fell to about 300p in 2003 following the takeover of Adams, the gum maker, have since recovered in response to takeover rumours and strong results and were unchanged at 510p on Wednesday."
957;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-02-14T18:46:43Z;FTSE slips despite bid rumours;;Cadbury Schweppes again provided a focus for market gossip in a becalmed session in London on Monday.While traders largely played down Friday’s speculation linking the company with a takeover from US group Kraft Foods, there was talk that US drinks groups Coca-Cola and PepsiCo were interested in a deal.Cadbury was also linked with a pre-emptive bid for French dairy group Danone. The talk was partly prompted by Danone’s comments on Friday that it would not welcome a hostile bid, leading some traders to speculate whether that meant it had received a tentative approach. If so, they said, Cadbury would be the number one company in the frame.However, other dealers said the theory was highly speculative and Cadbury shares finished down 0.9 per cent at 513.97p.Graham Jones, an analyst at Panmure, pointed out that Cadbury Schweppes shares, which have risen nearly 10 per cent in the last two weeks, had now moved into expensive territory and advised clients to sell into any strength.Allied Domecq also the subject of bid speculation. The drinks group rose 2.2 per cent to 533p as rumours returned that France’s Pernod, in conjunction with US-based Fortune Brands, was interested buying the owner of the Malibu, Perrier Jouet and Beefeater Gin brands.But Sandy Soames, an analyst at Cazenove, rated the chances of a bid for Allied emerging were less than 10 per cent as none of the supposed bidders had the financial firepower or committment for a bid he estimated would cost $17bn.He also pointed out that Fortune had already sold 10 per cent of its Jim Beam Brands, suggesting that Fortune is more of a seller than a consolidator in the global spirits business. Nevertheless, traders said general market activity was on the soft side.The FTSE 100 slipped 0.1 per cent to finish at 5,041.8 while the FTSE 250 index was up 0.1 per cent at 7,370.1. Volume was a relatively meagre 2.3bn shares.“With low volatility and no news to spark a sense of direction, not surprisingly, it was a quiet day,” said Stuart Fowler, head of UK equities at Axa Investment Managers.Vodafone stalled at 140p as its house broker Goldman Sachs rejected speculation that Vodafone Japan was for sale or likely to be.“Investors should view the transfer of UK chief executive Bill Morrow to Vodafone Japan as President as a sign of Vodafone’s commitment to the country, not the reverse,” it said.However, Goldman Sachs said the “mergers acquisitions outlook in the US is less clear and may be a source of continued volatility for the stock in the short-term”.BT Group rose 1.2 per cent to 211.75p after Goldman Sachs upgraded its recommendation to “inline” from “underperform”. Goldman said the scope for releveraging balance sheet was likely to be clearer after BT’s IFRS presentation. This is expected to provide details of any adjustments to net debt from the restatement of a £2.4bn property sale and lease back.Mobile phone group MM02 added 1.2 per cent to 123.5p as Deutsche Bank talked up the stock. The broker raised its target price to 150p from 130p, arguing the group’s UK operations were undervalued. It also felt that competitor T-Mobile’s domestic difficulties should provide a further boost to mm02’s business in Germany.Compass, the catering group, was up 1.2 per cent at 263p after it told its annual general meeting full-year like-for-like sales would grow by at least 6 per cent. However investors were mildly concerned there was no mention of margin targets. See more on CompassPunch Taverns was down 0.2 per cent at 710p after the pub operator’s chief executive Giles Thorley made more than £10m from the sale of 2m shares. Having exercised options to buy the shares at 198p, he then sold them at 702p per share.BAA was up 0.6 per cent at 636p after a property joint venture with Morley Fund Management to develop its airports was well received.Frank Skodzik, an analyst at West LB, said the transaction gave BAA the opportunity to realise proceeds from its property assets at a time when the commercial property market is buoyant.However, while he said the news would help underpin the stock, he cautioned that BAA’s share price had now reached his target.The Wireless Group rose 2.8 per cent to 92p after Kelvin MacKenzie, chief executive of the radio company announced plans to take the company private in a £100m deal. The approach was pitched at 90 pence a share in cash and was backed by U.S. private equity firm Veronis Suhler Stevenson.East Surrey Holdings added 3.2 per cent to 433p on talk the water and gas utility was being eyed for a possible takeover.PD Ports, often rumoured to be a bid target, was unchanged at 106p after a third quarter trading statement contained few unpleasant surprises. Alastair Gunn, an analyst at Arbuthnot Securities, upped his price target on the stock to 121p on the expectations that the final results would be some 15 per cent ahead of current consensus market forecasts.Consolidation within the small-cap broking sector continued as Charles Stanley, unchanged at 332.5p, announced it had agreed to acquire Rowan Dartington, which provides a range of private client and institutional stockbroking services.Among the smaller companies, White Nile continued to defy gravity yesterday, rising a further 26.1 per cent to 125.5p.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Danone shares rose more than 1 per cent in Paris on Friday with analysts welcoming the bullish forecast and last year's performance.Sales last year rose 7.8 per cent to €13.7bn ($17.6bn), operating margin improved to 12.4 per cent from 12.2 per cent, and net financial debt fell from €2.7bn to €1.4bn.Net profits rose from €839bn to €917bn before an expected write-down of €600m on the company's troubled US and European home and office water distribution businesses. Mr Riboud conceded the company's incursion in the US water distribution business had been “unsuccessful”.Suntory, Danone's Japanese partner in the US water delivery business, is expected to exercise its rights to sell its stake in the venture to Danone between 2006 and 2008. Mr Riboud suggested Danone could eventually decide to sell the business to a third party.Coca-Cola is expected to continue distributing Danone's Evian bottled water brand in the US. Danone is continuing to focus on what Mr Riboud called the company's “three growth businesses”: its “blockbuster” dairy products; its expanding Asian presence; and “new frontier” markets such as Mexico, Indonesia, China and Russia.He also considered the US a growth market for Danone's dairy products. “The potential is big when you consider that average annual dairy product consumption in the US is only 5 kilos per capita compared to 20 kilos in France,” he said."
960;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2005-01-12T20:15:59Z;Kraft to limit snack food ads to children;;Kraft Foods has promised to stop marketing junk food directly at children as the US government announced new health guidelines aimed at lowering consumption of salt and sugar.The voluntary response by one of the world's largest food producers will phase out advertising of products such as Oreo biscuits and sugary Kool-Aid drinks aimed at children under 12.Instead Kraft plans to introduce new products and labelling for reduced sugar cereals and lower-fat cheeses. This will start in the US from April and extend internationally, but the biggest impact on advertising will be in North America.Similar labelling initiatives have been announced by Pepsi, while McDonalds and Coca-Cola have launched salad ranges and low-sugar drinks, but Kraft's policy on marketing is one of the most ambitious yet.It should address a major weakness in government attempts to reduce obesity in the US, which are dwarfed by the advertising and lobbying budgets of food producers.Tommy Thompson, US health secretary, said: “The more we talk about it, the more the food industry is standing up and taking action. They are very attuned to the changes going on across America.”Michael Peters, chairman of Identica, a brand identity consultancy in London, said that based on recent conversations he has had in the US, he would expect other food and drink makers to follow Kraft's lead.“A lot of people are saying that if they don't adapt to this situation, it is likely their share price will be smashed,” he said. “This issue has been waiting to explode for a long time. A lot of manufacturers have been slow in recognising the need to do it.”But the government stopped short of imposing similar controls on other companies, saying it would imfringe constitutional protections for freedom of speech.The American Association of Advertising Agencies, a trade group, also said it hoped that the government would allow companies to respond voluntarily - as Kraft did - to consumer demands for limits on advertising. The group said such decisions “should never be taken as a matter of government regulation.”Instead, the US government focused on Wednesday on updating dietary recommendations to further emphasise the need to reduce calorie intake, particularly of sugars and other refined carbohydrates.The summary recommendations, which will be used to design a replacement for the famous “food pyramid” advisory, contain less radical changes than some expected.Ann Veneman, agriculture secretary, said: “The main recommendations are not significantly different. These have been pretty consistent messages.”Mr Thompson added: “It's really very simple. There is no magic pill. Eat more fruit and vegetables, watch your calories and exercise.”Stuart Trager, medical director for Atkins Nutritionals, praised the emphasis on reducing carbohyrdates but called on the government to recognise there was no “one-size-fits-all” approach to diet.Kraft said it would stop advertising some of its snack foods, including its Oreo biscuit brand, in media seen by children aged 6-11 as part of the fight against rising obesity levels. Oreo cookies will be banned from television, radio and print adverts aimed at children in the US. All adverts of such products would be dropped from media targeted at children world-wide by 2006.
961;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2004-11-30T07:20:16Z;Advertisers get in on the game;;"With reports of first-day sales of Halo 2, the latest version of Microsoft’s best-selling video game, exceeding $125m in North America, it is hardly surprising that an increasing number of companies are waking up to using games as an advertising medium.Last year, sales of video games topped $20bn worldwide, and the market for branding and advertising through games is growing: in 2004 it was worth an estimated £5m in the UK, according to branded entertainment specialists Cocojambo. This UK market is forecast to be worth £9m in 2005; internationally, it is valued at more than $1bn a year, according to Forrester, the research company.Among the brands which have already appeared in games are Nike, Pepsi, Toyota, Tesco Personal Finance, GSK, MTV and Thomas Cook. The branding can take the form of product placement within games, or content such as images of posters or, in football games, pitch advertising.Malcolm Russell, business director at WPP media buying agency Mindshare, says games publishers and advertisers are starting to embrace games as a medium.Mindshare’s own research confirms that consumers born in the 1990s are watching 25 per cent less TV than those born in the 1960s and 1970s. “This group is spending more time playing games which really involve them and this is providing some exciting opportunities for advertisers compared to TV which is relatively passive,” says Russell.But the games market is very fragmented, and advertisers have found it difficult to discover which titles are being developed, when they are due for release and who they are targeted at. In response, Cocojambo will launch the first quarterly online and print guide next week where global games publishers can advertise details of their games, including the territories they will be released in and the target audience, to help brands match up with particular releases.With marketers looking at the mix of budget allocations for 2005, Michael Wood, director of Cocojambo, says he has been answering queries from advertisers interested in getting involved in games.”For media buyers and advertisers over 35, games have been a novelty. But for teenagers and consumers in their early 20s, Halo 2 is part of the media landscape as much as Wife Swap,” says Wood.Matt Davies, business development manager of Codemasters games publisher, says an industry-wide guide is needed to assist advertisers. “In-game advertising is growing in importance as brands seek to target consumers in more innovative ways. We have to be focused on helping advertisers to have a better understanding of the games market,” he says.The company has persuaded brands such as Certina Watches, Sharp and Ford to buy brand content in Colin McRae Rally.steve.hemsley@talk21.comwww.cocojambo.com"
962;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2004-11-11T21:30:29Z;Wall Street higher amid oil price decline;;"Wall Street stocks moved higher on Thursday after crude futures staged a freefall and investors found solace in the Federal Reserve's view of the economy the previous day.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,469.84 while the broader S&P 500 index put on 0.9 per cent to 1,173.48. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.3 per cent to 2,061.27.Trading was heavier than expected after bond markets were closed owing to a federal holiday. Even with one less source of guidance, stock investors traded about 1.4bn shares at the New York stocks Exchange, about the daily average volume for the year.Crude oil futures fell 2.9 per cent and erased most of the gains in the prior session as rising crude inventories offset concerns about possible shortages of heating oil this winter. The perception that Yassir Arafat's death overnight would help prospects for peace in the Middle East further undermined crude prices as supply worries eased.This offered support to stocks following their initially muted reaction to the widely expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, which reiterated its upbeat view of the world's largest economy.The indices have been bound in a narrow range in the past few sessions, with intraday patterns hinting at a tense tug-of-war between bulls and bears. Some traders characterised the action as bullish consolidation.The bulls will be keen to tack on consistent gains following warnings from some market watchers that the current rally faces technical resistance and that several factors threaten to stop it in its tracks in a similar way to other failed rallies earlier this year.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, attributed much of yesterday morning's gains to the decline in oil prices and the upcoming dividend from Microsoft, set to inject about $30bn in the market.""I think we're coming to the end of it [the current rally] and next year's fundamentals continue to look pretty cloudy,"" Mr Boockvar said.On the corporate front, shares of PeopleSoft eased 1.6 per cent to $22.43 after the company rejected a final takeover bid from Oracle, whose shares edged off 1.8 per cent to $13.14.In other merger-and-acquisition news, Blockbuster launched a $70m offer for Hollywood Entertainment, a rival video rental company. Blockbuster shares were 11.1 per cent higher at $8.20 while Hollywood Entertainment added 11.5 per cent to $10.93.Another deal came in the retail sector, where Jones Apparel Group said it would buy Barney's New York for about $294m. Jones shares lost 3 per cent to $34.91.In the same sector Target edged back 0.2 per cent to $50.78 after the discount retailer reported a 78 per cent rise in quarterly earnings but missed analyst estimates.Among blue-chips, Coca-Cola lost 0.5 per cent to $40.96 after it lowered its long-term earnings and volume forecasts.Shares in rival PepsiCo were up 0.4 per cent at $51.54.Also lower were shares in Starbucks, the coffee house chain, whose 47 per cent rise in quarterly earnings failed to impress the markets. Shares inched up 0.3 per cent to $55.44.Meanwhile, Whole Foods Market saw shares add 9.8 per cent to $94.57 after it reported a 27 per cent increase in quarterly earnings.Among technology stocks, Dell Computer inched up 1.1 per cent to $37.25 ahead of its quarterly results after the close. Agilent Technologies was also due to report results after the bell, and shares gained 2.5 per cent to $25.68.Semiconductor shares saw buying as RF Micro Devices rose 7.6 per cent to $6.69 following an upgrade to ""neutral"" from ""underperform"" by analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices rose 7.5 per cent to $18.59 after Merrill Lynch analysts raised their rating for the stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral"".National Semiconductor shares, up 2.5 per cent to $16.26, defied a downgrade from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" by analysts at UBS.Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, gained 1.4 per cent to $23.17 after it named a new chief executive officer replacing Craig Barrett.A less positive note came from Nortel Networks, whose shares fell 5.9 per cent to $3.37 after the telecommunications equipment group delayed the filing of its quarterly results."
963;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:23:06+0000;Martin Glenn, President of Pepsico, UK and Ireland;;38 This year Glenn was the face of the food industry in the debate over the impact of advertising on child and adult obesity.Over the last year, ministers, regulators and pressure groups kept up demands for a ban on TV advertising aimed at children, particularly campaigns for soft drinks, fast food and snack brands, and those involving celebrities and animation.As the head of the UK’s biggest food and drink brand (one which has used Gary Lineker to great effect in its Walkers ads), Glenn could be said merely to have been defending his interests. But he was almost the only leading UK marketer in the sector prepared to argue the food industry’s case.Glenn says there was a sense of indignation behind his vocal attitude, but at the same time, he wanted to fill what he felt was a large void. “Although the industry associations were doing a great job, the industry itself was being far too reticent about making a good case in plain English. Everyone was being corporate about it.”In the summer, Ofcom judged an outright ban on food ads targeted at children as ineffective in tackling obesity and for now, the industry seems to have been given breathing space. With the industry focused on the government’s white paper on public health (to be published this month), some food companies have tried to show that they are taking the initiative in tackling the obesity issue, cutting back on snack portions and refraining from advertising on children’s TV. Walkers is even offering free pedometers to consumers.Glenn says that it was important showing a face behind the products. “People need to know that there are reasonable human beings behind a brand.”What’s the idea? Don’t blame the ads, blame the politicians.Where’s the cash? £552m a year is spent on TV ads for food, soft drinks and restaurant chains. You’ll notice if it goes.
964;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2004-10-28T17:38:12Z;DreamWorks in strong debut;;DreamWorks Animation's life as a public company got off to a rousing start on Thursday as shares in the Hollywood studio that created Shrek traded more than 30 per cent higher than their offer price.At midday in New York, DreamWorks shares were trading at $37.95, way above the $28 per share at which the initial public offering was priced by its underwriters. The surge meant DreamWorks' market value of nearly $4bn approaches that of Pixar, its most direct competitor, whose market capitalisation is about $4.5bn.Roger Enrico, chairman of DreamWorks and a former chief executive of PepsiCo, said he had been ?gratified with the reception? from investors. In filings with US regulators, the company had indicated a suggested price range for the shares between $23 and $25.The DreamWorks listing marks the first initial public offering of a Hollywood film studio since 1998, when Fox Entertainment, a unit of News Corporation, first sold shares.It also represents the coming of age of DreamWorks, founded a decade ago by a trio of entertainment luminaries Steven Spielberg, film director, David Geffen, music industry executive, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, former chief of Walt Disney Studios, with the financial backing of Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft.Mr Katzenberg on Thursday said the listing, which involves the sale of 29m shares to raise $812m, would be used to retire debt, fund the production of new films, and reward the original investors. ?Particularly Paul Allen,? Mr Katzenberg told the Financial Times. ?He took a credible gamble and he is more than entitled to be rewarded.?Mr Katzenberg said DreamWorks planned to produce as many as two animated movies per year, ?at the highest levels of creativity and storytelling?.DreamWorks' IPO comes on the heels of the success enjoyed by Shrek and Shrek 2, which this year achieved the highest US box office performance of any animated film. Shark Tale, DreamWorks' latest production, has also been performed well at the box office.Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are managing the IPO.
965;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2004-10-03T18:14:34Z;An IT giant gets back up on its feet;;This is the first article in a series on companies reforming themselvesWe call these our drawing rooms,? says Mike Jordan, the taciturn chief executive of Electronic Data Systems, allowing himself a rare half-smile.The conference rooms in question have been given a coat of white paint. On the wipe-down walls, using felt-tipped pens, Mr Jordan and his team are charting the turnround of the $20bn-a-year IT services giant.They have been back to the drawing board in every sense: costs cut, subsidiaries sold, debt repaid, dividends slashed and problem contracts either restructured or shredded. The senior management team inherited from Dick Brown, CEO until March 2003, has been erased.But investors hoping for a speedy transformation have been disappointed. EDS stock, which traded at about $14 just before Mr Jordan's arrival, stands at $20 today. Yet questions remain about the company's growth prospects and competitiveness in the increasingly crowded market for IT services. Meanwhile, its largest client General Motors, its former parent, which accounts for 10 per cent of revenues will put out to tender many of its contracts next year.?Jordan has been at the helm for 18 months now and things are going from bad to worse,? says Bob Djurdjevic at Annex Research, an IT research company.Mr Jordan, a slightly rumpled 68-year-old, gives his own assessment: ?The basic business is now financially sound. We are ready to start the heavy lifting.?From the 1960s to the mid-1980s, EDS first invented and then dominated the IT services market. Ross Perot, the company's billionaire founder and sometime US presidential candidate, saw that good profits could be made from handling data processing and other technology-related chores for large companies.In 1984, the Texas-based company was acquired by GM. But the marriage was never entirely comfortable. In 1996, EDS was spun off, and GM endowed it with the lucrative 10-year contracts up for grabs next year.Yet the newly independent company failed to make the most of its freedom. When the EDS board was looking for a live wire to energise their company, Dick Brown seemed ideal: a smooth-talking American with big company experience who was then engaged in the high-profile (though ultimately failed) remaking of Cable & Wireless, the telecoms group.For a while, it seemed an inspired choice. Revenues increased from $17bn in 1998, the year before Mr Brown's arrival, to $21.5bn in 2002. Landmark contract wins included a multi-billion dollar deal to build and operate a giant communications network for the US Navy the largest deal of its kind.Below the surface, however, all was not well. To meet the aggressive growth targets set by their new boss, EDS managers bid on contracts that were either unprofitable or impossible to manage. The Navy contract turned out to be a monster of a problem that will this year drain $450m from EDS's coffers. ?We did not have a clue what was going on with that contract last year,? concedes Mr Jordan.As Brown-era managers concentrated on top line growth, operating costs crept higher. A shock profits warning in September 2002 signalled the full extent of the company's problems. Within six months Mr Brown was gone albeit with a $35m payoff.Michael H. Jordan was hardly an obvious choice to lead the rescue. The ex-McKinsey, ex-Pepsi, ex-Westinghouse, ex-CBS executive had retired in 1998. Also, he had never worked in IT. His only link with EDS was Roger Enrico, a board member with whom he worked at PepsiCo in the 1980s.But if Mr Jordan was not steeped in bits and bytes, he soon surrounded himself with people who were. New faces in the executive suite include Charlie Feld, a veteran IT troubleshooter whose 60-person consulting company was acquired in January for $89m, and Dave Clementz, a former chief information officer at Chevron Texaco who was lured out of semi-retirement.In an era of fortysomething chief executives, Messrs Jordan, Feld and Clementz make a wizened triumvirate. Other new faces are somewhat fresher: Steve Schuckenbrock, a former chief information officer at PepsiCo who arrived with the acquisition of Feld Group, and Bob Swan, chief financial officer recruited from TRW, the engineering business.With his team in place and the balance sheet repaired thanks in part to the $2.1bn raised from the sale of software business UGS-PLM Solutions Mr Jordan is now turning to strategy. How can EDS win new business and make money in a world of shrinking margins and brutal competition?The first part of his answer involves further, deeper cost-cutting. Up to 20,000 jobs will go out of a total workforce of 120,000 as part of a plan to reduce the cost base by $3bn.Mr Feld has been charged with restoring some of the old Perot-era discipline to the way EDS conducts its business. ?We've got to take the variation out of how we do things,? he says. ?If we can just find a repeatable way to do desktop rollouts [for clients], this place will rain money.?The vast IT infrastructure used by EDS to support its clients housed in 16 data centres around the world will also be rationalised. Using industry-standard components, purchased from a few favoured suppliers, should result in cheaper, more flexible systems.Says Mr Feld: ?The next decade is going to be about how companies build their way out of the last 40 years of IT complexity to a simpler, cheaper platform.?Meanwhile, Mr Schuckenbrock has been charged with revamping the sales strategy. His aim is to position EDS as not only a services provider but also a partner capable of helping to transform corporate IT. ?We had become a great transaction executor but we were not telling clients ?this is what you should do'. We have got to become more consultative.? For this reason, AT Kearney, the group's management consulting arm, is being drawn into client relationships on the services side.The pitch captures the technology zeitgeist. Executives across all industries know they need to untangle the ugly knot of custom-built software and hardware that lurks in their data centres. Also, Messrs Feld, Schuckenbrock and Clementz have the gravitas to get EDS heard.The snag is that the story they are telling is hardly unique. IBM, which overtook EDS in the 1990s to become the largest IT services company, is making a similar pitch. Relative newcomers to IT services such as Hewlett-Packard are also preaching the gospel of simpler, industry-standard systems. Moreover, EDS is weak in the fast-growing market for ?business process outsourcing? (BPO) where administrative functions such as bookkeeping and human resources administration are provided as a service.Mr Jordan is astute enough to recognise the shortcoming. He promises a series of alliances with specialist BPO providers such as large accounting firms and human resources consultants in order to strengthen his position.On Wall Street there are signs that the tide of opinion is turning in his favour. In August, analysts at Goldman Sachs and Sanford C Bernstein upgraded their outlook for EDS.Yet doubts remain. Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency, in July cut EDS's credit rating to eblow investment grade. John Moore, a Moody's analyst, points to a number big risks, notably continued uncertainty about the Navy contract and the looming question of whether GM will remain a substantial client beyond 2006.?Given the magnitude of their GM business, you can't dismiss it as a risk that needs to be taken seriously,? says Mr Moore.Back in his drawing room, Mr Jordan responds that Moody's credit rating ?bears no relation to the financial strength of the company?. He also believes that EDS will retain a large portion of its GM contracts and that the Navy contract has finally been tamed.He does not quibble, however, with the notion that the new-look EDS still has to prove that it can win new business and make money in the process. This is the big challenge for 2005.?I'd say,? says Mr Jordan, ?that we are 55 per cent done with this turnaround.?

Landmark contract wins included a multi-billion dollar deal to build and operate a giant communications network for the US Navy - the largest deal of its kind.Below the surface, however, all was not well. To meet the aggressive growth targets set by their new boss, EDS managers bid on contracts that were either unprofitable or impossible to manage. The Navy contract turned out to be a monster of a problem that will this year drain $450m from EDS's coffers. “We did not have a clue what was going on with that contract last year,” concedes Mr Jordan.As Brown-era managers concentrated on top line growth, operating costs crept higher. A shock profits warning in September 2002 signalled the full extent of the company's problems. Within six months Mr Brown was gone - albeit with a $35m payoff.Michael H. Jordan was hardly an obvious choice to lead the rescue. The ex-McKinsey, ex-Pepsi, ex-Westinghouse, ex-CBS executive had retired in 1998. Also, he had never worked in IT. His only link with EDS was Roger Enrico, a board member with whom he worked at PepsiCo in the 1980s.But if Mr Jordan was not steeped in bits and bytes, he soon surrounded himself with people who were. New faces in the executive suite include Charlie Feld, a veteran IT troubleshooter whose 60-person consulting company was acquired in January for $89m, and Dave Clementz, a former chief information officer at Chevron Texaco who was lured out of semi-retirement.In an era of fortysomething chief executives, Messrs Jordan, Feld and Clementz make a wizened triumvirate. Other new faces are somewhat fresher: Steve Schuckenbrock, a former chief information officer at PepsiCo who came with the acquisition of Feld Group, and Bob Swan, chief financial officer recruited from TRW, the engineering business.With his team in place and the balance sheet repaired - thanks in part to the $2.1bn raised from the sale of software business UGS-PLM Solutions - Mr Jordan is now turning to strategy. How can EDS win new business and make money in a world of shrinking margins and brutal competition?The first part of his answer involves further, deeper cost-cutting. Up to 20,000 jobs will go - out of a total workforce of 120,000 - as part of a plan to reduce the cost base by $3bn.Meanwhile, Mr Feld has been charged with rethinking how EDS conducts its business. “We've got to take the variation out of how we do things,” he says. “If we can just find a repeatable way to do desktop rollouts [for clients], this place will rain money.”The vast IT infrastructure used by EDS to support its clients - housed in 16 data centres around the world - will also be rationalised. Using industry-standard components, purchased from a few favoured suppliers, should result in cheaper, more flexible systems.Says Mr Feld: “The next decade is going to be about how companies build their way out of the last 40 years of IT complexity to a simpler, cheaper platform.”Meanwhile, Mr Schuckenbrock has been charged with revamping the sales strategy. His aim is to position EDS as not only a services provider but also a partner capable of helping to transform corporate IT. “We had become a great transaction executor - but we were not telling clients ‘this is what you should do'. We have got to become more consultative.” For this reason, AT Kearney, the group's management consulting arm, is being drawn into client relationships on the IT services side.The pitch captures the technology zeitgeist. Executives across all industries know they need to untangle the ugly knot of custom-built software and hardware that lurks in their data centres. Also, Messrs Feld, Schuckenbrock and Clementz have the gravitas to get EDS heard.The snag is that the story they are telling is hardly unique. IBM, which overtook EDS in the 1990s to become the largest IT services company, is making a similar pitch. Relative newcomers to IT services such as Hewlett-Packard are also preaching the gospel of simpler, industry-standard systems. Moreover, EDS is weak in the fast-growing market for “business process outsourcing” (BPO) - where administrative functions such as bookkeeping and human resources administration are provided as a service.Mr Jordan is astute enough to recognise the shortcoming. He promises a series of alliances with specialist BPO providers - such as large accounting firms and human resources consultants - in order to strengthen his position.On Wall Street there are signs that the tide of opinion is turning in his favour. In August, analysts at Goldman Sachs and Sanford C Bernstein upgraded their outlook for EDS. Yet doubts remain. Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency, in July cut EDS's credit rating to below investment grade. John Moore, a Moody's analyst, points to a number big risks, notably uncertainty about the Navy contract and the looming question of whether GM will remain a substantial client beyond 2006.“Given the magnitude of their GM business, you can't dismiss it as a risk that needs to be taken seriously,” says Mr Moore.Back in his drawing room, Mr Jordan responds that Moody's credit rating “bears no relation to the financial strength of the company”. He also believes that EDS will retain a large portion of its GM contracts and that the Navy contract has finally been tamed.He does not quibble, however, with the notion that the new-look EDS still has to prove that it can win new business - and make money in the process. This is the big challenge for 2005.“I'd say,” says Mr Jordan, “that we are 55 per cent done with this turnaround.”A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO EDS'S RECOVERYMike Jordan, EDS's chief executive, does not have a background in information technology. In this sense, he is not unlike Leo Gerstner, the famously cantankerous former McKinsey consultant who in the early 1990s arrived from RJR Nabisco to restore International Business Machines - in part by driving Big Blue into IT services at the expense of EDS.Mr Jordan's business strategy can be boiled down to a handful of key points:● Appoint new management team: notably Charlie Feld, David Clementz, Steve Schuckenbrock and Bob Swan● Repair the balance sheet: EDS sold UGS-PLM Solutions, a software business, for $2.1bn● Undertake deep cost-cutting: up to 20,000 jobs will go out of a workforce of 120,000 to fulfil a promise to shed about $3bn - or 20 per cent - of the cost base● Restore management discipline after years of bloated operating costs● Standardise services and offer clients consultative advice

The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent to 1,896.84.Merck shares tumbled 26.8 per cent to $33, weighing heavily on the Dow in opening exchanges and confounding futures markets' earlier expectations of a higher opening.The drugmaker said it was withdrawing its Vioxx arthritis drug from markets worldwide after a study linked it with raised risks of heart attack and stroke. Sales of Vioxx reached $2.6bn last year.Merck topped the list of the decliners at the New York Stock Exchange. Pfizer, the largest drugmaker in the world and also a Dow component, saw shares rise 1.4 per cent to $30.60.The pharmaceuticals group of the S&P 500 was 3.5 per cent lower.Economic news was mixed and appeared to have limited impact on trading, offering little clarity to a market still divided on the state of the economy.Weekly jobless benefit applications rose but most economists dismissed the data with doubts about its reliability due to the hurricanes in the south-eastern US. In addition, the Commerce Department said personal incomes grew as much as economists had expected in August, but Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, focused on the flat growth of consumer spending. He warned that without a decline in oil prices, income growth would be sluggish this year and concluded: ""We're still nervous about fourth-quarter growth"".On a similar note, Mr Shepherdson said upbeat news that manufacturing activity in the midwestern US expanded was welcome, but said: ""Consumers are the problem, not industry - yet.""Traders also focused on the first debate between President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry, his challenger in the race for the White House. It is seen as vital in deciding the outcome of what has been a tight race. While Wall Street tends to be politically agnostic, history shows it prefers continuity, and market watchers have said a re-election of the incumbent could help stocks.Another factor influencing the market is so-called window-dressing by fund managers on the last day in the quarter. Some portfolio managers sell underperforming stocks in a bid to improve their fund's standings.For the quarter, the Dow is off 3.4 per cent, the S&P 500 has fallen 2.3 per cent and the Nasdaq has lost 7.4 per cent.Marc Pado, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: ""I don't view today's action as negative as it's a pretty flat day. Outside of Merck, it's well contained.""Elsewhere in the broader market, PepsiCo rose 1.1 per cent to $48.71 after the soft drinks and snacks company reported a rise in quarterly profits.Among financials, Fannie Mae shares lost 4.3 per cent to $63.40 after reports the Justice Department opened an investigation into possible accoumnting fraud at the government-sponsored housing lender. Freddie Mac, Fannie's sister government-sponsored agency, saw shares decline 2.6 per cent to $65.24.American International Group shares eased 0.7 per cent to $67.99 after the same US government agency opened a criminal probe into the insurer's possible role in helping a banking client move bad loans off its books.Among retail stocks, Family Dollar shares lost 1.8 per cent to $27.10 after the discount retailer reported in-line quarterly earnings but said profits growth slowed in the fourth quarter downgraded its estimates for next year.Also in retail, Talbots shares gave up 9.2 per cent to $24.79 a day after the company downgraded its earnings outlook due to slowing sales.Among internet stocks, Travelzoo.com shares lost 10.5 per cent to $52 after the travel website operator announced the successful completion of a $30m private placement of shares at a significant discount to the share price before the announcement."
968;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2004-09-28T20:39:40Z;Wall Street shrugs off $50 crude oil;;"Wall Street on Tuesday displayed its short attention span as stocks rallied undeterred by a crude oil price around $50 per barrel, with traders focused on higher earnings guidance from an industrial equipment maker and the prospect of rising profits from metals and mining companies.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9 per cent at 10,077.40 while the S&P 500 index was 0.6 per cent higher at 1,110.06. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.5 per cent to 1,869.87.William Livesey, senior technical analyst at Cybertrader, said some market indicators had been nearing levels that signalled stocks were oversold and suggested the potential for a rebound. However, he cautioned that one afternoon's action does not make a reliable rally: ""I want to see more upside action before I get excited.""Crude futures closed within a whisker of $50 per barrel amid fears about supply disruptions. While economists point out that oil, in real terms, is far from the highs of the 1970s and early 1980s, equity investors have worried that high energy prices will squeeze corporate profitability and cast a pall on the stock market.However, investors chose to use rising oil prices as a rallying cry to buy oil stocks. The American Stock Exchange oil producers index added 1.6 per cent, paced by a 3 per cent rise to $43.37 in Unocal, alongside Amerada Hess, which added 3.3 per cent to $89.21. Marathon Oil rose 2.6 per cent to $41.52.In addition, a rise in aluminium and other metals prices helped Alcoa shares add 4.3 per cent to $32.70 while copper mining group Phelps-Dodge rose 4.8 per cent to $93.60.Also helping the Dow industrials higher was Caterpillar, which added 3.3 per cent to $76.90, after the leading maker of large-scale industrial equipment raised its full-year revenue outlook citing strong demand.Tuesday's action was greeted with scepticism because a series of rallies year have failed the test of time.In addition to losing steam on a couple of occasions earlier this year, markets have suffered from relatively low volume and market watchers such as Chris Wolfe at JP Morgan Private Bank said there were signs many investors saw the market as fairly valued but had no reason to trade on it.Hugh Whelan, at ING Investment Management, pointed out that implied volatility indices for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ""suggest that the so-called mixed sentiment picture is really a case of investors having low levels of interest and passion about the market …the sideways, slightly downtrending market has simply exhausted both bears and bulls"".Dell Computer shares rose 1.1 per cent to $35.45 after the computer maker said it stood by its previous earnings guidance. The news flew in the face of recent concerns about the outlook for technology spending and tepid demand for new equipment.Hewlett-Packard, whose results and ability to compete with Dell have caused concern, saw its shares ease 0.9 per cent to $18.24.Solectron shares added 2.9 per cent to $5 ahead of the contract manufacturer's quarterly earnings report due after the close.Pepsi Bottling Group shares added 0.3 per cent to $26.68 after the largest bottler of Pepsi soft drinks reported rising quarterly sales and increased its full-year earnings estimates. Pepsico shares rose 0.2 per cent to $48.10.The news contrasted with recent reports from Coca-Cola Enterprises, the leading Coke bottler, whose shares suffered after it said slowing sales would hurt earnings. Yesterday, CCE shares were 0.4 per cent off at $18.96 after Coca-Cola said it would revise a profit-sharing agreement with its largest bottler. Coca-Cola shares inched up 0.9 per cent to $39.99.In the pharmaceuticals sector, the shares of Atherogenics surged 64.1 per cent to $38 after the company said its anti-inflammatory agent produced good results in trials."
969;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2004-09-17T23:17:39Z;Coke chief to be paid a basic $1.5m;;Coca-Cola has said that Neville Isdell, chairman and chief executive of the world's largest soft drink company, will receive a base salary of $1.5m a year, with a target bonus of $3m. The disclosures in a regulatory filing came two days after Mr Isdell warned that Coca-Cola would miss Wall Street forecasts for its second-half earnings by about 20 per cent.Mr Isdell, who took over the top job in June, will also be eligible to take part in Coca-Cola's long-term equity plan, with an annual target value of $10.5m. Both the bonus and long-term equity awards would depend on Coca-Cola's results and Mr Isdell's own performance, the company added.Mr Isdell's basic pay is the same as the $1.5m earned by his predecessor, Douglas Daft, who also received a $4m bonus last year. It is 50 per cent more than the $1m basic salary of Steve Reinemund, chief executive of rival PepsiCo but the $3.8m bonus Mr Reinemund received makes the new Coca-Cola chief's total payand-bonus package broadly comparable.Coca-Cola disclosed in July that it had granted Mr Isdell 450,000 stock options and a restricted stock award of 140,000 shares.The soft drinks giant has angered shareholders in the past with its generous awards to senior executives.Mr Daft was awarded restricted stock worth more than $60m at a time when lay-offs were mounting and volume performance dropped.But the award was tied to Mr Daft's achieving compound earnings per share growth of 11-16 per cent by 2005 a target Coca-Cola did not meet.Mr Isdell broke out of a planned 120-day review of the business to warn on Wednesday that poor weather in Europe and a difficult retail climate in North America were squeezing the company's sales.Volume growth for the third quarter was expected to be flat to 1 per cent, the worst since 1999, with full-year growth of only 1-2 per cent well below the 5 per cent target.Second-half earnings were expected to be only 77-82 cents per share, compared with analysts' forecasts of 99 cents.“I am not satisfied with this performance or the anticipated results,” Mr Isdell said. “They are symptoms of problems that demand strong corrective actions.”But Mr Isdell insisted he could turn Coca-Cola back into a “great growth company” through more effective marketing, bringing in new management talent, stepping up innovation, and getting the right balance between price and volume growth.
970;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2020-04-23T07:23:06+0000;Lex: Coca-Cola;;When anyone at Coca-Cola speaks highly of PepsiCo, something is badly wrong. Neville Isdell, Coke's new chief executive, did just that on Wednesday, praising Roger Enrico, former PepsiCo boss, for the way he had brought in new talent in the 1990s. A dearth of good managers is just one of the problems facing Coke. Errors in pricing strategy have been compounded by a failure to keep many Coke bottlers on the same course as the mother ship. Coke has also been slow to seize on consumer demand for healthier products. A cool summer in Europe added to the misery.Investors already knew much of the bad news. Coke's stock fell less than 5 per cent, despite the company's warning that second-half earnings would miss analysts' estimates by about 20 per cent. But there were some new pinpricks for confidence, such as impairment charges of about $400m, largely on German intangible assets. At the end of June, Coke had determined there was no need for such charges.Mr Isdell may, wisely, have been getting all the bad news out at once. It is early days for him, and he warned that any turnround would take time. Certainly Coke, the strongest brand in the world, should not be underestimated. But for now the company looks pedestrian, and its historical price-earnings premium to PepsiCo has disappeared. If Coke is to regain its premium rating, Mr Isdell will have to convince investors that his company stands above the competition. Perhaps that explains his surprising attention to PepsiCo.
971;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2004-09-08T17:42:22Z;The thirst to refresh the mobile's image;;Mobile operators and handset makers have been busy revamping their brands over the past five years as the mobile phone has evolved from its humble origins as a simple device for making telephone calls to an important fashion item almost on a par with watches or trainers.Now, as mobile phones enter their next phase - to become sophisticated design accessories incorporating mega-pixel cameras and MP3 music players - handset makers and operators are having to update their image once again. And many are looking to people from outside the wireless world to help them. .Last month, Nokia, the world's largest handset maker, said that it was headhunting Keith Pardy, a 45-year-old Canadian executive at Coca-Cola with global responsibility for the drinks maker's non-cola brands such as Fanta, Sprite and Powerade, to become its new head of brand management.“We see a lot of possibilities in enterprise, mobile gaming and entertainment which create a clear need for us to stretch the brand to these new areas,” explains Pekka Rantala, senior vice-president of marketing at Nokia. “We need to keep the brand image refreshed at all times.”Nokia's rivals are engaging in similar hirings from other consumer industries. And so are many mobile operators. Sony Ericsson, which is vying with Siemens for the position of the world's fourth largest handset maker, has made key appointments from Microsoft and Pepsi. Vodafone, which has the world's most expansive mobile network, has already hired several brand experts from Coca-Cola, Sony, Hewlett-Packard and Mars as it seeks to refresh its brand.Handset makers and mobile operators habitually update and revitalise their brand images. By the mid-1990s, just as mobile phones were starting to enter the mainstream, the key selling point for mobile phone services was reliability. As far as consumers were concerned, mobile phones needed to be as small as possible, have decent battery life and be easy to use. Mobile operators needed to have decent coverage and minimal dropped calls. Mobile brands therefore needed to reflect quality and reliability.By the end of the 1990s, the goalposts were moving. Fashion and design were becoming the key differentiators and handset makers such as Nokia began winning market share with its cutting-edge designs. Mobile brands suddenly needed to appeal to aspirational consumers and fashion-conscious youth.This time, it is technological innovation that is forcing mobile groups to readjust their brands. The advent of mega-pixel cameras or gaming may play to the advantages of companies such as Sony Ericsson or Samsung, with their formidable consumer electronics heritages. But for handset makers such as Nokia, these developments represent much more of a brand challenge.“We have been one of the strongest brands in the world and we want to keep it there,” says Mr Rantala. “But we need to stretch the brand so that . . . when consumers think about which camera to buy they are totally comfortable to have Nokia on their shortlist.”Mr Rantala readily concedes that Nokia cannot match the brand strengths of some of its Asian rivals when it comes to consumer electronics or imaging. But it is combating this partly by forging alliances with reputable companies such as HP and Kodak. Nokia has also gone on a global hiring spree in the past 12 months, recruiting marketing and brand experts from the gaming, entertainment and music industries.For the more recent new entrants into the mobile phone world such as Sony Ericsson, the migration to ever more sophisticated devices plays to its strengths in consumer electronics.“I often say half jokingly: ‘Who ever heard of a camera coming from Nokia?',” says Dee Dutta, corporate vice-president of global marketing at Sony Ericsson.Yet even Sony Ericsson has been beefing up its brand and marketing expertise. Mr Dutta says that its recent hirings from companies such as Microsoft and Pepsi have been primarily motivated by the strong sense of brand discipline at both companies.But he says the hirings also reflect the need for it continually to adapt its brand strengths to the rapidly changing mobile environment. “Pepsi and Coke packaging just doesn't change. Our shelf life has a maximum of 18 months. You need people who can react to our fast-moving world.”Of all the major mobile brands, Vodafone has been one of the most aggressive in hiring from leading consumer brands. While the mobile operator recognises the need to adapt its image to the changing technological landscape, part of its aim is also to hire people from companies whose brand and marketing approach it is trying to emulate.One of Vodafone's key stamping grounds has been Coca-Cola, where its most prominent hiring was David Haines, the mobile operator's former global brands director. Mr Haines, who left Vodafone earlier this year, was instrumental in implementing Vodafone's brand-transforming sponsorship of David Beckham, the soccer player, and his former team Manchester United.He also brought with him a Coca-Cola ethos which has spread throughout the company. David Wheldon, Vodafone's current global director of marketing brand communications, says Vodafone would happily see itself as the Coca-Cola of mobile.“Coca-Cola is all about being where its customers are,” he says. “That is something we have built on. We are in airports where the business travellers are.”O2, the UK-based mobile operator, has been credited with a successful rebranding of its operations since it was spun off from BT Group. Under its new image, the mobile operator has won a stronger following among fashion-conscious youth and users of advanced services such as picture messaging.It wants to have its brand associated with the latest technology and services as it seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors.“We think there is a lot of scope for differentiation as we now enter the second phase,” says Susie Moore, head of brands at O2. “Now that mobile and wireless is becoming so much more than just making a call, having a share of the customer's life is what it is all about.”As the growth phase in mobiles draws to a close, operators and handset manufacturers need to offer greater functionality and services to engender customer loyalty - and the best way to communicate this is through their brand.“This industry has moved from an acquisition phase to a retention phase,” says Mr Wheldon. “It is now all about delighting customers and retaining them and that is all about brand.”IT'S A MOBILE - BUT NOT AS WE KNOW ITAs more electronic gadgets from video cameras to laptop computers feature wireless connectivity, and as mobile phones incorporate ever more advanced functions, the distinctions between handset makers and consumer electronics groups are blurring.This convergence is creating both challenges and opportunities for the leading mobile and consumer electronics brands keen to grow their share of the global handset market, which is expected to see sales of over 600m units this year. The question marketing executives at these companies are asking themselves is which brand will win: the wireless brand or the consumer electronics brand.“There is now a blurring of the categories being driven by technology such as cameras or music,” says Martin Rowlatt, a partner at Onesixtyfourth, a brand consultancy. “Tomorrow's competition could well come from the likes of Apple.” Dee Dutta, corporate vice-president of global marketing at Sony Ericsson, says it is still too early to predict which brands will succeed in what he describes as an “evolving battle”.Consumer electronics brands such as Samsung have succeeded in gaining global market share with phones incorporating high-quality cameras and screens.Mr Rowlatt says it is important that companies from both the wireless and consumer electronics spaces maintain a strong development pipeline of sophisticated products to back up their brands.However, this must not be done at the expense of their key strengths. As Pekka Rantalasss, senior vice-president of marketing at Nokia, explains: “It is important we enter new markets such as imaging and gaming. But we need to remind consumers about the mobility angle that we are about. That's the value added that Nokia can bring to the consumer.”
972;PEP;Pepsico Inc;2004-09-05T15:26:13Z;Stumped by a different ball game;;Sir Clive Woodward, head coach of England's national rugby union team, shocked the sports world last week when he decided to quit his job with a view to managing a football team.The question is: will the the managerial skills he displayed while leading England to victory in the 2003 Rugby World Cup transfer into football?Many people, in football and elsewhere, seem to take it for granted that he will succeed in switching from one sport to another. Jack Rowe, Sir Clive's predecessor as England coach, commented on BBC Radio 4 that while Sir Clive would have much to learn about football, his management skills would be transferable.But are managerial skills universal? Managers, as well as educators promoting the thriving MBA business, are often tempted to believe that they are. A trained and skilled manager, it is said, should be able to perform well in any situation.But there is no real consensus as to what constitutes management skills. The only issue on which there seems to be agreement is that managers require attributes such as the ability to manage people, to communicate, and to initiate and manage change. The belief that management is a generic function that crosses all boundaries goes back to Peter Drucker, the American guru who, in The Practice of Management and Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices, attempted to distil management into a set of basicprinciples.One result of Mr Drucker's work was the concept of the “transferable manager”, a highly trained and skilled person who can move easily between management roles in different companies and industries. Mr Drucker himself repudiated this view, arguing that managerial skills are only one of the elements needed for success and noting that industry-specific and company-specific knowledge are just as important.There have been transfer success stories. The classic case is Pierre du Pont, who, in the 1920s, moved from the board of the family-owned gunpowder works to be president of General Motors.But on closer examination, his case turns out to be misleading. Mr Du Pont, who had been a very hands-on manager, changed his approach completely when moving to General Motors, recruiting experienced auto industry executives and handing over responsibility to them. Leadership was the key to his success and it is hard to pinpoint specific management skills that underpinned his achievement.There have also been many failed attempts to switch businesses. John Scully was one of the most successful managers in the history of Pepsi-Cola, masterminding the marketing campaign that saw Pepsi challenge Coca-Cola for domination of the world soft drinks market. The board of Apple Computers, believing that Mr Scully had the magic recipe for managerial success, hired him as CEO in the 1980s. Here the results were far less impressive. As well as a high-profile dispute with Steve Jobs, Apple's chairman and founder, there were severe problems with supply chains, product lines and staff morale.Why do such failures occur? The most important factor is lack of industry knowledge. Some of the most successful managers of recent times - such as Jack Welch at General Electric - spent most of their careers with a single organisation, and their detailed knowledge played a huge role in their success. Other factors, such as corporate culture or power structures among the elites, mean an incoming manager will find it difficult if not impossible to employ the same recipe.Generic management practices and sets of skills do exist. But these are necessary - and not sufficient - for managerial success. To succeed as a manager, it is necessary to know how, where and when to employ the skills and in what ways they must be adapted to fit the given situation. Sir Clive Woodward's move from one game to another - “switching codes”, as the sports writers put it - will not be simple. There will be more to do than merely teaching his players to kick the ball under the bar rather than over it.
