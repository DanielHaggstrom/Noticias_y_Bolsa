The stake is valued at $3.4bn based on Wabtec’s current stock price of $71.03 and the companies said the deal is expected to close by the end of next month.“With the increase in GE’s stake in Wabtec, and increased proceeds as we sell down this stake, this transaction will further strengthen our balance sheet and support our deleveraging plan,” said Larry Culp, GE’s chairman and chief executive.In return GE will be ceding majority control of the new combined company to Wabtec. It will now own only a 49.2 per cent stake, down from the 50.1 per cent the two had previously settled on.Shares in GE jumped as much as 4.9 per cent before paring that gain to 3.6 per cent. Wabtec was 3.2 per cent higher, although it had been up by as much as 5.9 per cent.Despite the share price gains, analysts at Gordon Haskett argued the modified deal appeared to be more beneficial to GE bondholders rather than shareholders.“GE stated that the modification is to strengthen the company’s balance sheet — in other words pay down debt and liabilities with the increased (corporate) ownership. In turn, this dovetails with our recent assertion that expected GE to use as much of its upcoming business sale proceeds as possible to pay down its debt and other liabilities (vs. spinning business ownerships to shareholders, including the upcoming Healthcare IPO),” they said. “Consequently, we view this to be a positive development for credit holders and a negative event for shareholders (vs. the previous arrangement).”The industrial giant, a maker of jet engines, lightbulbs and appliances, is under pressure to lower its debt pile, which totalled $115bn at the end of last September.As part of a broad restructuring effort that began in 2017, the company has been shedding assets and is preparing for a spin-off of its healthcare unit and the sale of a stake in Baker Hughes. In December, the Boston-based group said it would sell a majority stake in software provider ServiceMax to Silver Lake. GE also announced plans to turn its industrial software unit into a standalone subsidiary.
1;WAB;Wabtec Corp;2018-05-21T11:46:52Z;General Electric to combine transport unit with Wabtec in $11.1bn deal ;Industrials group sells assets to shore up balance sheet and simplify structure;General Electric has agreed to combine its transport unit with Wabtec, the maker of passenger and freight locomotives, in a $11.1bn deal that provides the US blue-chip company with a $2.9bn cash infusion.The transaction is part of planned asset disposals worth about $20bn by the industrials group as it seeks to shore up its balance sheet and simplify its business structure. The asset sales are expected to bring in between $5bn and $10bn this year.GE will take a 50.1 per cent stake in the combined company as part of its deal with Wabtec, which traces its roots to 1869 and is worth about $9bn.The disposal strategy is being driven by John Flannery, who took over as chief executive last August with the aim of simplifying GE’s structure. He has argued that under his predecessors Jack Welch and Jeff Immelt, GE became too sprawling and complex, and has said he intends to focus on just three core divisions: aviation, healthcare and the power industry.The company is at work on a number of other transactions. ABB is buying GE’s industrial solutions business, which makes electrical equipment, for $2.6bn. GE announced last month the sale of a healthcare technology business to Veritas Capital for $1.05bn. It is selling its lighting businesses, with Chinese groups including MLS and Foshan Electrical and Lighting reported to be interested, according to Reuters. Two aviation businesses are also up for sale, the company has said.GE has suffered a severe squeeze on its cash flows because of the weakness of its power equipment division and its operations serving the oil and gas industry, forcing it to cut its dividend last year. Raising cash from selling businesses helps ease that problem. The transport division, which also provides equipment for the mining industry, has suffered a difficult couple of years. Its profits dropped 16 per cent in 2016 and a further 34 per cent last year. But the most recent quarter showed an upturn, with profit up 37 per cent at $130m for the three months to March.“We are seeing growth in rail traffic and recent promising orders for new and modernised locomotives from . . . international railroads, and are confident in the compelling long-term opportunities and synergies before us,” said Rafael Santana, chief executive of GE Transportation. Mr Santana will become president and chief executive of Wabtec’s freight division.Wabtec chairman Albert Neupaver was reappointed as the executive chairman of the locomotive manufacturer, and chief executive Raymond Betler will continue to lead the company.The number of locomotives sold in the quarter dropped sharply to 60, from 157 in the equivalent period of 2017, as a result “continuing challenging market conditions” in North America, the company said in its quarterly filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the slow sales were offset by increased activity in servicing and supplying parts for older equipment.Questions have been raised over the long-term future of GE’s transport business, which makes diesel locomotives, given global pressure for rail electrification. GE last year clashed with India over a $2.6bn locomotive contract, when the country’s new railway minister Piyush Goyal said he wanted its rail network to become fully electrified.The deal with Wabtec is expected to be completed early in 2019. The train manufacturer has received financing commitments to fund its $2.9bn cash payment to GE, which it expected to eventually bankroll with longer term debt. Wabtec said it was “committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating profile”.GE estimated the deal created a tax benefit of $1.1bn for the combined company, which it included in the $11.1bn deal value. Morgan Stanley and Dyal Co acted as financial advisers to GE. Goldman Sachs advised Wabtec.
2;WAB;Wabtec Corp;2011-12-12T03:06:15Z;Employ the most energy-efficient technologies and techniques;;From Mr Andrew Warren.Sir, I fear Malcolm Brinded of Shell (“Big role for gas in global energy mix”, Letters, December 7) may be conflating his desire to promote consumption of his company’s products with a misunderstanding of what energy consumers actually want. Demand is certainly increasing for the services energy provides – light, heat, motive power. But it does not follow that the amount of energy we consume need follow anything like the same upward trajectory.Just by cutting our most profligate use, we could easily secure all the energy services we now enjoy while using a fraction of the fuel we currently do. The “simplest, fastest and cheapest way to achieve this” is not, as Mr Brinded suggests, by burning more fossil fuels – of any kind. It is by employing the most efficient technologies and techniques, in our buildings, our machinery or in our transport.Andrew Warren, Director, Association for the Conservation of Energy, London N1, UK
3;WAB;Wabtec Corp;2011-10-06T13:28:26Z;Power: Local utilities will do the lion’s share;Foreign groups are beating a retreat, writes Jan Cienski;Many people have an image of central Europe as a place of coal-fired factories belching smoke.However, an enormous wave of investment is likely to transform that picture, as the region moves away from coal-generated electricity to a mix based on nuclear, wind and gas.And the lion’s share of the investment will be by local utilities.Big foreign companies that, a few years ago, saw lucrative prospects in the region are pulling back to their home markets, or focusing on niches – such as wind – leaving the biggest work for local, often state-owned, companies.A good example of both sides of this coin is CEZ, the Czech utility in which the state has a stake of about 70 per cent.In recent years, CEZ, under pressure from the government to maximise profits, embarked on aggressive regional expansion, buying utilities in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and elsewhere in the region to make it into the top 10 of European power companies.However, the government has now shifted focus, and is demanding that CEZ retreat from its regional ambitions and focus instead on the Czech market.There, it is planning to complete the expansion of the Temelin nuclear power plant, as well as the construction of a new reactor at the Dukovany plant. It also plans to build two reactors in next-door Slovakia.Daniel Benes, CEZ chief executive, said in a recent interview that the priority is now the development of the home market for nuclear and coal power plants.At present about 70 per cent of CEZ’s capacity comes from coal-fired plants.The company recently received free emissions permits from the Czech government worth about €1.3bn ($1.7bn), says Jana Hays, an analyst at Candole Partners, a central and eastern Europe market analysis company.But the future of coal is looking doubtful because of tightening EU restrictions on CO2 emissions, which will spur investment in other sources of power.CEZ’s focus on its home market is being replicated elsewhere, as international companies – such as Sweden’s Vattenfall, which is selling its Polish assets – pull out of the region to build up capacity at home.This is especially true of German utilities, which saw their capitalisation take a large fall after the government’s decision to scrap the country’s nuclear plants.Wojciech Hann, an energy expert at Deloitte, the consultancy, says: “Many of those active in the region have to use excess cash to revitalise their own assets.“That could lead to a slowdown in cross-border mergers and acquisitions – unless certain signs of demand from some more ‘exotic’ players [for example, recent interest from Chinese investors in Romania] develop into a trend.”RWE, the German utility with about 6 per cent of the Polish market and other assets across the region, is planning to focus on wind power – spending €500m to build up capacity in Poland from 108MW to 300MW by 2015. But it is leaving the biggest investments to large local utilities.“We don’t want to build coal power plants. We see the future in renewables combined with gas power plants,” says Filip Thon, president of the management board of RWE Polska.Poland has the largest economy in the region and generates about 90 per cent of its electricity from coal.It is one of the few countries in CEE not to have a nuclear power industry.Mr Thon says Poland has a generating capacity of about 35GW, of which about 15GW has to be replaced in the near future because it is produced by antiquated power plants.The country also needs to build about 15GW of extra capacity by 2030 to keep up with demand.The full investment required is about €50bn over the next two decades.This does not include money needed for connectors to other European grids and to upgrade the transmission network to handle the fluctuating output of renewable sources such as wind power.As elsewhere, Poland is going to see big changes in its energy mix.Coal will be much less important. By 2030, the economy ministry expects coal to fall to about 57 per cent of capacity, with the rest from gas, wind, bio­fuels and the country’s first nuclear power plant.“The more the EU’s greenhouse gas penalties grow, the more nuclear will become cost-effective,” says Daniel Roderick, senior vice-president for nuclear plant projects at GE Hitachi, one of three consortiums – alongside France’s Areva and Westinghouse of the US – bidding to build a Polish plant.The plant, one of two planned, will be built for Poland’s PGE, 70 per cent owned by the government.Other large energy investments across the region, from expansion of Romania’s Cernavoda nuclear power plant, to the Visaginas nuclear plant in Lithuania, are being built by external contractors for local power companies.In Hungary, where the prickly centre-right government has been wary of a range of foreign investors, premier Viktor Orban has referred to “excessive profits” made by foreign investors in “monopoly” positions at utilities, and spoken of the need to “gain control” over them.Other leaders are more restrained in their criticism, but there is a clear trend for foreign utilities to play a more marginal role.“We’re seeing a retreat of foreign participants such as Vattenfall,” says Krzysztof Rozen of KPMG, the consultancy.“I would not expect a large boom on the part of foreign investors.”
4;WAB;Wabtec Corp;2010-08-26T05:38:28Z;India business wary over nuclear law;;India’s lower house of parliament on Wednesday approved a draft nuclear liability law that the national nuclear power company and Indian business groups fear will jeopardise the benefits of New Delhi’s nuclear deal with the US.The state-owned Nuclear Power Corp of India and leading industry bodies warned the draft law would throttle the country’s fledgling nuclear power industry, by deterring private companies from providing nuclear equipment or raw materials to India.Global nuclear companies such as GE, Westinghouse, Bechtel and Areva are keen to enter the Indian market because of New Delhi’s ambitious plans to expand its nuclear energy capacity from 4,000 megawatts of installed capacity to 30,000MW by 2020. These companies have been waiting for India to lay out its legal framework for liability– the final step of India’s 2008 civil nuclear deal with the US.The draft law is intended to ensure quick compensation for victims of nuclear accidents without the need to prove fault.However, Indian industry groups say a provision allowing nuclear power plant operators to seek recourse from equipment or raw material suppliers for 80 years after a plant’s construction would deter international nuclear energy companies and some local companies from doing nuclear commerce with India.In a letter to Manmohan Singh, prime minister, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry warned the legislation “threatens to completely undo the government’s efforts to accelerate nuclear power generation in our country”.The Confederation of Indian Industry said separately that the provision would be “a major deterrent” to India’s nuclear power operators accessing foreign technology.“No manufacturer, Indian or foreign, would be able to serve the nuclear power industry,” Sudhinder Thakur, executive director of the national nuclear power group, said this week.“The government has the powers to make laws, but in making laws, we should not defeat the purpose for which the laws are made.”Mr Singh defended the bill – which must still be approved by the upper house – saying it was the final step to end India’s decades-long status as a nuclear pariah, following its 1974 and 1998 nuclear weapons tests.“This bill completes our journey to end the nuclear apartheid that the world imposed on us,” Mr Singh told parliament ahead of the vote.Most countries with a large nuclear energy sector fix absolute and exclusive liability on nuclear power plant operators, which are normally able to access insurance to cover their risk. With up to 300 companies supplying components, materials, and services to build a nuclear power plant, industry groups say pinpointing liability in case of an accident is considered nearly impossible – and many suppliers, especially of small parts, could not afford to insure against a long accident risk.However, the debate on the nuclear liability bill was affected by the recent resurgence of public anger over the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.
5;WAB;Wabtec Corp;2008-09-24T20:28:15Z;French takeover clears UK nuclear energy mist;;"“The landscape for new nuclear build is beginning to take shape; the mist is clearing,” was John Hutton’s view of the agreed £12.5bn ($23.2bn) takeover of British Energy by France’s EDF.Pierre Gadonneix, EDF’s chairman and chief executive, describes Britain as the most important market in the world for new nuclear investment. The clearing mist reveals EDF as the dominant operator .Mr Hutton, the UK’s business secretary, has been a strong supporter of the deal, wanting to attract EDF’s financial strength and nuclear expertise to deliver an ambitious programme of investment in new reactors.Ministers hope Britain will be able to generate more than 30 per cent of its electricity from nuclear power, up from less than 20 per cent today.They also hope that the new nuclear generation programme will provide a boost for British manufacturers in the construction, operation and decommissioning of power stations.The price for Britain is that it has ceded control of another vital part of its energy infrastructure to foreign ownership, and it is allowing further concentration in an industry that is already under investigation by the regulator because of persistent concerns about a lack of competition. The British government’s perception of the urgent need for new nuclear power stations has been enough to override those concerns.EDF believes the worries about competition can be easily answered. It has been in touch with the European Union’s antitrust authorities and expects Brussels to approve the deal in the first phase of its investigation, meaning that the takeover could be completed by the end of the year.Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF’s UK business, said British Energy generated about 19 per cent of Britain’s electricity, and EDF less than 6 per cent. “So 75 per cent is in the hands of our competitors, which is very far from a dominant position.”Further questions will be raised when Centrica, the owner of British Gas, takes its 25 per cent stake in the new holding company for British Energy, which is likely to come next year, but Sam Laidlaw, Centrica’s chief executive, said he was “confident” that would not stand in the way of the deal.Nonetheless, BizzEnergy and Electricity4Business, two smaller energy suppliers that do not generate their own power, raised concerns about the deal, particularly because of the way that British Energy, which had been an independent generator with no supply business, would now be tied to two big suppliers, EDF and Centrica, in a vertically integrated group.The deal puts even greater weight on the inquiry into UK energy markets that Ofgem, the regulator, is due to publish next month.The British government also insists that the UK’s competitive model for energy markets is not being undermined.Ministers and officials point to the agreements signed by EDF to dispose of land at most of its nuclear sites to other companies to allow them to build reactors. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, a government agency, is also working with EDF to sell land at sites where it is in charge of nuclear clean-up.EDF says that once the land sales are over, it could end up with just two sites for building its four new European pressurised reactors, or EPRs. One will probably be at Hinkley Point in Somerset, the other could well be Sizewell in Suffolk.The rest will be up for grabs, and RWE of Germany confirmed on Wednesday that it was stil interested in nuclear investment in the UK. Eon is also enthusiastic.By buying British Energy, however, EDF has secured the bulk of Britain’s base of nuclear skills and given itself first pick of the most attractive sites.The leading role for EDF could have implications for the government’s ambitions that the nuclear revival should create a thriving British industry in supplying specialist equipment, forgings, large castings and reactor pressure vessels.EDF’s EPRs will be supplied by Areva, the French nuclear engineering group. EDF was unable to say what its precise plans were for UK investment.Given the global demand for nuclear components and expertise, however, both the government and British Energy agree the big problem will be finding enough skilled people, not fighting for a share of the work.Areva’s rival supplier Westinghouse, part of Toshiba, has been vocal that winning reactor construction contracts from other potential UK operators, such as Eon or RWE, would allow it to contribute more than £30bn to the UK economy. It has signed deals with BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Doosan Babcock that could create up to 10,000 jobs.Bill Coley, British Energy’s chief executive, said he did not believe Britain should regret surrendering its nuclear industry to the French. “This deal is a great push forward to grow the business.”"
