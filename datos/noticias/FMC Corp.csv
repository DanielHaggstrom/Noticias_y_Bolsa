0;FMC;FMC Corp;2019-05-08T16:22:04Z;Livent shares plunge after sales warning;;Livent lost more than a fifth of its market value on Wednesday after the lithium producer warned of weaker sales and revised guidance, fuelling fresh concerns about demand for the key battery material.The company, which was spun out of FMC last year and listed in New York, dropped as much as 23 per cent to $8.28 as investors digested the new forecasts.Livent, which produces a type of lithium that is used in Tesla electric car batteries, said a “small number of customers” had delayed their 2019 orders, which would lead to lower sales volumes and lower prices.In addition the company said that it did not expect to see a “meaningful change in demand” for its lithium hydroxide “until late 2019 or early 2020” despite rising sales of electric cars.Livent is one of the key producers of lithium hydroxide, a type of lithium that is used in more powerful high-nickel batteries by Tesla and other premium electric car makers.But many car and battery customers in China, the largest electric car market, have yet to switch to higher nickel batteries due to their costs.“We are seeing weaker near-term demand for our high-performance lithium hydroxide, as several major customers have informed us about recent decisions to delay their own commercial launches of high-nickel cathode chemistries,” Paul Graves, Livent’s chief executive said.“This will result in lower delivered volumes of lithium hydroxide to these customers in 2019 than previously indicated and lower overall sales volumes for the year.”Following Beijing’s decision to cut subsidies to its electric car companies in March many Chinese companies have chosen to continue using cheaper lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that use no nickel. While they are less powerful than high nickel batteries LFP batteries can be used for shorter-range cars and electric buses.The price of lithium hydroxide has fallen by 5.8 per cent this year to an average of $15,177 a tonne, compared to a 4.2 per cent fall for standard lithium carbonate, according to prices monitored by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Over the past year prices for lithium hydroxide have dropped by 27 per cent.The price of lithium hydroxide has fallen by 5.8 per cent this year to an average of $15,177 a tonne, compared to a 4.2 per cent fall for standard lithium carbonate, according to prices monitored by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Over the past year prices for lithium hydroxide have dropped by 27 per cent.The company now expects revenue of $435m to $475m and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $125m to $145m, against $443m and $183m respectively last year.Livent’s warning comes just weeks after Umicore, which makes cathodes for electric car batteries, blamed slowing demand in China for a profit warning that sent its share price into freefall.In spite of the weaker current market conditions, the outlook for electric vehicles and lithium demand remains positive said Mr Graves.“We have seen multiple manufacturers announcing more detailed plans for new electric vehicle model launches. Importantly, for the first time they are now specifying performance requirements that will require the use of high-nickel cathode chemistries, which increases our confidence in the growing importance of high-performance lithium hydroxide.”
1;FMC;FMC Corp;2019-04-05T04:00:40Z;Mitsui boosts Brazil’s lithium ambitions with Sigma deal;Japanese trader invests in mining project as electric car battery demand rises;Brazil is set to emerge as a significant supplier of high-quality lithium — a raw material used in electric-car batteries — after one of the world’s biggest commodity traders agreed to back a new project in the country.Japanese group Mitsui & Co is to invest $30m in Grota do Cirilo, a hard rock lithium deposit being developed by Canadian miner Sigma Lithium Resources, in return for a quarter of its initial output of 220,000 tonnes.The cash from the Mitsui deal and a $40m debt offering will enable Sigma to start construction of a processing plant at the site in the south-eastern province of Minas Gerais.It plans to ship its material to China, where it will be converted into lithium hydroxide, the type of lithium used by Tesla in its car batteries. It is aiming to be in production by 2020.Lithium demand is expected to rise over the next decade because of rising sales of electric vehicles. Australian miners have moved quickly to cash in on the expected boom, opening a handful of hard rock mines in recent years and dominating the market.Minas Gerais needs to show it is opening to mining. So they are looking for projects that tick the box in terms of not having a tailings damThe Sigma financing deal is a rare piece of good news for Brazil’s mining industry, which has been rocked by the deadly mining disaster in Minas Gerais early this year. A dam holding waste material, or “tailings”, from an iron ore mine suddenly burst in January, releasing a torrent of waste material that cut through a local community killing at least 300 people. Following the spill, Vale, the operator, has been forced to halt production at several sites.Calvyn Gardner, Sigma’s chairman and chief executive, said he expected Brazilian regulators to grant an installation licence for Grota do Cirilo in the next couple of months.He said Sigma was using dry processing technology to produce lithium concentrate, a partly refined version of the metal, meaning it did not need a dam to store waste material and water.“We designed the mine two years ago without a tailings pond. We don’t have that issue,” he said.“Minas Gerais needs to show it is opening to mining. So they are looking for projects that tick the box in terms of not having a tailings dam.”During the construction phase 500 people will be employed at Grota do Cirilo, which is located in one of the poorest parts of Minas Gerais.Despite the long distance to its main market in China, Mr Gardner said Sigma would be able to compete with Australian producers because of its low production costs.“We can land material in China for $340 to $360 a tonne,” he said, adding that only the giant Greenbushes mine near Perth in Australia had lower costs.Under the terms of the deal announced on Friday, Mitsui also has the right to buy a further 25,000 tonnes a year of lithium from Sigma over a period of six years.If the company goes ahead with an expansion project to lift production to 440,000 tonnes a year, Mitsui will be able to buy more material if it provides extra funding. That level of output would place Sigma in the ranks of the industry’s midsized producers.Demand for high-quality lithium is expected to increase as carmakers shift to higher nickel-content batteries, whose chemical process tends to use more lithium hydroxide.
2;FMC;FMC Corp;2019-02-13T13:56:30Z;SoftBank backed Nemaska says needs additional C$375m to complete lithium mine;;Nemaska Lithium, a Canadian lithium producer backed by Japan’s SoftBank, said it needs a further C$375M ($283m) to complete its lithium mine in Québec.Nemaska said it had reassessed the costs of its Whabouchi hard-rock lithium asset following the start of construction.“We now have a better understanding on the remaining scope of the project, estimated budget and current market conditions,” Guy Bourassa, the chief executive of Nemaska said. “The revised overall project cost reflects a more precise outlook on installation costs and other key variables to the completion of our project.”The new cost estimate highlights the difficulty of building new lithium mines to meet increased demand for the battery raw material from increased sales of electric cars. It also underline the risks of investing in companies promoting new types of processing technology. Nemaska plans use electrolysis to produce high purity lithium, which means it main input cost will electricity.Shares in Nemaska crashed, falling 35 per cent to C0.35 cents.In May Nemaska raised C$1.1bn in a financing package that included a C$99.1m investment from SoftBank. It also included $350m of senior secured callable bonds and a streaming agreement with private equity fund Orion Mine Finance.The company said the extra C$375m would enable it to complete construction of the mine and meet the drawdown conditions of the debt.Mr Bourassa said construction of the mine is on time and it is working with its shareholders to “identify a variety of funding solutions.” The company aims to complete the mine construction in October, and make its first shipment of lithium-containing spodumene in December.“We are evaluating several options that would enable existing and new shareholders, and project partners to join the table,” he said.Analysts at Canaccord said they “do not doubt there are multiple parties interested in gaining access to the project’s lithium.”The funding shortfall at Nemaska could have consequences for other lithium companies trying to raise money, including Bacanora Minerals. It is also planning to use a new processing technology. Its shares were down 11.6 on Thursday at 19.45p.
3;FMC;FMC Corp;2018-08-28T10:09:32Z;Livent IPO to test faith in electric car revolution;FMC aims to raise $100m for group that supplies lithium for battery-powered vehicles;The upcoming New York listing of FMC Corp is poised to test investor appetite for lithium following the sell-off of this key commodity used in electric cars.FMC Corp said its lithium business Livent aims to raise $100m to help it become a dominant supplier for battery-powered vehicles that rely on the metal.“We believe we are well positioned to capitalise on the accelerating trend of vehicle electrification,” FMC said in a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Shares of lithium producers have fallen sharply this year. Investors fear there will be an oversupply of the raw material as new mines come into production. Shares in the world’s largest producer Albemarle have dropped 24 per cent year to date, while Chile’s SQM is off by 27 per cent.The price of lithium — a white metal powder used in lithium-ion batteries — also fell for the first time in two years last month, according to London-based Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.Other lithium groups will be keeping a close eye on Livent’s debut. Its IPO comes as two large Chinese producers of lithium — Ganfeng and Tianqi Lithium — are set to raise funds through share sales in Hong Kong.Livent is targeting production of lithium hydroxide, a form of the metal that is set to attract higher demand as carmakers shift to next-generation batteries that offer greater energy density.It aims to produce almost half of the world’s lithium hydroxide for electric car batteries by 2027 from 9.5 per cent last year, according to the prospectus.Lithium hydroxide is the form of lithium used in batteries made by Panasonic for Tesla’s vehicles.“We believe the demand for our compounds will continue to grow as the electrification of transportation accelerates, and as the use of high nickel content cathode materials increases in the next generation of battery technology products,” FMC said in its filing.The company plans to increase lithium hydroxide production from 30,000 tonnes at the end of 2019 to around 55,000 tonnes by the end of 2025.Livent extracts lithium from the Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina. However, the group plans to “pursue additional sources” of lithium through further expansion in Argentina, acquisitions and the development of new resources or long-term supply agreements, it said.FMC’s lithium division had net income of $70.2m in the first half of this year, up from $27.6m in the same period of 2017. Revenues rose by 51 per cent to $210.7m as of June 30 due to higher sales of lithium in China.FMC has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Credit Suisse as bankers for the deal. The company will continue to hold 80 per cent of Livent once it is listed, shares of which will then be distributed to its shareholders. FMC will also offer a $400m revolving credit facility to the company.
4;FMC;FMC Corp;2018-01-18T18:19:34Z;Lithium stocks slide after SQM gets approval to ramp up production;;Lithium stocks were hit hard on Thursday after one of the sector’s biggest producers was given the green light to boost production. On Wednesday, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile, or SQM, said it had resolved a long-running dispute with Chile, striking an agreement to expand production to meet demand from electric cars. Fears that the New-York-listed company, which has a market value of $15bn, could flood the market with fresh supplies have cast a shadow over the sector. Shares in Albemarle dropped 8 per cent to $116, while FMC Corp fell 5 per cent to $89.22. Two years ago they were trading at $50 and $34 respectively. SQM was off 2 per cent at $58.34.“SQM, the global lowest-cost producer, yesterday got the right to increase 4 to 6 times its annual lithium production quota. We expect SQM to aggressively recover market share from 2020 and see downside risk to the lithium price ,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley. “Negative for global lithium equities.”Prices for lithium have jumped by over 200 per cent over the last five years as demand outstripped supply. Those gains and the hype around electric vehicles have driven the share prices of companies like SQM, Albermarle and FMC into the stratosphere. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said they expected SQM to increase production of lithium carbonate equivalent from an expected 63,000 tonnes in 2019 to 163,000 tonnes by 2024.“While SQM's additional volume increases as a result of the license changes announced should not impact the market until 2020, it could impact sentiment in the sector and supports our view that supply options are increasing which should see the market begin to balance by late 2018,” said Deutsche. The sell off in lithium stocks comes Canada’s PotashCorp attempts to sell a 32 per cent stake in SQM.
5;FMC;FMC Corp;2018-01-17T18:37:52Z;Focus on electric cars lights up lithium;Demand for metal used in rechargeable batteries looks healthy but supply is growing;In the aftermath of recent car emission scandals, governments in countries such as France are strongly encouraging carmakers to go electric. Paris wants to banish petrol and diesel cars by 2030.Elsewhere, such as the UK, diesel car demand has slowed. In turn this shift has refocused attention on low or zero emission electric vehicles. Those EVs require batteries, and prices of their key inputs — lithium, cobalt, lead and nickel — have soared.The first two of these have attracted the most interest given their current importance to batteries. Together they make up about half of a battery’s cathode. No surprise that prices for each have trebled in less than three years.Neither it is no surprise that share prices of both lithium and cobalt producers have also rocketed. But while nickel could replace some of the cobalt required over time, as cathode technology evolves, lithium should remain integral to all batteries for some time.And lithium demand looks healthy, compounding at a 14 per cent rate between 2017 and 2022. That’s because sales of rechargeable batteries should treble by 2025 to $59bn, according to Credit Suisse, as buyers take up electrified vehicles, both hybrids and fully electric.You know a bull market has arrived, though, when specialist indices and exchange traded funds appear for lithium. Have a look at what’s inside, though. The Solactive Global Lithium index not only has lithium makers such as US listed Albemarle and FMC Corp, it also contains carmakers Tesla and BYD. More than 40 per cent of index members at best only consume lithium. This index has more than doubled since early 2016. Junior miners such as Australia’s Galaxy Resources have been six baggers.Even as demand builds, supply too is surging. Although Argentina and Chile used to make a large proportion of lithium carbonate, that balance will shift.Australia’s contribution is increasing so rapidly that an excess supply of lithium carbonate is likely for the next couple years at least. “It’s our top short idea,” says Vivienne Lloyd at Macquarie.Should lithium prices finally tumble, expect the lithium miners to head back to ground.alan.livsey@ft.com
6;FMC;FMC Corp;2016-07-26T23:23:28Z;FMC contract underlines rising battery demand for Lithium;Lithium producer FMC wins new contract from major electric carmaker;The lithium market received a boost after FMC said it planned to double its output of battery raw material lithium next year, in a sign the largest producers are increasing supply to meet demand from electric carmakers.The Philadelphia-based chemical company, one of the world’s four largest producers of lithium, said it would accelerate expansion of lithium hydroxide as a result of a “new multiyear supply agreement with a major manufacturer of electric vehicles”.“We partner closely with leading manufacturers of lithium ion batteries and electric vehicles to ensure our production meets their current and future demand,” said Tom Schneberger, vice-president and global business director at FMC Lithium.Prices for lithium hydroxide, a refined type of lithium used by in batteries by carmakers such as Tesla Motors, have risen 38 per cent this year, according to Benchmark Minerals Intelligence. That’s been driven by strong demand in Asia, the centre of global battery production.Demand is expected to remain robust as Tesla completes its battery gigafactory near Reno in Nevada, which will start producing battery cells for its mass market Model 3 for delivery next year. The company currently obtains battery cells from Panasonic in Japan.FMC will produce an additional 4,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide next year, raising the company’s total global capacity to 18,000 tonnes. It did not give details of the electric vehicle manufacturer it struck a deal with.The additional production would be almost enough to supply Tesla’s Gigafactory or roughly 500,000 mass-market electric vehicles, according to Aleksey Yefremov, an analyst at Japanese bank Nomura.“The fact that FMC wants to bring incremental capacity on in the near term confirms a tight market for battery grade lithium,” he said.FMC extracts lithium from the Salar de Hombre Muerto operation in Argentina before it is sent overseas to be further refined into products such as lithium hydroxide.But analysts said FMC would need to expand its supply of lithium carbonate, the raw feedstock that gets converted to hydroxide, in order to double its production. That could come from other raw lithium producers such as Chile’s SQM or Orocobre, according to Robert Baylis, an analyst at consultancy Roskill.Mr. Baylis also expects lithium hydroxide prices to peak in the second half of this year as supply has increased.“The gloss on the lithium industry is therefore going to come off pretty quickly into 2017, although demand growth still remains robust,” he said.
7;FMC;FMC Corp;2016-05-19T18:49:54Z;Oil services groups agree $13bn merger;FMC Technologies of the US is expected to gain tax benefits from tie-up with France’s Technip  ;Two of the world's leading providers of services to the offshore oil industry are merging and selecting the UK as the combined company’s domicile, following the trend of groups in the sector relocating to Britain to benefit from favourable tax treatment.FMC Technologies of the US and Technip of France have agreed a merger of equals to create the world's second-largest listed oil services group by revenues, with a market capitalisation of about $13bn.Oil services companies have been hit hard by the decline in crude prices since mid-2014, as exploration and production groups renegotiate or even cancel contracts with their suppliers in efforts to cut costs. Several oil services groups have pursued consolidation deals to try to better withstand the downturn.The combined company, to be called TechnipFMC, will be dual listed in Paris and New York, but domiciled in the UK, and have operational headquarters in Paris, Houston and London.Executives and advisers of the two companies declined to say whether the merged company would pay less tax as a result of the relocation to the UK. But one person close to the deal said that it would generate tax benefits for FMC, which is incorporated in the US.Other oil services companies including Ensco and Noble Corp, the offshore drilling contractors, have relocated to the UK to benefit from its favourable tax treatment.Doug Pferdehirt, the president of FMC and intended chief executive of TechnipFMC, denied that the deal was being done to minimise either company’s tax bill.“We have not determined what the tax rate of the new company will be — we pay tax wherever we generate revenue,” he told the Financial Times. “Tax was not the major concern here.”He added that the deal was “transformational for the oil and gas industry . . . By bringing these two companies together we can extract cost and improve returns for our customers”.Technip, Europe’s biggest oil and gas services group by market capitalisation, has been trying to do a deal with another company for the past two years to diversify its pipes and oil infrastructure construction business.In 2014, the Paris-based company abandoned a €1.5bn unsolicited takeover offer for CGG, a French seismic surveyor that uncovers and determines the size of hydrocarbons reserves.Since the summer of 2014, shares in FMC have fallen from more than $60 to less than $30.Over the same period Technip’s shares have fallen by almost half, and last year the company issued a profit warning and announced it would cut 6,000 jobs.Technip’s shares closed up 6.3 per cent to €49.30 on Thursday. FMC’s shares were down 3.8 per cent to $27.58 in New York trading on Thursday afternoon.Thierry Pilenko, Technip chief executive who will become executive chairman of the merged group, said: “We have complementary skills, technologies and capabilities which our customers can access on an integrated basis or separately as they prefer.”David Thomas, analyst at Mirabaud Securities, said: “This will allow the new company to offer a solution to clients from the seabed right up to the surface level and beyond. I don’t think there will be many people who doubt the strategic sense of this deal.”Goldman Sachs and Rothschild are financial advisers to Technip. Evercore and Société Générale are advisers to FMC.
8;FMC;FMC Corp;2016-05-19T14:28:25Z;Technip/FMC: tasty;Investors need to know who is in charge of the cooking;Combining the finest ingredients is all very well, but the choice of chef can be just as important. The $13bn all-share combination of two oil service companies, France’s Technip and FMC Technologies of the US, has a nice enough aroma. Making the deal go down smoothly will be a matter of deciding who is in charge.The combination makes good industrial sense. The two know each other, having run a joint venture called Forsys Subsea since June. And they are not direct competitors. Technip specialises in putting together complicated offshore oil and gas projects, only some of which involve its own equipment (mostly flexible underwater pipes). Adding FMC, a specialist in the underwater pressure valves for oil wells should lead to more compelling bids for offshore projects. Management also promise $400m of cost-cutting annually — 3 per cent of combined operating costs. This could prove conservative.As Forsys had already received regulatory approval last year, the deal should not face objections from antitrust authorities similar to those which did for Halliburton’s $35bn bid for Baker Hughes in the US, which was blocked by the Department of Justice last month. A better comparison would be Schlumberger’s $14bn acquisition of Cameron, FMC’s US rival, which closed last month.That combination put Schlumberger firmly in control. Cameron shareholders were left with a tenth of the combined companies. Technip and FMC tout their deal as a merger of equals, and it is — in the narrow sense of each set of shareholders receiving half of the new group. Based on the undisturbed prices, Technip benefits from a small 10 per cent premium, explaining its shares’ rise on the announcement.In terms of profits, it is a different story. FMC will initially contribute less than a third of the combined group’s profits. The fact that its shareholders will receive a 50 per cent stake suggests they are the ones getting the premium, and that FMC, not Technip, is the target. In the merged company’s boardroom, a US chief executive from FMC will answer to a French executive chairman from Technip.That is better than having co-chief executives, but only just. Investors need to know who is in charge of the cooking. Otherwise they could end up with blancmange.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
9;FMC;FMC Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

12;FMC;FMC Corp;2015-12-15T13:52:25Z;Tesla in stand-off over lithium supply;Electric carmaker builds the world’s largest battery plant and needs to secure the raw material;On the edge of the Nevada desert, Tesla, the electric carmaker, is building the world’s largest battery plant.The mile-long, so-called Gigafactory is expected to boost demand for lithium, the raw material used in the batteries that power most electric cars.But the company has yet to announce any lithium supply deals with big producers, leaving it unclear where it will source the lightweight natural material it will need to start producing batteries by 2017 with Panasonic, its partner.The Gigafactory is set to supply batteries for the 500,000 cars Tesla hopes to produce by the end of the decade, as well as to power homes. The company hopes that by supplying its own batteries it can cut its costs per kilowatt-hour by more than 30 per cent, crucial for the mass-market uptake of electric vehicles.But that will require secure, long-term supplies of lithium, more than 70 per cent of which is found in Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Due to growth in demand for electric batteries, the global lithium market is approaching a shortage, with no new supply coming on stream next year, say analysts. At the same time, battery factories being built in China are set to increase demand for lithium.“Raw material availability is probably the biggest challenge facing the Gigafactory outside of the need for basic demand,” says Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consultancy in London. “It is also the only area of the electric vehicle supply chain where Tesla does not have ownership and control.”The company tried to buy Simbol Materials, a California-based lithium start-up, in June 2014 but it has since gone into receivership, said a person familiar with the matter.“The current strategy seems to be no direct investment but leveraging the Tesla name by signing ‘contingent’ contracts at unachievably low prices with junior mining companies who have never produced lithium chemicals,” says Joe Lowry, a market expert and founder of Global Lithium, a consultancy.“The most likely outcome is Tesla will pay high market prices for lithium through at least the end of the decade,” adds Mr Lowry, who formerly worked for FMC Lithium, one of the big producers.So far two companies have announced supply deals with Tesla, and neither is expected to produce substantial amounts of lithium until after 2020. That could leave the company short of the lithium it needs when its factory starts operating — or trying to sign supply agreements when the price of lithium hydroxide is higher.Tesla will need about 24,000 tonnes annually of lithium hydroxide, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, out of a market last year of 50,000 tonnes.Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder, has said the company will seek to use lithium from Nevada, where Albemarle’s Silver Peak mine is the only operation producing the material in the US.The mine produced 870 tonnes when it was owned by Rockwood in 2013 before Albemarle bought the company for $6.2bn last year, according to the latest available data.Analysts say Albemarle of Baton Rouge, FMC Lithium of Philadelphia and SQM of Chile, the big producers of lithium, have not been willing to supply at the prices Tesla has demanded.“Tesla is not the biggest piece of the pie,” one smaller producer says. “It’s the dog that barks that doesn’t bite.”Tesla says none of the announced supply agreements is exclusive and that not all its lithium will come from these suppliers.FMC Lithium says it is in continuous sourcing discussions with many of the leading electric vehicle manufacturers, including Tesla. Albemarle says it cannot discuss any information related to its supply agreements. SQM did not respond to a request for comment.In August, Bacanora Minerals, which is in the preliminary stages of developing the Sonora project, a lithium plant in Mexico, said it had signed a conditional agreement with Tesla to supply lithium hydroxide. That sent Bacanora’s shares up by about a quarter on the day.Last month the Toronto-listed company raised £8.8m through issuing new shares for the project, which is not expected to start its first phase of production until the first half of 2018.In September Mr Musk said on Twitter that the Bacanora deal “is not exclusive and has many contingencies”.The same month, Pure Energy Minerals said it had entered into an agreement with Tesla for the “potential” supply of lithium hydroxide. The Toronto-listed company plans to produce this from the project in Nevada, in the same basin as Albemarle, about three and a half hours’ drive from the Gigafactory.The company said the agreement sets a “predetermined price that is below current market rates and is aligned with Tesla’s goal to continuously reduce the cost of its lithium ion batteries”.As the factory comes into production that is likely to spur other small producers in the US, according to analysts.“You’re going to see a lot more people digging for lithium brine in Nevada,” one producer adds. “For just its closeness to the factory.”
13;FMC;FMC Corp;2015-10-13T20:33:23Z;FMC falls on weaker currency and job cuts;Chemicals company says weaker Brazilian real will cut earnings at its Latin American business;Investors soured on FMC after the US chemicals company lowered its full-year profit forecast citing the devaluation of the Brazilian real and announced job cuts.The company, a $5bn maker of pesticides and chemical sprays used by farmers, said a weaker real would cut earnings at its Latin American business by between $200m and $240m in the second half of the year. A combination of a deepening recession in Brazil, alongside a steady US recovery, has left the real as the worst performing big emerging market currency against the greenback this year. Brazil accounted for 24 per cent of the company’s total revenues last year.“[A] A weak crop protection pricing environment in Brazil is a key additional risk for FMC that could be a source of more downside in coming quarters,” Aleksey Yefremov, an analyst at Nomura, said.The Philadelphia-based company lowered its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to $2.35-$2.45 a share, below its previous forecast for earnings of $3-$3.30 a share. This missed analysts’ estimates for earnings of $3.02 a share.FMC also announced between 800-850 job cuts that would help reduce costs by $140m to $160m a year.“The steps we are announcing today will protect the profitability of the business during this downturn, shrink the capital employed in the region and position FMC to take advantage of a future market recovery,” Pierre Brondeau, chief executive, said.Shares, which have declined nearly 36 per cent this year, fell 3 per cent to $36.35.Shares of US carrier JetBlue Airways fell nearly 8 per cent to $24.75, after analysts at JPMorgan downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “overweight” and lowered their price target by a dollar to $27. “JetBlue shares no longer provide the level of upside potential we once envisioned,” Jamie Baker, an analyst at JPMorgan, said.The New York based company said late on Monday that preliminary passenger revenue per available seat mile, a key industry metric, climbed 1 per cent in September from the previous year.Under Armour shares fell 2 per cent to $101.28 after the company said Brad Dickerson, the company’s chief financial officer and chief operating officer, would leave the company in early 2016 to pursue an opportunity outside of the athletic performance industry. The athletic gear maker will conduct an external search for a CFO.Ryder System was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 after it lowered its full-year earnings forecast, citing a greater than planned number of out-of-service vehicles during the third quarter.The transportation leasing company now sees full-year earnings of $6.17 to $6.29 a share, from its previous guidance for earnings of $6.45 to $6.55 a share. Ryder shares fell more than 9 per cent to $68.63.Disappointing Chinese import data renewed concerns about growth in the world’s second-largest economy and weighed on global stocks on Tuesday, including those in the US.By close of markets, the S&P 500 lost 0.7 per cent to 2,003.69, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 17,081.89.

14;FMC;FMC Corp;2012-01-25T19:14:37Z;Weir widens reach amid boom in fracking;;Weir Group has extended its exposure to the North American market for shale gas and oil yet again through the purchase of Novatech, a Texas-based manufacturer of pump parts.The deal comes as Weir, which holds a 50 per cent market share in the supply of high-pressure pumps used in the North American shale market, seeks to extend its own manufacturing capability in Fort Worth, Texas, and Edmonton, Canada, to deal with a backlog in orders from rig operators of up to six months.Weir is to pay $176m for the family-owned Dallas-based business, and comes two months after the FTSE 100 company deepened its involvement in “ fracking”, or hydraulic fracturing, of shale formations to extract oil and gas by paying $675m for Texas-based wellhead specialist Seaboard Holdings.That deal effectively doubled Weir’s share of the global fracking surface equipment market dominated by North American companies towards 10 per cent. Rivals Cameron and FMC Tech each command a quarter of the $4.5bn market, while GE has a 13 per cent share, according to recent data produced by Spears.The Seaboard deal was similar in scale to its $653m acquisition of SPM Flow Control in 2007, which originally established Weir as a large supplier to upstream oil companies in North America looking to exploit the nascent fracking boom. The process demands high pressure pumping systems and highly abrasive horizontal drilling techniques to extract oil and gas from rock formations.Though small in scale, the Novatech acquisition reflects Weir’s determination to widen its marketing reach and ease supply bottlenecks in order to compete more effectively against rivals struggling to keep pace with demand for new and replacement fracking equipment.Speaking to the Financial Times at the end of last year, Keith Cochrane, Weir’s chief executive, argued the increasing number of fracking projects targeting oil shale deposits could continue to drive demand. “Rig count has continued to grow despite the gas market being flat all year,” he said. “There are 3,500 wells that are drilled but not fracked – we have that degree of backlog.”While major oil service companies such as Halliburton prefer to make their own pumps and operate a vertically integrated business model, Weir is keen to target its growing portfolio of pumps and valves directly to rig operators and oil services customers such as Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, which are more likely to outsource supplies.However, as the sector continues to expand, clouds are appearing on the horizon.Earlier this week one Weir customer, Chesapeake Energy, said it was planning an 8 per cent cut in gas production and a 67 per cent cut in the number of rigs drilling gas wells. While on Wednesday, ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil and gas group by market capitalisation, said it also planned to cut its North American gas production this year as it shifts to more profitable oil reserves. The moves are in response to US natural gas prices hitting a decade low.Mr Cochrane conceded that “at some point original equipment will get into balance or come off a bit as the market gets into equilibrium, as demand and supply reach a balance”.However, Weir is already preparing for when fracking capacity hits a new plateau. Mr Cochrane said the rapid expansion of demand for equipment, which is subject to extremes of pressure and abrasion, has created a lucrative aftermarket for spares, which Weir can exploit.“Installed horsepower [rig output] may be peaking – but as expansion falls, replacement continues to rise,” he said.Andrew Carter, London-based analyst at RBC, said that capacity additions being undertaken by Weir and some of its competitors “are about right”, and could bring supply and demand close to balance by the end of 2012.Mr Carter also calculated that capacity expansion at Weir plants in Texas and Canada announced last year could add up to $400m to revenue capacity.Remarks from Aubrey McClendon, Chesapeake’s chief executive, that US natural gas was not “oversupplied” but “under-demanded” find an echo in Mr Cochrane’s view that the fundamental imperative of energy security will underpin markets for both shale gas and oilfields being developed in North America.“A number of people are looking at petrochemical plant extensions in the US,” he said, while the “dash to gas” in North America could provide a cleaner fuel source for the US’s ageing portfolio of power plants.Mr Cochrane also argued that beyond the US, moves to exploit shale reserves in Europe, Asia and Latin America could be exploited by a company that has a worldwide manufacturing footprint.That point was backed on Wednesday by Mr Carter, who pointed to recent observations by Schlumberger that unconventional drilling activity is picking up more quickly than it had expected, particularly in Argentina, China and Poland, but also the Middle East.……………………………………………………………..Obama backs development of natural gasIf fears over the impact of softening gas prices on suppliers of fracking equipment has weighed on Weir Group’s share price this month, remarks from President Obama in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night proved particularly welcome.In spite of environmental controversy surrounding the rapid expansion of hydraulic fracking, the president appeared to champion it as a key plank of US energy policy capable of creating 600,000 new jobs in a period of high unemployment.“We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years, and my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy,” he said.Weir, the FTSE 100’s top gainer in 2010, strongly outperformed the blue-chip index last year in large part because of its exposure to fracking, but the stock has slipped from £21.58 to a low of £18.66 on Monday on signs of an end to the fracking boom and collapse in US gas prices.But Andrew Carter of RBC backed Weir’s US latest acquisition: “If management were as concerned by US natural gas prices as some market participants are, we do not think this deal would have happened.”Malcolm Graham-Wood, oil industry analyst at VSA Capital, agreed. “After the last few days when investors have been worried about the company’s exposure to the shale gas industry, this acquisition shows that the company are happy with the sector,” he said.
15;FMC;FMC Corp;2011-11-03T09:47:46Z;Individuals: leading lights;Profiles of 10 legal innovators who shone brightly in this year’s FT report;Scott Barshay, Partner, Cravath, Swaine & MooreScott Barshay took a leading role in defending a hostile takeover bid for Barnes & Noble, the book retailer, and clients credit him with developing and leading an innovative defence strategy that included a poison pill, litigation and a highly contentious proxy fight.While every hostile takeover defence is unique, few since the heyday of hostile mergers and acquisitions in the 1980s have involved the kind of heated litigation used with Barnes & Noble.Mr Barshay says that it is critical not to be afraid of departing from convention. “You have to have the courage of your convictions that you are going to be successful,” he says. At the same time, an ability to draw on a wide range of views, advice and experience have been invaluable tools. Clients point to Mr Barshay’s depth of understanding, combined with a highly creative and strategic approach.Mr Barshay also advised United Airlines on its $7bn merger with fellow US carrier Continental Airlines, and has played a leading role in some of the past year’s highest profile deals, including Hertz Global’s offer to acquire Dollar Thrifty in the rental car market, and the pending merger of Deutsche Börse, the European exchange, with NYSE Euronext.Jeffrey Carr, Senior vice-president and general counsel, FMC TechnologiesJeffrey Carr is a vocal advocate for change in the legal industry. Reforming delivery of legal services at FMC Technologies, the provider of technology for oil and gas fields, and influencing change across the industry has become almost a hobby. In demonstration of his willingness to embrace new technologies, Mr Carr sent a request to law firms via Twitter, inviting them to describe what makes them different in 140 characters or less.In his time at FMC, Mr Carr has designed and implemented “Aces”, an engagement model for external law firms, and carried out a comprehensive overhaul of the company legal department’s management models and systems. A mantra, which applies to both internal staff and external counsel, centres on performance-based pay, risk-sharing and rigorous and formal evaluation.Mr Carr has pioneered new billing arrangements, which include a mixture of risk-sharing, fixed fees, budgets with implications and ­expectation around efficiency. The arrangements have improved quality and reduced outside legal spending.For Mr Carr, his greatest achievement is developing a legal team that has transformed the way legal services are provided in the company. He describes it as “a high-performance and sustainable team and a proud legacy”. A hive of innovation, his team is rolling out a wiki to share legal advice internally, a new compliance programme and developing M&A process maps.Richard (Rick) Climan, Partner, Dewey & LeBoeufRick Climan has negotiated multibillion-dollar mergers and acquisitions but also devotes a substantial amount of time to teaching law students and fledgling lawyers the intricacies of his craft. His success as an educator is based in large measure on his use of innovative techniques, which include the use of mock negotiations.His unique monthly M&A forums in Silicon Valley have earned a wide and loyal following, with some audience members attending them for well over a decade and others flying in from Los Angeles and even New York to attend.The forums are geared towards educating the legal and business communities on the cutting-edge M&A issues affecting technology companies. Participants include senior executives and in-house counsel at tech companies, tech-focused investment bankers, law professors and, increasingly, lawyers from rival firms.When asked whether it is in his firm’s interest to pass his expertise to competitors, Mr Climan answers: “Most top-tier M&A professionals would say they much prefer to be opposite a seasoned lawyer than a naive one. It streamlines the process. I actually think that many lawyers, who are risk-averse by nature, are afraid of innovation. If they break from tradition they may be singled out for ridicule, or worse if the strategy fails.”Jay Goffman, Partner, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & FlomMost of Jay Goffman’s reorganisations are done through quick, cost-efficient, out-of-court pre-packed restructurings. He was a pioneer in the method and continues to be a leader in the field. He has led many landmark pre-packs.In representing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 2010, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom orchestrated the largest pre-pack to be confirmed in less than 30 days, and thwarted a takeover attempt by Carl Icahn, the activist-investor. By quickly developing a plan that served the best interests of more than 350 lenders, Mr Goffman’s team restructured $5bn of debt. Once on the verge of bankruptcy or a forced merger, MGM has now recapitalised its worldwide business and positioned itself to continue making films.Working with fellow partner Rick Madden to help the deeply indebted Centro Properties Group avoid liquidation, Mr Goffman also exported US innovations to Australia, using his firm’s techniques to solve the riddles of a jurisdiction that dissuades faltering companies from restructuring.On the subject of fostering innovation within firms, Mr Goffman says: “Most lawyers don’t naturally think in a creative manner. They often become lawyers because they like structure. You have to convince people they are not going to get shot if they think out of the box and give them the freedom to think about the right solution.”Robert Giuffra, Partner, Sullivan & CromwellRobert Giuffra has been at the forefront of securities litigation arising from the financial crisis. He played a pivotal role bringing together a coalition of 11 financial institutions, including Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and UBS, to challenge the multibillion-dollar ­restructuring plan of MBIA Insurance.Following the Morrison versus National ­Australia Bank case, which centred on whether US courts could hear cases brought by foreign ­investors against companies whose shares were not listed on American exchanges, Mr Giuffra ­advised on two of the largest cases to apply the decision, acting for Porsche, the carmaker, and UBS, the Swiss bank. He was also counsel to UBS in multiple litigations that resulted from the collapse of Enron, the energy group, securing the dismissal of hundreds of millions in damages relating to Enron notes and securities.Mr Giuffra says: “I try to think about first principles rather than looking at what precedents exist.” He credits his success to hours spent brainstorming arguments with his associates and partners, and the long hours put in before trial. His clients describe him as intelligent, creative and a “master chess player” in the court. His political experience and understanding of the landscape are also highly valued.Markian Melnyk, Founder and president, Atlantic Grid Development (formerly a partner at Dewey & LeBoeuf)Atlantic Grid Development’s core project, the Atlantic Wind Connection, is an offshore high-­voltage transmission backbone designed to serve efficiently mid-Atlantic region offshore wind energy parks while also making the ­congested land-based transmission grid more ­reliable and efficient.The system’s backbone cable will run in shallow trenches on the seabed in federal waters 15-20 miles offshore, where the wind is strong but the towers would barely be visible. When completed, the project will generate enough to power approximately 1.9m households.Mr Melnyk says: “The idea came about as a ­result of my needing to change the focus of my legal practice and deciding there was a lot of ­potential in developing offshore renewable power as a practice area. So I looked at how you would develop a project in US waters and saw there was a whole transmission angle to it, then I saw that there was an opportunity to actually do it.”The $5bn Atlantic Wind Connection project exemplifies the fact that innovation in the energy sector is not always born in the laboratory. It is also an example of how legal training and experience can be applied to creating change.Mr Melnyk says: “Sometimes you think it’s only the engineers who can make it better and drive down costs, but here there were policy ­opportunities to make it better.”Stephen Poor, Chairman and managing partner, Seyfarth ShawStephen Poor has been chairman and managing partner of Seyfarth Shaw since 2001, and has led the firm to adopt the quality and efficiency methodologies of the Six Sigma management system.Rather than trying to steamroll the methodology across the firm – “or boil the ocean”, as Mr Poor puts it – the firm began by instigating Six Sigma department by department. It has now been woven into every aspect of the firm’s operations. “It has become the prism through which we look at everything,” Mr Poor says.Seyfarth’s client service model focuses on creating “value-based” relationships that incorporate Six Sigma techniques, process improvement strategies, alternative fee approaches and technology. Clients say the firm stands out for an enthusiasm for new and innovative ways of working.Mr Poor has also led the implementation of a full competency-based talent system, which introduces performance-based remuneration and career progressions for the firm’s attorneys. The firm believes clients gain greater value from a system that better aligns attorney skills and rates with client business needs.This year, Seyfarth launched a labour and employment fellows programme, providing second-year law school students an opportunity to develop hands-on skills in employment law.Charles (Rick) Rule, Partner, Cadwalader, Wickersham & TaftRick Rule worked in construction at the age of 14 to finance a career in creative writing, but his inherited love of a healthy argument led him to the University of Chicago law school. Becoming part of the Chicago school of antitrust theory allowed him to examine the philosophical, social and economic impact of the subject, and he went on to become acting director of the antitrust division at the US Department of Justice at only 29.Now head of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft’s antitrust practice, Mr Rule enjoys the intellectual challenge of working at an intersection of antitrust issues and innovation. He has served as adviser to regulatory bodies and corporate clients including Microsoft, the software group.His team is advising the company on antitrust matters related to its $8.5bn acquisition of Skype, the internet telephony provider. The team also represented Microsoft as a third ­party in the DoJ’s investigation of Google’s ­ proposed acquisition of ITA Software, the provider of airfare software used by search engines and travel sites.Mr Rule says: “People who are innately interested or are verging on being frustrated business people are the best lawyers. The way you institutionalise innovation is by not institutionalising it. We find people who have the passion and curiosity, the intellectual capability. Let them deal with clients early on and learn by doing, and then their strengths come out.”Amy Schulman, Executive vice-president and general counsel, PfizerSince setting up the Pfizer Legal Alliance, a flat-fee structure for 19 of the pharmaceutical company’s law firms, Amy Schulman has gone on to expand her remit. In a still unusual move for corporate counsel, she is now also the business head of Pfizer’s nutrition division, which had ­annual revenues of $1.867bn in 2010. This is no small leap for a lawyer who, up until 2008, was working as a partner in private practice for DLA Piper, the international law firm.Asked how she manages to combine a business role with heading Pfizer’s legal function, Ms Schulman says: “It’s like having two kids. That balancing act is never evenly weighted.”Once a teacher – she taught philosophy and English – encouraging young professionals is a theme in Ms Schulman’s career. She is one of a handful of general counsel who recruit law graduates directly, thereby side-stepping the law firm training to create a junior associate programme that is more tailored to the needs of business.She feels most proud of her work in inculcating young professionals with the zeal to practise law and work for clients. Her drive to better the profession is expressed in all her innovations from the alliance to raising the profile of Pfizer’s lawyers in the business.Richard Truesdell, Partner, Davis Polk & WardwellRichard Truesdell is co-head of Davis Polk & Wardwell’s global capital markets group, and represents clients in US and international capital markets transactions and advises on corporate governance and securities market regulation. His innovative work in the past year has included the initial public offering of Cobalt International Energy.Cobalt faced a substantial obstacle to accessing the public markets in order to expand its exploration and drilling operations. The company’s assets consisted solely of resources or potential reserves, as opposed to actual reserves. The US Securities and Exchange Commission prohibits exploration companies from disclosing these on the grounds that they are too speculative for potential investors.Armed with experience of a similar IPO for OGX in Brazil, where regulations were less prohibitive, Mr Truesdell came up with a way to give potential investors a well-informed view of the company’s prospects without falling foul of the regulators. It focused on the geophysical characteristics of Cobalt’s prospects and the basins in which they were located, rather than the prohibited summary numbers of resource barrels. He says that breadth of experience is crucial to innovation. “Tight focus can make you very efficient but kills creativity,” he says. “Then you must have the determination to see that through.”
16;FMC;FMC Corp;2011-07-26T21:18:29Z;Companies postpone decisions amid deadlock;;US companies are postponing business decisions and confronting doubts over where to hold their cash due to the deadlock over the debt ceiling, according to corporate treasurers and consultants.With the debt deadline less than a week away, companies are focusing on the possible implications for activities ranging from mergers and acquisitions to their day-to-day investments in US Treasury bonds.Craig Martin, head of the treasury practice at the Association for Financial Professionals, said: “They’re saying: ‘With this uncertainty, I’m not going to do anything now’. Maybe they had capital expenditure plans, plans to hire, they were looking at acquisitions …. Now they’re going to sit on their hands.”If the US fails to raise its debt ceiling, potentially triggering a default and a downgrade by credit rating agencies, heightened perceptions of risk could disrupt the liquidity operations through which treasurers manage corporate cash as well as companies’ ability to raise finance.Jeff Immelt, head of General Electric, said of the issue earlier this month: “It is just kind of needless volatility at a point in time when we don’t need that volatility.” But he said GE would not be affected and warned that small companies were the most vulnerable.Company executives are still grappling with a lot of unanswered questions about the real impact of the impasse, said Peter Frank, a director in corporate treasury solutions at PwC.“Some say we’ll look back on this and it’ll be like Y2K. A fuss over nothing,” he said. “Others say it’ll be a cataclysmic event. Lehman Brothers-plus. Most people are in the middle of the spectrum.”Thomas Deas, chairman of the National Association of Corporate Treasurers, said: “We’re getting increasing questions [from members] as we go each day without a resolution. The level of interest is rising exponentially.”Many companies have built up piles of cash as a defence against systemic disruptions. “We’re making doubly sure, as we learnt in the financial crisis of 2008, that liquidity is everything,” said Mr Deas, who is also vice-president and treasurer of FMC Corp, a chemical producer.But in spite of lessons learnt in 2008, others said the damaging effects of a default would be inescapable.Jeff Wallace, managing partner at Greenwich Treasury Advisors, said corporate treasurers were paralysed “like a deer in the headlights” having woken up late to the potential implications.A downgrade of US treasuries from triple A would have a knock-on effect on other places they could invest their cash, including money market funds, whose managers are concerned clients could start to withdraw their money.“You look at where it’s safe to put your short-term money and … where do you go?” said Mr Wallace.A survey of 305 members by the Association for Financial Professionals (AFP) last week revealed that 24 per cent of companies would liquidate some or all of their US Treasuries if the debt limit was not raised.Twenty eight per cent said they would not buy more Treasuries but would maintain their current holdings, while 48 per cent said they would continue to manage their short-term investment portfolios unchanged.In the AFP survey, a slim majority of executives – 52 per cent – said they expected that a failure to raise the federal debt limit would have a negative impact on their access to capital.Some banks would also be vulnerable to credit rating downgrades, which would signal a jump in the risks of dealing with them.Referring again to the financial crisis, when some banks failed to provide funding promised to companies, Mr Deas said that at FMC: “We have a syndicate of 20 banks who provide committed credit and we are working to make sure that is well diversified.”
17;FMC;FMC Corp;2011-05-25T19:16:49Z;US derivative regulators claim laws will hand trade to Europe;;US futures regulators warned of splits in derivatives rules between the US and Europe and told lawmakers that budgetary restraints would leave them unable to enforce new laws.Derivatives are one of a handful of key regulatory reforms where there is agreement on the direction but differences on the detail between the world’s biggest financial markets.The G20 agreed in 2009 that by the end of 2012 over-the-counter trading of standardised derivatives should use clearing houses to contain risk and, “where appropriate”, push bilateral trading deals to more transparent trading platforms.But Jill Sommers, a Republican-appointed commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, told a congressional hearing that there were “important substantive differences between the US and other jurisdictions … [that] may harm the competitiveness of US business”.She pointed to the fact that Europe’s rules are months behind the US, that the European Union might exempt pension funds from a requirement that OTC derivatives transactions should be made through a clearing house, and that the EU was considering a less cumbersome standard for new trading platforms.However, Ms Sommers added that the regulators were working well together, consulting on a daily basis to iron out differences.Stephen O’Connor, chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and a Morgan Stanley executive, told the House agriculture committee hearing that the extraterritorial reach of US rules would push business to overseas banks.In particular, the prospect of Washington’s rules forcing foreign subsidiaries of US banks to demand collateral from non-US counterparts would hurt their competitiveness. “Foreign clients of the US bank might migrate to the overseas banks,” he said.Thomas Deas, treasurer at FMC Corporation, the chemicals group, said Singapore officials were “making a vigorous effort to attract treasury centres from multinational corporations through targeted incentives and a predictable regulatory framework”.Some officials and Democratic lawmakers say the differences are exaggerated by the industry, which is playing jurisdictions against each other in a bid for laxer rules. House Republicans have drafted legislation to delay US derivatives rules until the end of 2012 but the bill will not be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate, according to aides.The parties are also squabbling about regulators’ budget requests. Republicans are blocking a large increase for the CFTC, which it requested to fulfil its new responsibilities for policing derivatives markets. Bart Chilton, a Democrat-appointed commissioner, warned that the agency would be neutered as it attempted to implement the new rules. “We could write the rules but we would be a hollow shell – we wouldn’t be able to actually enforce them,” he said.
18;FMC;FMC Corp;2010-07-21T01:42:23Z;EU fines six groups in animal feed cartel;;Six companies involved in a cartel that ran for more than three decades in the animal feed industry have been fined more than €175m ($226m) by Europe’s top competition watchdog.However, five of the companies either blew a whistle on the price-fixing arrangements or decided to settle with competition officials at the European Commission, leaving only one company, France’s Timab Industries, to reject the settlement terms.The case is the first “hybrid” result since the commission introduced its new and relatively rarely used procedure for settling cartel investigations, and may be scrutinised closely by lawyers.The watchdog first learnt about the cartel, which involved manufacturers of animal feed phosphates, in 2003 when Finland’s Kemira blew the whistle. Officials established that the cartel ran from as early as March 1969 until February 2004, although not all the companies were involved throughout that period.The cartel involved the allocation of market shares and sales quotas, as well as co-ordination of sales conditions and prices when necessary.Kemira was granted complete immunity from fines because of its role in bringing the cartel to light. Tessenderlo Chemie and Quimitecnica, together with related companies, also benefited from fine reductions of 50 per cent and 25 per cent respectively because of their co-operation and a further 10 per cent under the settlement procedures.They will have to pay €85.7m and €2.8m respectively.Ercros and FMC, together with their related companies, will get only the 10 per cent reduction under the settlement process, and will pay €14.8m and €14.4m.Timab will get a 5 per cent reduction for co-operation, and was fined €59.8m.Two companies argued that economic conditions meant that they were unable to pay the fines. The commission accepted these arguments in only one case and cut the fine by 70 per cent. It did not identify the company.
