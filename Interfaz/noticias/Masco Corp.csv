0;MAS;Masco Corp;2012-02-14T22:34:49Z;Masco losses pull US homebuilders lower;;hares in Masco Corp plunged 12.1 per cent to $11.63 after the home improvement retailer reported a larger fourth-quarter loss than expected.Masco shares have rallied strongly in recent months amid increasing optimism about the construction sector, which tends to drive traffic to Masco stores, and the stock remains up 10 per cent for the year.But analysts were concerned by weak plumbing sales and the sell-off spread to homebuilders, whose share prices have been tightly correlated with Masco in 2012.Lennar Corp fell 0.7 per cent to $23.80 and DR Horton was off 1.2 per cent to $14.56.“Certain … projections suggest that [Masco] is not expecting a material US demand recovery in 2012,” Peter Lisnic at RW Baird told clients.Elsewhere, stocks retreated in stages as the trading day was punctuated by soft January retail sales data and the postponement of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers.The S&P 500 fell more than 10 points, or almost 1 per cent, over the course of the day, but rebounded strongly in the final 30 minutes of trading to end off just 0.1 per cent at 1,350.5.“Any and all sell-offs continue to find aggressive buying late in the day, which is a positive sign for US equities,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers investment research. “US investors do not seem to be reacting as strongly to eurozone news as before.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite index both reversed losses fully, to end the day fractionally in positive territory at 12,878.28 and 2,931.93 respectively.Apple shares hit record highs after breaching $500 for the first time on Monday. Shares climbed 1.4 per cent to $509.46 yesterday as investors brushed off attempts by a Taiwanese company to prevent the export of iPads from China as a trademark tussle rumbled on.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was hit hard as investors absorbed banks’ submissions on the proposed Volcker rule on proprietary trading.Bank of America fell 3.3 per cent to $7.98 after Citigroup analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, arguing that “earnings headwinds” would check a rally, which has seen BofA shares climb more than 40 per cent this year.Morgan Stanley fell 2.5 per cent to $19.05 and Citigroup was off 2.4 per cent to $32.08.However, not all analysts expect Volcker concerns to weigh on bank stocks.Insurer Fidelity National bucked the trend of falling financials, climbing 7 per cent to $31.04, for the best performance in the S&P 500.The company reported strong fourth-quarter earnings but also raised its quarterly dividend by 17 per cent to $0.14 per share.First Solar fell 6 per cent to $39.21 on reports that solar panel installations in Germany, a big global market, will be far lower than previously expected in the first four months of the year.Goodyear Tire fell 5.2 per cent to $13.25 after fourth-quarter revenues missed analyst expectations.Shares in Hospira climbed 6.1 per cent to $36.30 with investors apparently relieved that fourth-quarter profit only fell 15 per cent year-on-year.Shares in Gap rose 2.9 per cent to $22.34 as Citigroup analysts recommended clients buy the stock, pointing out the company had substantial cash on hand for stock buy-backs if it wanted to support its share price.Netflix shares climbed 4 per cent to $123.07 as filings showed that Jana Partners, a hedge fund, took a $45m stake in the video streaming and DVD delivery company in the final quarter of 2011.Shares in Zynga, the developer of online games such as FarmVille, climbed 7 per cent to $14.35, a new high, ahead of its first quarterly earnings report, which came after the close of trading.The company reported more than $300m in fourth-quarter revenue, a jump of almost 60 per cent from the previous year, although stock distributions to employee meant the company was lossmaking.Shares retreated by a few cents after hours, but are still up around 50 per cent so far this year.Shares in Michael Kors jumped 27.5 per cent to $42.85 after the luxury-goods maker reported same store sales in North American and European stores climbed by more than a third in its fiscal third quarter. Shares have now more than doubled in price since an initial public offering just two months ago.
1;MAS;Masco Corp;2012-01-12T17:15:58Z;Urban shares plunge on chief’s departure;Textron jumps on news of possible strategic review;Investors in Urban Outfitters reacted with dismay to the resignation of Glen Senk as chief executive.The shares fell 15 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday, when the company announced Mr Senk would, after four years in the job, be replaced by 64-year-old Richard Hayne.The fall continued when the market opened yesterday, with the stock closing 18.6 per cent lower at $24.26.Analyst reaction was almost universally negative. Jeff Black at Citigroup cut his target price for the stock from $34 to $20, removing Urban from his “top picks” list and recommending clients sell shares, while cutting his 2012 earnings forecast to $1.50 a share.Erika Maschmeyer at RW Baird downgraded the stock to a “hold” equivalent from a “buy” equivalent, while Paul Lejuez at Nomura, worried for the retailer’s turnround prospects, told clients: “If Glen can’t do it, we wonder who can?”Elsewhere, US stocks were generally flat. The S&P 500 recovered from early weakness to close up a fraction at 1,292.48.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,49.45, as Coca-Cola fell 1.9 per cent to $68.06. Kaumil Gajrawala at UBS removed his “buy” recommendation, pointing out Coca-Cola shares have had a negative correlation of 0.93 with dollar strength for the past three years.“Currency, which had been in [Coca-Cola’s] favour, unnaturally increased operating margins [in 2011 but] goes against them in 2012,” Mr Gajrawala wrote to clients.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index bucked the trend of larger indices, advancing 0.3 per cent to 2,710.76, on a surge in solar energy stocks.First Solar was up 7.8 per cent to $41.80 and Yingli Green Energy rose 20.4 per cent to $4.96, after China said it planned to double solar electricity generation capacity to 6 gigawatts in 2012.Gas-heavy energy exploration and production companies sold off as the price of natural gas fell 5 per cent to a 28-month low of $2.78 per million British thermal units.Cabot Oil & Gas led fallers, off 11.2 per cent to $69.62, SouthWestern Energy fell 8 per cent to $29.92 as RW Baird analysts downgraded the stock to “neutral”, and Range Resources fell 6.3 per cent to $54.36.Nymex natural gas futures have fallen by a third in the past year, as higher production from US shale formations has lifted supply, and mild temperatures hurt demand.Supermarket operator Supervalu tumbled 12.5 per cent to $7.34 as the supermarket retailer recorded a loss of $750m for its third fiscal quarter. Analysts had been expecting a profit of a similar magnitude, according to Bloomberg data.The company’s margins held steady, and Supervalu said that once one-off costs associated with store closures and employee severance payments were factored out, the business had been profitable.Lennar rose 7.2 per cent to $22.25, as the first US homebuilder to report fourth-quarter results declared earnings of $30.3m, only $1.7m down on the same period in 2010.Factoring in house price moves, the company’s margin on home sales improved to 19.4 per cent, suggesting some health in the property market.But Lennar also reported mark-to-market losses of $7.6m related to distressed property purchases by its Rialto arm. That was a big swing from mark-to-market gains of $4.7m on Rialto investments in the fourth quarter of 2010. That means, if the company were to sell its distressed assets now, it would incur a substantial loss.But other homebuilders rallied on the result with PulteGroup up 4.9 per cent to $7.70 and DR Horton up 4.8 per cent to $14.13, while home improvement retailer Masco Corp climbed 4.6 per cent to $11.99.Aircraft maker and defence contractor Textron advanced 5.7 per cent to $21.32 on reports that the company was considering a strategic review that could see it dispose of assets.Large bank stocks continued to rally ahead of financials’ quarterly results season, which JPMorgan kicks off tomorrow. Bank of America climbed 3.6 per cent to $6.87 and Citigroup was up 4.3 per cent at $31.27, both at two-month highs.Money manager Franklin Resources fell 5 per cent to $96.67 after the company surprised analysts by reporting that equity assets under management fell $4bn during December to $270.2bn.Hostess Brands, the baker of Twinkies and Wonder bread, filed for bankruptcy for the second time in six years, blaming pension and healthcare obligations.
2;MAS;Masco Corp;2011-12-29T22:14:37Z;US homebuilders surge as pending home sales rise;;Shares in homebuilders surged on Thursday as a measure of pending home sales reached its highest level in 19 months.PulteGroup climbed 6.1 per cent to $6.31, DR Horton close up 4.4 per cent to $12.74 and Lennar Corporation rose 4.6 per cent to $19.86,Building supplier Masco Corp also rose 8.4 per cent to $10.70 for the best performance in the S&P 500.The rise in the National Association of Realtors pending home sales index, which is based on contract signings was the second data boost for homebuilders this month, after construction starts hit their highest level in a year in November. Lennar, DR Horton and PulteGroup are all now up more than 40 per cent in the quarter to date.Elsewhere Wall Street brushed off a rise in US jobless claims to record solid gains on as financial stocks bounced off a difficult previous session.The S&P 500 climbed 1.1 per cent to 1,263.02, moving back into positive territory for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 1.1 per cent to 12,287.04 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.9 per cent to 2,613.74.Although new jobless claims ticked up 15,000 in the week ending December 24, but Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said that should not hold back US markets:“[The rise] is marginally more than was predicted but at 381,000 [claims] remain comfortably below that 400,000 line in the sand that points to steady job creation,” he wrote to clients.The financial sector of the S&P 500 climbed 1.6 per cent, outperforming all other sectors.Bank of America climbed 3.3 per cent to $5.46 and JPMorgan Chase was up 2.4 per cent to $33.42, although bank stocks were recovering from a poor day on Wednesday, when they had significantly underperformed the market.Yahoo climbed 2.2 per cent to $16.13 on reports that Alibaba, a potential suitor for the internet portal company, had hired lobbyists, raising speculation of more bidding activity.Shares in Mosaic, a fertiliser maker, fell fractionally to $50.28, after the company said it will cut output by as much as 250,000 metric tonnes through the first quarter of 2012 because of low prices for phosphate products.Shares in Amazon were also down a few cents to $173.86, even though the company reported it sold a record number of Kindle devices, running into the “millions”, over the holiday period.Investors seemed focused on a negative research note from Goldman Sachs which reported that Christmas shopping data released by comScore, a digital research company, implied that Amazon’s 2011 sales will come in at $17.87bn. That would be slightly below analyst expectations of $18.19bn.“For [Amazon] to materially appreciate in the near term would require the company to beat and raise on the bottom line over the next few quarters,” Heather Bellini wrote to Goldman clients. “Given our lower operating forecasts for 2012, we see this scenario as unlikely.”Amazon is set to end the year off 4 per cent, with investors showing signs of nerves over the strategy of Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, to drive sales by heavy investment in new products.With one day of trading left in 2011, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 is set to end the year up 5 per cent, the best performance apart from defensive utility and consumer staple stocks. That has been driven by robust US consumer spending, even as worries about global growth have resurfaced, but analysts are questioning whether the outperformance can continue.The holiday season has been characterised by heavy discounting and high volumes of internet purchases by price-conscious shoppers. The latest quarterly results season saw several star retail stocks report falling or stalling margins.Consumer electronics chain Best Buy fell 15.5 per cent on December 13, after profits fell, despite an increase in revenue, because of lower margins. And on December 22 Bed, Bath and Beyond, tumbled 6.3 per cent in a rising market, as it broke a long run of margin growth.“This lower gross margin, we believe, will be a trend across retail as the cost of sales increases, and the internet, a lower margin sales channel, continues to hurt margins,” said David Strasser, retail analyst at Janney.Analysts also question whether retail spending can continue to outpace economic growth. The personal savings rate fell steadily over the year to 3.3 per cent in September, the lowest level since 2007, suggesting consumers may be cutting back on savings to fund spending.The holiday season has also seen signs of cracks in the emerging market-driven growth story that has seen luxury retailers trade at a premium this year. Tiffany was heavily penalised by investors at the end of November when it forecast “weakness” in sales in western European and north-eastern US.“No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high end consumer spending.”
3;MAS;Masco Corp;2011-12-20T22:25:22Z;US data boost homebuilding stocks;;Homebuilders led a strong rally in US stocks as the S&P 500 enjoyed its best day so far in December.PulteGroup rose 10.4 per cent to $6.17, DR Horton was gaining 5.7 per cent to $12.43 and Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $19.68, as construction starts hit their highest level in a year in November.Home improvement retailers were boosted, with Masco rising 8.9 per cent to $9.82 and Home Depot adding 4.3 per cent to $41.93.Some analysts were cautious, however, noting that much of the rise was due to building works starting on apartment blocks, which hit a three-year high.“The report doesn’t signal any turn in fortunes for the lion’s share of the market – single family homes,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “Activity there rose by just 10,000 units to a 447,000 annualised pace and the highest in only five months.”Other analysts warned that Tuesday’s gains could be reversed by a change in sentiment, noting the high volatility of homebuilder stocks. All three large US homebuilders had fallen on Monday, in spite of a confidence survey rising to its highest level of the year.Broader markets bounced with the S&P 500 adding 3 per cent to 1,241.30 after its best day of the month. However, the benchmark US index remains in negative territory for December, traditionally one of its strongest months.The financial sector of the S&P 500 recovered ground after Monday’s sell-off. Bank of America climbed back above $5, a level that it had breached on Monday for the first time since 2009. BofA shares closed up 3.7 per cent to $5.17.Morgan Stanley climbed 4.5 per cent to $14.80 and Citigroup was up 4.6 per cent at $25.95.Jefferies surged 22.9 per cent to $14.50, its highest close since October, as the investment bank revealed quarterly earnings that were not as bad as expected.Profit fell to $63m, 23 per cent lower than last year, but many analysts had expected worse. The bank faced intense scrutiny of its exposure to eurozone sovereign bonds in November, but fees from investment advisory services rose year on year.“The results are better than expected but the share price reaction is overdone,” said Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga Securities.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.9 per cent to 12,103.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.2 per cent to 2,603.73.AT&T lagged behind the market, but was still up 1.3 per cent to $29.01, despite calling time on its attempt to acquire T Mobile USA.That was a fillip for its equipment suppliers. Juniper Networks climbed 8.9 per cent to $19.74 and F5 Networks was up 6.7 per cent to $109.39.“We believe this development is a short-term positive for equipment vendors,” said George Notter at Jefferies. “We believe that AT&T in recent months had significantly dialled back fourth-quarter spending in order to apply leverage in its fight with regulators.”Rival network Sprint Nextel also took cheer, closing up 9.3 per cent to $2.36.BlackBerry handset manufacturer Research In Motion suffered another day of heavy selling.Shares fell 2.9 per cent to $12.52, the latest losses apparently triggered by reports that as many as 5,000 of its PlayBook tablets had been stolen from a freight truck.CVS Caremark rose 8.9 per cent to $39.80. The pharmacy chain boosted its quarterly dividend to 16.25 cents a share from 12.5 cents a share.Eastman Chemical jumped 8.1 per cent to $38.70 after announcing it had broken ground on a new facility to produce acetate in China.Red Hat fell 8.9 per cent to $41.95 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. The open-source software company reported fiscal third-quarter billings that missed analysts’ estimates.Billings, a predictor of revenue, increased 23 per cent from a year earlier in the three months to the end of November.Cruise ship operator Carnival Corporation was one of the other five S&P 500 stocks to fall. Shares close down 0.2 per cent to $31.93 after Carnival lowered guidance for 2012 earnings.Zynga, the online social game developer, enjoyed its first day of gains since a $10bn IPO last week.Its shares were up 2.1 per cent to $9.24, still 76 cents below their debut price.In after-hours trading Oracle shares tumbled 10 per cent to $26.26, after the software reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. That knocked the S&P 500 futures by 5 points suggesting the benchmark index may open lower on Wednesday.
4;MAS;Masco Corp;2011-09-06T18:06:33Z;US banks lead Wall Street lower;;US bank stocks fell sharply on Tuesday – following the lead of their European counterparts 24 hours earlier – as renewed fears about eurozone sovereign debt hit investors’ confidence as they returned from a long Labor Day weekend.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 led the market lower, with bank shares down 1.8 per cent as the S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,165.24.The broad index has now more than reversed the late August four-day rally, and is trading only 60 points above its year lows seen early last month.“There is no reason to think this ends anytime soon,” said Dan Greenhouse, chief strategist at BTIG, blaming European politicians for the falls in US equities.Morgan Stanley was the biggest faller among the big banks, off 4 per cent at $15.33. Citigroup fell 2.5 per cent to $27.70. Bank of America, the biggest faller in early trading, pared some losses to close down 3.6 per cent at $6.99.On top of bond market jitters about Italian sovereign debt, US banks had their own bad news to contend with, as federal lawsuits against big banks dominated US headlines over the holiday weekend. The possible settlement of one case concerning foreclosure practices was balanced by a new case announced on Friday over mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.But Nomura analyst Brian Foran held out hope for bank stocks, predicting mortgage refinancing revenue “will be big in the second half of 2011”.In a note to clients Mr Foran argued that as many as 75 per cent of US mortgage holders have an incentive to refinance at current record low interest rates. “Capacity constraints and pricing power,” mean banks are better placed than customers to benefit, as they can charge customers interest rates higher than banks’ own cost of funding.Mr Foran upgraded Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp – up 1.4 per cent at $9.75 – from hold to buy, because of its large mortgage book.Mr Foran also said big mortgage originators, Wells Fargo – down 1.2 per cent to $23.92 – and Bank of America should receive temporary revenue boosts from refinancing.Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said another refinancing spike, “would be helpful but not a game changer”.Even at the peak of the last refinancing spike in the fourth quarter of last year, mortgage refinancing revenue only accounted for 14 per cent of revenue at Wells Fargo and 11 per cent at Fifth Third.Credit Suisse recommended clients buy regional bank stocks, arguing low interest rates are already priced into their business models because most regional bank lending is to commercial clients at variable rates.On the other hand, national banks are likely to see interest rate margins compress over time, as fixed rate consumer loans mature and are refinanced at lower rates.Analyst Craig Siegenthaler recommended buying Fifth Third, Zions and Synovus Financial.But Zions and Synovus both fell, down 1.2 per cent to $15.99 and 2.2 per cent to $1.31 respectively. Bellwether regional bank, Regions Financial was among the the biggest fallers in the S&P 500, down 5.8 per cent at $3.89.Consumer discretionary stocks fell 0.4 per cent, with Harley Davidson, down 2.4 per cent to $35.15, suffering after a survey of dealers by RBC Capital Markets found sales growth likely slowed in August.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 4 per cent to $4.21.But consumer staples were also off 0.4 per cent, and utilities were down 0.6 per cent as defensive stocks fared badly too.Netflix shares rose 2.7 per cent to $218.77, after the company announced its Latin American customers will have access to Miramax content.Netflix shares are still down almost 10 per cent for the month after the breakdown, last week, of contract renewal talks with the cable network Starz.International Paper Company, the largest US pulp and paper maker, was the biggest riser in the S&P 500. Its shares rose 8.9 per cent to $27.77 after the company successfully concluded its 3 month battle to acquire shipping-box manufacturer Temple InlandThe $3.7bn bid values Temple-Inland at $32 a share. Temple shares rose 25 per cent to $30.85.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, underwriters of Dunkin’ Brands summer IPO, both initiated coverage of the donut and coffee chain owner. Goldman told clients to sell the stock. Morgan Stanley rated it hold. Analysts at both banks said the potential for earnings growth was already reflected in the share price.Dunkin shares rose 0.1 per cent to $27.02Energy stocks were down 1.1 per cent, but Sunoco was up 5.3 per cent at $38.03, after the chemical manufacturer decided to shut its last two petroleum refineries.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off 0.9 per cent at 11,139.3, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,473.83.
5;MAS;Masco Corp;2011-02-17T22:45:05Z;Manufacturing data lift Wall Street;;Cliffs Natural Resources jumped on strong quarterly earnings while the wider markets edged to new 30-month highs as blockbuster manufacturing data outweighed disappointing employment numbers.The iron and coal miner’s record fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, sending the shares up 7.2 per cent to $100.55. The company reported net income of $384.4m, or $2.82 per share, ahead of the $2.18 Wall Street expected.That lifted the iron and steel sector by 2.6 per cent, with Allegheny Technology, the speciality metal manufacturer, adding 1 per cent to $69.16.Indices fell in early trading after employment data showed that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits had risen by 25,000 to 410,000 in the second week of February – economists had expected the total claims to come in at 400,000.Data also showed that consumer price inflation had risen more than expected in January. Headline CPI was up 0.4 per cent while core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent.But losses on the S&P 500 were pared later in the session after data from the Philadelphia Fed showing that US manufacturing had risen strongly in February, surging unexpectedly from 19.3 in January to 35.9 in February.“The Philly Fed number was extraordinary,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. “It just blew away expectations.”That helped the S&P 500 to close up 0.3 per cent to 1,340.43, a fresh 2½-year high. In the previous session the index reached the point where it had doubled from its March 2009 low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher to 12,318.14 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent to 2,831.58.The industrial sector saw healthy gains after the release of the manufacturing figures.Masco, the US building products group, was up 3 per cent to $13.20 while the S&P construction and materials index added 1.3 per cent.The data managed to outweigh concerns over global political instability as unrest continued to spread throughout the Middle East, lifting oil and gold prices.The turmoil did help certain sectors and stocks, however. The oilfield service sector gained from the higher oil prices, rising 1.7 per cent with Noble up 3.5 per cent to $41.33 and Halliburton adding 2 per cent to $48.43.Newmont Mining, the gold miner, was up 1.7 per cent to $58.96 as gold prices spiked up.In earnings news, CBS said net profit had risen 78 per cent to $319.4m in the fourth quarter.Earnings for the media group were boosted by local advertising revenue as television, radio and billboards proved popular with advertisers rebounding from the recession. This lifted the stock up 1.1 per cent to $22.35.Williams, the energy group and gas pipeline operator, added 8.4 per cent to $30.08 after announcing that it planned to separate its exploration and production businesses into two independent, publicly traded groups. The company also said it would boost its quarterly dividend by 60 per cent to 20 cents a share for the first quarter of 2011.That helped lift El Paso, another pipeline owner, by 3.9 per cent to $18. The stock was also helped by news that Raymond James Financial had raised its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”. The S&P pipeline index was up 6.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Duke Energy said fourth-quarter profit had risen 23 per cent, boosted by asset sales, sending its shares up 2.4 per cent to $18.12. Duke agreed to buy rival Progress Energy in a $13.7bn deal that would create the largest power utility in the US.Disappointing results from NetApp weighed on the technology sector.The data storage technology company fell 6.5 per cent to $54.77 after its third-quarter figures showed that revenues had fallen because of component shortages. The computer hardware sector was down 1.2 per cent.Weight Watchers International, which provides services and products for dieting, surprised the markets by issuing a 2011 guidance that far surpassed investor expectations, sending its shares up 45.6 per cent to $65.39.Skechers, the shoe company, was down 0.1 per cent to $22.06 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings had fallen by 88 per cent.
6;MAS;Masco Corp;2010-06-23T22:00:54Z;European bathroom fittings cartel fined €622m;;"Seventeen bathroom fittings companies, ranging from US-based multinationals to small Italian speciality manufacturers, were hit by fines totalling €622m ($761m) on Wednesday for their part in one of the largest longest-running cartels to surface in Europe recently.But more than one-third of the members of the cartel will have their fines reduced – either because of their co-operation with the European Commission, Europe’s top competition watchdog, or because full penalties could have pushed them close to bankruptcy.EU competition officials have been bombarded with requests for milder treatment because of the current economic climate. The fact that five of the 10 companies that made such pleas in the bathroom fittings case won reductions will be scrutinised by lawyers.On Wednesday, the EU’s new competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, rejected suggestions he was taking a softer line on antitrust penalties than his predecessor Neelie Kroes. “I’m not conciliatory at all …I’m very tough on cartels,” he insisted.Stephen Kinsella, partner at law firm Sidley Austin, said: “Reductions [because of inability to pay] aren’t unprecedented and there’s no real change in the rules. But it’s a much clearer invitation from the commission that if you’ve got a very good case, make it.”But lawyers say the case will be perceived as a signal from Europe’s regulator that it is open to persuasion.Two other well-known companies – Germany’s Grohe and Ideal Standard, which acquired parts of the US American Standard conglomerate in a break-up three years ago – saw their fines reduced by 30 per cent in return for co-operation and will be fined €54.8m and €326.1m respectively.The bathroom fittings cartel, which was organised through hundreds of trade association meetings, ran for 12 years, from 1992 to 2004, and covered six countries in continental Europe.The whistle was eventually blown by Masco, the US building products group, which gets immunity from any penalty as a result.The Commission did not identify which companies got reductions but said that for three companies these reductions were by 50 per cent, and that for a further two, by 25 per cent.Officials also said two unnamed companies first thought to be involved had had the allegations against them dropped, and that the period of the cartel had been narrowed. Commission officials originally thought it began in 1985.Companies involved can appeal against the fines to the European courts in Luxembourg; they could also face private damages actions from customers."
7;MAS;Masco Corp;2010-04-28T20:42:20Z;Wall St up despite sovereign debt downgrades;;An S&P downgrade of Spain’s sovereign debt briefly shook US stock markets on Wednesday but failed to break the session’s rally, as investors welcomed the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep the benchmark interest rate near zero, announced late in the day.Doug Robert, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research said: “The Fed accomplished its mission. It did not want to excite the markets and it didn’t. Investors have had enough excitement this week with what’s going on in Greece and Spain, and the Goldman hearings.”The main indices moved slightly higher in reaction to the announcement.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent at 1,191.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 11,045.27 and the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,471.73.Dow Chemical was up 5.9 per cent to $31.83 as the largest US chemicals producer said its first-quarter profit was better than expected.Net profit, excluding non-recurring items, was 43 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 30 cent per share.JetBlue slipped 11.5 per cent to $5.77 as the domestic airline posted a $1m first-quarter loss while analysts expected a profit, as higher fuel costs hit margins.Net losses were 1 cent per share. The average analyst estimate was for a 3 cent profit.

8;MAS;Masco Corp;2008-04-16T18:44:26Z;Building materials M&A;;Cobwebs are gathering in the aisles of home improvement stores. US housing starts are in freefall, dropping by 11.9 per cent month-on-month in March. For makers of building materials, the question now is whether they should simply shut down more facilities or try to hammer out mergers.The building products industry is being squeezed between the housing slump and raw materials inflation, which has boosted construction costs and damped interest in speculative projects. Makers of everything from wallboard and insulation to paint and taps have slashed jobs and shut factories to offset depressed sales and tepid pricing power. Shares in Masco are down 41 per cent in two years, while Louisiana-Pacific’s have dropped by more than 60 per cent. USG has also been hit hard. If US commercial property comes under serious pressure, the pain could get worse.Weyerhaeuser, which recently agreed to sell its containerboard business, is also trying to sell a unit that makes plastic composites. Quanex is planning a spin-off of its building products unit. While competitors struggle to re-engineer their businesses, more capacity may need to be cut. For example, even though capacity utilisation in the wallboard sector had dropped to 70 per cent in January, Goldman Sachs estimates new plant openings scheduled for this year could boost capacity by a 10th.Whether consolidation would significantly strengthen the industry, however, is debatable. Diversification can help to smooth business cycles. But integration of new businesses is expensive, and a broad slump in construction activity leaves even the most diverse companies with few places to hide. The number of new building permits continues to slide, suggesting more pain. With balance sheets weak and share prices depressed, talk about deals in the sector may prove to be just that. Many companies may be forced to try to ride out the storm alone.Post and read comments on this Lex
9;MAS;Masco Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 13,136.14, a new record close.The major talking point among investors was Dow Jones, which soared to its highest level in four years after News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, launched a hostile $60-a-share bid for the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Late on Tuesday, the Bancroft family, who control Dow Jones via a dual shareholder structure, rejected the proposal.Dow Jones gained 54.7 per cent to close at $56.20, down from a high of $57.88 earlier in the day. On Monday, volume in call options, mainly priced at $45 a share, soared by almost seven times.While News Corp slid 4.2 per cent to $22.99, shares in the New York Times jumped 5 per cent to $24.58, the Washington Post rose 2.9 per cent to $765.30 and Gannett rose 2 per cent to $58.17. Shares in Pearson, the publisher of the Financial Times rose 5.6 per cent to $18.01, the highest level in five years.As the first-quarter earnings season continued on Tuesday, analysts said better- than-expected results aug­ured well for the overall market. Recent weakness in the dollar was also playing a crucial part in boosting the appeal of internationally focused companies.“There have been some stellar results from Wall Street but also strong results from companies with foreign operations” [boosted by] “strong growth in the global economy . . . lower tax rates and a weaker dollar,” said David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “The US market looks to be enjoying respectable earnings growth, sustained by robust global growth and the prospect of falling interest rates, caused by soft onshore growth.”While the weaker dollar has helped boost large-cap stocks, analysts said currency bears were watching for any shift in the attitude of foreign investors. While the S&P is up 4.8 per cent this year in dollar terms, the rise is only 1.55 per cent for euro-based investors.“There is a danger that we reach a tipping point with foreign investors if the dollar continues to decline,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “If the dollar goes significantly lower, it could become precarious for stocks.”In earnings news on Tuesday, Liz Claiborne reported a 65 per cent plunge in first-quarter net profit and said that 2007 earnings would fall well below analysts’ expectations. The clothing retailer fell 17.3 per cent to $37.Procter & Gamble reported a 13.6 per cent rise in quarterly profit and raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast. Its shares fell 2.2 per cent to $62.96, after a rise of 2.25 per cent on Monday.Archer Daniels Midland said its fiscal third-quarter earnings increased 4 per cent and shares in the largest US ethanol producer fell 5.4 per cent to $36.60 as results missed analysts’ expectations.Avon Products came calling with a near-tripling in fiscal third-quarter earnings from the same period last year. Its shares rose 2.8 per cent to $40.93.Another company reporting a near-threefold rise in first-quarter profit was Qwest Communications, whose results were boosted by lower costs and higher take-up of bundled services – such as telephone, television, high-speed internet and wireless services – by customers. Shares in Qwest rose by 2.6 per cent to $9.11.Shares in Centex rose 3.8 per cent to $46.46 after the homebuilder said fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell 49 per cent, owing to a drop in home sales in what the company called one of the most difficult markets in 25 years.Masco said its first-quarter earnings fell 30 per cent as the slump in housing soured demand for home improvements.Shares jumped 9.5 per cent to $29.80 as the results were better than forecast.Marathon Oil reported a decline in first-quarter earnings to $717m from a year-ago profit of $784m, but the result was above expect­ations. Its shares fell 0.3 per cent to $101.27, down from a high of $103.02 earlier in the day.
