This represents a multiple of 8.2 times adjusted 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.“When you look at the kind of challenges our clients are facing in a data-led, digital-first world, it’s obvious that companies like us need to make bold moves,” said Publicis chairman and chief executive Arthur Sadoun in an interview.Like its rivals WPP and Omnicom, Publicis has come under pressure as online platforms such as Facebook and Google have upended the traditional intermediary agency model and dominated digital advertising. New competitors have also emerged in the form of professional services companies such as Accenture, which last week announced it will buy Cirruseo, a French cloud consulting firm.Publicis has said previously that it would make acquisitions in the fields of data, dynamic creativity and digital transformation as it aims to reshape its business model from a holding company into a single platform. The Epsilon deal follows its 2014 acquisition of digital and tech network Sapient to increase its technological firepower.Epsilon provides a range of services including loyalty programmes, email marketing and collating consumer data on transactions, location and web activity.Mr Sadoun said: “The new market imperative is to deliver personalised experiences at scale. There is no way our clients will continue to grow and reduce costs if they can’t deliver this in their own markets.”He added that Publicis had been interested in buying Epsilon for years. It had been in discussions over the deal since December and saw off competition for the company from private equity firms and other strategic buyers. “We are buying a leader in data analytics that can enrich and value first-party data in a unique way,” he added.In 2018 Epsilon generated $1.9bn of net revenues, of which 97 per cent were in the US and employs roughly 9,000 people globally.Publicis was advised on the transaction by bankers at Allen & Company, Citigroup, JPMorgan and BNP Paribas.

2;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2008-04-25T08:06:37Z;The SEC and market rumours;;"“Buy on the rumour, sell on the news” is a time-honoured trading strategy. A less reputable one is to simply make up the rumour and hope enough dupes take it seriously to move the stock price in your favour.The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday settled with
a Wall Street trader accused of spreading false rumours concerning Blackstone’s bid for Alliance Data Systems. The trader was charged with drafting a false rumour that ADS’s board was meeting to consider a lower bid price, and then sending it out via instant messaging. Having been picked up by the media, the rumour allegedly caused ADS’s market value to plunge by $1bn in the space of half an hour. As part of the settlement, the trader disgorged profits and paid a fine, without admitting or denying guilt. He is also banned from working for any broker or dealer.Such cases are understandably rare. Back in 2001, the SEC charged a day trader with posting a phony Lucent Technologies profit warning on internet message boards. Proving someone has spread a false rumour involves determining the source and then coming up with hard evidence to back up the case. The SEC is under pressure to investigate allegations that Bear Stearns was brought low by deceitful tittle-tattle. Financial institutions present a particular conundrum, as an initially false rumour regarding their solvency can quickly become self-fulfilling.The rise of rapid-fire, global trading, twinned with the dissemination of information over digital networks, has amplified the dangers of rumour mongering – particularly in today’s fretful climate. Lies spread by electronic means at least leave a more easily identifiable audit trail. But the more depressing aspect of all this is that, once the falsehood is out there, enough traders feel desperate enough to move markets on the back of unsubstantiated gossip.Post and read comments on this Lex"
3;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2008-04-24T21:03:43Z;Trader charged with spreading false rumours;;A Wall Street short-seller on Thursday was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with spreading false rumours in a case that suggests regulators are taking a fresh look at behaviour that many companies say is now rampant.The case, which hinges on rumours about a Blackstone takeover deal, comes as the SEC faces growing pressure to investigate allegations that false rumours about Bear Stearns may have had contributed to its collapse last month.After Bear’s liquidity evaporated, similar rumours hit Lehman Brothers, leading to a sharp, but temporary, drop in its shares. At the SEC’s request, Lehman and other banks sent information to the commission about trading in their securities in the days surrounding Bear’s collapse.Rumour-mongering cases are rare and notoriously difficult to prove because they require investigators to track down the initial source of the rumour and produce documentary evidence.In spite of that, Chris Cox, SEC chairman, said the commission would take firm action against people who spread bogus rumours.“The message of this case is simple and direct. The commission will vigorously investigate and prosecute those who manipulate markets with this witch’s brew of damaging rumours and short sales,” he said.In its case on Thursday, the SEC charged Paul Berliner, a short-seller, with spreading false stories about the Blackstone’s acquisition of Alliance Data Systems while selling ADS shares short.According to the complaint, Mr Berliner on November 29 sent instant messages to traders at brokerage firms and hedge funds and elsewhere suggesting that Blackstone’s agreed deal to acquire ADS for $81.75 was being renegotiated at $70 a share. The rumours were picked up by the media and caused ADS’s shares to fall 17 per cent, according to the complaint, which did not identify the media outlets.Mr Berliner agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying guilt and to disgorge $26,129 in profits and pay a $130,000 fine. He will also be banned from working for any broker or dealer.William Holleman, Mr Berliner’s attorney, said: “Our client looks forward to putting this matter behind him and moving on with other endeavours.”The SEC appears to have based its case on Mr Berliner’s instant messages. Defence lawyers have expressed concern that many traders believe instant messages and text messages cannot be recovered.
4;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2008-04-20T19:26:42Z;Blackstone pledge to defend Alliance Data suit;;Blackstone Group said at the weekend that it would “vigorously defend” a lawsuit filed against it by Alliance Data Systems and “does not intend to settle”.Alliance Data Systems said it was suing the private equity firm, seeking payment of $170m for failing to complete its takeover of the credit card operator and loyalty programmes manager.In January, Alliance Data sued Blackstone after regulators at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency refused to sign off on the deal on terms acceptable to the buyer but dropped the suit shortly after filing it.“The Blackstone affiliates breached their contractual obligations by refusing to accept reasonable and customary regulatory requirements and prolonging negotiations with regulators,” said Alliance Data. “In order to protect the interests of Alliance Data’s stockholders, we are compelled to litigate this issue.”Blackstone said that “our extensive efforts have not succeeded in completing the transaction within the timeframe set forth in the merger agreement and the agreement has therefore been terminated”.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency told Blackstone that to secure approval for acquisition of Alliance Data, it would have to provide open-ended guarantees of capital and liquidity for its target as the debt on the financial services firm soars from under $1bn to $6bn. That would have cut into Blackstone’s returns.The outcome of the litigation will revolve around whether Blackstone did use its best efforts to save its buy-out of Alliance Data.The litigation is one of a growing number of such suits between buyers and sellers and between buyers and their banks, as deals conceived under bull market conditions approach closing deadlines under completely different circumstances.The strains put a premium on the careful wording of agreements that were signed when few anticipated how radically financing terms would change. Terms such as the break-up fees, the conditions under which buyers can walk away, and who holds the ultimate responsibility for securing financing are likely to be negotiated far more carefully in future.
5;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2008-02-22T08:49:06Z;3Com’s silver lining;;Are regulators doing private equity a favour? During the boom, the lack of anti-trust risk for financial buyers, and their ability to move quickly, supposedly gave them an edge over strategic bidders in auctions.Now that the private equity world has been turned upside down, regulators are again proving to be helpful in some cases. Last month, demands from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency gave Blackstone an excuse to ditch its agreement to buy Alliance Data Systems. The buy-out group had originally overpaid. The deal is now in the process of being renegotiated. But if Blackstone does agree to complete, it is likely to be done at a lower price.JC Flowers’ overpriced acquisition of Sallie Mae came apart last year when the buyer claimed student lending legislation passed by Congress was a material adverse change.Now the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (Cfius), has stymied 3Com’s sale to Bain Capital and Huawei, the Chinese networking equipment company. Could that blow actually have a silver lining for the buyers?It is possible. From the outset, Bain was after 3Com’s Chinese business, rather than its struggling US operations. If Cfius is playing hardball because of Huawei’s involvement, Bain could try to win over the authorities by offering to ditch all the American assets in return for approval. It might be tough to find a buyer for those at a decent price in today’s environment. But if that risk was reflected in a reduced purchase price for 3Com, it might still make sense. Bain could, feasibly, even end up with the Chinese assets its wants at a lower price.It is a long shot, not least because of the unpredictability of Cfius. But 3Com, with its shares down 40 per cent in five months, does not appear to have many options.Post and read comments on this Lex
6;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2008-02-15T09:28:18Z;Clear Channel doubts;;Is the massive buyout of Clear Channel turning into a game of “pass the break fee” between the private equity sponsors and the banks? The stock market seems to think so. Shares in the radio and outdoor advertising group now trade at a 26 per cent discount to the offer price. Investors clearly do not expect the deal to close, even though there are no more excuses. The final regulatory hurdles were jumped this week.On one side, financial sponsors Bain Capital and Thomas H Lee are paying a toppy price. But if they walk away they would be on the hook for a $500m reverse break fee – there has been no obvious material adverse change to Clear Channel’s business. So they have pressed ahead with regulatory approvals. On the bright side, they can claim they secured great debt terms and financing costs will have fallen since the original bid.On the other side are the banks, on the hook for about $16bn of new debt. Given turmoil in the leveraged loan market, they might face a mark-to-market hit of, say, $2.5bn on day one. They might also struggle to sell loans on, clogging up their already strained balance sheets. Accepting the reputational risk of refusing to put up the money, and accepting responsibility for the break fee, looks financially tempting in comparison.It is not surprising equity investors are spooked, given the pain many felt when Blackstone walked away from buying Alliance Data Systems. The question seems to be whether the banks or sponsors blink first and who is left holding the $500m break fee. They might even find a way to share it.There is a chance that the deal still happens. But it is a brave investor who will bet on all sides sticking to their commitments in today’s environment.
7;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
8;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2008-02-05T23:33:49Z;Picking up the pieces of global M&A deals;;"When it comes to doing deals, bankers and chief executives are experiencing one of the most schizophrenic markets ever seen.The minute one bidder walks away from a deal, citing market difficulties, another announces an acquisition, citing opportunity.From Kaupthing Bank’s last-minute decision to call off its planned €3bn ($4.4bn) takeover of Dutch rival NIBC Holdings, to Blackstone threatening to walk away from its $6.4bn buy-out of Alliance Data Systems, several billion dollars of deals have been axed or shelved as conditions in the credit market deteriorate.But, while some deals are being pulled, others are being created. Just last week, Microsoft launched a $43bn unsolicited bid for Yahoo; Chinalco acquired a $14bn stake in Rio Tinto, and Punch Taverns of the UK approached Mitchells & Butlers about a £4bn merger.Even BC Partners managed to complete its $16.5bn acquisition of Intelsat on Monday after making concessions with its three financing banks on the structure of its $15bn debt.“We currently have a bi-polar market with some deals being pulled at one end of the spectrum, and new opportunities created for cash-rich buyers who sense an opportunity to make acquisitions at attractive multiples at the other,” says Henrik Aslaksen, co-head of European M&A at Deutsche Bank.Despite promising signs of a pick-up in activity, global M&A volume is still far behind levels seen last year.In the year to date, there have been 2,794 deals, with a total value of $236bn – the lowest number of deals since 2005 and the lowest dollar volume announced since November 2004, according to Thomson Financial.“Companies have no doubt in their minds that the competitiveness of the market today requires a global solution, and the underlying rationale for deals has not changed,” says Carlo Calabria, European head of M&A at Merrill Lynch.“However, the question now for companies is at what point do they strike in a falling market,” he adds.Investors have looked to the mining and energy sector for the bulk of deal activity. Vale of Brazil is working on a potential $90bn take-over of Xstrata, the Anglo-Swiss miner. EDF of France and ACS, a Spanish construction group, are considering a joint break-up bid for Iberdrola.“The fundamentals driving M&A in the mining and energy sectors remain very much in place – competition for resources, the benefits of scale, scarcity of opportunity and the need to drive growth. These sectors are likely to remain broadly unaffected by a broader M&A slowdown,” says William Vereker, co-global head of power and European head of natural resources at Lehman Brothers.Non-US acquirers are picking up the slack. “There is a lot of capital outside the US which is likely to be more active in making acquisitions in the US,” says Frank Aquila, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.Global acquisitions by sovereign wealth funds totalled $20.6bn in January – one-third of the total volume registered during 2007. In the US, sovereign wealth fund acquisitions accounted for 28 per cent of total M&A activity last month. However, where sovereign wealth funds are not involved, financing some of the larger deals will remain a challenge. Strategic buyers’ reluctance to enter the takeover fray has been one of the main causes for a recent drop in bank lending.Almost three-quarters of senior loan officers surveyed by the Federal Reserve in January said lower demand for credit was due to a fall in M&A financing, according to a report released on Monday.Even companies on the lookout for acquisitions for some time, such as General Electric and Dow Chemical, have promised to return cash to shareholders through share buy-backs if they cannot find suitable targets at the right price.Some US companies say the conditions are ripe for mid-sized, bolt-on acquisitions. David Anderson, chief financial officer of the US manufacturing giant Honeywell, says the company is looking to use its cash resources for acquisitions in the $100m-$500m range.“In a slowing economy, there are going to be companies that are going to struggle…It could create vulnerability and we are going to be in a position of strength,” he said in a recent interview with the Financial Times.The outlook for private equity also looks difficult. Until last summer, these funds were corporate buyers of first and last resort, acquiring companies with values of more than $30bn.But by the end of last year, investors withdrew from the debt markets, leaving banks sitting on a massive inventory of unsold loans and bonds. Brad Hintz, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, estimated last week that $160bn of deal debt has yet to be sold.Mr Hintz predicts US and European buyout activity will drop 30 per cent this year and an additional 22 per cent next year.Yet private equity players still have large cash funds to spend, and as a result, some bankers predict more partnerships this year, whereby buyers seek allies for acquisitions, either for political, financial, technological or strategic reasons."
9;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2008-01-30T23:35:07Z;Blackstone sued over Alliance bid;;Alliance Data on Wednesday revealed that it is going to court to force Blackstone to complete its $7.8bn leveraged buy-out of the company.Blackstone said this week that the deal was in doubt, citing what it characterised as unreasonable demands from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.Alliance, a credit card company specialising in loyalty programmes, accused Blackstone of “failing to use reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approval”.Tony James, president of Blackstone, responded by saying that deals fall apart for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain regulatory approvals.“If you can’t get regulatory approval, it has nothing to do with the buyer,” Mr James said. “No private equity firm puts its funds on the hook.”With Alliance’s share price trading at about half the $81.75 that Blackstone originally offered, litigation had been expected. “The case will turn on the meaning of best effort,” says the head of the private equity practice at one major Wall Street law firm who is not involved in the Alliance deal. “And that is a wide open story.”The 68-page merger agreement mentions regulatory approvals among the conditions for closing but does not seem to address the possibility that a restructuring of the deal to meet OCC objections might be rejected. Nor does it include an explicit out for Blackstone if the OCC requirements proved unreasonably burdensome.Blackstone offered to pledge $100m to reassure the OCC about its commitment to Alliance, but the OCC wanted an open-ended pledge of $400m with no guarantee that it would not ask for more at a later date, according to a person familiar with the matter. Blackstone considered that unacceptable and unprecedented.Alliance said it “believes the OCC’s requests are reasonable and that Blackstone has the ability to satisfy them and obtain the required approvals”.Regulators tend to be concerned about the debt private equity firms put on acquired companies. In this case, Blackstone was taking the debt from less than $1bn to about $6bn.
10;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2008-01-29T09:21:49Z;Blackstone’s way out;;Marking assets to market has been the bane of financial companies’ existence since the credit crisis started. Private equity groups, with their long-time horizons, tend to avoid the worst of it. But it is hardly a comfortable feeling to complete a deal where, from the stock market’s perspective, the equity you are putting in is worthless on day one.That is what Blackstone faced with Alliance Data Systems. The credit card service provider’s share price collapsed on Monday to about half the $81.75 a share Blackstone agreed to pay last May. Given that the private equity group planned to fund three quarters of the deal with debt, the equity component was already worth zero, at least from the stock market’s perspective.Fortunately for Blackstone, regulators rode to the rescue. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is understood to have demanded a “source of strength” commitment – basically Blackstone agreeing to stand behind the deal if it went wrong. That does not make sense for a private equity group, whose business model depends on placing a series of risky, ring-fenced bets.So Blackstone gets a good excuse to walk away. The regulator avoids agreeing to a highly geared transaction, which could become a headache. And shareholders get crushed in the middle. There remains a chance that Blackstone agrees a lower purchase price, reduces the leverage in the deal, and negotiates an agreement with the regulator (something they would probably have managed during better times). But ADS shareholders should not bank on that, or on winning in court.More broadly, perhaps, distressed financial services may not prove the fertile area for private equity that some hoped. The Sallie Mae deal has already fallen through. In today’s chaotic markets, regulators will prefer big financial institutions buying troubled businesses, to investors who can walk away if life gets tough.Post and read comments on this Lex
11;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2008-01-28T21:49:02Z;Wall St rallies on rate cut hopes;;Wall Street stocks rallied on Monday, after overcoming an initial wobble, as hopes for more aggressive interest rate cuts spurred gains in financial companies ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Tuesday.US equities, although volatile, fared much better than traders had feared, after a sharp sell-off in Asia and Europe looked set to deliver another down day in the US.The outlook for investors was far from serene after new home sales plunged to a 12-year low and McDonald’s shares hit the skids after disappointing December same-store sales.The S&P 500 closed up 1.8 per cent at 1,353.97 points having fallen 0.6 per cent at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 1.5 per cent to 12,383.89 while the Nasdaq Composite rallied strongly to close up 1 per cent at 2,349.91 after it briefly turned negative in afternoon trade.Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said equities were showing tentative signs of stabilising. “Three out of the last four days we have finished up near the highs of the day, that’s a real turn from the way the market has behaved.”A factor that may decide if stocks can find a footing this week will be the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate policy. Since the Fed made an emergency 75 basis point rate cut last week investors have been divided over whether the central bank will cut rates 25bp or 50bp when its meeting concludes on Wednesday.The futures market has priced in an 86 per cent chance the Fed will take the more dovish approach – to lower the Fed funds rate to 3 per cent.“Anything less than 25bp would probably risk a significant negative reaction in the financial markets,” said Maury Harris, an economist at UBS Investment Research.In spite of the rally investors were still awaiting a clear signal about whether equities have become oversold or if recent upticks were merely the product of a fleeting bear-market rally.Given fears the economy is entering a recession, this week’s data on the state of the labour and housing markets are important.New home sales fell 4.7 per cent to a 604,000 annual rate in December, the lowest reading in 12 years, compared with expectations of about 650,000.The homebuilder sector pared early losses to extend last week’s 28 per cent rally as traders bet that rate cuts would help the sector. The S&P homebuilder index climbed 6.4 per cent to 426.29, with Lennar up 9 per cent at $18.50.“The stock market apparently believes the worst is over,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. “[But] we think the downside for activity and prices remains considerable. To repeat, there is no sign of a bottom in any of these data.”Confidence in the health of the US consumer took another dent on Monday after McDonald’s reported flat December same-store sales owing to a softening in consumer spending. The stock fell 5.6 per cent to $51.07 while rival Wendy’s gave up 5.3 per cent to $23.92. Also in the consumer sector, Sears Holdings rose 1.3 per cent to $100.28 after its chief executive left. Financial companies en­joyed the best of the gains, with Lehman Brothers rising 4.8 per cent to $60.63 and JPMorgan up 4.4 per cent at $45.57.After the close American Express said fourth quarter profit fell 10 per cent, in line with estimates, after it took a charge to cover bad loans. The shares closed up 4.3 per cent at $47.40 but fell 2.8 per cent after hours.The telecoms sector came under early pressure before rebounding after Verizon Communications reported weakness in its fixed line business. Quarterly earnings rose 3.9 per cent, in line with expectations and the shares closed up 0.9 per cent at $38.11. Corning, gained 3.3 per cent to $23.10 after it raised fourth-quarter profit 11 per cent amid heavy demand for glass used in flat-screen TVs and computers. Gains in the transport sector were limited after YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell to a $735.8m loss – far worse than expected. The shares fell 14.7 per cent to $16.08.Alliance Data Systems’ $6.76bn buy-out by Blackstone was put into doubt. Shares in the credit card services provider plunged 35.2 per cent to $42.48 while Blackstone slipped 1.1 per cent to $19.15.
12;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2008-01-28T19:00:49Z;Blackstone deal for ADS in doubt;;Blackstone Group’s $7.8bn buy-out of Alliance Data Systems has been thrown into doubt by regulators, leading the share price of the credit card operator and manager of loyalty programmes to plunge. In lunchtime trading, ADS shares were down 35 per cent at $22.70.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency told Blackstone that to secure approval for its acquisition of ADS, it would have to provide open-ended guarantees of capital and liquidity for its target as the debt on the financial services firm soars from less than $1bn to $6bn.People familiar with the thinking of Blackstone said that the giant private equity firm still wanted to do the deal, in spite of the fact that even before this setback, the share price had dropped well below the near-$82 bid last May. In the past, Blackstone has declined to put in more equity to rescue other deals that were unravelling.Blackstone put out a statement expressing its willingness to work with Alliance Data to re-submit proposals to the OCC. However, it noted that the OCC requirements amounted to “an unlimited and indefinite liability” on Blackstone and its funds, even after Blackstone sells on its holding in the company.Blackstone’s original due diligence on Alliance Data did not include talks with the OCC, according to people familiar with the matter. These people add that the OCC had never before made such a stipulation.Meanwhile, in its statement, Alliance Data “strongly disagreed” with Blackstone’s stated assertion that it couldn’t reasonably meet the OCC conditions.That OCC stipulation could have a chilling effect on other private equity firms’ willingness to do deals at a time when rescue capital is badly needed.Bank regulators have come under increasing pressure for the debacle in the credit markets for a wide range of alleged lapses including not clamping down on widespread fraud in the mortgage market and not insisting on greater transparency in the off balance sheet entities of the banks.A spokesman for the OCC declined to comment.
13;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2007-05-28T21:02:51Z;US buy-out groups in record $82bn bids;;"Buy-out groups in the US are having their busiest month on record after launching nearly $82bn-worth of bids since the beginning of May.The frenzy of activity defies predictions of a slowdown in the private equity-driven deal boom but could also signal a desire by buy-out funds to rush into deals before credit markets take a turn for the worse.Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor specialising in private equity, said: “Part of the reason for the increase in activity is a secular shift in liquidity, but part of it is an opportunistic taking advantage of the time.”US private equity funds bought more than $81.8bn-worth of companies this month, led by the $27.2bn proposed takeover of the wireless group Alltel by Texas Pacific and the buy-out arm of Goldman Sachs, according to Thomson Financial.The current total for May, which also includes Daimler’s $7.4bn sale of Chrysler to Cerberus, is already ahead of the record $81.6bn notched up in November last year.Investment bankers said the volume could still grow as there were a few more multibillion
dollar deals likely to be announced before the end of the month.The spike in activity in May comes on the back of $78bn-worth of deals in April, the third busiest month on record.Monthly figures are volatile because the frequency of buy-out bids is variable, but the latest figures suggest deals are getting bigger. May’s record volume came through 86 deals, against the 100 or so in previous records.Among May’s largest deals, Blackstone launched a $7.7bn bid for Alliance Data Systems, a business services group, and Warburg Pincus offered $3.9bn for the eyewear maker Bausch & Lomb."
14;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2007-05-18T20:57:59Z;Bull run continues on Wall Street;;Wall Street’s bull run continued this week, with the exception of the technology sector, as deals and earnings news pushed the S&P 500 index to within sight of its all-time high.Late on Friday, the S&P had risen 0.65 per cent to close at 1,522.75, a gain of 1.1 per cent over the week. The benchmark notched its seventh consecutive weekly rise and closed at its highest level since setting its record close of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Energy and telecoms stocks were the best performing sectors, while information technology was the laggard among the 10 major groups within the S&P.Higher oil prices and a further rise in bond yields were unable to weigh on stocks.“We are seeing so much consolidation and the market has also shifted its focus to the economy,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.“The market can absorb higher oil prices and bond yields if the economy is looking stronger.”Blue chips remained the bull’s prime choice this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 13,500 points for the first time and set a series of record closes as its run of strength since the end of March continued.On Friday, the Dow rose 0.6 per cent to finish at 13,556.53, a rise of 1.7 per cent for the week.A feature of the market’s current rally has been strong buying of large blue chip stocks. This positive sentiment was nurtured this week when high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett, Edward Lampert and Carl Icahn revealed their latest stock selections in regulatory filings.Railroads were a prominent sector, boosted by investment from Mr Buffett and Mr Icahn, and the S&P railroad index rose 3.8 per cent this week. Mr Lampert’s disclosure of a stake in Citigroup helped the bank’s shares rise by 3.6 per cent to $55.By contrast, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite was bedevilled by weakness among many semiconductor stocks amid a general rotation out of tech. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 2.7 per cent this week. On Friday, the Nasdaq rose 0.75 per cent to close at 2,558.45, but slipped 0.15 per cent for the week.The Russell index of small companies fell 0.7 per cent for the week.Leading declines among chip makers was Micron Technology, down 6.9 per cent to $11.47, after the group said it planned to sell $1.1bn in convertible notes.One ray of light among chip makers was Advanced Micro Devices, up 6.2 per cent to $15.59 this week, as it rolled out a new line of graphics cards designed for high-definition video games.In another week replete with deals, Microsoft said it would purchase Aquantive, the digital marketing group for about $6bn on Friday.It is the largest acquisition yet made by Microsoft, and its stock fell 0.5 per cent to $30.83, while Aquantive soared 77.8 per cent to $63.79 on Friday.“We view the acquisition as a necessity for Microsoft to compete against Google in online advertising, an estimated $40bn market growing at a 20 per cent rate through 2010,” said Jim Yin, systems software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Shares in General Electric rose 1.2 per cent to $36.96 on Friday, as the conglomerate moved towards selling its plastics business for $11bn to Saudi Basic Industries.In other acquisition activity this week, Cardinal Health bought Viasys Healthcare for $1.42bn.

15;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2007-05-17T21:17:45Z;Wall Street retreats after recent bullish run;;Wall Street stocks weakened on Thursday, as investors consolidated the market’s recent run of gains.The S&P 500 dipped 0.1 per cent to close at 1,512.75, putting an attempt at breaking its 2000 record high of 1,527.46 on hold.Energy stocks led the market as oil prices rallied sharply. By contrast, utility stocks languished as Treasury yields continued their recent rise.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were also weaker. Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank did not expect the present problems in the subprime mortgage market to harm the broader economy or the financial system.Standard & Poor’s said yesterday that first-quarter 2007 operating earnings for the S&P 500 increased 8.2 per cent over the first quarter 2006, boosted in part by the weaker dollar.“The stronger-than-expected earnings can be traced back to international sales, that now account for a significant portion of the S&P 500 revenue,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P.Among S&P sectors, materials led with a 16.9 per cent jump in earnings, and financials posted a better-than-expected rise of 12.7 per cent. In contrast, consumer discretionary companies recorded a 5 per cent drop in earnings, mostly due to lower profits from homebuilders and the automobile sector and lower margins from retailers.Against the backdrop of slowing economic growth, weaker housing activity and high petrol prices, the better-than-expected pace of quarterly earnings growth is “about as close to a perfect landing as we could have hoped for”, said Mr Silverblatt.Still, traders have noted recent buying of put options, which provide insurance against the risk of a sharp decline in the S&P in the coming months. The Chicago Board of Trade’s Vix index, a measure of S&P 500 index volatility known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” was a touch firmer yesterday and remains above recent lows.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent lower at 2,539.38. Semiconductor stocks were again lower and the 1 per cent drop in the Philadelphia semiconductor index took its decline so far this week to 2.4 per cent. Micron Technology fell 5.3 per cent to $11.50 after the group said it plans to sell $1.1bn in convertible notes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to close at 13,476.72, but the blue-chip barometer did rise above the 13,500 threshold for the first time earlier in the day.Blue-chips were boosted in part by Exxon Mobil, which rose to an all-time high of $82.44, before it closed up 0.4 per cent at $81.80. A downgrade for Caterpillar, off 1.5 per cent at $74.84, weighed on the Dow.The S&P railroad index rallied 2.1 per cent, for a gain of 4.5 per cent so far this week following more news that high profile investors had recently purchased stakes in railroad companies.Merger and acquisition activity yesterday was led by Alliance Data Systems. The issuer of private-label credit cards agreed to be acquired in a $7.8bn deal by Blackstone Group.

Citigroup said the company’s upgraded search engine will boost revenue and the bank reiterated its buy rating on the stock and has a price target of $600 a share.“By our math, Google generates approximately $0.08 for every search on its network. A better search experience = more searches = more revenue,” said Mark Mahaney, US internet analyst at Citigroup. “Google’s successful product innovation is likely to increase its mind share, its market share, and its market cap,” said Mr Mahaney.
16;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Blackstone’s critics;;In today’s larger-than-life market, Blackstone’s $7.8bn agreement to buy Alliance Data Systems seems almost run of the mill. Away from the deal trail, though, the private equity group has had an unusual week.First, the AFL-CIO union group wrote to the Securities and Exchange Commission arguing that Blackstone’s proposed flotation was designed to skirt rules that apply to listed investment companies in the US. Then came the first congressional testimony from the private equity world’s new spinmeister, Douglas Lowenstein, who countered assertions that the industry makes the rich richer while doing nothing for regular workers. Whatever their merits, these claims reflect that Blackstone’s initial public offering has become a focal point for criticism of private equity.It does not help that Blackstone is pushing the boundaries further than Fortress, the hedge fund group that made a spectacular stock market debut in February. The treatment of arguably fee-like income as capital gains is attracting scrutiny – although changing the tax rules would affect not just IPO candidates but all private equity groups. The planned sale of partnership interests rather than shares, partly to avoid listed company governance requirements that would otherwise apply, also tests new ground, given the size and range of Blackstone’s business.None of that means it should not go ahead with its IPO – even though it conflicts with the group’s previous insistence on the joys of staying private. There are reasonable arguments for going public, centred on institutionalising the business. The question is on what terms. Mr Lowenstein might have an easier job if Blackstone ran into a speed bump or two. At least it would help dispel the impression that the group wants to have its cake and eat it too. But the SEC, which agreed to the Fortress IPO, seems unlikely to find the AFL-CIO persuasive. And in this market, investors will probably fill their boots on Blackstone’s terms.
17;ADS;Alliance Data Systems Corp;2007-05-17T15:04:57Z;Blackstone in $7.8bn deal for Alliance Data;;Alliance Data Systems, which runs branded credit cards for retailers such as Victoria’s Secret and rewards points programmes for clients such as Hilton Hotels, has agreed to a $7.8bn takeover from Blackstone, returning to private ownership just six years after it first launched itself onto the public markets.Under the terms of the agreement, Blackstone will buy all of the shares in Alliance Data for $81.75 per share in cash, 30 per cent more than its closing share price on Wednesday. The deal includes $1.04bn of debt.The deal comes amid a surge of takeover activity in the transactions services industry. First Data, which processes credit card transactions, last month sold itself to KKR for $26bn. Acxiom, the data management company, agreed to be taken over on Wednesday for $2.24bn by two private equity firms.Analysts say that a combination of “sticky” business models with high levels of client retention have attracted private equity firms, as have strong cash flows, which make it easier to pay off the debts accumulated in leveraged buyouts.Alliance Data has performed strongly since it went public in 2001, with its share price rising 400 per cent in that time. Earnings at the company last year grew 37 per cent to $190m.Blackstone’s offer values the company at about 29 times earnings last year, indicating the high premium private equity firms are prepared to pay during the current hot deals environment.“They have done nothing but exceed expectations on an earnings front,” said David Scharf, an analyst at JMP Securities.But volatility in their share price over the last 16 months seemed to have forced the company to consider going private, as management found itself spending too much time dealing with investor relations, he said.Alliance Data was formed in 1996 following the merger of JC Penney’s transaction services business and The Limited’s credit card bank operation, after both units had been bought by venture capital firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe.It runs and markets “private label” credit cards for other retailers including mid-range clothing retailer J.Crew, jewellers Fortuna, and home furnishing store Crate & Barrel. This means that Alliance Data underwrites credit cards carrying the brand of these clients and offers their customers special loyalty deals.Aside from Alliance Data’s credit card business, it also runs loyalty programmes for companies such as Hilton and Citibank, allowing customers to redeem points accumulated for using certain services in return for rewards such as consumer electronics or holidays, and operates a joint rewards points programme for a number of different companies in Canada.Alliance Data said in a statement that its senior staff would continue to run the company. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.”By maximising the value of their investment, this agreement is clearly in the best interests of our stockholders,” said Mike Parks, Alliance Data chairman and chief executive.Alliance Data’s shares rose $15.85 or 25 per cent to $78.81 in early trading.
