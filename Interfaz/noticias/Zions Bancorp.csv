0;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2018-03-13T11:31:38Z;US regional banks powered by prospect of sector reforms;Stocks of smaller lenders outpace big rivals on hopes of bill easing regulatory burdens;Shares in some of America’s top regional banks have raced ahead of their Wall Street rivals, ahead of a key Senate vote that promises to lift some of the burdens heaped upon them in the years after the crisis.The rally comes as the Senate moves closer to passing a bipartisan bill on bank regulation, under which a key threshold for tougher oversight would be raised from the current $50bn in assets to $250bn. That should be a boon for mid-sized banks such as Silicon Valley Bank, Fifth Third, KeyCorp and Comerica, which would be released from the public stress test known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).All four banks are part of the Dow Jones mid-cap banks index, which has risen 14 per cent to a record high since the turn of the year. That is more than double the gain of the equivalent large-cap index — which includes JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, among others — and which is up 6 per cent.The bill led by Mike Crapo, Republican senator from Idaho, may mark the biggest rollback of banking regulation since the financial crisis. Eight years after the Dodd-Frank Act targeted excesses at the “too big to fail” banks, its supporters say, it is high time to grant relief to smaller banks swept up in that maelstrom of post-crisis rulemaking.Richard Hunt, president and chief executive of the Washington-based Consumer Bankers Association, says that many of his members in the $50bn to $250bn bracket were looking forward to re-investing the huge sums of money they are spending on compliance. “I can assure you they’re not a systemic risk to the US economy,” he says. The most obvious winners would be regional banks in the $50bn to $100bn bracket, which would immediately be freed from all of the Federal Reserve’s “enhanced prudential standards” — tougher capital and liquidity requirements, leverage and lending limits, mandatory risk committees and resolution plans, as well as the annual stress test.One such bank is Zions Bancorp of Salt Lake City, which has $66bn in assets. Harris Simmons, its chief executive, keeps a 28-inch stack of papers on the credenza in his office, to impress on visiting senators and congressmen the sheer scale of the effort to comply with the Fed’s stress test. [The current set-up is like] killing an ant with a sledgehammerThe paperwork — 22 volumes in total, running to 12,500 pages — was what the bank submitted to the Fed in 2015, as it tried to demonstrate to the regulator that it had a strong enough grip on its operations to survive a catastrophic shock to the system. “I like to show them what we’re talking about, when we talk about CCAR,” says Mr Simmons.Banks between $100bn and $250bn in assets, meanwhile, will get a slightly inferior deal: exempted from the tougher standards 18 months after the date of the bill’s enactment, but still facing “periodic” stress tests. And the Fed will retain the authority to apply any prudential standard it deems necessary, during this off-ramp period and beyond.Still, that is better than the current set-up, which is like “killing an ant with a sledgehammer”, says Bruce van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, a $152bn-in-assets bank based in Providence, Rhode Island. CCAR is “‘busy work’ that doesn’t add a lot of value”, he says. “I’d love to free those resources and have those folks working as data scientists, to understand how we can serve our customers better.”The dozen banks in the Dow Jones mid-cap US banks index are Signature, Comerica, Citizens, Regions, M&T, Silicon Valley Bank, CIT, Fifth Third, Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp, First Republic and Zions. They all have less than $250bn in assets.The large-cap index includes JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, US Bancorp, PNC, SunTrust and BB&T. All bar the last two have more than $250bn in assets.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson
1;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2015-12-29T16:00:15Z;Activists take aim at muddling midsized banks;US lenders generating subpar returns face pressure to merge;Midsized banks be warned: muddling along with subpar returns will no longer cut it.Dozens of regional lenders in the US, from People’s United of Bridgeport, Connecticut to Umpqua Holdings of Portland, Oregon, are at present making less than a 10 per cent return on equity. All should listen out for a knock on the door from PL Capital Advisors, a New Jersey-based activist determined to shake up a flabby and fragmented part of the banking sector.PL, which made its name forcing change at small, community-focused banks, is about to launch a new fund to go after bigger targets, seeking to exploit disenchantment with feeble profits among institutional investors and a friendlier regulatory attitude toward mergers.Other activists are preparing for battle, from Basswood Capital Management and Stillwell Value, both New York hedge funds, to Seidman & Associates of New Jersey.Now that banks have steadied themselves after the crisis, there is a sense of “back to basics,” says Rich Lashley, one of PL’s two principals. “More and more [merger] discussions are going on behind the scenes. Everyone is trying to figure out if they are a buyer or a seller.”Years of low growth, ultra-easy monetary policy and post-crisis regulations have squeezed profits for hundreds of American banks, forcing them to rely on cutting costs to improve margins. But many of the 1,156 publicly listed lenders are still posting returns well below their cost of capital, despite running down expenses as far as they will go. The obvious solution? Merge — or at least find very good reasons not to.“Banks need to stop kidding themselves that [higher interest] rates are going to save them,” says Nathan Stovall, an analyst at SNL Financial. “Hope is not a strategy.”Observers note that the backdrop for the activists has improved. Seven years on from the depths of the Lehman crisis, regulators still seem opposed to deals involving JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup or Bank of America, which remain under pressure to shrink and become less complex. But the banks beneath them appear to have a green light to get bigger.One Wall Street dealmaker notes that BB&T of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has done three chunky acquisitions in a little over a year. He concludes that the US Federal Reserve wants to see more “super-regional” lenders challenging US Bancorp, PNC Financial Services and Capital One beneath the top tier.“If I’m [Daniel] Tarullo, I want ten of these guys, not three,” he says, referring to the Fed’s lead banking supervisor.In one successful strike for activism, New York Community Bancorp agreed a $2bn deal in October with New York-based Astoria Financial. Astoria had been targeted by Basswood, which disclosed a 9.22 per cent stake in July and said it had requested a board seat. In its filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Basswood argued that Astoria had “substantial opportunities . . . to take steps to enhance shareholder value.”More deals are beginning to flow. Since the end of September, New York’s M&T Bank was cleared to complete a $3.7bn merger with Hudson City, a regional rival, after a three-year wait, while KeyCorp of Cleveland announced a $4bn tie-up with Buffalo-based First Niagara.First Niagara, a $39bn-in-assets bank which had achieved a double-digit ROE in just one of the past 20 years, is a “classic example” of the kind of subpar performer PL is planning to go after, according to Mr Lashley of PL. He says he aims to raise about $200m from rich individuals, and is ready to team up with other activist funds to increase his negotiating power.If you want to get honey you can’t kick over the beehiveOthers on PL’s potential hit-list — between $5bn and $75bn in assets, and a single-digit ROE — include Comerica, a Dallas-based lender getting to grips with the oil slump, and Zions Bancorp, a Salt Lake City-based bank which the Fed judged to be short of capital last year. All told, that group of 79 lenders accounts for $1.18tn of assets, or about one-tenth of the listed US banking sector.Activism in bank stocks poses particular challenges. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, no investor can accrue a stake of more than 10 per cent in a bank without first becoming a bank itself. That has encouraged fund managers to take small stakes in their targets, often appealing to managers behind closed doors rather than shaking fists in public.“If you want to get honey you can’t kick over the beehive,” says Christopher Marinac, co-founder of FIG Partners, an Atlanta-based research and advisory boutique.That is the modus operandi of Larry Seidman of Seidman & Associates, a Parsippany, New Jersey-based firm which has challenged dozens of bank management teams over the years.Now that regulatory requirements have “dramatically increased,” he says, it is easier to make the case that executives need to consider radical action.At these kind of size levels, in this kind of environment, “you’ve got to be really, really good to earn a decent ROE. And if you can’t, you have an obligation as a director to do something about it.”
2;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2015-03-01T15:51:40Z;Citigroup prepares for ‘stress test’ results;Bank and executives under pressure to pass Federal Reserve examination;Three top Citigroup executives are facing a critical hurdle this month, according to senior figures at the bank, as it prepares for the results of a “stress test” by the US Federal Reserve.A year ago Citi became one of a handful of banks to have its plans for dividends and stock buybacks rejected by the Fed, on the grounds that it had inadequate processes in place for assessing its capital needs in the event of a severe recession or a market meltdown.If the bank were to fail again, chief executive Mike Corbat, chief financial officer John Gerspach and Brian Leach, head of risk, would be under strong pressure from investors to step down, said two executives who spoke separately, on condition of anonymity.Analysts say there would also be little sympathy from Citi’s board towards Mr Corbat and his fellow executives, if they flunk another examination.“As difficult and as opaque as the process is, it is the CEO’s job to pass it,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA.The Fed launched its two-part test in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial crisis to ensure that banks have enough capital to absorb losses and support operations during times of extreme stress, without burdening the taxpayer. Under the test, which became an annual event in 2011, banks with total assets of more than $50bn have to submit their capital-distribution plans to the Fed for approval. Some 31 banks are under the microscope this year.Last March, Citi was judged to have enough capital to withstand the toughest of the Fed’s scenarios, but failed to clear a more significant hurdle — a qualitative test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) — announced the following week. The verdict came as details of a $400m fraud in Citi’s Mexican arm began to emerge, stirring speculation that the Fed might fault the bank’s controls.Yet on the day that the Fed announced it had failed Citi, Mr Corbat was on a business trip in South Korea, prompting criticism from analysts and investors that the bank had not taken the test seriously enough. In the latter half of last year, Citi spent $180m on a big compliance push, while the chief executive paid several personal visits to Fed officials in New York and Washington.“We’ve worked towards what we would want to be an unqualified pass, both qualitatively as well as quantitatively,” Mr Corbat told investors last month. “We felt that we knew what it was we needed to do.”Most analysts suspect that Citi will have done enough to win approval for its capital plans on 11 March. But they note that the regulator’s methods remain something of a mystery, with little guidance on how the Fed sorts winners from losers.As difficult and as opaque as the process is, it is the CEO’s job to pass [the CCAR]Three other banks besides Citi failed the test on qualitative grounds last year: Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and HSBC. Zions Bancorp, a Utah-based bank, failed the quantitative part of the test, known as the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing.“It’s a total black box,” said Pri de Silva, an analyst at CreditSights.A former Fed official closely involved in the development of the CCAR describes the process as a “mixture of art and science,” aimed at putting the onus on banks to demonstrate that they have developed sophisticated capital-planning processes that account for their unique risks, rather than providing them with a series of boxes to tick. “They explicitly don’t want to teach to the test,” the former official said.
3;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2014-03-27T00:41:46Z;Fed rejects Citi’s 2014 dividend and stock buyback plans;Stress tests also fault US units of HSBC, RBS and Santander;The Federal Reserve rejected the capital plans of five large banks including Citigroup as part of its annual stress test, clearing Bank of America and Goldman Sachs only after they agreed to lower buyback and dividend proposals.The Fed widened the scope of its study this year by examining 30 large banks, rejecting the capital plans of the US units of HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander, as well as Zions Bancorp, a Utah-based lender that last week failed the first round of the two-part stress test.The test measures the strength of the US financial system in a crisis scenario but it also governs the ability of banks to pay dividends and share buybacks. Analysts estimate US banks and financial companies planned to return more than $80bn in capital to shareholders over the next year.The Fed’s willingness to veto foreign bank subsidiaries’ capital plans may ring alarm bells in London and Frankfurt.Barclays and Deutsche Bank were not part of this year’s stress tests but will be in the future. Their large New York investment banks will draw scrutiny from Fed officials, with any negative results potentially affecting capital distributions within the groups. The Fed singled out Santander in particular for “widespread and significant deficiencies” across the bank’s US processes.The blow to Citi comes in spite of the money and attention devoted to capital planning under chief executive Michael Corbat who was brought in to bolster internal controls after the bank failed the test two years ago.Citi had planned a $6.4bn buyback programme by the first quarter of 2015 and intended to increase its quarterly common stock dividend from 1 cent to 5 cents, the bank said. It is yet to resubmit its lower capital return plans to the Fed.“We are deeply disappointed by the Fed’s decision,” Mr Corbat said. “The additional capital actions represented a modest level of capital return and still allowed Citi to exceed the required threshold on a quantitative basis.”In objecting to Citi’s plans, the Fed cited “inadequate” improvement in areas flagged as needing more attention and finding fault with Citi’s ability to estimate revenue and loss projections under a stress scenario.“When viewed together, they raise sufficient concerns regarding the overall reliability of Citigroup’s capital planning process to warrant an objection,” the Fed said.We are deeply disappointed by the Fed’s decision. The additional capital actions represented a modest level of capital return and still allowed Citi to exceed the required threshold on a quantitative basisThe rejection of the US units’ capital plans of Santander, RBS and HSBC is an embarrassing blow, and could delay the planned initial public offering of Citizens, RBS’s US retail network, which had been expected before the summer.RBS, in which the UK government holds an 81 per cent stake, is counting on a sale of Citizens to rebuild its capital, which fell close to regulatory minimums after it suffered heavy losses of more than £8bn last year.It is the first time the Fed has put foreign-owned banks through the process. The regulator said it often objects to banks’ debut plans, adding that the objections were of a qualitative nature – concerning the banks’ controls and models, rather than the level of capital they hold.The banks that failed must resubmit their plans “following substantial remediation of the issues that led to the objections,” the Fed said. Citi and the three foreign-owned units met the minimum regulatory requirement of a tier one capital ratio of 5 per cent in the stress test’s first round last week.Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA in New York, said: “It’s looking more like the old Citigroup based on this reduced pace of restructuring, the poor regulatory relations and the subdued response to shareholders.”The four US units of foreign institutions that were rejected on a qualitative basis can pay dividends or buy back shares at a level similar to the previous year’s payout, but they cannot increase those levels.
4;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2014-03-26T23:35:15Z;Fed looks beyond banks’ financial target;;Banks on both sides of the Atlantic are learning the hard way that hitting the financial targets in the Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests may not be enough.Four of the five banks that had their capital plans rejected on Wednesday, crimping their ability to deploy their cash on dividends and share buybacks, met the headline number of a 5 per cent minimum tier one common capital ratio.Yet the central bank still punished Citigroup and the US units of HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander on “qualitative” measures such as their ability to project how another financial crisis would affect their revenues, and what losses they would suffer.The Fed’s calculation took in whether banks are appropriately addressing potential risks, the strength of their capital planning and risk management practices, and corporate governance issues. Only one bank, Utah-based Zions Bancorp, was rejected because it failed to meet the minimum tier one common capital ratio of 5 per cent.“Past stress tests were largely pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey exercises – that is, a big bank hit the capital number and it won the [Fed’s] blessing to pay dividends,” said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics.“Now, looking more broadly at qualitative factors, the [Fed] is making the tests far more rigorous and demanding – a good thing since capital models are complex and don’t always stand up under real stress.”Analysts describe the qualitative measures as something of a “black box”, leaving investors uncertain over the specific shortfalls that may leave a bank on the wrong side of the line.The Fed gave banks time to assess its analysis before publishing it, providing them with preliminary results of its capital analysis to give them a few days to make cuts to their capital plans before it released the results on Wednesday.Goldman Sachs and Bank of America only received approval from the Fed after lowering their planned payout to investors in a resubmission of its capital proposals. Their original capital plans would have brought them under the minimum regulatory criteria, which include a 4 per cent leverage ratio.Bank of America agreed on Wednesday to a $9.5bn settlement with a US housing regulator, as its former chief executive agreed in a separate case to a three-year ban from serving as an officer or director of a public company.BofA’s pact with the Federal Housing Finance Agency is the largest payout to a single regulator over misleading mortgage sales practices in the run-up to the financial crisis.Continue . ..Under the revised plans, BofA’s leverage ratio rose to 4.1 per cent, compared to the initial 3.9 per cent. Goldman’s leverage ratio improved to 4.2 per cent, from 3.9 per cent.The Fed’s announcement was the trigger for many banks that were given the all-clear to reveal their 2014 capital plans for the first time. JPMorgan said it would increase its dividend from 38 cents to 40 cents per share from the second quarter of this year and implement a $6.5bn share buyback plan in the 12 months from April 1.Morgan Stanley said its plans include share repurchases of up to $1bn beginning in the second quarter, in addition to doubling its dividend to 10 cents per share.BofA said it would increase its dividend from 1 cent to 5 cents per share – its first dividend increase since 2007 – and initiate a new $4bn stock repurchase programme, replacing a buyback plan from last year that expires on Monday.Goldman did not disclose details of its capital plans but the bank’s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, said its proposal “provides flexibility to manage our capital resources dynamically and return excess capital to our shareholders.”Wells Fargo said it planned to raise its dividend by almost 17 per cent to 35 cents per share for the second quarter. The bank’s board also approved adding 350m more shares to its stock repurchase plans.Even as the banks’ recovery from the financial crisis allows them to pay out increasing sums to shareholders, the publication of the stress tests – on the same day as BofA announced its latest multibillion-dollar settlement – is a reminder of the legacy of regulatory scrutiny that stemmed from that crisis.“Big brother banking is bigger than ever,” Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA, said of the regulators’ role in the sector.Many investors are buying bank stocks again to gain longer-term exposure to the US economy and a recovering housing market, rather than focusing on dividends. But the 5 per cent fall in Citi’s stock after hours was also a reminder of the short-term reputational damage that can stem from falling foul of regulators’ raised expectations.
5;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2014-03-26T23:05:17Z;Citigroup: stressed out;Fed vetoes bank’s planned payout for second time in three years;"Stressful, indeed, particularly for Citigroup. The Federal Reserve rejected its planned payout to shareholders as part of an annual two-part assessment of the US’ biggest banks. That marks Citigroup’s second veto as part of the so-called stress tests after a rejection two years ago. Citigroup was not the only bank whose dividend and buyback plans were thwarted. Four others – US units of HSBC, RBS and Santander as well as Zions Bancorp also had plans denied, but Citigroup was the only US megabank. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reduced their original payout requests, but then won approval.In the second leg of the tests, the Fed examines whether banks can maintain a Tier 1 common ratio of 5 per cent including planned dividends and buybacks. Based on the numbers, Citigroup met the requirement. But regulators also scrutinise things like capital planning processes. Here the Fed objected to Citigroup’s ability to project revenue and losses under a stress scenario, for example, and there were deficiencies in areas that had previously been flagged.For shareholders, it is disappointing that the bank cannot boost the payout at least for now; shares fell 6 per cent in after-hours trading. Citigroup has not decided when to resubmit a plan. BofA also exited the crisis in worse shape than rivals and like Citigroup was holding its dividend at 1c, but BofA got the go-ahead for an increase to 5c. Fresh concerns about Citigroup’s processes are worrisome. They follow news of alleged fraud at the Banamex unit in Mexico and subpoenas over compliance with anti-money laundering requirements. None of this helps repair an image still tarnished by the crisis. The previous stress test stumble was a part of Vikram Pandit’s downfall, which no doubt the current chief executive Mike Corbat is well aware of.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
6;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2014-03-23T17:33:40Z;Zions Bancorp: stressed out;The Fed’s test leaves Utah bank facing a capital raising;Zions Bancorporation may be feeling a bit stressed out. It was the only one of 30 banks to fail the annual stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve to gauge resilience in a severe economic and market downturn. To ease the situation, Zions can sell some assets. But the bank and its shareholders also face the prospect of it possibly having to raise common equity capital. And that is hardly relaxing.The Utah-based community bank, which has $56bn of assets, said that under the Fed’s hypothetical financial disaster scenario it had much higher commercial real estate losses, greater risk-weighted assets and lower pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue than it had projected. The bank’s Tier 1 common ratio fell as low as 3.6 per cent, according to the Fed, versus the 5 per cent minimum required. Based on RWAs of about $45bn, that represents a capital shortfall of more than $600m.Zions has collateralised debt obligations that it has already been selling and offloading its remaining $1bn or so would help. Some of the CRE portfolio could also be securitised or sold, reducing the credit losses in the adverse scenario, but too much and it would have the counter-effect of hurting revenue. That leaves selling shares. Evercore, for instance, sees a combination of selling down the CDO portfolio and a common equity raise of up to $300m as most likely. That could be about 5 per cent dilutive.And Zions’ stock on Friday fell, you guessed it, about 5 per cent to $31. For Zions, the long-term picture is positive. The bank has offices in Arizona, California and Nevada, and is poised to benefit as those areas, which were hard hit in the real estate downturn of 2007 to 2009, recover alongside an improving economy. But in the near term, the market for Zions shares is unlikely to calm down – until its plans to appease regulators on its capital position become clearer.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
7;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2013-12-27T21:27:07Z;Regulators eye exemption to part of Volcker;;US regulators are considering an exemption to part of the Volcker rule which has triggered a legal challenge from smaller banks worried that it will hurt their profits.The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they were “reviewing whether [such a move] would be appropriate and consistent” with broader regulatory reforms.The Volcker rule– named after the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker – is aimed mainly at shutting down the proprietary trading desks that the largest Wall Street banks use to take positions with their own funds.However, it became clear this month that smaller banks were also being affected by the new rule that was recently ratified by regulators. Zions Bancorp, a Utah-based bank, announced it would have to take a $387m charge to write down the value of trust preferred securities.Smaller banks are some of the biggest owners of these securities, which fall under the definition of a prohibited “covered fund” as part of the Volcker rule.Zions said it would have to sell its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations backed by trust preferrers. Making them available for sale means the bank has to value them at their latest market level, triggering the charge.The American Bankers Association filed a legal challenge on Christmas Eve, requesting that the provision was blocked on the grounds that it was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”.Regulators had already released guidance to banks, explaining they might be able to restructure the securities rather than engage in a costly sale.On Friday they went further in new guidance, released in advance of a Monday deadline for them to respond to the legal complaint filed in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.The four agencies said they would address the matter no later than January 15. Their accountants said this would still allow banks to adjust their final 2013 accounts.Smaller banks have a lot of local political power in the US and had already persuaded members of Congress to give them a raft of exemptions from the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms.
8;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2013-12-18T17:55:33Z;US banks urge Volcker rule clarification;;"US banks are urging regulators to clarify an aspect of the Volcker rule that relates to their ability to hold certain complex securities amid rising fears that smaller lenders will have to sell the assets and take billions of dollars worth of losses.The issue centres on trust preferred securities (TruPS) that were sold by small banks and insurance companies in the run-up to the financial crisis and often repackaged into collateralised debt obligations known as “TruPS CDOs”.While banks are still digesting the final version of the 800-page Volcker rule, some believe that it mandates them to divest their remaining holdings of TruPS CDOs. People familiar with the matter estimated that as many as 300 banks may be affected by the issue.Zions Bancorp, Utah’s biggest bank, became the first casualty of Volcker’s purported impact on TruPS CDOs when it said this week that it would take a $387m post-tax charge on its portfolio of the securities.The regional bank is one of the biggest holders of the specialised assets, but many other regional banks still own portfolios of TruPS CDOs – leading to fears of widespread losses if other lenders are forced to follow Zions’ example.Many of the banks’ remaining TruPS CDOs are classified as “held-to-maturity”, meaning they do not have to be marked to market. Reclassifying them as “available-for-sale”, in preparation for an eventual divestment, would lead to paper losses and potentially impact their regulatory capital ratios.“Even though the [Volcker] provisions of the regulations are scheduled to go into effect in 2015, accounting practices triggered by implementing regulations could subject many banks to imminent financial losses,” the American Bankers Association said in a letter sent to banking regulators on Wednesday.US regulators may respond as early as today to address the concerns, according to people familiar with the matter. Regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, declined to comment.Data from SNL Financial shows that even larger banks still hold some of the complex securities. Citigroup and Wells Fargo own $218m and $595m worth of TruPS CDOs, respectively, which could be affected by the rule.In a separate letter sent on Wednesday, the American Association of Bank Directors, which represents directors of smaller US banks, argued that the Volcker rule had been misinterpreted and does not actually require banks to divest their TruPS CDOs at all.Regulators’ interpretation of the Volcker rule “has engendered hasty conclusions in the banking industry,” the AABD wrote. “We don’t believe that the issue only affects a small number of community banks. Based on calls we have received so far, it is a far more significant issue.""The disagreement over Volcker’s treatment of the complex securities underscores the difficulty banks now face in interpreting the final rule and applying it to their businesses."
9;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland.

10;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2013-12-16T18:44:05Z;Zions bank becomes early Volcker casualty;;One of the first casualties of the Volcker rule is a small Utah-based bank that is far from the large Wall Street institutions that regulators had sought to rein in.Zions Bancorp said on Monday it would no longer be able to hold certain types of securitised debt as it seeks to comply with the Volcker rule, raising concerns about the cost of the new regulations to smaller banks.As a result of the Volcker rule’s treatment of collateralised debt obligations comprised of trust preferred securities, Zions has now marked these assets to market value, triggering a $387m charge to earnings.Regional US banks snapped up and sold billions of dollars’ worth of CDOs backed by trust preferred securities before the crisis. Banks found the preferred securities attractive because they combined debt and equity characteristics and had tax and accounting benefits.Zions, one of the largest holders of so-called “TruPS” CDOs, had hoped to hold on to its portfolio until the market value of the bundled debt increased. The bank on Monday said it would reclassify all affected CDOs on its books in preparation for possible sale.“This is not something that we had anticipated nor do we think we reasonably could have anticipated based on what was in the proposed rule,” Doyle Arnold, Zions chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call.The bank is reclassifying the CDOs from “held to maturity” (HTM) to “available for sale” (AFS). Gains and losses on securities that are held as AFS feed into financial companies’ regulatory capital ratios under incoming Basel III rules.Zions estimated that reclassifying its portfolio of CDOs to AFS would result in its tier one common equity ratio falling from 10.47 to 9.74 per cent.Banks such as Zions are counting the costs of legacy investments made in the lead-up to the financial crisis. “We haven’t bought any CDOs really since pre-crisis . . . and certainly wouldn’t touch any today,” Mr Arnold said.The move by Zions also highlights the importance of accounting classification when tabulating the value of banks’ securities portfolios, which have been growing as some banks seek out higher-yielding assets to offset lower profit margins from lending.“I don’t think others are too far behind,” said one lawyer for regional banks. “There could be a ground swell and this could become a real problem.”A fire sale of TruPS CDOs would further depress prices of the assets, potentially leading to more charges and regulatory capital hits for regional lenders. “We’re not going to just go out and dump those things tomorrow,” Mr Arnold told analysts.Regulators said they would watch for possible negative effects on the economy and markets because of the Volcker rule and could go back and revise certain aspects if they agree that is necessary.

The S&P 500 financial sector stocks led all other major sector indices, up 5.9 per cent for the week.The KBW Bank Index, which comprises 24 large and regional commercial banks, has risen 8.8 per cent to 49.76 since last Friday. Bank of America was the leading individual bank stock on the index, up about 19 per cent in that period.The bank, which passed the stress tests but said it would not return capital to shareholders on Tuesday, gained another 6 per cent to $9.79 on Friday.Zions Bancorporation, the Utah-based bank, has climbed 17.3 per cent to $22.28 since last Friday as the bank said this week that it planned to repay part of its $1.4bn in US government bailout funds.But not all analysts were convinced that the S&P’s rise could continue into next week. The Bespoke Investment Group said in a note to clients: “While it’s just a number, 1,400 will probably act as psychological resistance in the near term, especially since the S&P 500 is currently two standard deviations above its 50-day moving average.“A market in an uptrend typically trades in overbought territory for long periods but, once it gets to two standard deviations and above, we usually see some sort of pullback, or at least a pause,” it added. “But while we’re expecting some sort of pause in the short term, we remain bullish on the long-term prospects of this market.”JPMorgan was down 0.3 per cent to $44.57 on Friday but has risen more than 8.3 per cent this week after it announced plans to buy back $15bn of its shares and increase its dividend by a fifth. Other major banks – Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo – added more than 6 per cent each on the week, hitting their highest points in the year to date.Goldman Sachs climbed almost 5 per cent this week to $122.93. The investment bank was slightly behind its competitors in gains after a former derivatives trader resigned from the bank and criticised its culture as “toxic”.Volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, continued to fall, down 15.4 per cent to below 15.The Vix, or Wall Street “fear gauge”, climbed above 20 last week as fears of global economic woes crept back into the market.Those fears abated this week as confidence from the banking sector drove markets up.The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down slightly to 13,232.55 and the Nasdaq Composite Index was down fractionally to 3,055.26. Both indices rose to cyclical highs this week.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the Nasdaq, has retreated by 2.4 per cent since crossing the $600 threshold in early trading on Thursday. The iPad maker was 0.3 per cent higher at $585.57. IBM, the information technology company, hit an all-time high on Friday, gaining more than 3 per cent on the week to $206.01. The company has surged since Warren Buffett revealed that he took a stake last November.BlackBerry maker Research In Motion added 6.9 per cent to its gains from Thursday to reach $14.38. The company has recovered some of its losses for the year to date but is still down about 1 per cent.Sears Holdings, parent company of the department store chain, was down 1.1 per cent to $82.55 as it reported that it would close 62 retail stores in the first half of the year to reduce expenses.Fertiliser producers were among the day’s best performers. Mosaic, the potash and concentrated phosphate nutrient maker, climbed 4.1 per cent to $57.51.Vincent Andrews, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said he envisioned “a supportive backdrop for agriculture equities”. He added: “February North America potash producer inventory declined for the first time since October 2011 as production cuts were in excess of demand deferral. We expect a very strong US spring and [about a] 10 per cent relief rally as potash sentiment inevitably flip-flops once product inevitably moves in the US.”Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, one of the world’s largest fertiliser producers, rose 7.1 per cent to $45.91. While another fertiliser maker, CF Industries, gained 1.7 per cent to $184.21.

The bank said in a statement that it expected earnings for the first quarter of 2012 to beat initial estimates.Zions Bancorporation soared 10.5 per cent to $21.58 as the bank said it planned to issue $600m in senior debt to help repay $1.4bn in US government bailout funds.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,394.28, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1 per cent to 13,194.10, led higher by Bank of America.The bank, which passed the tests but said it would not return money to shareholders at present, climbed 4.1 per cent to $8.84 with its shares now up more than 59 per cent in the year to date.American Express was the second-leading gainer on the index, up 3.5 per cent to $56.15. The world’s third-largest payment networks company said it would boost dividends by 11 per cent to 20 cents and buy back up to $5bn of shares.The Walt Disney Company was leading the fallers, down 1.2 per cent to $43.48. Earthmover Caterpillar dropped 0.9 per cent to $112.27.The Dow Jones Transportation Average was down 1.4 per cent to 5,180.39 as gas prices hit a record for 2012. The average price of regular unleaded gas struck $3.81 with its impact taking a toll on airlines and rail companies.Southwest Airlines was the worst off among airlines, down 2.7 per cent to $8.18. United Continental Holdings, the parent company of United Airlines, fell 2.1 per cent to $19.42, and Delta Air Lines shed 0.1 per cent to $9.30.Norfolk Southern Corporation, the Virginia-based railroad company, dropped 3.1 per cent to $64.95. Rail-based transportation supplier CSX Corporation fell 2.9 per cent to $20.20.The Nasdaq Composite index was up fractionally to 3,040.73 as Apple continued to add to its gains.The most heavily weighted stock on the index climbed again into record territory, gaining 3.8 per cent to $589.58. David Evanston, analyst at Canaccord, raised the 12-month price target for Apple to $710.“Since we attended the iPad launch last week, our checks have indicated record pre-orders with wait times for shipping iPad models now reaching 2-3 weeks …Apple remains a top pick,” he said.Netflix, the streaming and home DVD delivery provider, fell 2.3 per cent to $103.90. Its shares were hit by news that Walmart would let customers buy online access to movies they have already purchased.
13;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2012-01-24T21:18:07Z;Wall Street hampered by soft earnings;Doubt from Europe drags markets;An earnings miss by Zions Bancorporation highlighted the ongoing risk to US banks from souring loan securities.Utah-based Zions, which owns a group of banks in southern and western states, fell 7.6 per cent to $17.15 as it booked a $12.1m, or four cents a share, charge on collateralised debt obligation securities in the fourth quarter.Overall per share earnings of 24 cents were 9 cents lower than expected.Zions followed the trend in fourth-quarter bank results, reporting a fall in non-performing assets over the fourth quarter and reducing reserves set aside for losses from loans made by the bank itself.But Zions recognised losses on securities the bank holds from CDOs, instruments which issue securities backed by the debt of low-rated companies.$4.3m of the CDO losses resulted from the bankruptcy of a homebuilder, while Zions also said its CDO portfolio “had exposure to 24 of the 92 bank failures that occurred in 2011”.The CDO charge was four times greater than expected by Stifel Nicolaus analysts, who removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, although Brian Zabora at Stifel, said no other bank he covered had a portfolio of CDO securities, “so this issue should be pretty unique to Zion”.Zion’s report added to a gloomy start to earnings season by financials, which are so far showing year-on-year earnings growth of 10.4 per cent, well short of consensus analyst expectations of 20.7 per cent at the start of the season“With financial sector heavyweights generally …dragging down early fourth-quarter results, the rest of the S&P 500 will have work to do to drag index earnings back toward expectations in the weeks ahead,” said Gina Martin Adams, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo.The S&P 500 snapped a 5-day rally to close down 0.1 per cent at 1,314.63. The benchmark US index had opened sharply lower after Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, said it would likely declare Greece in “selective default” once the country concludes its debt restructuring, but the index pared losses on positive US economic data.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 12,675.75 but the Nasdaq Composite index ticked up 0.1 per cent to 2,786.64Stocks were further boosted after the close of trading, when Apple reported record fiscal first-quarter profits and revenues, easily surpassing analyst expectations as iPhone sales surged. That sent Nasdaq futures up 24½ points in after-hours trading.Apple rose as much as 12 per cent to $468 in after-hours after it closed in regular trading at $420.41, down 1.6 per cent.Tech stocks had already outperformed after fourth-quarter sales at Western Digital, the hard disc drive manufacturer came in significantly above expectations, given the disruption to the company’s supply chain caused by flooding in Thailand. Shares rose 6.3 per cent to $36.88.“Our thesis that WD can systematically recover and gain share is playing out much faster than anticipated with much higher profit,” Ben Reitzes at Barclays Capital told clients.That helped semiconductor manufacturers, which build components for hard disc drives, and the Philadelphia Sox index of semiconductor stocks climbed 0.4 per cent.Data storage computer manufacturer EMC Corp climbed 7.3 per cent to $25.14 as fourth-quarter earnings rose almost a third year-on-year. Disruption to Western Digital’s supply chain had left EMC facing higher prices for hard disc drives, “but the company has done a great job of getting its allocation of disc drives without suffering too much margin degradation,” said Jason Noland at RW Baird.Nasdaq futures accelerated further in after-hours trading, after Apple reported fourth-quarter earnings that were 30 per cent above consensus expectations, and also offered strong guidance for the current quarter.Verizon Communications fell 1.6 per cent to $37.79 after reporting an overall net loss of $2.02bn, hampered by pension costs and lower margins on smartphone sales.Investors continued to express doubts in the new management team at Research In Motion, sending shares in the BlackBerry handset manufacturer down 3.5 per cent to 15.01, barely 50 cents higher than they started the year.Investment bank Jefferies said RIM is at a “cost disadvantage” compared with other smartphone producers and that significant restructuring will be necessary to compete in the future.McDonald’s reported strong fourth-quarter earnings with net income rising 11 per cent from a year ago but share sold off 2.2 per cent to $98.75.Insurance group Travelers narrowly missed analyst estimates, logging $618m of net income in the fourth quarter compared with forecasts of $620m but its shares fell 3.8 per cent to $58.00 for the worst performance in the Dow Jones.Kimberly-Clark also succumbed to disappointment surrounding its fourth-quarter earnings. The maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies reported that net income fell 19 per cent from a year ago and that it expected a “difficult” start to 2012. Its shares were off 1.7 per cent to $72.27.Coach climbed 5.8 per cent to $67.97 as the luxury retailer defied the gloom cast by Tiffany, which earlier this year reported a year-on-year fall in holiday sales at its flagship New York store. Same-store sales at Coach’s North American stores were up 8.8 per cent.Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, fell 1.7 per cent to $36.86 after fourth-quarter earnings missed analyst estimates because of lower output at its Australian operations.
14;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2011-12-30T21:41:34Z;US stocks escape worst of eurozone crisis;;The S&P 500 ended the year exactly 0.04 points lower than it started, although analysts found cause for comfort.“Given all the negatives that the market has had thrown at it, even to end the year flat is a victory for the US market,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “It shows the attraction of US companies in turbulent times.”Despite a gut-wrenching August, when 4 per cent daily moves in the S&P 500 briefly became the norm, Wall Street escaped the worst of the eurozone crisis which wreaked havoc elsewhere, as the FTSE All World Index ended the year down 9.7 per cent.At 1,257.60, the S&P 500 had recovered 14 per cent from October lows, but was 8 per cent short of April highs.Once dividends are factored in, financials and materials aside, every broad sector of the S&P 500 has delivered gains this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the year up 5.5 per cent to 12,217.56, although a few big stocks skew the price-weighted index. Only the Nasdaq Composite index fell over the year, 1.8 per cent to 2,605.15.The worst performing stocks tell the macro stories that preoccupied investors this year.First Solar, down 74 per cent for the year to $33.76, has seen a lucrative market for solar panels disrupted first by a glut of supply from China and second by a threatened collapse in demand from the eurozone, as governments cut back on subsidies.Computer Sciences Corp, the IT services company that fell 52.2 per cent to $23.70, has been hit by reduced government spending on outsourcing, most recently the cancellation of a contract by the UK’s National Health Service.Alpha Natural Resources, down 66 per cent to to $20.43, and US Steel Corp, off 54.7 per cent to $26.46, have been two of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500, moving 2 per cent for every percentage point move in the benchmark index.Their share prices have waxed and waned with sentiment about Chinese growth and demand for steel, which US Steel Corp makes and Alpha’s metallurgical coal is needed to manufacture, from the country’s construction industry.Homebuilder stocks rallied on resilient US economic data. Lennar Corp and DR Horton, which had seen their market capitalisations more than halve by October, ended the year up 4.9 per cent to $19.66 and 5.7 per cent to $12.61 respectively, as US construction starts and pending home sales data turned positive in November.Among the big fallers only Netflix, down 60.5 per cent to $69.29 from a peak above $200, seemed little affected by macro events. The web-streaming company, the darling of internet investors in 2010, was undone by a decision to raise prices for users who wanted to continue using its physical DVD delivery service, and an aborted attempt to spin off the DVD business altogether.Moving from individual stocks to sectors, one theme dominated the year: the collapse of financials. Down 18.4 per cent for the year, 7 percentage points more than any other sector, their weighting in the S&P 500 has slipped to just 13 per cent, barely above consumer staples, energy or healthcare stocks.The four companies which have weighed most heavily on the index – Bank of America, down 58.3 per cent to $5.56, Citigroup, 44.4 per cent to $26.31, Goldman Sachs, 46.2 per cent to $90.43 and JPMorgan Chase, 21.6 per cent to $33.25 – were all banks. Between them they wiped more than 23 points off the S&P 500, equivalent to 2 per cent of the index at the start of the year.“Looking ahead banks are not necessarily key to a rally in US equities,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers investment research, “but they could certainly be the cause of a bear market, if they were to fall fast again.”At the other end of the spectrum investors cheered the boom in shale oil, and the prospects it offers for US energy independence.Cabot Oil & Gas saw its market capitalisation double as its share closed the year at $75.90, as the company increased revenues from oil by 50 per cent in the quarter ended September 30, compared with the same period in 2010.But it was solid performances by mega-caps which had the most market impact. Apple drove the S&P 500 significantly more than any other stock, giving the index an eight point boost, as its share price climbed 25.6 per cent over the year to $405.00. ExxonMobil’s 15.9 per cent move to $84.76 gave the S&P 500 another six points, while IBM boosted the index five points, as it rose 25.3 per cent to $183.88.
15;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2011-11-25T17:21:25Z;Fed includes more banks in ‘stress tests’;;The Federal Reserve launched its third round of bank “stress tests” this week, forcing US institutions to gauge whether they could withstand a slide in the economy.For the first time every bank with more than $50bn in assets has to comply – from JPMorgan Chase to Zions Bancorporation. At stake is whether banks will be allowed to return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buy-backs.The Fed’s stress scenario is tougher than last year, including a rise in the US unemployment rate to 13 per cent. With bank stocks being buffeted by news in Europe, the central bank has also opted to make banks model a “global market shock” and a severe recession in the eurozone.Banks have until January to deliver the results of the tests, including any request for a bigger dividend, and – unlike last year – the Fed will publish the results of individual banks in March.The increased rigour could make life difficult for the banks. But analysts at Goldman Sachs said they believed most institutions were well-placed. “Reduced leverage, higher quality assets and higher capital levels relative to prior exams should help banks withstand the stress of the Fed’s exam,” they wrote.There was some evidence of greater health this week when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a bank regulator, published its quarterly snapshot of the industry, showing bank earnings jumped 49 per cent to $35.5bn. Tempering the good news was the caveat that the improvement came from banks setting aside less money to cover future losses. The Fed may be forcing banks to plan for worse but they are actually still betting on a recovery.
16;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2011-10-04T22:37:44Z;S&P 500 surges 4% after dipping into bear market;;A Financial Times report that European finance ministers are discussing co-ordinated bank recapitalisations triggered a 4 per cent surge in the S&P 500 in the last 45 minutes of trading.The S&P 500 had traded as low as 1,074.77 at the start of the day’s session, well into the bear market territory that is defined by a 20 per cent drop from its year high on April 29, but the benchmark index closed up 2.3 per cent at 1,123.94, after the FT report.Bank stocks led the rebound, with financials in the S&P 500 up 4.1 per cent, reversing an earlier fall of 2.9 per cent.Morgan Stanley closed up 12.3 per cent at $14.01, having traded beneath $12 for the first time since December 2008, earlier in the session. JPMorgan rose 6.6 per cent to $30.26 and Citigroup rose 5.5 per cent to $24.39.Regional bank stocks also surged, with Fifth Third Bancorp up 8.6 per cent to $10.64 and Zions Bancorp up 7.8 per cent to $10.64.“It’s good to see a bounce in stocks. It’s been a one-way street for several days now,” said Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management. “But volatility is so high, it’s unclear which way the market will eventually go.”Utility stocks in the S&P 500 were down 0.5 per cent, the only sector of the S&P 500 to fall.NRG Energy, the power generator and electricity supplier, fell 1.8 per cent to $19.57 after decreasing its revenue guidance for the quarter on Monday evening, citing bad weather in Texas, which interrupted supply to retail customers.Northeast Utilities System fell 2.5 per cent to $31.27 and Edison International fell 2.2 per cent to $36.30.Utility stocks also fell 2.3 per cent on Monday but before that had not had a single day’s fall of more than 2 per cent since early August as investors flocked to defensive names.The reason appeared to be the heavy selling of an exchange traded fund that tracks the S&P 500’s utility sector.The Utilities Select SPDR was down 0.5 per cent to $32.66 after three blocks of more than 300,000 shares each were traded in the morning session.By midday, 10m shares had been traded in the ETF, just short of the full-day average of 11.8m.“It looks like someone is selling off the utilities ETF,” said Angie Storozynski, energy analyst at Macquarie. “Nothing could convince me to sell utilities at the moment, it’s exactly the protection I would want right now.”Some traders speculated that the sell-off was due to an institution raising funds to cover short positions as the broader index tumbled in the morning session.Semiconductor stocks performed strongly with MEMC Electronic Materials up 9.3 per cent to $5.19, Nvidia up 9.2 per cent to $12.90 and the Philadelphia semiconductor index up almost 4.2 per cent.The moves followed the release of semiconductor sales data for August, which was not as bad as expected.Romit Shah, a Nomura analyst, warned unit growth was “sub-seasonal” and predicted “another (and likely deeper) round of estimate revisions” but stocks benefited from a relief rally.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index outperform the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The Nasdaq was up 3 per cent to 2,404.82 while the Dow was up 1.4 per cent to 10,808.18.Apple fell 0.6 per cent to $372.50 on a lukewarm reception for its latest iPhone model, the 4s, unveiled Tuesday afternoon. Jefferies analyst Peter Misek tipped the stock to turn round on Wednesday.“The surface is underwhelming because the 4s looks just like the iPhone 4, but underneath the hood there is a lot to be excited about,” he said. Mr Misek also tipped the lower priced 3gs to become a “global blockbuster,” if it is rolled out worldwide at a low price.The New York Stock Exchange was up 3.5 per cent to $22.75 on reports that the European Commission may block its merger with German exchange Deutsche Börse.Yahoo rose 6.9 per cent to $14.46 on reports that private equity house Silver Lake and Russian group Digital Sky Technologies have joined Chinese ecommerce site Alibaba in its bid for the internet gateway service.Material and energy stocks which had been sold off heavily on Monday and last week, also benefited from the late buying. Alpha Natural Resources, the Appalachian metallurgical coal miner, closed up 8.8 per cent to $17.44. Its rival Cliff Natural Resources also jumped 10.6 per cent to $53.41.
17;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2011-06-10T23:47:00Z;Federal Reserve widens net for capital tests;;"The Federal Reserve will force more banks to submit to new annual capital tests, allowing US officials to veto dividends and share buy-backs at any group with more than $50bn in assets.In a proposal on Friday, the Fed said it planned to expand the existing pool of top-tier banks subject to the capital assessment scheme from 19 to 35, drawing in the likes of Northern Trust and M&T Bank.The plan is the latest development in so-called “macro-prudential” regulation: policing the financial system as a whole for risks rather than looking at just the safety and soundness of individual banks.Stress tests carried out in 2009 on 19 banks were the prototypes for the new examinations. Those succeeded in restoring faith in the financial system after the crisis when officials published results of a detailed examination of the banks’ capital positions.This year, the Fed conducted capital assessments of the same group of institutions, ranging from Bank of America to American Express, requesting data on how they would fare in a shock economic downturn and asking them to submit capital distribution plans for approval. JPMorgan Chase was able to increase its dividend after the tests; Bank of America was not.Expanding the set of companies to those with just $50bn in assets matches the definition of a “systemically important” institution under last year’s Dodd-Frank financial reforms. These banks will be subject to a capital surcharge, on top of the requirement to maintain a 7 per cent tier one capital ratio to assets, adjusted for risk, agreed by the international Basel committee.Fed officials have said that smaller banks, such as Zions Bancorporation of Salt Lake City, the smallest bank to exceed the revised threshold, will face only a minimal additional capital requirement.There is heated debate over the capital charge for the biggest institutions, led by BofA and JPMorgan. Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor, said last Friday that staff calculations showed the charge could be anywhere between 1.4 per cent and 7 per cent. The mention of a higher than expected top end of the range sparked a sell-off this week among bank stocks.But the US Treasury is pushing for a surcharge of 2-2.5 per cent, while Fed officials do not expect the surcharge to exceed 3 per cent.US officials are trying to agree a number with international counterparts at the Basel committee before a decision is ratified by government ministers in November."

related charges. J&J was hit by $271m of charges related to its DePuy ASR, a hip replacement which had to be recalled. The stock had been losing ground since the start of the year, but after Tuesday’s gains is up 1.4 per cent year to date.Elsewhere in the sector, Forest Laboratories added 2.4 per cent to $34.10, helped by the strong results, while the wider S&P healthcare index was up 0.9 per cent.This helped the wider markets bounce higher, with the benchmark S&P 500 index closing 0.6 per cent higher at 1,312.62. This followed a 1.1 per cent loss in the previous session after S&P, the rating agency, surprised traders by lowering its outlook on US debt from “stable” to “negative”.Sentiment on Wall Street was helped by news that housing starts and permits for future home construction had risen by more than expected in March, rising 7.2 per cent from the previous month to 549,000.But the improvement was largely a bounce back from the sharply lower levels in February when the figure was depressed by the winter weather, and so did not have a profound impact in the session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent to 12,266.75 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 per cent to 2,744.97. “The market did react positively to some good earnings, but the gains were not dramatic as traders are in a cautious mood at the moment,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “The markets will likely stay in a tight 3-4 per cent trading range for the time being,” he added.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs reported profits down 72 per cent in the first quarter as the bank’s trading revenue declined and earnings were hit by a $1.64bn dividend payment to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.These results were better than analysts’ had expected, but shares in the investment bank still lost 1.3 per cent to $151.86.This weighed many financial stocks, but failed to drag down the overall sector.

The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.6 per cent, down 1.7 per cent overall since the natural disaster in Japan.Elsewhere in the technology sector Jabil Circuit, the world’s third-largest electronics manufacturing services company, was up 8.6 per cent to $20.58 after giving a third-quarter earnings forecast that exceeded analysts’ expectations.

On Tuesday shares in the industrial conglomerate declined after it forecast sales volumes at existing businesses would rise more slowly in 2011 than this year.Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation from “buy” to “neutral” and JPMorgan reiterated its “underweight” rating for 3M.“This is not about management as the durable 3M franchise is intact and has been enhanced through investment since chief executive [George] Buckley came aboard,” analysts at JP Morgan said. “This is more about an ongoing high level of expectations from a bullish sell side that has maintained stubbornly high estimates. We need to see some capitulation here.”In technology, Texas Instruments added 1 per cent to $33.75 after the US chipmaker narrowed its fourth-quarter profit and sales forecasts. But the reductions brought the company’s forecasts in line with analyst estimates and it said a recent correction in demand for its chips would be short-lived.Netflix’s chief financial officer, Barry McCarthy, resigned and will be replaced by David Wells, an internal appointment.

better than expected economic data from China.The S&P 500 closed up 1.1 per cent at 1,121.90, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,544.13 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.89 per cent higher at 2,285.71.The S&P 500 broke through its 200-day moving average and all 10 main S&P sectors rose, five by one per cent. Global regulators agreed to phase in rules for lenders to comply with their new, more stringent, capital reserves rules from January 2013 to January 2019. Todd Hagerman at Collins Stewart said on average large US banks have 8.79 per cent tier one capital, which is more than the 7 per cent equity component that Basel III will require.Keith Horowitz, an
analyst at Citigroup, added that the best capitalised of the large caps were likely to begin to return capital through dividends and
buy-backs, and he cited JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and US Bancorp as possible examples. The S&P 500 financial index led the risers, up 2.3 per cent, after the Basel III committee unveiled the new rules.Goldman Sachs added 2.7 per cent to $154.37, JPMorgan Chase climbed 3.7 per cent to $41.24 and US Bancorp was up 3.3 per cent to $23.37.

The broader industrials sector rose 1.1 per cent.Oil companies benefited from oil prices reaching a four-week high, partly due to the continuing closure of the largest oil pipeline from Canada to the Midwest of the US after a leak, and partly on the back of the Chinese economic data.ConocoPhillips rose 1.2 per cent to $55.38 and Suncor Energy was higher by 1.1 per cent to $33.26. ExxonMobil fell 0.3 per cent to $61.00 after its rating was cut from “buy” to “hold” by Deutsche Bank because of its exposure to natural gas, of which there is a surplus across the world.Xerox, the photocopy machine and document-management company, rose 7.7 per cent to $9.81 after it was reported that the share price could double as it enters the more profitable data processing, analysis and storage market."
23;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2009-04-21T23:05:04Z;US Bancorp bucks gloomy trend among regional banks;;US regional banks on Tuesday provided investors with a mixed picture of the state of the financial sector as stronger-than-expected earnings from US Bancorp helped counter the gloom resulting from big losses at Zions Bancorp.US Bancorp, based in Minnesota, reported net income of $529m, a 60 per cent increase over its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008, demonstrating that major regional players could benefit from the forces that helped generate last week’s profit announcements from the biggest US banks. But other regional banks, particularly smaller ones, did not fare as well.“I think there is some clear delineation between big healthy institutions and the plain-vanilla small-cap regional banks,” said analyst Andrew Marquardt of Fox-Pitt Kelton.“They’re having much worse results in terms of charge-offs and reserve builds.”Alabama-based Regions Financial, which cut its dividend to 1 cent per share last week, eked out a profit of 4 cents per share on earnings of $77m.Utah-based Zions surprised investors late Monday by announcing a loss of $832m, reflecting its exposure to commercial real estate.Analysts said they were impressed by US Bancorp’s increase in market share and its ability to build up reserves against future charge-offs. The bank’s stock was up 17 per cent to $18.65 in late trading.Mr Marquardt said US Bancorp’s credit reserves of $1.3bn, almost triple the amount reserved a year ago, is a healthy sign, compared with other regional banks, such as Comerica, which so far have not reserved against a similar percentage of loans.Zions was down 18 per cent in late trading.Sandler O’Neill slapped a sell rating on the stock, while Moody’s downgraded the bank’s debt ratings because of Zions’ large exposure to commercial real estate loans, as well as its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations.Mr Marquardt described KeyCorp’s results for the quarter as disappointing and questioned whether the Ohio bank would have to cut its dividend again.As for Regions, its earnings and outlook would be negatively affected in the near term by the recession, which is now hitting the south-eastern part of the US with particular ferocity, the analyst added.
24;ZION;Zions Bancorp;2008-09-23T20:57:52Z;Wall Street stocks fall amid volatility;;Developments in Washington took precedence over those on the trading floor on Tuesday, as investors’ attention turned to key congressional testimony on how to rescue the US financial system.Wall Street stocks swung in and out of negative territory throughout the hearing. A slide in oil prices and positive sentiment in the technology sector helped early on in the day to offset concerns over the likely success of the authorities’ proposed $700bn bail-out.Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary, received a cold reception when he appeared before the Senate committee, amid heightened investor anxiety that political wrangling could hamper the workings of the plan.Since the crisis worsened at the start of the month, the wider market has closely tracked the financial sector. Regional banks, among the hardest hit in the previous session, continued to weigh on Tuesday.Regions Financial fell 12,1 per cent to $13.72. Citigroup said: “While the proposed plan may put a floor on the ultimate risk facing the group, thereby lowering ‘systemic risk’, we do not believe the plan will relieve the near-term credit pressures facing RF and other banks. We expect the stock to come under selling pressure as investors refocus on operating fundamentals.”Citigroup also downgraded its recommendation on Zions Bancorporation from “buy” to “hold”. The shares in Zions fell 14.2 per cent to $40.54.General Electric fell 4.6 per cent to $24.95 after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, citing “growing fundamental pressures” at its GE Capital division.The broader markets, which opened just as the hearing began, initially rallied sharply higher.But by the close that upbeat tone had abated, with the S&P 500 down 1.6 per cent at 1,188.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.5 per cent lower at 10,854.17, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2 per cent at 2,153.34.A report from Oppenheimer served as a reminder that the Wall Street crisis is likely to have a knock-on effect on Main Street.Analysts led by Meredith Whitney wrote in a note to clients: “Credit market disruption has had underappreciated consequences on the economy, in our view.“A virtual suction of liquidity has occurred in the credit and lending markets, and consumer and corporate credit is already showing the effects. What started last summer has accelerated and intensified so much so that we believe any government bail-out plan has little hope of improving core fundamentals over the near and medium term.”Meanwhile, seasonally adjusted data showed house purchase prices dropped 0.6 per cent in July from June.Among home builders, Lennar sank 7.5 per cent to $12.71 as it reported its sixth straight quarterly loss.The materials sector led the market declines, down 3.2 per cent. Air Products and Chemicals fell 8.8 per cent to $73.22 after the hydrogen producer cut its fourth-quarter earnings estimate. Early gains were led by the technology sector, which initially rose almost 2 per cent before falling back to stand down 0.8 per cent. A loss this month of 11.4 per cent has pushed its prospective price to earnings ratio below 20.Microsoft, which has raised its quarterly dividend and on Monday unveiled plans to buy back as much as $40bn of its stock, rose 0.2 per cent to $25.44.Google, which unveiled the first smartphone powered by its Android software, fell 0.2 per cent to $429.27.Elsewhere in the sector, 3Com rallied 3.4 per cent to $2.16 on the back of positive results, helped in part by a litigation settlement. Bed Bath & Beyond fell 1.2 per cent to $30.40 ahead of quarterly earnings from the home goods retailer due after the closing bell.The fall in oil prices helped airlines and automotive stocks. Bucking that trend, General Motors reversed an early gain of 4 per cent and was down 7.4 per cent at $10.72.In mergers and acquisitions news, Bristol-Myers Squibb raised from $60 to $62 a share its offer for the part of the biotechnology group ImClone Systems that it does not already own. Shares in ImClone rose 6.9 per cent to $63.51, while Bristol-Myers was down 1.8 per cent at $20.26.

Once the world’s largest insurer by market capitalisation, shares in AIG have lost more than 40 per cent this week.Merrill Lynch slid another 12.3 per cent to $17.05, taking its loss to a third of its value at the start of the week.Meanwhile, shares in Lehman itself fell 13.5 per cent, in part due to doubts over whether the US Treasury would fund a deal. Over the week, shares in the 158-year-old institution have slumped 77.5 per cent.Washington Mutual, which has sustained heavy losses in recent sessions, lost 3.5 per cent on Friday to $2.73 even after the lender said it would set aside less for bad loans in the third quarter. Over the week, it has lost 36 per cent.General Electric, one of the world’s largest insurers of debt, fell 5 per cent on Friday. MBIA, the monoline bond insurer, lost 5.1 per cent, taking its decline over the week to 21.8 per cent.Still, Zions Bancorporation offered at least some comfort to badly hit regional banks after successfully raising capital. The shares rose 11.5 per cent to $37.48 on Friday.The S&P 500 dipped in and out of negative territory throughout the day but had edged up 0.2 per cent at 1,251.70 by the close. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1 per cent at 2,261.27 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent at 11,421.99.Automotive stocks helped prop up the market on the prospect of low-interest government loans to help the sector. Over the week, General Motors and Ford climbed 21.5 per cent and 11.3 per cent to $13.01 and $4.91, respectively.Material, energy and utility stocks also gained on Friday on the back of rising commodity prices.In a memorable week, the benchmark S&P 500 finished only marginally in positive territory, up 0.1 per cent, even after the government in effect nationalised troubled mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Dow Jones stood 1.2 per cent higher, although the Nasdaq Composite 0.3 per cent lower.“Dour would be a fair word,” said Kevin Quinn, equity sales trader at Stanford Financial, of the mood on trading desks week.Over the course of the week, the market endured its biggest one-day fall of the year and was at one point on course to close at its lowest point of 2008. Yet stocks enjoyed boost later in the week as it emerged that Lehman was actively courting suitors.David Buik, analyst at BGC Partners, said: “Wall Street’s rally was all the more surprising to the degree that it seems unlikely that much of the world’s economies can drag itself up by the bootstraps.”Meanwhile, a slew of negative economic updates – capped on Friday with the release of worse-than-expected retail sales – served as a reminder that investor concerns are not confined to the financial sector.On Friday, retailer Macy was one of the biggest drags on the S&P 500, down 4.8 per cent to $20.81. Nordstrom and JC Penney each lost 4.1 per cent, to $34.07 and $41.43 respectively.Meanwhile, Best Buy fell 3.3 per cent to $44.49 after UBS downgraded the consumer electronics retailer from “buy” to “neutral” due in part to an excess supply of LCD televisions.Oil refiners enjoyed gains as Hurricane Ike headed towards Texas. Over the week, Valero Energy and Tesoro advanced 7.4 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.

His testimony drove home the significance of the unexpectedly sharp rise in jobless claims and a weaker-than-forecast economic growth number.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average snapped their four-day winning streak. The Dow closed 1 per cent lower at 12,582.18, while the S&P fell 0.6 per cent to 1,367.69.The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.5 per cent to 2,331.57.Financial stocks sold off after the Fed chairman said he expected to see some bank failures, particularly among smaller banks.

Fifth Third Bancorp fell 3.6 per cent to $24.05.Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage financier, slid 2.4 per cent to $24.49 after it posted a larger-than-expected $2.5bn loss for the fourth-quarter. Freddie also increased its credit loss estimates for 2008 and 2008 due to the severity of the housing downturn.Fannie Mae, Freddie’s larger rival, pared earlier losses, rising 2.3 per cent to $27.90.Thornburg Mortgage added to investor concerns about the state of the housing and mortgage markets. The lender fell 15.4 per cent to $9.76 after it said it might have to sell assets to meet margin calls.Other mortgage lenders also suffered. Countrywide Financial fell 4.9 per cent to $6.64, while Washington Mutual fell 6.3 per cent to $15.73.Elsewhere in the financial sector, MF Global fell 27.6 per cent to $21.19 after it said one of its wheat traders had triggered a $141.5m loss.Computer maker Dell, which reported results after the bell, fell 3.4 per cent from the regular session close to $20.15. Dell’s revenue fell short of analysts’ estimates. The stock has fallen 26 per cent since December.In the telecoms sector, Sprint Nextel, the third-biggest US wireless carrier, fell 9.6 per cent to $8.09 after it posted a $29.5bn net loss for the fourth quarter and said it would cut its dividend.

Fitch responded by cutting the company’s credit rating to junk.The news sparked a rally in Sprint’s chief rivals, AT&T and Verizon. AT&T rose 2.2 per cent to $35.96, while Verizon rose 2.2 per cent to $37.18.Sears edged 0.2 per cent lower to $101.40.
