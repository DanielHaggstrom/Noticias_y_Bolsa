One is a silhouette. Another wears geek-chic specs and a uniform two sizes too big. If you have spotted either, please contact US attorney-general William Barr. He would like to talk to the men concerning the theft of the personal data of 147m Americans in 2017.Of course, the US government has no hope of catching the duo, pictured in an official release, along with two other officers charged. Instead, the legal flourish supports the US government’s message that Chinese espionage is omnipresent — so do not trust the telecoms equipment maker Huawei.The charges also give Equifax, a big US-based credit checking agency, some belated cover for the hack. Quoted businesses are expected to battle one another by legitimate means. The world’s largest military is a more daunting adversary.However, Equifax’s defences were woefully weak, as US politicians and security consultants pointed out. The hack hit confidence in the business, number two behind Experian in the lucrative credit-checking sector.The pair were previously neck-and-neck in their market ratings, though the UK-listed Experian — spawned, improbably, by a Nottingham garment retailer — was already a far bigger business. Experian’s pricey shares now trade at 33 times forward earnings, according to S&P Global. That is a fifth higher than Equifax, whose chief executive at the time of the breach was forced to step down.High ratings for credit checkers reflect network advantages and the steep margins that come with them. But their huge volumes of personal and corporate data also make them tempting targets for hackers. Experian suffered a smaller breach of its own in 2015.Data theft is only a medium-level threat. The bigger worry is that credit checkers and western financial institutions may be exploited as vectors to distribute malware across millions of organisations. These bugs could be used to crash systems simultaneously.Lex likes big credit checkers as a long-term bet. They have potential to go on growing steadily worldwide. But the risks of these stocks are steeper than the market currently acknowledges. As the scrap between the US and China intensifies, so will commercial espionage against highly-connected businesses of all kinds.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think of credit checkers in the comments section below.
1;EFX;Equifax Inc;2020-02-10T17:39:24Z;US charges four Chinese military officers over Equifax hack;Millions of personal data stolen in 2017 breach of credit reporting agency;The US has blamed China for the 2017 Equifax hack as prosecutors announced hacking and espionage charges against four Chinese military officers.Federal officials on Monday portrayed the 2017 attack on the consumer credit agency as just one part of an continuing effort by China to steal US data and intellectual property.The personal data of almost 150m Americans were compromised in the breach, along with 1m citizens of Canada and the UK. Equifax agreed a $800m US settlement last year over the hack.William Barr, the US attorney-general, said the attack on Equifax was a “deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people.“Unfortunately, the Equifax hack fits a disturbing and unacceptable pattern of state-sponsored computer intrusions and thefts by China and its citizens,” he added.The attorney-general said the stolen data could be useful for Chinese efforts to develop artificial intelligence technologies and for targeting Americans in intelligence operations.The US has stepped up its efforts to combat what it views as Chinese economic espionage and to enlist the support of American companies and institutions.Last week, Mr Barr warned that “China’s current technological thrusts pose an unprecedented challenge to the United States”. Beijing had mounted a “technological blitzkrieg”, he said.The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately return a request for comment on the charges.The indictments are only the second time the US has charged Chinese military hackers, according to David Bowdich, deputy director of the FBI.In 2014, the US charged members of the Chinese military with hacking and economic espionage linked to American companies including a nuclear power plant operator.“When China violates our criminal laws and international norms, we will not tolerate it and we will hold them accountable,” said Mr Bowdich. He added that the FBI had no evidence so far that China had used stolen data the against Americans.In the aftermath of Equifax attack, executives were hauled before Congress, the company changed its leadership, and Equifax faced a flurry of lawsuits and investigations. Insider trading convictions even emerged from the scandal after two employees were accused of trading after learning of the hack before it was made public.Last year, the Federal Trade Commission, along with other federal and state authorities and private plaintiffs, agreed a settlement that made Equifax liable for almost $800m.At the time, Joseph Simons, chairman of the FTC, said the company had “failed to take basic steps” that could have prevented the intrusion into Equifax’s databases.In the FTC settlement, and the criminal indictment, the entry point for the hackers was described as an unfixed software vulnerability the US government had warned about two months prior to the attack.Officials on Monday praised Equifax for its co-operation with their investigation.Mark Begor, Equifax’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company was grateful for federal investigators’ efforts. “The attack on Equifax was an attack on US consumers as well as the United States,” he said.
2;EFX;Equifax Inc;2019-07-22T21:27:47Z;Equifax: credit due;FTC settlement shows data breaches will never again be just an IT ‘technical’ problem;Calling customer service is one of the most unpleasant aspects of modern life. The US government thinks that waste of time is worth $25 an hour. On Monday the Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Equifax, one of the largest US credit reporting agencies, that will require the company to pay up to $800m. It had a massive data breach in 2017 that affected 147m Americans. About $425m of the settlement, which includes state lawsuits against Equifax, will go directly to consumers affected by the hack. Each person affected may be eligible for up to $20,000 for suffering unauthorised charges or spending phone time with customer services to fix incorrect credit reports.Data breaches are increasingly common. Most consumers are resigned to the notion that their personal information will be compromised at some point. If corporations had hoped they could avoid the expense of remedies to prevent these breaches, settlements such as this one should convince them otherwise.Equifax’s enterprise value is $20bn. This settlement will not ruin the company. Its share price, after the 2017 breach was discovered, fell by almost 40 per cent. But after a sharp rally this year, its market value has returned nearly to where it was before the event. The company has since brought in new management and pledged more than $1bn to better secure its data. Most damning is the FTC’s finding that Equifax responded too slowly to news of a breach, only for the problem to worsen.Data breaches will never again be considered “technical” problems for IT staff to cope with. Most companies now have directors who are focused on cyber security. The Equifax settlement calls on the company’s board to certify that it is complying with the terms.Companies may well prefer that legal problems be managed merely as a cost of doing business. Very likely paying $25 an hour to its customers — more than call centre workers earn — will sting more than that.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

3;EFX;Equifax Inc;2019-07-22T16:54:35Z;Equifax to pay almost $800m in US settlement over data breach;FTC says credit reporting agency ‘failed to take basic steps’ to prevent hack that hit 147m people;Equifax will be liable for almost $800m as part of a record US settlement after a 2017 hack that exposed the personal data of nearly 150m people whose most sensitive financial information is tracked by the credit reporting agency.The settlement with several federal and state authorities, and claimants in a class-action lawsuit, draws a line under one of the largest breaches of US consumer data.Joseph Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the company had “failed to take basic steps” that could have prevented the “massive data breach”.“This settlement requires that the company take steps to improve its data security going forward, and will ensure that consumers harmed by this breach can receive help protecting themselves from identity theft and fraud,” he said.The resolution with the FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 50 state attorneys-general and class-action claimants, requires Equifax to pay $380m into a fund to compensate affected consumers, $80m of which will be for attorneys’ fees.Equifax will also pay $290m in CFPB and state penalties, including $10m to the New York Department of Financial Services, and make available an extra $125m for the fund if it is used up.$425mthe amount Equifax will pay into a fund to compensate US consumersMark Begor, Equifax chief executive, said he did not expect the company to make additional payments into the fund beyond the original amount. “We expect this will be enough, but we have made more money available because we recognise it may be necessary,” he told reporters.The settlement comes two years after the breach in July 2017, when hackers were able to steal data including social security numbers after Equifax failed to patch its systems, the FTC said. The company had been warned of a security vulnerability in March that year but failed to take action until the hack.“Hackers were able to access a staggering amount of data because Equifax failed to implement basic security measures,” the FTC said on Monday.The names and dates of birth of at least 147m Equifax customers were stolen in the hack, as well as 145.5m social security numbers and 209,000 payment card numbers and expiration dates.Equifax was forced to scrap executive bonuses and suspend share buybacks last year, in anticipation of fines and lawsuits resulting from the hack.Mr Begor said on Monday that Equifax had seen “no evidence” of the hacked personal information being sold online.The deal will require Equifax to boost its cyber security systems and obtain third-party assessments of its processes every two years. It also forces the company’s board to certify annually that it is complying with the settlement, a move that would make directors personally liable, FTC officials said.The total sum for which Equifax is liable is more than double its 2018 net income of $300m — though substantially less than the $3.4bn in revenue it recorded last year. FTC officials said Monday that they weighed up Equifax’s ability to pay while continuing to invest in cyber security when deciding the appropriate penalty.“We do want to make sure that we’re not bankrupting the company,” said Maneesha Mithal, director of the division of privacy and identity protection at the FTC.Last September, UK regulators fined Equifax £500,000, the maximum penalty allowed by law at the time of the hack, after it was revealed hundreds of thousands of British customers had also been affected. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office said Equifax had collected British customer data and stored it in the US.Highlights of the FT’s coverage of the cyber threat — and how to respond to itThe 2017 hack of Equifax was just one of a series of major data breaches affecting consumers in the US and worldwide. The cascade of hacks has made it difficult to attribute a consumer’s identity theft to any one incident, officials said on Monday.Mr Simons used the announcement of the settlement to reiterate his calls for Congress to give the FTC greater authority to impose penalties on companies. At the moment, the agency can only issue fines for a violation of a settlement, not for a first offence.In the case of Equifax, Mr Simons said, even much of the restitution resulted from the enforcement powers of the CFPB and the states, rather than the FTC. “Our equitable monetary relief was limited to . . . those people who had direct relationships and bought a product specifically from Equifax,” he said.Brian Frosh, attorney-general for Maryland, pointed to Equifax’s business model of gathering financial information about individuals who may never have dealt directly with the company as a particularly egregious aspect of the breach.“We did not choose Equifax, Equifax in fact chose us,” he said.
4;EFX;Equifax Inc;2018-10-12T10:08:06Z;Ex-Donald Trump adviser Gary Cohn joins blockchain start-up;Former Goldman Sachs president calls Spring Labs project a ‘unique opportunity’;Gary Cohn, Donald Trump’s former top economic aide, is now an adviser to a blockchain start-up that hopes to use the nascent technology to overhaul the way banks share credit data.In one of his first public moves since leaving the White House earlier this year, the 58-year-old former president at Goldman Sachs has joined fledgling fintech firm Spring Labs.The 20-strong start-up, which has offices in Los Angeles and Chicago, is developing ways to use the blockchain to allow lenders and data providers to exchange credit and identity information more efficiently, in a challenge to big credit consumer companies like Equifax and Experian.“[It’s] an obvious place to take a very, very analogue industry and digitise it,” Mr Cohn told the Financial Times, labelling the project a “unique opportunity”.During his time in the White House, Mr Cohn played a major role in the Trump administration’s tax reform package, which was passed by Congress late last year. But he resigned in March after objecting to the president’s plans to roll out steel and aluminium tariffs.Mr Cohn said that since his departure he had been advising private companies in “traditional industries”, though he declined to provide further details.But he added that he had looked at “a bunch of different opportunities” in the blockchain sector after studying the potential of the technology while in the White House.While he made clear that he was not an advocate for individual cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, he said that blockchain technology was a “huge new invention” that could also be used for smart contracts, or in currency settlement.“We all know all the inefficiencies of the existing currency world and blockchain clearly helps to eliminate them at some point in the future,” he added.Mr Cohn will join Bobby Mehta, former chief executive of big US credit company TransUnion, and Brian Brooks, chief legal officer at Coinbase, one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, on Spring Labs’ board of advisers. Mr Cohn also has an undisclosed amount of equity in the company, though it is unclear whether he received the stake through an investment or as part of an arrangement with the company.“When you look at the two challenges Spring Labs has, one is building the technology. Once you’ve built the technology you’ve got to get it accepted and adopted,” Mr Cohn said, adding that he would use his experience in financial services to help the company tackle the latter.Blockchain technology allows for information storage and transmission without a central control body. While it is best known for its role in underpinning the exchange of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, its decentralised functionality has made it popular with companies seeking to manage large flows of data. However, critics have questioned whether its usefulness has been overstated, and the technology has also been tainted by its association with the cryptocurrency world, which many have warned is vulnerable to fraud.Under the current credit system, banks hand over customer data to credit reporting agencies such as Equifax and Experian, before buying back aggregated reports from those companies. Last year, Equifax disclosed that it had suffered a massive data hack in the US, affecting 143m clients and raising concerns about the safety of customer information.Adam Jiwan, Spring Labs’ chairman and chief executive, said his company was building blockchain-based applications that would allow such data to be shared directly between parties in a “highly secure” and “anonymous” way that complies with data privacy regulations.He added this could “ultimately . . . replace the credit bureaus you see today”.Set up in 2017, Spring Labs is the brain-child of the founders of Avant, a US consumer loans provider that has originated more than $5bn of loans since it was founded six years ago. In March, Spring Labs raised nearly $15m in seed funding, including from previous Avant backers.It expects to launch several applications — which may include fraud and identity verification tools — in the first half of 2019 and is also in “deep discussions with industry partners”, Mr Jiwan said.
5;EFX;Equifax Inc;2018-09-19T23:12:48Z;Equifax hit with UK fine after huge data hack;Regulator cites failure to address IT problems after attack last year;UK regulators have hit credit rating agency Equifax with its first financial penalty for a huge data hack, accusing it of failing to address known IT problems and unlawfully storing British data in the US.Equifax was forced last year to scrap executive bonuses and suspend share buybacks because of expected fines and lawsuits after one of the biggest corporate data breaches.The UK Information Commissioner’s Office on Thursday announced it would impose the maximum allowable fine under old data protection laws of £500,000, and criticised the company for failing to fix IT vulnerabilities even after they were raised by the US Department of Homeland Security.“The loss of personal information, particularly where there is the potential for financial fraud, is not only upsetting to customers, it undermines consumer trust in digital commerce,” said Elizabeth Denham, head of the ICO. “This is compounded when the company is a global firm whose business relies on personal data.”Equifax said: “As the ICO makes clear in its report, Equifax has successfully implemented a broad range of measures to prevent the recurrence of such criminal incidents and it acknowledges the strengthened procedures which are now in effect.”The hack was one of several to hit the corporate world recently. BA, UK’s biggest airline, this month revealed hackers stole the financial details of 380,000 customers.The ICO found Equifax had collected data through an identity verification tool used to compare information about individuals against other data sources, and stored it in the US even for British citizens. It also identified that British data were stored in another unencrypted file that could be accessed by multiple users.The ICO said the hack was likely to be particularly distressing because of concern that leaked information could hurt credit ratings.Equifax is still the subject of investigations by the US Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and the Federal Trade Commission. A detailed report from the US Government Accountability Office published this month highlighted that several government bodies, including the Internal Revenue Service tax agency and the postal service, had identified security problems at the company.When the Department of Homeland Security offered assistance, the report said the company declined.
6;EFX;Equifax Inc;2018-06-28T14:54:48Z;Former Equifax manager charged with insider trading;;A second former Equifax employee has been charged with insider trading for allegedly selling securities before the credit reporting agency revealed a massive data breach last year.The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, a software engineering manager, of trading on confidential information he received while creating a web site for consumers whose sensitive personal information had been hacked.Criminal charges were also filed in a parallel proceeding brought by the US attorney’s office for the northern district of Georgia.According to the SEC’s complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Mr Bonthu had been told the work was being done for an unnamed potential project, but came to the conclusion the company itself was the victim of the breach.The SEC claims Mr Bonthu violated company policy when he traded on this non-public information by purchasing put options in Equifax, which he then sold less than a week later, after the company revealed the data breach. The trade “netted him more than $75,000, a return of more than 3,500 per cent on his initial investment”, the SEC said.Richard Best, director of the SEC’s Atlanta regional office, said in a statement: “As we allege, Bonthu, who was entrusted with confidential information by his employer, misused that information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach and then sought to illegally profit.”Mr Bonthu’s employment with Equifax was terminated in March after he refused to co-operate with an internal investigation into the matter, the SEC said.As part of a settlement, which is subject to court approval, for the civil charges brought by the SEC, Mr Bonthu has agreed to a permanent injunction and to return the alleged ill-gotten gains plus interest.In March, Jun Ying, a former executive who had been in line to become Equifax’s global chief information officer, was charged with insider trading for allegedly selling almost $1m worth of shares before the company revealed its data breach.
7;EFX;Equifax Inc;2018-06-13T14:20:38Z;Dixons Carphone hack explained: what happened and should you be worried?;Cyber security experts are wondering how well the retailer protected its data;"Dixons Carphone, the electricals and mobile phone retailer, on Wednesday disclosed an “attempt to compromise” 5.9m credit card numbers in one of its processing systems and launched an investigation. It also said 1.2m records containing non-financial personal data have been accessed.It is not on the scale of really big worldwide attacks against large corporations, such as the 2014 raid on Yahoo or the 2017 raid on Equifax, but in UK terms it is one of the more serious attacks given the numbers involved and the fact that credit card data was compromised. The 2015 attack on TalkTalk involved 157,000 customers while a data breach at Carphone Warehouse the same year involved the personal data of 3m customers. This could involve twice as many people and potentially more sensitive information that could be used for fraud.The exact nature of the latest breach is still being investigated by the company and various regulatory bodies and data watchdogs. Questions are already being asked by cyber security experts about how well the retailer protected its data and why personal records were put at risk, in a heightened atmosphere over data protection after GDPR was implemented.“We are very conscious that we have let ourselves down here. We are very unhappy about it,” said new Dixons Carphone chief executive Alex Baldock.The TalkTalk hack was perpetrated through insecure websites that it inherited from Italian telecoms group Tiscali. At Carphone Warehouse, intruders gained access to customers’ details using an out-of-date WordPress interface. The Information Commissioner’s Office imposed a £400,000 fine in relation to the Carphone Warehouse incident, after finding “multiple inadequacies in Carphone Warehouse’s approach to data security”.The company, which merged with Dixons in 2014, implemented several IT improvement programmes after that, but the latest hacking attempt was uncovered after a general review of IT and data security that began “a couple of months ago”, according to Mr Baldock. He had already pledged to significantly increase spending on technology and IT systems.The breach concerns data held on customers of Currys, PC World and Dixons Travel stores in airports. Carphone Warehouse sales are unaffected.The company said the card numbers of chip-and-pin enabled cards cannot be used to transact without other information such as the three-digit security code and the expiry date. It stressed that the non-financial information on 1.2m customers does not appear to have been removed from Dixons Carphone systems. It has, however, notified the issuers of all cards affected, not just the 105,000 that were issued outside the EU and so do not have chip-and-pin protection.But customers should nevertheless be concerned. Trevor Reschke, threat intelligence officer at Trusted Knight, said that now the credit card data is in the criminal sphere, “it’s unlikely to be long before it starts being shopped around among criminals, with ensuing phishing and ‘brute force’ attacks launched”.“I would advise anyone concerned to keep an eye on their bank accounts and watch out for obvious phishing attempts.”Dixons Carphone said it would be writing to affected customers immediately to apologise, and pointing them to Action Fraud’s guidelines on fraud and cyber crime.When TalkTalk systems were compromised in 2015, the company offered free upgrades to customers affected. Mr Baldock said it is “too early to speculate” as to whether similar goodwill gestures will be made in this case, but stressed that so far there was no evidence of anyone suffering financial loss.The breach occurred before the General Data Protection Regulation took effect, so the maximum fine that can be imposed by the Information Commissioner is £500,000 rather than €20m or 4 per cent of turnover (whichever is greater) under the new regime. But the regulator may still make use of the enhanced investigatory powers that GDPR conferred on it. And it is not the only regulator potentially involved; as Dixons Carphone has two consumer finance units overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority, the incident is also on the watchdog’s radar. The FCA also has fining powers over how timely and accurately listed companies make market disclosures.The wider impact could be greater. The group’s shares fell 3.5 per cent on Wednesday and have dropped two-fifths in the past year. It can ill-afford to be alienating customers at a time when weak consumer sentiment is affecting the electricals market, and changing patterns of user behaviour are disrupting Carphone Warehouse’s business model.TalkTalk found to its cost the lasting damage of its 2015 attack to its brand and customer trust — shares never recovered to pre-hack levels of more than £3 and now trade at about £1.24."
8;EFX;Equifax Inc;2018-03-14T17:55:29Z;Equifax: hack bounceback;Investors, customers and the public have become inured to information theft  ;There is something odd about the insider trading case against Equifax IT executive Jun Ying. According to the US Justice Department, Mr Ying realised in August last year that the credit monitoring company had suffered a big data breach, searched for the impact of a similar breach on the share price of Experian, a rival credit checker, then sold almost $1m of stock in Equifax to avoid potential losses.Mr Ying has not yet presented his defence (and his lawyers declined to comment). But the Experian hack provided little impetus to sell.Experian announced in October 2015 that hackers had stolen the personal information of 15m customers of T-Mobile, the US wireless operator. Was the fallout dramatic, incentivising any later breach victim to run for the hills? Not really. T-Mobile was “incredibly angry”. There were some lawsuits. Experian, whose revenues were $4.2bn that year, set aside $20m to cover one-off costs. Shares in the London-listed company fell 3.8 per cent on the day. That was the stock’s low point. It has since risen by more than 50 per cent.If there was a lesson to take from Experian, it is that investors, customers and the public, have become inured to information theft. That lesson is visible, too, in Equifax’s own breach, although it was not quite so apparent at the time.After Equifax revealed last year that data on more than 140m Americans had been stolen, its stock fell more than a third. Affecting most US households, the breach ignited a storm of political and regulatory protest.However, the shares have since clawed back most of their losses. Although there were $114m of net one-off charges last year, the revenue drop attributed to the breach was just 3 per cent in the most recent quarter. Investigations and lawsuits continue and there is the chance of nasty surprises. But the credit checking market is tightly controlled, supporting operating margins of almost 30 per cent. The lesson from the next data breach: buy the dip.Sign up to Lex’s new midweek newsletter from writers in London, New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong at ft.com/newsletters. 
9;EFX;Equifax Inc;2018-03-14T17:33:59Z;Former Equifax executive charged with insider trading;Senior IT officer accused of selling $1m of shares after discovering cyber breach;A former Equifax executive has been charged with insider trading for allegedly selling almost $1m worth of shares before the credit reporting company revealed a massive database breach last year.Jun Ying, 42, who had been in line to become the firm’s global chief information officer, is accused by the US government of disposing of his shares in Equifax after learning that the company had been hacked.The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission said Mr Ying sold the Equifax stock after looking for information on how a big data breach can affect a share price.“Our office takes the abuse of trust inherent in insider trading very seriously and will prosecute those who seek to profit in this manner,” said Byung Pak, US attorney for the northern district of Georgia, in a statement.Paulino do Rego Barros, Equifax’s interim chief executive, said it had “separated” Mr Ying from the company after investigating the share sales and had reported its findings to the government.“We are fully co-operating with the DoJ and the SEC, and will continue to do so,” he said in a statement.Mr Ying’s lawyers at Schulte Roth & Zabel said they would not comment as the case was pending.The data breach last year exposed the personal details, including social security numbers, of almost 150m consumers in the US. The hack occurred after the company had failed to fix a software flaw, despite being notified by the government. Shares in the company fell almost 14 per cent after the announcement.The hackers had gained access to Equifax data in May last year and the company got its first hint of the attack in July.According to the DoJ indictment, Mr Ying was asked to assist in the response to the breach in August, although he was initially told the hack had hit an Equifax customer, not the company itself, according to the DoJ and SEC.The government alleges Mr Ying figured out the truth before he was officially informed by Equifax, pointing to two texts in which he allegedly told a colleague: “Sounds bad. We may be the one breached” and “I’m starting to put 2 and 2 together”.“As alleged in our complaint, Ying used confidential information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach,” said Richard Best, director of the SEC’s Atlanta regional office.In late August, he allegedly used Bing to search online about the stock price impact of the 2015 breach of Experian, another credit bureau. Experian shares had fallen 3.8 per cent when the hack was revealed in October 2015, although they had risen around 50 per cent by August of 2017.An hour after searching online, Mr Ying allegedly exercised all his stock options inEquifax and sold them for $950,000. The SEC said he avoided more than $117,000 in losses as a result.Soon after, Mr Ying, then the chief information officer of Equifax’s United States Information Systems unit, was told that the company was the victim of the breach.In mid-September, after the resignation of Equifax’s global chief information officer, Mr Ying was offered the top job, according to the SEC. The offer was apparently withdrawn after the company learned of the trades.In November, the company said four other executives, including the chief financial officer, who had sold shares ahead of the announcement of the breach in September 2017, had not known about the hack when the sales occurred.The data breach was one of the largest in recent history and sparked several investigations, including by the SEC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As well as nearly half of all US citizens, Equifax said that 700,000 customers in the UK had also been affected.The company’s chief information officer, chief security officer and its chief executive, Richard Smith, have since resigned.

Equifax did not immediately comment.Last year, Equifax revealed that the personal information and social security numbers of almost 150m US consumers had been exposed in one of the largest corporate data breaches in history.Shares fell almost 14 per cent following the news last September.
11;EFX;Equifax Inc;2018-02-18T17:28:44Z;Germany’s Union takes stand to prove value of active managers;Fund group says suing companies can improve behaviour and share price;One of Germany’s largest asset managers, faced with questions over how active managers can add value compared with passive index funds, came to a surprising conclusion last year: sue companies.Frankfurt-based Union Asset Management is now embroiled in some of the biggest securities lawsuits in the US and Germany, and is poised to become lead plaintiff in litigation against the credit monitoring Equifax over its cyber security breach last year. Union board member Andreas Zubrod says that getting involved in the cases is a way of sending a message to its portfolio companies that it will hold wrongdoers accountable, and force them into improving their corporate governance. “If something bad, fraudulent or corrupt happens, we see it as part of our duty to engage,” said Mr Zubrod. “When we decided to engage more and become lead plaintiff in more cases, that was not only about collecting money that has been lost to our investors, but to urge companies to stop that behaviour and to show other companies what is good practice.” Union is joining other large asset managers like Neuberger Berman, Franklin Templeton, T Rowe Price and AllianceBernstein, in increasingly adopting activist tactics as they push companies to improve their corporate governance. Active managers have come under fire for underperforming major market indices in recent years, while also charging more than passive index funds. Union, Germany’s second-largest asset manager with about €325bn, also overhauled an environmental, social and governance, or ESG, ranking for the companies in which it invests a couple years ago. It analyses how well management incorporate ESG, whether the company promotes sustainability, and if it is involved in any controversies, giving them a score on a scale of zero to 100. Last year, the asset manager hired Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, one of the top securities law firms in New York, and have since become active in several lawsuits.Union is set to become the lead plaintiff in the consolidated Equifax lawsuits in Georgia federal court, where shareholders in the company are suing over the major security breach  last year, when hackers accessed as many as 143m customer accounts. News of the breach knocked an initial one-third off Equifax shares.The asset manager is a plaintiff in lawsuits against Wells Fargo, over the fake accounts scandal that led to a $185m fine by US authorities and unprecedented sanctions by the Federal Reserve. It is also suing Cognizant Technology Solutions and is co-lead plaintiff in a case against Allergan over an alleged generic drug price-fixing scheme. In Germany, the firm is involved in litigation against Volkswagen over its diesel emissions scandal. While active managers are not currently going as far as to launch a proxy fight or demand board seats — that is still the domain of hedge fund activists such as Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman — they are pushing companies on corporate governance topics behind the scenes. When they do not get their way, they may call an activist hedge fund to suggest they mount a campaign. One of the biggest activist wins of last year, Jana Partners’ investment in Whole Foods before it was sold to Amazon, was reportedly sparked at least in part by the asset manager Neuberger Berman contacting some hedge funds and urging them to help lobby for change at the grocer. None, so far, have incorporated litigation as one of their top active management strategies, though. “We don’t want to sue the world and its companies, that is not our business,” said Mr Zubrod. “We are an asset management firm, not litigators. It’s for a different aim, that’s why we’re engaging in selective cases that can have a positive impact.”

In an announcement on Wednesday, the DoJ said that it and other agencies around the world had arrested 13 defendants who were part of an organisation known as “Infraud”, which engaged in the large-scale acquisition, sale and dissemination of stolen identities, compromised debit and credit cards and other personal information. The defendants trafficked in data taken from financial institutions including HSBC and PayPal, the DoJ said in its indictment. The DoJ announced charges against dozens more individuals, saying the gang caused losses of more than $530m to consumers and small businesses. Intended losses were much bigger, the DoJ said, running to more than $2.2bn. Online aliases of the gang members, based in Australia, the UK, France, Italy, Kosovo and Serbia as well as in the US, included “Guapo”, “Moneymafia” and “TonyMontana”. The [DoJ] refuses to allow these cybercriminals to use the perceived anonymity of the internet as a shield for their crimes“Today’s indictment and arrests mark one of the largest cyberfraud enterprise prosecutions ever undertaken by the Department of Justice,” said John Cronan, acting assistant attorney-general. “The [DoJ] refuses to allow these cybercriminals to use the perceived anonymity of the internet as a shield for their crimes. We are committed to working closely with our international counterparts to identify, investigate, and bring to justice the perpetrators of these crimes, wherever in the world they operate.” The crackdown comes as banks and other financial institutions globally are spending billions of dollars to upgrade their defences against cyber attacks, fearing lawsuits and demands for the heads of top executives if they fail to fend off threats.Last September Equifax, the credit-scoring company, said that hackers stole names, social security numbers, dates of birth and other identifying information for 143m Americans over a period of about two and half months. In 2015 a similar breach at Anthem, a health insurer, involved the social security numbers of more than 78m people.According to the DoJ’s indictment, Infraud was created in October 2010 by Svyatoslav Bondarenko, a 34-year-old from Ukraine, who allegedly wanted to create the premier online destination for “carding”, or buying retail items with counterfeit or stolen credit-card information. Under the slogan “In Fraud We Trust”, the organisation directed traffic and potential purchasers to the sites of its members, which served as online conduits to traffic in stolen personal information, malware, and other illicit goods. Infraud also provided a service to facilitate digital currency transactions between its members, the DoJ said, while employing “screening protocols” to ensure that only the most skilled cybercriminals joined the group. On a call with reporters, David Rybicki, deputy assistant attorney-general, said that the gang was so prolific, and stole data from so many sources, that it was uncertain whether victims would ever be made whole. He said that the DoJ had received assistance from PayPal and HSBC, which were named in the indictment. In a forum post in May 2011, an unnamed defendant who used the alias “Aimless88” said he had 795,000 HSBC logins available. HSBC declined to comment. “Infraud was truly the premier one-stop shop for cybercriminals worldwide,” said Mr Rybicki.

Just under 30 per cent of companies reported they had suffered information theft, loss or attack in 2017, making it the most common type of organisational loss.Nearly four in 10 executives said their companies suffered a virus or worm attack, while the second-most frequently cited attack was email-based phishing, the survey shows.While cyber attacks are the most common way companies can lose information, companies can still be vulnerable to more prosaic routes.""People instinctively think about data being targeted by cyber attacks, but not all threats to information are confined to the digital realm,” said Jason Smolanoff, senior managing director at Kroll. “There is a convergence between physical and digital threats, with issues arising from equipment with sensitive data being stolen or lost, for example, or employees with access to highly sensitive information accidentally or intentionally causing a breach.”"
14;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-11-20T06:01:09Z;Best practice needs the human touch;Resilience in business is rooted in paying heed to staff behaviour;"At the heart of most corporate crises lie the risks involved in managing people. After a host of scandals during the present century, companies recognise that policies and procedures count for very little if they ignore the human element. Efforts to tackle the matter are being made, yet disasters keep coming.Whether it is the Harvey Weinstein scandal, which has exposed sexual abuse that goes beyond the entertainment and media industries, Ryanair’s debacle over pilot rosters or the collapse of public relations consultants Bell Pottinger over controversial work by staff in South Africa, companies face reputational or financial damage if they do not get people matters right.“People risk” can range from deliberate acts of fraud or sabotage to failure to follow rules, poor training, strategic miscalculations or someone opening a virus-infected email. Globalisation and technological change add complexity to the risks companies face and the speed with which problems can escalate.Credit-checking group Equifax this year blamed “human error and technology failure” for one of the largest data breaches in history, affecting more than 145m people in the US alone. Its former boss said a single individual had failed to communicate to the IT team that a software patch needed to be applied. Lawmakers accused it of shoddy practices.Japan has had a string of disasters, from Kobe Steel (faked quality certification) to Nissan (unqualified vehicle testers), Takata (exploding airbags) and Toshiba (accounting scandal). Analysts blame a culture of hiding mistakes, compounding human weaknesses.The effects of risk management problems can be long-lasting. Volkswagen’s diesel emissions scandal, for example, has led not only to millions of cars being recalled and billions in fines, but has also damaged confidence in Germany’s engineering excellence and thrown the future of diesel vehicles into question.The purpose of risk management, however, is to allow risk to be taken safely. Innovation depends on risk. “The outcome of great people risk management is the success and resilience of the business,” says John Ludlow, chief executive of Airmic, a UK association of corporate risk and insurance managers. Mr Ludlow believes companies have improved their people risk management, but there is more to do.He says leaders need to define the corporate culture and standards of behaviour, and improve capabilities in technology and processes. They also need to build trust among customers, suppliers and employees.Technology brings fresh questions, such as how ethics policies will work in the cyber world. “If you think about kids and cyber bullying, do you think adults are going to be any different?” asks Mr Ludlow. “Relationships are more detached and I think people will feel naturally easier about bullying another company with which they just have a digital relationship.”Research by Cranfield School of Management for Airmic identified five principles needed to achieve resilience: the ability to anticipate problems; adequate resources to respond to changing conditions; a free flow of information up to board level; the capacity to respond quickly to an incident; and a willingness to learn from the experience.Hersh Shefrin, professor of finance at Santa Clara University in California, believes companies are not taking sufficient heed of the behavioural roots of risk-taking. “What we know from psychological advances in the last 40 years is that people are highly imperfect when it comes to making judgments about risk,” Prof Shefrin says. “It’s important to understand how to improve decision-making, to identify vulnerabilities, by bringing together the quantitative tools of risk management with the qualitative psychological perspective.”For individuals, he says the problem usually starts with a bias towards excessive optimism, where people expect the future to be rosier than it is likely to be, and overconfidence, where they are too sure of their capabilities and tend to under-assess risks. In organisations, there is a tendency towards collective biases such as groupthink, where people reinforce and magnify individual biases.Prof Shefrin says insights into how to handle these questions are contained in the work of psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, popularised in Michael Lewis’s book The Undoing Project, but their ideas are not being put into practice in a systematic way.“We have pockets where we see improvement, driven by a tone at the top. But biases and psychological vulnerabilities are deep-seated and hard-wired within us,” he says.Tackling all of this starts with corporate leaders: the boss can sometimes be the biggest risk-taker. Travis Kalanick, founder of ride-hailing app Uber, was ousted as chief executive in June after a series of problems, including sexism and lawsuits over stealing trade secrets that many saw as deriving from the macho culture he engendered.Biases and psychological vulnerabilities are deep-seated and hard-wired within usThe financial sector, which experienced behavioural scandals in the aftermath of the financial crisis, has changed how it recruits, trains, pays and monitors people. But problems still occur.Wells Fargo is still suffering from a scandal last year in which employees created hundreds of thousands of fake customer accounts. The US bank has replaced its chief executive, reshuffled its board, changed a string of senior executives and distanced itself from the aggressive culture of cross-selling it said had fed the deception.“Financial firms are getting better at managing people risk, but it’s usually because someone has experienced a very bad incident, or because they have been regulated to do it,” says Nicola Crawford, chair of the Institute of Risk Management, which has members in more than 100 countries.An important aspect of managing people risk is enabling staff to challenge existing practices, yet the application is patchy. Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, the UK bank, was censured for attempting to unmask a whistleblower.David Hillson, a consultant and author of The Risk Management Handbook, doubts whether progress has been made in managing people risk. “People have been looking for quick wins but I think the area is quite confused. If you look at what’s been written by some of the big consultancies and professional bodies, the guidelines are conflicting in terms of definitions and proposed responses,” he says.Many companies now have safeguards in place, such as enterprise risk management (ERM) systems, and there is a global standard for risk management: ISO 31000. These can, however, create a false sense of security.Yves Duhaldeborde, director of talent and rewards at consultancy Willis Towers Watson, points out that data are available via psychometric testing and staff surveys, which organisations can use to track risk propensity. “Organisations can do a better job with the data they have, calling data sources together and learning more in a positive way about employees,” he says. Mr Duhaldeborde says companies put effort into employee engagement but “the people element is the toughest one to assess and control”. He adds: “You always have employees who may be disgruntled, are not fully satisfied with their job, or feel they have not been treated fairly.”"
15;EFX;Equifax Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Experian: credit where due;UK group has escaped the travails of its transatlantic rival;Until this year the tiny group of credit check companies that toil in consumer lending markets had largely avoided public scrutiny. Cyber security and big data in credit reports seemed less exciting compared to stories of Russian interference in elections and leaked Hollywood emails. The data breach at Equifax has changed that. So far, UK-listed rival Experian remains unscathed. It has a good shot at staying that way.Experian’s share price has already recovered from the drop that accompanied the revelation hackers stole financial records for as many as 146m Equifax customers, mostly in the US. Shares are up 15 per cent over one year while Equifax shares are still off by 8 per cent. The market thinks the problem is not systemic. Unless there is another breach it is impossible to know for sure whether the hack indicates weak links in the industry or an unlucky one-off. Companies that collate information on millions of people are certainly an attractive target. Then again, their reputations depend on their defences. Equifax’s troubles will have sharpened the focus on security by its rivals.The fallout from US regulators is clearer. Here Experian, with 43 per cent of revenues coming from outside the US, seems in good shape to weather any change. Within the US, lawmakers appear irritated that consumers can be charged to access information about themselves. But Experian is already focused on increasing free consumer checks and has reduced dependence on consumer credit subscriptions. Surely only masochists enjoy poring over their credit profile enough to pay for these services. Consumer Services contribute just 22 per cent to group revenue.A dip in consumer subscriptions is manageable. Operating margins remain high at 25 per cent. Experian’s real business is in collating and analysing credit data then selling it to banks and other companies. Organic revenue growth at the credit services business, which accounts for over half of group sales, is 5 per cent. There is no reason this demand should dip.Credit reporting requires a network effect to be successful. Once that is in place, it becomes a profitable, cash-generative business. The small cadre of companies at the top have the kind of scale that puts a high barrier to entry for competitors. If one suffers misfortune, the others benefit. Experian’s sales were helped by more interest in its new identity monitoring service following the Equifax breach.

Social security numbers, which are widely used by Americans to verify their identities, were among the personally identifiable information that was stolen in the incident, one of the largest data breaches in history.This led US lawmakers to demand new reforms targeting the profitable credit reporting market, which is dominated by the big three of Equifax, Experian and TransUnion in the US. Experian produces more than half its revenues from North America.The debacle also prompted Equifax to offer free credit card monitoring and identity protection services, something that ricocheted across the industry. Experian noted on Wednesday that it was “diversifying our revenue streams and reducing our dependence on credit subscription services” offered to consumers.While Experian said it experienced a “spike” in enrolments for its new identity monitoring service IdentityWorks after the news of the Equifax hack broke, that had “tailed off” quickly. Brian Cassin, Experian’s chief executive, said it was “too early to tell” whether the Equifax breach would affect Experian’s market share but the company was having “positive conversations” with clients. “We don’t really know what’s going to happen from a regulatory perspective going forward,” he added. Revenues in its North America division rose 4 per cent on an organic basis in the six months to the end of September to $1.26bn. However, it posted a 3 per cent decline in the UK and Ireland, dragged down by falls in some of its traditional consumer credit monitoring products.Overall, statutory revenues were up 5 per cent to $2.19bn. Pre-tax profits ticked up 4 per cent to $541m after adjusting for the sale of its email marketing business earlier this year. The company raised its first interim dividend by 4 per cent to 13.5 US cents per ordinary share.""We continue to expect good levels of growth for the year, with organic revenue growth in the mid-single digit range and stable margins as we invest in our operations and growth initiatives,” Mr Cassin said.US prosecutors and regulators, as well as the UK’s financial watchdog, have announced formal investigations into the breach by Equifax, whose chief executive quit after the scandal broke.

Equifax failed to fix a software flaw despite a warning from the US government. Social security numbers, widely used by Americans to verify their identity, were among the personal details compromised.Shareholders are also facing lower capital returns. The company, which bought back $77m worth of its shares since June, cancelled plans for more repurchases this year after the stock dropped about a quarter. “We just don't think it's appropriate,” said John Gamble, chief financial officer.Revenues are also expected to come under pressure. Nervous corporate clients are putting off signing new contracts until Equifax can assure them its systems are secure. Several have demanded IT audits. “We're hoping to win back their trust,” Mr Gamble said.Net income in the third quarter dropped 27 per cent from a year ago to $96m as the costs of the breach began to bite.Initial investigation and remediation expenses, as well as the costs of lawyers and other professionals dealing with the fallout, contributed to a $27m charge in the third quarter.We just don't think it's appropriateFree identity theft protection and credit monitoring offered to consumers will add to the bill. The company has so far incurred $5m of these expenses and recorded an additional $56m as a contingent liability. The final tally from the complimentary services could be as much as $115m.The US company also told investors to expect $60m to $75m on IT spending in the fourth quarter. It warned of a wide range of other costs that it could not put a figure on, including compliance spending.The disclosures underline the fall from grace for the former investor darling, which plays a crucial role in the consumer finance economy by collating financial records about borrowers and selling them to banks and other companies.Revenues in the quarter rose 4 per cent from a year ago to $834.8m, to the chagrin of its critics.“Equifax’s negligence put half of the American population at serious risk of identity theft, yet its business model continues to churn out big profits,” said Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, said the results showed that “consumers aren’t the customer for companies like Equifax, consumers are the product”.A wide range of regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Trade Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority are probing the company, along with 50 state attorneys-general.More than 240 class actions against Equifax have been filed by consumers. Unnamed financial institutions have also filed lawsuits, alleging negligence and breach of contract.Regulators are also examining allegations of insider trading. Equifax said the SEC had subpoenaed the company over “trading activities” by some employees, although it did not provide details. The company has been under scrutiny over share sales by three of its high-ranking executives a few days after it spotted unusual traffic on its servers. Individual officers and directors, as well as the company itself, also face class action suits that allege violations of securities laws.Equifax said it was disputing the allegations and said it would defend itself against the claims. It added it was co-operating with regulators.Officials at the department of Homeland Security told the company in March that it needed to address a software security flaw but it did not do so. Equifax noticed “suspicious” activity at the end of July. It waited six weeks, until September, to reveal that it had been hacked.

The Treasury select committee wrote to the FCA earlier this month to demand details about what it was doing over the cyber attack that Equifax first revealed in September.The select committee’s interest followed Equifax increasing its forecast of UK customers affected to 700,000, from its original estimate of 400,000, which already made it the UK’s biggest cyber attack. Details thought to be compromised include credit card information, driving licence data and telephone numbers.In total, a file containing 15.2m UK records was accessed during the cyber attack, which resulted in the theft of personal data of as many as 143m US citizens.The FCA’s probe adds to a plethora of investigations launched by regulators and prosecutors in the US since then.The two-month attack was first discovered in July, just months after the company was warned by the US homeland security to update its systems, but the company did not disclose it until early September.Since the scandal broke, Equifax’s chief executive has quit and US lawmakers have threatened the credit checking industry with a legislative crackdown in the wake of the episode, which has put about half the adult population of the US at risk of identity theft.When Equifax first admitted last month that UK customers may also have had their information stolen, it said it was co-operating with the FCA, the Information Commissioner’s Office and the National Cyber Security Centre.The ICO’s fining powers only stretch to £500,000 but the FCA can impose far more swingeing fines for breaches. Equifax has only been overseen by the FCA in the UK since March this year, according to the regulator’s records.Equifax said in a statement that it was already working closely with the FCA and other authorities. “We welcome this opportunity to learn the lessons from this criminal cyber attack in order for all businesses to better protect consumers in the future.”

22;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-10-18T04:07:02Z;How to Brexit-proof your investment portfolio;Be a bit braver for a bit longer to beat the bear market;Ask any UK investor what keeps them awake at night, and the chances are the answer will be two-fold: Brexit and the bear. More than eight years into the current bull market, it is not unreasonable to worry that we might be near the top. But beating the bear that everyone fears is lurking around the corner is hard, if not impossible to do.You certainly don’t want to be too late as the initial down-leg can be scarily quick, but getting out too early will also hurt. You could move into cash, but the final stages of the bull market are often the most profitable for investors. No one likes to leave too much on the table.Perhaps the most sensible way of “beating the bear” is to be a bit braver for a little bit longer, while making some allocation to cash in the name of capital preservation and keeping some dry powder.What about beating Brexit? The slow and tortuous negotiations are casting a long shadow over the UK economy. The outlook isn’t very sunny for sectors of the stock market that are focused on the domestic economy. From consumer confidence to car sales, the dwindling value of real household incomes as inflation rises means investors focused on the UK market have their work cut out for them.Nevertheless, many of the fund managers I speak to have still been able to find investments that can run up the down escalator.A good example is Old Mutual’s Dan Nickols, who manages the top-performing UK Smaller Companies Fund. While he has upped the international earners in his portfolio, he is also backing UK companies with a strong story to tell, and particularly those that could benefit from industry consolidation.His fund contains both structural growth players and consolidators that are scooping up smaller operators and capitalising on cost synergies. Names include Fever-Tree, the Aim-listed drinks brand, Breedon, the construction materials group, Biffa, the waste management company and Conviviality, the independent drinks distributor.The well-worn investment playbook since the Brexit vote has been to target companies with overseas exposure to take advantage of sterling weakness, while steering well clear of UK domestic cyclicals. But a company doesn’t have to be listed on the FTSE 100 to have a high international exposure. The IPO pipeline remains strong.Alastair Gunn of the Jupiter Distribution funds recently bought DP Eurasia, the Domino’s pizza franchisee for Russia and Turkey, which is growing fast and valued at a discount to the other successfully listed Domino’s franchisees around the world. Of course, this one comes with an added topping of political risk.Another example is Global Ports Holding. The world’s largest cruise terminal operator is reaping the benefits of the growing popularity of this form of holiday with tourists worldwide.Brexit-related uncertainty and the challenging domestic backdrop mean UK investors need to be smarter about how they invest, according to Alexandra Jackson of the Rathbone UK Recovery Fund (soon to be renamed the Rathbone UK Opportunities Fund). She says some of the best structural growth themes to invest in can be found in the UK with a lot of interest around gaming and litigation finance.Another fund manager who has long favoured online gamers is Leigh Himsworth, manager of the Fidelity UK Opportunities Fund, who holds GVC Holdings — an online gaming company that benefits from international earnings.One of his long-term investment themes is technology — specifically how the internet is evolving — which he accesses via IT securities and gaming companies.If gaming companies sound too racy, you could look for companies that benefit from the uptick in inflation such as discount retailer B&M. Consumers trade down when prices are going up and B&M offers groceries and non-food items on a seasonal basis at a widening gap to supermarket prices.Another route is to focus on companies with domestic earnings in the non-discretionary spending space. Motor insurers fit the bill and are in the midst of an upcycle for pricing.Cyber security is rising fast up the boardroom agenda, justified by the growing number of cyber attacks in recent months from WPP to Equifax. Ms Jackson points to £570m market-cap GB Group as “the tech business you’ve never heard of that helps prevent fraud through identity assurance”. Mr Gunn owns NCC Group in this space.Professional investors are also focused on unearthing businesses that could benefit from self-help. TP-ICAP, the company born out of the merger of Tullett Prebon and ICAP inter-dealer brokers, will be a beneficiary of rising volatility. This might be at record lows thanks to our QE-flooded world, but could rise as the tap is turned off and we set off on the path towards monetary normalisation.Then there is FTSE 100-listed Micro Focus which has acquired a chunk of Hewlett-Packard’s software businesses, where it expects to more than double operating performance. Other examples include engineering company Melrose that has applied the private equity model of “buy — improve — sell” to many underperforming industrial businesses, and ITM Power, which is using hydrogen to power fuel cells.Finally, consider companies that have structural growth opportunities regardless of what happens at the Brexit negotiation table.UK housebuilders have a well-rehearsed investment case: a massive under-supply of housing, with no quick supply response. Even if interest rates rise in November, they stand to remain subdued for some time — and the government has helpfully thrown in a further £10bn of Help to Buy funding, news of which added £1bn to the combined market capitalisation of builders including Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey in a single day. However, the effect of any post-Brexit labour shortages has to be factored in, and housebuilders are also exposed to any falls in house prices or transaction volumes.As such, an arguably more Brexit-proof play could be the government-backed PRS Real Estate Investment Trust, which develops suburban family homes close to good schools which are then leased via the private rented sector. The Homes and Communities Agency provided some funding during its recent IPO, and its business model benefits from its scale and use of fixed price contracts.

He added that the additional steps could “mean a little bit more inconvenience” for legitimate consumers.Financial security professionals said it was particularly tricky for banks to confirm the identities of prospective customers applying for new accounts. Techniques to verify existing ones, such as “two-step authentication”, were also vulnerable in part because fraudsters can claim to have forgotten the passwords or lost the devices.“That can all be bypassed by providing information such as birthday and social security number,” said Alex Heid, chief research officer at SecurityScorecard. “That’s where the core of the problem is.”Banks are starting to gather more sophisticated data on how consumers interact with their devices — typing speed, force or accuracy, for example — to learn user behaviour and spot fraudsters.Analysts have been quizzing banks about the impact of the Equifax hack on banks’ bottom lines as more consumers order credit freezes on their accounts, preventing companies checking financial histories.However, executives said not enough individuals had put the restrictions in place to have much of an impact.“While the number of locks and freezes has grown a lot [after the Equifax hack], it is still a relatively small percentage of the overall credit population,” said Citigroup’s Mr Gerspach. “So it really hasn’t had a significant impact as yet on our ability to acquire customers.”Identity fraudsters stole $16bn from 15.4m victims in the US last year, $2m more than 2015, according to a study by Javelin Strategy & Research.

Users were redirected to pages that infected their computers with “adware”, or spam advertising.In a statement later in the day, Equifax said that “its systems” were not compromised.It added: “The issue involves a third-party vendor that Equifax uses to collect website performance data, and that vendor’s code running on an Equifax website was serving malicious content.”“Since we learned of the issue, the vendor’s code was removed from the webpage and we have taken the webpage offline to conduct further analysis.” The company added that the issue did not “affect our consumer online dispute portal”.Shares in the S&P 500 company, which fell 1.5 per cent during the trading day on Thursday, recovered 1.2 per cent in after-hours trading.Cyber security is an especially sensitive subject for Equifax, which has been the subject of a public and political storm because of its botched handling of sensitive information earlier this year.Lawmakers have threatened the credit checking industry with a legislative crackdown in the wake of the episode, which has put about half the adult population of the US at risk of identity theft.

Users were redirected to pages that infected their computers with “adware”, or spam advertising.In a statement Equifax said: “Our IT and Security teams are looking into this matter, and out of an abundance of caution have temporarily taken this page offline.

26;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-10-11T17:16:04Z;Credit data groups face more scrutiny after Equifax hack;US lawmakers call for reforms for US group and its rivals TransUnion and Experian;"The highly profitable companies that underpin the $13tn market for US consumer loans are facing a crackdown in the wake of one of the largest data breaches in history at credit checking group Equifax.Lawmakers have called for reforms that threaten to upend not only the scandal-hit S&P 500 company itself but also its two big rivals, TransUnion and London-listed Experian.Before Equifax’s botched handling of sensitive personal information came to light last month, the sector had for the most part escaped the public debate over “big data” that has enveloped Silicon Valley.Yet the debacle has thrust the three companies, which play a crucial but mostly behind-the-scenes role in the financial lives of millions of Americans, into the limelight and given ammunition to their critics.“It’s obviously a difficult time for us — the legislative stakes have been raised, for sure,” acknowledged Eric Ellman, public policy strategist at the Consumer Data Industry Association.Influential figures in both political parties maintain that the Equifax incident, which has put about half the adult American population at risk of identity theft, is symptomatic of a wider disregard in the industry for the interests of consumers.They note that citizens do not choose to engage with the companies — even though the financial histories they collate and disseminate help determine access to credit cards, mortgages and even employment.“Equifax, and this whole industry, should be completely transformed,” said Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren at a hearing last week.Equifax, and this whole industry, should be completely transformedSuch rhetoric presents dangers for investors, who have done well over the years as the companies have become bedrocks of the credit economy.The big three, which have expanded their clientele beyond banks into sectors such as insurance, government and healthcare, generated about $9bn in total revenues last year.Although based in the UK, Experian produces more than half its revenues from North America. It is the 15th most profitable business in the FTSE 100 index, according to Bloomberg data, earning a return on equity last year of 34 per cent.Shares in TransUnion, once owned by the billionaire Pritzker family, have more than doubled since Goldman Sachs and Advent International launched it on the stock market two years ago.Equifax too was until recently an investor darling. The Atlanta-based company more than doubled revenues in the 12 years Richard Smith spent at the helm. He stood aside last month after the data breach scandal caused its share price to drop as much as 35 per cent.Lawmakers say the model is not working for consumers. John Kennedy, a Republican on the Senate banking committee, likened it to a restaurant that charges extra to stop its waiters spitting in the food.“You offer me a premium service to make sure the information you collect on me is accurate,” he told Mr Smith on Capitol Hill last week. He added: ""You can't run your business without me. My data is the product you sell.""Ms Warren and her colleague Brian Schatz have introduced a bill, the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation Act, that aims to give customers more control over their data.The law would prevent Equifax and its peers from charging customers to “freeze” access to their credit files. At present, depending on the state, the companies can charge $5 or $10 for the service, which prevents third parties from accessing individuals’ data.Equifax itself, stung by criticism it was slow to respond to the hack on its systems, is making the freezes free and in his testimony to Congress, Mr Smith called on TransUnion and Experian to do the same. Experian responded by saying that while it was “looking at broader solutions that can help consumers”, this should not “be done based on crisis-mode responses from Equifax”.Even so, such a reform is likely to be manageable for the industry, given it makes most of its money not by charging consumers for freezes but from the companies that buy the data.Charles Gabriel, who runs the policy analysis group Capital Alpha, said free freezes were “seen by investors as where the industry seems already heading, anyway”.More far-reaching changes are also on the horizon, however.Patrick McHenry, a Republican, is bringing forward legislation to encourage US tax authorities to streamline how they share income data. That could make the financial industry less reliant on the credit reporting companies.Other suggestions in Congress range from a ban on prospective employers assessing candidates’ credit history to restrictions on insurance companies using it to determine premiums. Some senators, including, Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, have suggested consumers should have the right to “opt in” before Equifax and its rivals can deal in information about them.The industry is stepping up efforts to defend its interests.TransUnion, for instance, has hired the Republican lobbying firm CGCN to work on “issues affecting data security, privacy and cyber security”.“Don’t let this crisis generate legislation or regulations driven by panic,” said Mr Ellman. “We would hope they’d take a step back.”The extent of political support for more radical reform is unclear, however. Even campaigners are cautious about their prospects.“The chances for passing legislation in the wake of this breach are as good as they’ve ever been,” said John Breyault of the National Consumers League. “But in terms of specific bills, that’s where it gets a little harder to tell. Legislation moves slowly at the best of times.”For now at least, Wall Street is betting that Equifax’s two rivals should emerge largely unscathed. While shares in TransUnion and Experian dropped about 13 per cent and 6 per cent respectively after Equifax disclosed the data breach, they have since recovered.The companies are here to stay, said Ken Fleming, director at Standard & Poor’s, not least because their corporate clients still find the service valuable. For instance Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which stand behind US residential mortgages, tend to require credit information from all three agencies before they sign off on a loan.“The barriers to entry are fairly high,” Mr Fleming said. “And they serve a real need for the lenders.”"
27;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-10-10T16:58:27Z;Equifax says nearly 700,000 UK customers may have had details stolen in hack;;Equifax, the US credit-reporting company at the heart of a cyber security scandal, has admitted that nearly 700,000 UK customers may have had their personal details stolen — including partial credit-card information, passwords and driving licence information.The figure is far more than Equifax previously forecast in September, when it said that 400,000 UK customers may have been hit. That figure already made it one of the biggest data breaches in record in the UK.The company said in a statement on Tuesday that a file containing 15.2m UK records in total was accessed during the cyber attack, which was first disclosed by Equifax in September.Of the 15.2m records, Equifax has determined that 693,665 individual customers may now be at risk of having personal information stolen. Nearly 15,000 people had sensitive information such as passwords and partial credit-card information accessed, the company said.The bulk of those affected had their phone number accessed, while nearly 30,000 people had their driving licence number accessed, Equifax warned.UK authorities including the Financial Conduct Authority and the Information Commissioner’s Office are already scrutinising the breach, adding to the plethora of prosecutors and regulators in the United States.Patricio Remon, President for Europe at Equifax Ltd (UK), said, “Once again, I would like to extend my most sincere apologies to anyone who has been concerned about or impacted by this criminal act. Let me take this opportunity to emphasise that protecting the data of our consumers and clients is always our top priority.”
28;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-10-09T13:01:24Z;Why would we want to increase the cyber risk to our bank data?;The impact of EU rules on account security needs more thought after the Equifax hack;The cyber world is full of would-be extractors of our bank account data. Banks and their regulators recognised cyber risk as a major threat decades ago and have built an elaborate ecosystem of protections against it. Regulated banks are strictly limited in how they store customers’ data. They are required to have multiple lines of defence against security breaches, subject to independent audit and review by government supervisors.But as the Equifax data breach highlights, other entities, such as credit reporting agencies, reside outside this system. The protection they offer is only as good as their managements’ vigilance, and that is often lacking.Given the relative success of bank cyber regulation, why would we want to provide new points of penetration? That is the question presented by the Second Payments Services Directive, or PSD2, being implemented in the UK and EU. The goal is to increase competition, lower costs and foster innovation in the bank-dominated payments system. But its impact on the security of customer bank accounts requires more thought, particularly in light of the Equifax hack.Under PSD2, two new species of third-party providers will have direct access to bank accounts: payment providers and account information aggregators. The latter will be able to amass large databases of transaction data making them a juicy target for hackers .Regulators have tried to address potential security risks created by PSD2. Today, many nonbank companies already gain direct access to accounts by convincing consumers to give them their security credentials. The new rules in Europe and the UK will require such companies to register with regulators and subject them to oversight. Importantly, in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority will start requiring these players to access account information through a special interface instead of obtaining a customer’s username and password, narrowing their access to data relevant to their services. If a third-party provider is hacked, crooks may still be able to access customers’ funds, but will not be able to obtain the customers’ security credentials to sell on to others. These measures will enhance cyber security, but many other aspects of PSD2 could still compromise it.When financial institutions have been hacked, it has frequently occurred through a third party. So supervisors require banks to take a proactive role in ensuring that loan servicers, for example, have the same level of protection for sensitive customer information that applies to the bank. However, because payment providers and account aggregators are bank competitors, PSD2 limits banks’ ability to make discriminatory judgments, or impose contractual obligations on them. But this will inhibit a bank’s ability to take preventive measures if it has security concerns. It is unclear if the third party is even obliged to notify a bank if they experience a security breach.Similarly, out of concerns about competition, banks will have no clear authority to contact customers to verify provider authorisations, even though regulators have long encouraged banks to scrutinise any suspected unauthorised access or use of customer data. Monitoring for fraud will be hampered because customers may no longer interact with banks directly. No longer able to see and understand how customers are using their accounts, they will be hard put to identify red flags.And then there is financial capacity. Regulators in the UK and EU have said that third-party providers will be financially responsible for unauthorised withdrawals directed by their systems. But will they have the resources to pay? While banks are subject to meaningful capital requirements, UK and EU regulators will impose none on the aggregators and a paltry €50,000 for payment providers. The amount and availability of insurance against consumer losses remains an open question. Moreover, financial obligations seem only to extend to unauthorised withdrawals. Consumers could be on their own in dealing with other harm, such as identity theft and damaged credit.Done right, open data access promises more convenient, lower cost financial services for consumers. If banks want to survive, they need to compete. Many are. But if they are relegated to absorbing the back-office costs of making the payments system safe while internet companies freely siphon their customers’ data, the current regulated system may be disrupted out of existence. Government policy should support a new ecosystem where technology enjoys a symbiotic relationship with banking, not act as an invasive species.The writer is a former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

He retains $18m in pension benefits and millions of dollars more in Equifax stock.The breach resulted from a combination of human and technological error, Mr Smith told the panel. On March 8, the US Department of Homeland Security alerted the company to the need to patch a flaw in the “Apache Struts” software application used in a website that allows consumers to challenge credit report errors. The Equifax manager responsible for ensuring that the patch was applied failed to do so, Mr Smith said. A week later, company security officers ran automated scans that should have detected any unpatched systems, but they failed to find them, he added. Company lawyers are investigating the failure of those technical security systems, Mr Smith said. Equifax security officials first observed suspicious activity on their network over the weekend of July 29-30. The next day, Dave Webb, the chief information officer, informed Mr Smith that documents related to consumer disputes had been affected. Under questioning, Mr Smith acknowledged that he did not ask at the time if any personally identifiable information, such as social security numbers, had been disclosed. Lawmakers also sought details of the approval process for Equifax stock sales by three high-ranking company executives a few days after the unusual network activity was noticed. Chief financial officer John Gamble sold shares worth $946,374; Joseph Loughran, president of US information solutions, exercised options on stock worth $584,099; and Rodolfo Ploder, president of workforce solutions, sold $250,458 of stock after getting approval from John Kelly, the company’s chief legal officer. The three executives were not aware of the cyber attack and Mr Kelly approved the sales before it was clear that personal information had been compromised, Mr Smith said. Highlights of the FT’s coverage of the cyber threat – and how to respond to itMr Smith acknowledged that Equifax had fumbled the rollout of a new website and call centers allowing consumers to determine whether their data had been disclosed. The company had been “overwhelmed” in the days following public disclosure of the breach, but improvements have been made in the intervening weeks, he said. Equifax is allowing consumers to freeze their credit reports with the company without charge. But even when pressed by lawmakers, Mr Smith would not commit to the company covering the costs of freezing individual credit reports with its competitors, Experian and TransUnion. The scale of the massive breach was evident in the hearing room. Congressman Joe Barton said he had checked the company’s website and found that his information had not been affected, but sensitive data belonging to one of his staffers had been. “I think it’s time at the federal level to put some teeth in this,” Mr Barton said, suggesting that companies be required to pay “a couple thousand dollars” for each consumer affected by future breaches. But Mr Walden, the committee chairman, was unconvinced of the need for congressional action. “I don’t think we can fix stupid,” he said.Mr Smith’s repeated apologies for the company’s mishandling of the breach and subsequent response were brushed aside by lawmakers. “It’s like the guards at Fort Knox forgot to lock the doors and failed to notice thieves emptying the vaults,” said Greg Walden, the Republican chairman of the House energy and commerce committee, who joined the hearing. Mr Walden also complained about the company’s subsequent “ham-handed” moves to help consumers, including repeatedly tweeting the wrong website address for customers to check if they had been affected by the breach. “If Equifax wants to stay in business, it’s entire corporate culture needs to change,” said Frank Pallone, the senior Democrat on the full committee.

Equifax’s security department told staff to make the patch within 48 hours — but the upgrade did not take place.He apologises “to the American people” for the attack, which he blames on “both human error and technology failures”, according to the pre-released testimony. “The vulnerability remained in an Equifax web application much longer than it should have.”Mr Smith admits “mistakes were made” in the company’s response to the attack, which has prompted a series of regulatory investigations, dozens of private lawsuits and a one-quarter drop in the company’s share price.Equifax found setting up a website to help customers to be an “overwhelming” challenge, “given that the company needed to build a new capability to interface with tens of millions of consumers”.

They need to decide whether a company shorn of what were once its two main drivers of growth can still be classified as a pillar of the Japanese industrial establishment.There will be plenty of unpicking over coming months — not least because, even after the eight months it took to put this deal together, the finished agreement is vulnerable.The deal has been directly challenged by Toshiba’s partner in the joint venture at the core of the memory chip business. Western Digital argues that the terms of that arrangement give it consent rights over a deal of this nature.Equally, given Toshiba Memory’s status as the world’s second-biggest producer of memory chips, there will be an awful lot of regulatory hurdles to overcome, no matter how carefully Bain and the consortium have structured this.Politics, especially in China, may shape the various antitrust proceedings that lie between now and March 2018 — the date by which Toshiba hopes (and needs) this deal to be closed.Its final form helped smooth concerns a prized Japanese asset would fall into South Korean hands and, although SK Hynix is part of the consortium, it has been denied any voting rights.Equifax executives braced to face Congress over hackingEquifax executives are this weekend preparing to face Congress for a grilling over the credit reporting company’s botched handling of a data breach that has put about half the US population at risk of identity theft, writes Alistair Gray.Senior managers did their best this week to take some of the sting out of the hearings. Richard Smith, chairman and chief executive, brought an abrupt end to his 12-year tenure by standing aside just days before he was due to testify.His interim replacement as chief executive, Paulino do Rego Barros, went on to throw more meat to the company’s critics. Offering a “sincere and total apology”, he also pledged to give customers more control over their personal information by letting them “lock” their Equifax credit files for free.Highlights of the FT’s coverage of the cyber threat — and how to respond to itOpponents made clear that such steps fell far short of drawing a line under the episode, which has revealed just how beholden consumers are to such companies. Equifax gathers information about consumer creditworthiness and sells it to banks and landlords.It discovered in July that hackers had penetrated its systems but waited until this month to make the raid public. The episode has sparked a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors, prompted dozens of private lawsuits and knocked a quarter off its share price.Late on Friday, Equifax said it was conducting a “thorough review” of share sales by senior managers and re-examining Mr Smith’s pay deal. It has formed a “special committee” to examine the trades made by three executives who sold the company’s stock soon after the attack was discovered, and whose subsequent disclosure wiped as much as 35 per cent off the company’s share price.The executives — John Gamble, chief financial officer, Joseph Loughran, president of US information solutions, and Rodolfo Ploder, president of workforce solutions, — sold $1.78m of stock at the start of August, corporate filings show. Equifax has previously said the executives had no knowledge of the hacking that had been discovered days earlier.Equifax has also come under fire for its choice of new chairman. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator, said the elevation of Mark Feidler, an existing board member who served on its technology committee, was “not real accountability”.Private equity transactions hit post-financial crisis highBuyouts are back: private equity transactions have hit a post-financial crisis high, as the total value of deals surged nearly 25 per cent to $212bn in the first nine months of the year, write FT reporters.They represent just under one-tenth of total mergers and acquisitions, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Activity in the US and Europe was at its strongest since 2007 when it reached $526bn in the same period.At the same time, a flurry of so-called megadeals valued at more than $10bn in the third quarter boosted worldwide deal volumes to $2.4tn, an increase of 2 per cent from the same time a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.The biggest gains have come from Europe, where dealmaking volumes have climbed 28 per cent to $611bn in the year to date.The increased pace of activity across the region was underlined this week by a succession of large deals. Finland’s Fortum made an €8bn offer for Germany’s Uniper, Siemens struck a €7bn deal to combine its rail arm with France’s Alstom and Hellman & Friedman agreed to buy Nordics payments processor Nets A/S.Dealmaking in the US is still 12 per cent lower than last year at $895bn in the year to date.Globally, groups have been carrying out near-record levels of midsized transactions ranging between $1bn and $5bn, according to Thomson Reuters. There were 357 transactions in that range during the first nine months of the year, up 12 per cent from a year ago and the highest since 2007, which was the strongest ever year for M&A.Bombardier’s tussle with Boeing threatens to worsenThe row between Boeing and Bombardier threatened to break out into a trade war as Washington backed the US group and proposed huge tariffs on US imports of the Montreal-based aircraft maker’s newest passenger jet, putting thousands of jobs at risk in Canada and the UK, write Peggy Hollinger and Patti Waldmeir.The preliminary ruling by the US Department of Commerce on Tuesday to impose tariffs of up to 219 per cent on Bombardier’s C Series jet comes after Boeing alleged that its rival was able to sell the aircraft at below cost because of subsidies from Canada and the UK. A final ruling is not expected until early next year but the US move will increase tensions with Canada and the UK, which both deny any wrongdoing and are threatening to boycott Boeing as a result.The decision could also put at risk some of Bombardier’s 28,000 aerospace jobs, including those in Belfast.The group’s Northern Ireland facility makes wings for several of its aircraft, including the C Series, and employs 4,500 people. About 1,000 work on the C Series.Bombardier has staked its future on the new aircraft, which threatens the duopoly enjoyed by Airbus and Boeing in short-haul passenger jets. It has twice been bailed out by Canadian authorities after spending billions of dollars more than expected on developing the C Series.The company has not found a new customer for the aircraft since its contentious sale of 75 C Series jets to Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines last year for $5.6bn, which triggered Boeing’s complaint.Japanese banks in plan to launch digital currencyJapanese banks are planning to create a digital currency called the J Coin, which can be used to pay for goods and transfer money using smartphones, write FT reporters.The launch of the payments platform, which is hoped to be rolled out before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, is partly seen as a response to China’s Alibaba, which recently brought its own mobile phone payments service to Japan.The J Coin is backed by a consortium of banks, led by Mizuho Financial Group and Japan Post Bank, and has been given the blessing of the country’s central bank and financial regulator. It would be convertible into yen on a one-to-one basis.It operates over a smartphone app and uses QR codes that can be scanned in stores, a popular means of paying in Asia.Japanese banks are worried about the impact of Alibaba’s Alipay service, which is being launched in several cities, including Tokyo.Alongside the obvious strength of the rival service, they argue that the platform will allow data on Japanese consumers to be sent to China.Japan has been relatively slow to embrace digital payments, with 70 per cent of all transactions by value still carried out in cash.That is the highest of the developed countries, which have on average reduced cash utilisation to only 30 per cent.The banks behind J Coin estimate that the system could add an extra ¥10bn to Japan’s economy by reducing the costs of handling cash and cutting settlement fees for retailers and consumers.

It said “any obligations or benefits owed” to him under his employment agreement would “be deferred” until the board had completed a review of the episode.

He said on Tuesday the hackers had exploited “a defect in custom software”, which he said the agency believed it had now closed by rewriting the software code.Asked what month the cyber attack occurred in 2016, Mr Clayton said: “I don’t think we can say for sure.” He said he was unable to say how long a newly launched SEC investigation into the hack would take. “You’ve got to pull a lot of data to look at this.”John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, told Mr Clayton: “This bed was on fire when you laid down in it. I’m not blaming you.”Referring to his predecessor, Mr Clayton said: “I have no belief sitting here that Chair White knew about [the breach].”Asked if it was possible someone at the SEC was aware of the attack and chose not to disclose it, he said: “I don’t want to go there. I want to wait till the facts come out.”In his opening statement Mr Clayton said: “I have formally requested that the [SEC inspector general] begin a review into what led to the intrusion, the scope of non-public information compromised and our efforts in response. I have also asked the [inspector general] to provide recommendations for how the SEC should remediate any related system or control deficiencies.”The SEC chairman appeared to frustrate some Democrats over Equifax, which took six weeks to disclose its hack, by refusing to talk about the case or comment on whether the SEC was investigating it.“You can’t say to this committee that they were wrong in withholding this information?” Senator Brown asked. “It would be inappropriate for me to comment on that specific matter,” Mr Clayton responded.“Well that’s a pretty big concern,” Mr Brown said. “If a company did what they did and the chair of the SEC is not willing to be critical of that, that’s a concern to a lot of us.”
36;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-26T17:30:21Z;Equifax chief quits over data breach;Credit reporting group splits top roles and promises ‘total focus’ on cyber security;Critics of Equifax have vowed to keep pressure on the credit-reporting company even after its chairman and chief executive Richard Smith stepped down just days before he was due to testify in Washington about a data breach scandal. Mr Smith, who has come under heavy criticism over how Equifax has dealt with a massive cyber attack, is leaving with immediate effect in the face of a public and political outcry.In a separation of the top jobs at the company, Mark Feidler, a private equity executive who already sits on the board, becomes non-executive chairman. The decision was immediately criticised by the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, who said the elevation of an insider who served on the data security committee was “not real accountability”.Equifax said it would consider internal and external candidates for a new chief.Mr Smith’s departure brings to an abrupt end 12 years at the helm in which he had won praise on Wall Street for transforming Equifax into a consumer finance powerhouse, more than doubling its revenues during his tenure.But three weeks ago the company shook the industry when it admitted a cyber attack compromised 143m Americans’ personal information, including addresses, dates of birth and social security numbers.The change at the top threatens to take the sting out of what promised to be a fiery hearing on Capitol Hill scheduled for next Wednesday, although Equifax said Mr Smith still planned to appear.Describing the company as a “travesty”, Mark Warner, an influential Democratic senator from Virginia, said the resignation was “by no means enough”.Sherrod Brown, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said there should be “no big payday” for the outgoing chief. “Equifax executives cannot be allowed to wash their hands of this,” he said. Equifax said Mr Smith would not receive a bonus this year. His pension was valued at about $18m, according to the company’s proxy statements.“At this critical juncture, I believe it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward,” Mr Smith said on Tuesday. Equifax’s chief information officer and chief security officer have already left.Paulino do Rego Barros, who most recently served as head of Equifax’s Asia-Pacific division, is taking on the CEO job on an interim basis. Highlights of the FT’s coverage of the cyber threat - and how to respond to itCritics have rounded on managers’ response to the episode. Equifax said it discovered the cyber raid, which went on for more than two months, at the end of July but waited until September to disclose it. Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana, on Tuesday described the delay as “a little bit bizarre”.The company floundered in dealing with questions from upset consumers while a website it set up to help them was, at least initially, beset by glitches. Mr Feidler said: “The board remains deeply concerned about and totally focused on the cyber security incident. We are working intensely to support consumers and make the necessary changes to minimise the risk that something like this happens again. Speaking for everyone on the board, I sincerely apologise.”Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the episode. Investors have knocked a quarter off the company’s share price and dozens of private lawsuits have been filed.Shares in Equifax fell 1.3 per cent on Tuesday morning in New York.

39;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-22T15:21:45Z;Equifax hack points to problems in SEC’s backyard;Reticence about breach of its own online system undermines watchdog’s authority on cyber crime;This week, federal prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into the hack at Equifax that potentially affected more than 143m Americans.The announcement from the US attorney’s office in Atlanta, where Equifax is based, came as the Federal Trade Commission and 44 state attorneys-general were also wading in.The pile-on is not surprising. Even in an era when cyber attacks have become sadly common, the Equifax hack stands out for its sheer size, severity and how badly it has been handled.The US credit reporting group discovered on July 29 that its defences had been breached, potentially compromising valuable personal information, including Social Security numbers and driving licence details, that could be used for identity theft. Personal details of more than 400,000 UK residents were also exposed.But the company did not go public with the breach or inform regulators at the US Securities and Exchange Commission until September 7. In the meantime, three top executives, including its chief financial officer, sold shares worth $1.8m.Finding out what the executives knew, and when they knew it, is important because Equifax shares dropped 20 per cent in the two trading days after the hack was revealed.The probes are part of a larger campaign by securities regulators globally to force companies to be more forthcoming more quickly with important news, including profit warnings, deal talks and accounting restatements. The SEC regularly brings cases about delayed disclosure: earlier this year it fined drug group Allergan $15m for failing to disclose friendly merger talks as it fended off a bid from Valeant. The watchdog also rapped Navistar for failing to reveal it was having trouble winning regulatory approval for new truck engine technology.In the UK the Financial Conduct Authority is probing outsourcer Mitie and defence group Cobham over their handling of shock profit warnings, and it ordered Tesco to pay £214m in fines and compensation to investors who overpaid for shares in the month before the supermarket chain revealed its 2014 accounting scandal.However, neither watchdog has punished a company for failing to disclose a cyber attack, and the SEC has thus far declined to say whether it is looking into Equifax. It is definitely investigating Yahoo’s two-year delay in disclosing a 2014 breach. But Yahoo, rather than the SEC, revealed the probe.Does the US watchdog’s reticence on cyber attacks have something to do with its own problems in this area?The SEC this week revealed that hackers exploited a software flaw in its online filing system to gain access to non-public company information. The four-sentence disclosure notes that the commission learned of the attack last year but quietly patched the software without saying anything in public. It went public only after learning last month that the hackers may have reaped “illicit” trading gains from their intrusion.The watchdog is not covered by its own disclosure rules, but that long silence will make it harder for it to fulfil its mission. When the SEC tries to bring its first cyber attack disclosure case, what is to stop the target from complaining that the pot is simply calling the kettle black.brooke.masters@ft.com
40;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-22T11:07:27Z;SEC hacking disclosure fell short of its own guidance;Regulator has urged companies to announce cyber attacks more promptly;The Securities and Exchange Commission delayed for at least eight months before notifying the public that hackers had penetrated its network, even as it urged the companies it regulates to promptly disclose cyber attacks.The commission so far has released only a four-sentence description of the 2016 hack into its online EDGAR company filings system, which officials belatedly realised last month had permitted criminals to obtain nonpublic information and trade profitably on it. Publicly traded companies are required to disclose to investors any hack that has a material effect on their operations. Government agencies such as the SEC are governed by a different set of rules that generally require notification within seven days to law enforcement authorities, congressional oversight committees and a federal information security incident centre, though not the public. “They have a real glass house problem,” said Jonathan Shapiro, a partner at Baker Botts in San Francisco. “One would hope and expect they’d hold themselves to as demanding a standard as they’d expect from registrants.” The commission’s tight-lipped approach, which attorneys said may have been intended to protect efforts to identify the hackers, has left companies and investors in the dark. Apart from SEC chairman Jay Clayton’s unusual cyber security statement, which was released on Wednesday after normal business hours, the commission has provided scant details. On Thursday, an SEC spokesman confirmed that the incident had not been previously revealed, but said that the commission would not comment on its disclosure obligations. EDGAR is used by 5,700 public companies to file routine financial statements, including annual reports and quarterly results. The almost 20-year-old network hosts 21m filings. Word of the hack comes as the SEC is under pressure to investigate the credit reporting agency Equifax’s delay in telling investors about a massive data breach. Company officials learnt of the incident on July 29, which potentially exposed 143m Americans’ personal information, but did not tell the public or SEC regulators until September 7. Earlier this year, Yahoo confirmed that the SEC was investigating its two-year delay in disclosing a 2014 breach involving 500m users’ data. The commission has never brought an enforcement action against a publicly traded company for failing to disclose a cyber security problem. But officials have been looking for a suitable case to send a signal to the markets. “They’ve been doing a lot of sabre-rattling in that space,” said John Stark, former director of the SEC’s office of internet enforcement. Mr Clayton is likely to face questions about the cyber attack when he appears on Tuesday at a Senate banking committee oversight hearing. In March, Carl Hoecker, the SEC’s inspector general, identified numerous weak spots in the commission’s information security approach, which he said failed to qualify as “effective” under federal law. SEC security officials took up to 14 days to notify the US Department of Homeland Security’s computer emergency readiness team about particularly serious cyber incidents, which are supposed to be reported within one hour, Mr Hoecker found. “This breach is potentially a game-changer for the SEC in how it executes its mission,” said Paul Rosen, former DHS chief of staff. “Companies are rightly asking themselves: what’s the SEC going to do to protect their data?” Though the commission says that no information readily linked to specific individuals was involved in the hack, the incident has triggered concern among companies using EDGAR. The hackers gained access to nonpublic information, which the commission defined as “generally related to our supervisory and enforcement functions”, according to Mr Clayton. Mr Rosen, a partner at Crowell & Moring, said that language suggested that criminals may have accessed “some of the investigative crown jewels of the commission”. Federal agencies do have discretion over how much to tell individuals affected by a network breach, according to Steven Chabinsky, a partner at White & Case. “Reasonableness is what federal regulators are looking for, which means the proper adoption of risk management principles, not perfect security,” said Mr Chabinsky, who was once the FBI’s top cyber lawyer.Follow David J Lynch on Twitter: @davidjlynch
41;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-22T04:07:51Z;Asset managers must beef up cyber security defences;Hacks at the SEC and Equifax highlight the need for extra vigilance, writes Aliya Ram;"Another week, another cyber attack. This time hackers seized personal information including social security numbers, driving licence details, birth dates, email addresses and phone numbers for 143m Americans and up to 400,000 people in the UK. Equifax, the US credit scoring agency that holds the data, was slapped with state and federal investigations, private lawsuits and a summons for chief executive Rick Smith to attend a congressional hearing.Investors such as T Rowe Price, Vanguard, BlackRock, Sun Life, Fidelity Investments, Wellington and other asset managers with stakes in Equifax will have been burnt by the large drop in the group’s market value over the past two weeks. As corporate stewards, these investment companies should have questioned the security systems of a company that stores vast amounts of highly sensitive data and has suffered breaches in the past.The price tumble indicates they were surprised by the latest hack.But Equifax should serve as a broader warning about cyber security at financial institutions that are crucial to the smooth functioning of the economy. Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said as much on Wednesday when the regulator revealed that a hack of its own systems last year may have allowed traders to reap illicit gains.Asset managers are custodians for $78.7tn of pension funds and institutional mandates, make millions of electronic trades every day and hold vast amounts of financial data. Like most businesses, they have rushed to adopt technologies without preparing for new risks. For asset owners this could mean bank account information and financial records; for asset managers it could mean investment strategies, trading algorithms — even trades themselves.“Bluntly, asset managers are not prepared for the increased threat landscape,” says Walter Price, fund manager at the Allianz Technology Trust. “This was highlighted by the 35 per cent drop in Equifax’s valuation and their benign comments that they were vigilant with regard to cyber security when, in retrospect, they were not.”Regulators are losing patience. In May, the SEC warned that a quarter of investment management companies in the US do not carry out regular assessments of cyber defences, while more than half do not test IT vulnerabilities. It counts cyber security as a “top compliance risk” and carries out regular surveys of brokers and investment managers to check for improvements.72 hoursAmount of time companies with operations and customers in the EU will have to notify data protection agencies of a cyber attack under rules coming into force next MayIn August it said brokers and investment managers had taken some steps to introduce better defences since 2014, but that risks remain. Mr Clayton’s mea culpa this week holds a message for all market participants: “Cyber security is critical to the operations of our markets and the risks are significant”. For the asset management industry, these are greatest for small and midsized hedge funds, which outsource IT systems to third parties, as well as quantitative investors that use technology to make automated investment decisions.“Regulators want to see that you have processes and policies in place to manage cyber risk, they want to see that you have risk lines that go straight to the board,” says Conor Claxton, chief operating officer at Macrosynergy Partners, a hedge fund. “It is only in the past two or three years that asset managers have started thinking beyond just renewing the contract with their old IT supplier.”From next May, companies with operations and customers in the EU will have to notify data protection agencies within 72 hours of a cyber attack under new rules that will allow regulators to fine them up to €20m or 4 per cent of global annual turnover.Highlights of the FT’s coverage of the cyber threat - and how to respond to itIn the US, senators have expressed interest in a similar regime: “[Equifax] raises serious questions about whether Congress should not only create a uniform data breach notification standard, but also whether Congress needs to rethink data protection policies,” said Mark Warner, the Democratic senator who is a former technology executive and vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee.Asset owners also bear responsibility, but they too are not fully prepared. A risk survey by Crowe Clark Whitehill, the consultancy, found nearly 30 per cent of 145 pensions professionals had not reviewed risk registers in the previous six months.In private, asset management bosses say that cyber defence software is expensive and largely unproven, making it difficult to know what to buy. According to a UK government poll, only 31 per of FTSE 350 boards receive “comprehensive, generally informative” reports about cyber crime. The Equifax hack indicates these chief executives might still be in the dark.The costs to the economy of doing nothing are huge. Companies that suffer breaches may soon find regulators and governments are far less sympathetic to lax defences. Introducing board-level oversight of cyber security risk is a must for asset managers to protect their businesses and customers as well as fending off fines in future.Aliya Ram is an FT reporter covering asset management and technology"

For Jay Clayton it is revitalising the market for initial public offerings. A data breach means he must now focus on safeguarding the integrity of the agency he runs, if he is to attract businesses to the exchanges.On Wednesday, the SEC admitted that in 2016, its database of filings, which is called Edgar, had been improperly accessed by hackers who gained access to private information. News of the breach came just a fortnight after the massive hack at the credit rating company Equifax.Stealing data for illicit trading or exploiting the SEC’s technology systems is nothing new. Two elite law firms had deal information stolen from their computers in 2015. IT employees have repeatedly extracted similar details from their company’s databases and traded on them. Troublemakers have also created phoney filings in the Edgar system to manipulate stock prices.The admission of the hack at the SEC comes at a sensitive time. In November, the first part of the so-called “Consolidated Audit Trail” will become operational. The CAT is supposed to be a comprehensive central repository where securities exchanges will submit equity trade data. The purpose is to help the SEC track rogue trading activity.In the wake of the Equifax hack, lobby groups for the securities industry said, perhaps cynically, that implementation of CAT should be slowed if sensitive data are more at risk. The SEC’s own problems give critics another excuse for seeking to brake reform.All SEC bosses have to balance the impulse for tough enforcement against keeping regulation light enough to encourage trade. But Mr Clayton’s mandate to pursue any agenda will be weakened as long as the SEC is playing catch up on cyber security.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Should cyber risk and liability make companies think twice about going public?
43;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-21T16:06:13Z;Big Tech bonanza needs closer scrutiny;The complexity and convenience of the internet means it escapes lawmakers’ attention;"Two eye-popping revelations have tumbled out of America’s tech world this month. The first was the news that Equifax, the credit agency, suffered a huge cyber hack that the company woefully mishandled, putting the data of 143m Americans at risk.The second is the admission by Facebook that it has uncovered at least $100,000-worth of advertisements placed on its platform by Russian-backed groups meddling in American elections. It comes after news of widespread manipulation by malevolent actors in the social media space.These scandals may force American politicians in Congress and state legislatures to focus, finally, on what is happening in the weeds of the internet.Such scrutiny is desperately overdue. In recent years America’s tech titans, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon have exploded in size, profitability and power. What is almost as startling as this ascent is how little debate it prompts inside Congress.It is possible to see powerful parallels between Silicon Valley now and finance a decade agoTrue, some leftwing American politicians (such as Bernie Sanders) bemoan the low levels of tax paid by tech groups; rightwing voices complain that social media platforms have been slow to remove extremist Islamist material. But Congress has not held big inquiries into the quasi-monopoly powers that companies such as Facebook and Google hold within their own technology niches, or discussed how tech companies harvest consumer data, curate content or even manage cyber security.The Equifax scandal revealed that the US lacks any overarching federal framework to set standards for disclosure of cyber hacks, and until now that state of affairs was barely discussed by politicians. Why? Lobbying is part of the tale. A decade ago, the dominant lobbyists in Washington were the banks and other financial groups. But today tech is eclipsing the banks, with companies such as Google near the top of the list of the largest corporate donors. The biggest five tech companies spent around $49m on lobbying last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, twice what the biggest five banks spent. Tech groups have also hired an army of former government officials, and poured money into academic foundations.That has helped the tech world to deftly play all sides of the political spectrum. Democrats admire Silicon Valley for its progressive stance on issues such as gay rights and immigration reform. Many Republicans like the tech sector’s libertarian ideals and business savvy. Meanwhile, almost all politicians tend to view the innovative success of Silicon Valley as a point of national pride. Thus when European regulators criticise Facebook, Amazon or Google, it is often cast as a competitive attack.There is another way to make sense of this political silence: take an anthropological look at some of the cultural labels attached to tech. If you do that, it is possible to see some powerful parallels with the state of finance a decade ago.In the early years of this century it was clear that finance in general — and complex products like credit derivatives in particular — were exploding in scale. But politicians in American and Europe were uninterested in peering into the financial undergrowth. This partly reflected deft lobbying by banks, and deliberate opacity. But the simpler problem was that credit derivatives were swathed in technical language and acronyms and perceived by non-bankers to be utterly boring and dull.As a result, it felt natural for politicians, journalists and voters to avert their eyes and leave this sector to the geeks. After all, consumers were enjoying a bonanza of cheap mortgages; nobody felt much need to challenge the status quo. It was an area of “social silence”, to use the concept developed by Pierre Bourdieu, the French sociologist and intellectual; everything was hidden in plain sight.Of course, the titans of Silicon Valley insist they are saving the world, not sparking a systemic crisis. But the key point is that consumers are hooked on cheap (or quasi “free”) tech services, as they were hooked on cheap mortgages a decade ago. But few have any idea about how the internet works, or even care to ask. Once again, we have placed blind trust in geeks.Let us all hope that Congress now does its job with Facebook and Equifax and organises full-blown hearings and commissions about what went wrong. Let us also hope the politicians scramble, belatedly, to improve their technical knowledge about the internet. But consumers also need to do what they failed to do a decade ago: ask hard questions about what is being hidden in plain sight by the aura of complexity. And then force politicians to act.gillian.tett@ft.comIf you are a subscriber, add Gillian to myFT in order to receive alerts when her articles are published.

At least four congressional committees also have joined the fray and chief executive Richard Smith can expect to be publicly flayed when he testifies on Capitol Hill early next month.But it is state-level legal officers who may be having the greatest immediate impact. In the days since Equifax acknowledged the cyber attack, attorneys-general in at least 44 states have gone after the embattled company, forcing it to stop charging for credit monitoring, demanding reams of information about its response to the hack, and in one case filing a civil lawsuit that seeks monetary penalties and disgorgement of profits. The fast-moving legal offensive illustrates the powerful role that legal officers in the 50 US states can play in tackling alleged corporate wrongdoing. Using their authority to enforce state laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive business practices, the attorneys-general can secure monetary fines, financial restitution for consumers and sweeping agreements that reshape industry behaviour.“What the state AGs bring to the table is we're nimble,” said George Jepsen, Connecticut’s attorney-general, who is leading a multi-state investigation. “We can move and react very quickly.”Indeed, it took Maura Healey, Massachusetts’ attorney-general, only five days to publicly announce plans to sue the credit reporting agency. State officials have a record of securing major corporate settlements. In May, Target paid $18.5m to 47 states to resolve an investigation into a data breach that had affected tens of millions of consumers. That came three years after 49 states, in a joint effort with the justice department, secured a $25bn settlement from the nation’s five largest mortgage servicers over charges of abusive loan and foreclosure practices. At the federal level, Equifax confronts a number of serious inquiries that could result in criminal charges or hefty financial penalties. The US Attorney in Atlanta, where Equifax is headquartered, has opened a criminal investigation of the breach. The Federal Trade Commission has confirmed that it is investigating and a related Securities and Exchange Commission probe is a virtual certainty, according to several attorneys specialising in data privacy issues. But the states also wield significant power over corporate conduct, including the ability to require corporate wrongdoers to take remedial actions via settlements that effectively impose a de facto regulatory standard on the rest of the industry, said Joseph Jacquot, a partner at Foley & Lardner. “They are a formidable force,” said Mr Jacquot, a former chief deputy attorney-general of Florida. “This is definitely an environment that will empower the AGs.” What the state AGs bring to the table is we're nimbleAlong with its two major rivals, Experian and TransUnion, Equifax has been a frequent legal combatant with the states. The industry maintains files on roughly 200m Americans, information that determines whether individuals can obtain credit cards, mortgages, car loans and sometimes even employment. Consumer complaints over credit report errors in recent years have led to more than 30 investigations and settlements, such as a 2015 accord by New York attorney-general Eric Schneiderman, which required widespread changes in the companies’ approach to errors and medical debts. “There is a long history between the Equifax and the states. That history isn’t a pleasant one,” said Nathan Taylor, a partner at Morrison & Foerster. “The states might have an appetite to push here.” Equifax did not reply to a request for comment. In the US, companies must comply with the laws of the individual states in which they operate. Equifax, for example, was required to comply with the varying terms of breach notification laws maintained by 48 of the 50 states. On Thursday, Ms Healey in Massachusetts filed a civil lawsuit against Equifax accusing it of “a shocking betrayal of public trust and an egregious violation of Massachusetts consumer protection and data privacy laws”. The lawsuit, which seeks financial penalties and profits disgorgement, charges the company with failing to provide “prompt notice” of the cyber attack, neglecting to adequately protect the personal information it possessed and engaging in unfair and deceptive trade practices. In an interview, Ms Healey assailed Equifax’s response to the breach and promised a “hard look at the industry” and its business model of gathering consumer credit data and selling it to third parties.“We’re going to hold them accountable,” she said. “This won’t be the end of it.”Follow David J Lynch on Twitter: @davidjlynch
45;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-21T01:41:00Z;SEC hacked for possible ‘illicit’ trading gains;Probe ordered after breach of Edgar online information filing system;Hackers may have exploited a software flaw in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s online filing system to gain access to nonpublic information and reap “illicit” trading gains, SEC chairman Jay Clayton said on Wednesday evening.Commission officials learnt last month that a previously detected 2016 cyber attack, which exploited a “software vulnerability” in the online Edgar reporting system, may have involved improper securities trading. When officials belatedly realised the extent of the breach, Mr Clayton “immediately” ordered an internal investigation. The software flaw, “which was patched promptly after discovery”, did not result in unauthorised access to personal information, involve systemic market risk or disrupt the commission’s operations. The disclosure of the incident and “ongoing” investigation came in an unusual eight-page statement on cyber security from Mr Clayton, which the commission released shortly before 8pm. The SEC also said it was co-ordinating with the “appropriate authorities”, a likely reference to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which normally investigates such electronic attacks. “We must be vigilant,” Mr Clayton said. “We also must recognise — in both the public and private sectors, including the SEC — that there will be intrusions, and that a key component of cyber risk management is resilience and recovery.” The SEC’s attack acknowledgment comes less than two weeks after the credit reporting agency Equifax disclosed a massive breach affecting the personal information of more than 143m Americans. Under Mr Clayton, the commission has emphasised the importance of cyber security both internally and on the part of financial market participants. In 2011, the commission released guidance for public companies describing the information that should be disclosed about intrusions and defensive efforts. We also must recognise — in both the public and private sectors, including the SEC — that there will be intrusions, and that a key component of cyber risk management is resilience and recoveryThat guidance remains relevant, Mr Clayton said while cautioning public companies to review their efforts in light of a growing threat. “Issuers should consider whether their publicly filed reports adequately disclose information about their risk management governance and cyber security risks,” he said. Likewise, the commission will “continue to evaluate this guidance in light of the cyber security environment and its impacts on issuers and the capital market generally,” he said. The chairman also warned publicly traded companies to take their cyber disclosure obligations seriously. ”Failure to do so may result in an enforcement action,” he said. Despite frequent public statements about cyber security, the SEC has yet to bring an enforcement action alleging inadequate disclosure of a data breach. Commission enforcers have been alert for an especially egregious case and Equifax may be it, according to several attorneys specialising in data privacy issues. The credit reporting agency discovered on July 29 that its networks had been penetrated, but did not alert the public until September 7. Shortly after being sworn in as chairman in May, Mr Clayton ordered “an assessment of our internal cyber security risk profile and our approach to cyber security from a regulatory and oversight perspective”. He also established a new senior-level working group to co-ordinate cyber defence and response efforts throughout the agency. Although the commission’s $1.6bn budget is expected to show no increase in the fiscal year that begins on October 1, Mr Clayton is dedicating greater resources to cyber defences and plans to hire additional specialists. The commission is also considering ways to reduce the amount of sensitive information it retains on its servers. It has “reduced the market sensitivity of certain data we collect” by obtaining it on a delayed basis, Mr Clayton said, without offering further details. Additional changes in the type of data collected are under consideration, he said. A commission spokesman did not reply to a request for comment.Follow David J Lynch on Twitter: @davidjlynch

Mr Horn, who replaced Sally Yates in that job when she was named deputy attorney-general in 2014, is also looking into possible insider trading by three top executives at the credit reporting agency in the weeks before the company disclosed the breach to the public, according to Bloomberg News. An insider trading probe would be the latest blow for the credit agency following the Federal Trade Commission’s acknowledgment last week that it is investigating the company’s handling of the matter. Equifax said earlier this month that it had uncovered a cyber attack that had potentially compromised personal information, including Social Security numbers and driver licence details, belonging to 143m Americans. The breach also revealed the names, dates of birth, email addresses and telephone numbers of as many as 400,000 UK consumers.The DoJ investigation, led by the US Attorney’s office in Atlanta where Equifax is headquartered, centres on the actions of three top executives. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also likely to be investigating their trades, according to an attorney involved in the case. Kevin Callahan, an SEC spokesman, said the commission declined to comment. The Equifax breach was a wake-up call and …New York is raising the bar for consumer protections that we hope will be replicated across the nationPublic filings show that the executives, including chief financial officer John Gamble, sold shares worth almost $1.8m in the days after the hack was discovered on Saturday 29 July. Mr Gamble, CFO since May 2014, sold shares worth $946,400 on Tuesday August 1, while Joseph Loughran, president of the group’s US information solutions business, exercised options to sell stock worth $584,080. Rodolfo Ploder, president of workforce solutions, sold $250,458 on Wednesday August 2. None of the filings lists the transactions as being part of special “10b5-1” plans, which allow insiders at publicly traded companies to set up schedules for selling shares they are granted as part of their pay. An Equifax spokesperson said that the three executives “had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred” at the time they sold. Shares in Equifax, which have fallen about 35 per cent since September 7 when the company disclosed the breach, were down 0.6 per cent in early afternoon trading. Separately on Monday, New York governor Andrew Cuomo ordered the state’s Department of Financial Services to draft new regulations requiring credit-reporting agencies to register with the state and to meet its cyber security standards. The new rules will allow New York’s financial services superintendent to deny or revoke a credit reporting agency’s authorisation to do business in the nation’s fourth-largest state with a population of roughly 20m. “The Equifax breach was a wake-up call and with this action New York is raising the bar for consumer protections that we hope will be replicated across the nation,” said Mr Cuomo.

48;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-17T15:57:33Z;Carson Block files lawsuit against Equifax;Veteran short-seller accuses credit-reporting company of ‘abysmal’ handling of hack;Veteran short-seller Carson Block has launched a private lawsuit against Equifax, accusing the credit-reporting company of an “abysmal” handling of one of the worst cyber security incidents in history.Equifax said on September 7 that its systems were breached by criminals in a raid that went on for more than two months — an admission that has prompted a flood of regulatory inquiries, dozens of private lawsuits and a more than one-third collapse in the company’s share price. The data of up to 143m Americans was compromised, the company said, along with up to 400,000 people in the UK.One of those was Mr Block, whose suit filed on Friday accuses Equifax of negligence in failing to safeguard and protect his personal identifying information from criminals, as well as a failure to disclose the breach in a timely fashion.Mr Block’s firm, Muddy Waters, has no short position that would benefit from a fall in the stock. In the suit, filed in the Northern District of California, San Francisco division, he seeks damages of at least $500,000 for the “stress, nuisance and annoyance” of dealing with issues stemming from the breach. The suit notes that Equifax’s business revolves around being a “secure storehouse” for data and providing a clear financial profile of consumers that lenders and other businesses can rely on. According to its own description, Equifax organises, assimilates and analyses data on more than 820m consumers and more than 91m businesses worldwide.Equifax could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.Hackers gained access to the Atlanta-based company’s systems via a vulnerability in Apache Struts, which is a popular open-source framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language.On Friday, Equifax said that it patched the hole on July 30, one day after it had detected strange activity on its servers. But cybersecurity experts note that the fix had been available since March, when the Apache Foundation put out an update which had been widely disseminated in tech circles.Mr Block’s suit names 11 senior executives at the company, including CEO Richard F Smith and Susan Mauldin, former chief information security officer. On Friday Equifax said that Ms Mauldin — a music major— would retire immediately from the company, along with David Webb, chief information officer.According to the suit, Equifax should have known that its defences were fragile, following two big breaches in 2016 alone. In one of those, in May, 430,000 names and other vital pieces of information were lost as a result of the company using “alarmingly poor” security for the generation of PINs from the last four digits of a social-security number and the four-digit year of birth.
49;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-15T21:58:08Z;Equifax’s information, security executives resign amid breach fallout;;The chief information officer and chief security officer of Equifax are leaving, the company announced on Friday, after a massive data-breach scandal that potentially exposed personal information for millions of consumers, sparked investigations and litigation and battered its shares.Russ Ayres will serve as the company’s interim chief security officer, from his previous position as vice-president in Equifax’s IT unit. He will report to the company’s new interim chief information officer, Mark Rohrwasser, who has led Equifax’s international IT operations since 2016.The changes will take effect immediately, according to Equifax’s announcement. The company added that its internal investigation of the incident “still ongoing and the company continues to work closely with the FBI in its investigation.”Equifax did not name the departing executives in its press release, but the company’s website indicated its chief information officer was David Webb, who joined the company in 2010 from Silicon Valley Bank. According to his biography on Equifax’s site, he was also a vice-president at Goldman Sachs, and earned his bachelor’s degree in Russian as well as and a master’s in business administration from Northwestern University.Susan Mauldin previously held the position of chief security officer, according to her LinkedIn page, which has removed many of its public details since reports earlier in the day indicated she had earned degrees in music composition, raising eyebrows about her qualifications for the tech-focused job.In its announcement Equifax also gave an update on the latest developments and revelations since its announcement a week ago that it had been been the target of an enormous data breach that began in mid-May and was detected on July 29.The breach may have compromised personal information involving as many as 143m US consumers, the company said at the time. On Friday, Equifax added that as many as 400,000 Britons may be impacted as well.Its announcement Friday evening confirmed that it has worked with cybersecurity firm Mandiant since August to review the intrusion and determine its scope. It also said that its security organisation was aware of a widely discussed weakness in Apache Struts — a popular open-source framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language — “and took efforts to identify and to patch any vulnerable systems in the company’s IT infrastructure.”Equifax had revealed late on Wednesday that hackers had exploited that weakness.In the past week, Equifax shares have tumbled 24.5 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Wonga warned current and former customers in April that there might have been “illegal and unauthorised access to some of your personal data on your Wonga.com account”. Most of its affected customers were based in the UK but some were in Poland.In October 2016, UK telecoms group TalkTalk was hit with a record £400,000 fine after an October 2015 cyber attack stole the personal data of 156,959 customers, including 15,656 bank account and sort code numbers. The mobile phone provider was then fined an additional £100,000 after a second attack. The ICO’s fining powers are limited to £500,000.Patricio Remon, the president of Equifax’s UK unit, said on Friday: “We apologise for this failure to protect UK consumer data. Our immediate focus is to support those affected by this incident and to ensure we make all of the necessary improvements and investments to strengthen our security and processes going forward.”The company added that it would be writing to UK consumers who were potentially targeted to offer a free service that monitors their personal data and credit information.Equifax disclosed the security breach early this month. The disclosures about the raid, which went on for more than two months, have prompted state and federal investigations in the US, dozens of private lawsuits, and a summons for Rick Smith, the company’s chief executive, to a congressional hearing early next month.Equifax has only been overseen by the FCA in the UK since March this year, according to the regulator’s records. The FCA confirmed it was aware of the incident.The ICO said it had been “pressing [Equifax] to establish the scale of any impact on UK citizens” and was working with agencies on both sides of the Atlantic with regard to the breach.“It can take some time to understand the true impact of incidents like this, and we continue to investigate. Members of the public should remain vigilant of any unsolicited emails, texts or calls, even if it appears to be from a company they are familiar with,” it added.Additional reporting by Brooke Masters in London

Our immediate focus is to support those affected by this incident and to ensure we make all of the necessary improvements and investments to strengthen our security and processes going forward.”The company added that it will be writing to UK consumers who were potentially targeted to offer a free service that monitors their personal data and credit information.US authorities including the New York attorney-general’s office and the New York Department of Financial Services are among the enforcement teams already looking at Equifax’s breach, which the company first admitted earlier this month.
52;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-15T15:45:32Z;Equifax response highlights raw deal for retail banking customers;Arbitrations tend to be quick and cheap and of little benefit to complainants;Equifax has rarely been a great friend of the American consumer.In the last three months of 2016 the company was the most complained-about in the country, according to data logged by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The 3,732 Equifax-related gripes during that period, ranging from inaccurate files to services charged for, but never received, were almost as many as for JPMorgan Chase (2,187) and Citibank (1,905) combined.The angst continued this week, after Equifax — one of the top three credit-reporting bureaus, along with Experian and TransUnion — admitted it had allowed hackers to gain the personal data of up to 145m Americans, then botched its handling of the aftermath.In a funny kind of way, though, the company’s response may end up giving consumer advocates a boost: by helping to do away with a common feature of financial-services contracts known as the arbitration clause. Some Republicans are trying to overturn a new CFPB ban on such language. In view of the uproar, they may lack the votes needed.After Equifax disclosed the breach, it offered to make amends by offering one year of free identity theft protection and credit file monitoring — so long as people waived their right to sue the company in a class action. The outrage was so intense that Equifax backed down, saying that people who signed up would not, after all, be forced down the road of arbitration. For consumer groups who had been working for years to get such clauses struck out, the retreat was a gift: a company in the grip of a serious scandal, accepting that such a move was beyond the pale.Since the US Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that any business could include an arbitration clause in its service contract, Wall Street has stuck them in almost everywhere: in credit cards, prepaid cards, payday loans, student loans, car loans, even current accounts. Everywhere but mortgages, in short, where such clauses were explicitly outlawed by Dodd-Frank.Consumers often barely glance at contracts, of course. But in the latest deposit-account agreement from JPMorgan-owned Chase, the number two US bank by branches, for example, the clause is there on page 15: customers give up the right to have a dispute heard before a judge or jury unless they make an effort to opt out of arbitration by calling a hotline or speaking to a banker within 60 days of opening the account.Supporters of the clauses say that class actions don’t always mean great payouts. It’s a “fantasy view of the judicial system,” says Andy Pincus, a partner at Mayer Brown in Washington, to think that “you go to court, a judge decides and if you’ve been injured you’ll win.” In the real world, he says, most matters that consumers complain about are small and are subject to peculiar sets of circumstances that “absolutely cannot be litigated in a class action”.To critics, the clauses are an obvious cop-out. If banks can deny consumers the right to band together to sue in a class action, they stand to save a fortune on legal fees, while also avoiding the embarrassment of negative headlines. How many consumers, after all, can afford to mount a case on their own?Arbitrations, on the other hand, tend to be quick and cheap and behind closed doors. And they almost always result in a rawer deal for consumers, says Melissa Stegman, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending in Washington. She cites a CFPB study, which found that in a typical year of class actions 6.8m consumers received a net $440m of relief, after all legal fees and court costs. In arbitration, 16 consumers received a total of $86,000.In July the CFPB issued a rule banning companies from using mandatory arbitration clauses to deny groups of people their day in court.“More than anything else, forced arbitration clauses are a giveaway to predatory lenders who are able to conceal bad conduct and fraud,” says Ms Stegman. “Companies know consumers don’t have a way to fight back.”The Republican-led House of Representatives instantly voted to kill the CFPB’s rule and now the measure is before the Senate, which hasn’t said whether it will take it up. The deadline for consideration expires in November.Meantime Allied Progress, an anti-bank group, is running TV ads in Alaska, Maine and Ohio, urging voters there to harangue their officials.“Big corporations like Equifax got caught trying to sneak [forced arbitration] past you, to strip away your rights and avoid accountability,” thunders the voiceover. “And Wall Street wants Washington to make it permanent.”ben.mclannahan@ft.com
53;EFX;Equifax Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Equifax boss wrestles with fallout from cyber breach;Richard Smith will need his ‘competitive fire’ to restore credit agency’s reputation;It is too early to survey the field for the most admired chief executives of 2018 in the Atlanta, Georgia area. But it seems safe to assume that one of the recently-announced 2017 winners will not be among them.Richard “Rick” Smith, chief executive of the credit-reporting company Equifax, was honoured at an event at The Foundry at Puritan Mill in the north-east of the city late last month. Exactly three weeks later, he appeared pale and penitent in a video on Equifax’s website, apologising for one of the worst cyber breaches in history.Up to 143m Americans may have had precious personal details, such as social security numbers and driver’s licence records, stolen in a raid that went on for two and a half months, Equifax admitted on September 7. The company said that more than 200,000 credit-card numbers were also stolen. The disclosures have already prompted state and federal investigations, dozens of private lawsuits, and a summons for Mr Smith to a congressional hearing early next month.“Outrageous,” said Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, on Thursday morning.“I think he should be fired,” said Jim Cramer, the loud-mouthed CNBC host, referring to the chief executive. “I mean, what does it take to get fired these days?”Feelings are running high because none of the 143m people affected by the hack — along with a so-far undisclosed number in Canada and the UK — ever signed up to Equifax. Instead, their details were handed to the company by the big banks and credit-card companies that rely on Equifax to gather and sift data from thousands of sources.The ill-will has been intensified by the company’s handling of the aftermath. Not only were consumers asked to waive their rights to join class-action lawsuits before signing up for credit protection — a requirement the company has since dropped — but the “phishy-looking” website, www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, put no one’s mind at ease, said Eric Johnson, dean of the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University. Many users who tried to check if their details had been compromised noticed that they got the same messages whether they entered dummy numbers or real ones.More bad news trickled out on Wednesday when Equifax explained how it had fallen victim to a web-application vulnerability that was publicly disclosed — and much discussed — in March. Even if the company swung rapidly into action, said analysts, it failed to fortify its defences enough by mid-May, when the hackers gained access.“Plaintiffs’ lawyers are dancing around their conference room tables,” said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.Some cyber security experts said the scale of the raid suggested a state-level actor intent on destabilising the US’s financial system.This does not feel like “script kiddies or scammers”, said Alex Heid, New York-based chief research officer at SecurityScorecard. “Once the attackers got access to those networks, they knew exactly what they wanted, and what they were going after.”Equifax did not respond to requests for comment.Born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Mr Smith had a “somewhat nomadic” childhood, he told the New York Times in 2008, as his father moved around with the carmaker Chrysler. During high school and university at Purdue in West Lafayette he wrestled, which “instils a competitive fire”, he told the Atlanta Business Herald last year.After graduation he spent 22 years at the conglomerate General Electric — in plastics, car-leasing and six other businesses — before being offered a move to Shanghai in 2005. Rather than uprooting his high school-age daughters, he answered a headhunter’s call about the chief executive job at Equifax.Can he hang on, after what he described this week in a USA Today opinion piece as “the most humbling moment in our 118-year history”? Investors are not yet calling for his head, said Jeffrey Meuler, a Milwaukee-based analyst at Baird who maintained his “buy” rating this week even as the stock sank 30 per cent.But whether the 57-year-old is forced out or not, the next few months will be a good test of one of his rules to live by.“Jack Welch [former GE chief executive] taught me that you learn more as a leader in difficult times than in good times,” he said in 2008. “You learn who you are and the depth you must get into.”

However, in light of the intense public interest and the potential impact of this matter, I can confirm that FTC staff is investigating the Equifax data breach,"" said Peter Kaplan, the commission's acting director of public affairs. His statement came a day after Senator Mark Warner, a Democratic member of the Senate Banking Committee and a former technology executive, asked the commission to evaluate the adequacy of credit reporting agencies' cyber security practices. The Equifax breach revealed the Social Security numbers, driver’s licence records, birth dates, addresses and credit histories of roughly one-half of the US adult population, making it ""one of the largest, and potentially most impactful, breaches in recent history”, Mr Warner wrote to acting FTC chair Maureen Ohlhausen. Equifax is also likely to face investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has declined to comment, as well as several state attorneys-general. On Wall Street, the company’s shares continued to slide, off more than 3 per cent in lunchtime trading and down roughly one-third over the past week. The FTC has policed cyber security with 21 enforcement actions since 2014 against companies such as Uber, Ashley Madison, and Wyndham Worldwide. Commission investigations usually end with settlements that require offending companies to institute tighter data security practices and submit to outside auditing of them over a 20-year period. In some circumstances, the commission can seek monetary penalties. In December 2015, for example, LifeLock paid $100m to settle FTC contempt charges that the company had violated a 2010 federal court order requiring it to better secure consumer data and refrain from deceptive advertising. The FTC can also seek fines to refund consumers who have paid for flawed services or if companies subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, such as Equifax, violate its terms. In 2006, ChoicePoint, a consumer data broker, paid $10m to settle FTC charges of lax electronic security practices affecting 163,000 consumers under that 1970 law. The agency, which is tasked with protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive practices, applies a “reasonableness” test to corporate data security practices. “A company’s data security measures must be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security,” according to the commission. Equifax may struggle to demonstrate that its efforts were adequate. Earlier this week, the company acknowledged that it had failed to patch a known weakness in Apache Struts, used to develop web applications in the Java programming language, thus allowing hackers to access sensitive customer data. Brian Krebs, a well-known computer security expert, wrote on Wednesday that one Equifax computer application that allowed its employees in Argentina to manage customer credit report disputes was also “wide open, protected by perhaps the most easy-to-guess password combination ever: ‘admin/admin’.” Follow David J Lynch on Twitter: @davidjlynch"

56;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-14T07:22:59Z;Equifax blames known web app glitch for hacking;US credit-reporting group accused of failing to shore up defence against Apache flaw;Equifax, the US credit-reporting group at the centre of a huge data breach, has said that it was hacked via a weakness widely discussed in cyber security circles six months ago. The admission is likely to amplify criticism of its lax defences.The Atlanta-based company said last week that hackers broke into its vaults in mid-May to steal names, social security numbers, dates of birth and other identifying information for 143m Americans, along with more than 200,000 sets of credit card numbers.Since then, shares in the company have fallen about 30 per cent amid calls for hearings on the affair in both chambers of Congress, state-level investigations and a flurry of private lawsuits.Late on Wednesday, in an update posted to its website, Equifax said that the criminals had exploited a vulnerability in Apache Struts, which is a popular open-source framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language.The fact that Equifax [was] attacked in May means that [it] did not follow that advice. Had they done so, this breach would not have occurredBut Oege de Moor, chief executive and founder of Semmle, a software analytics provider based in San Francisco, noted that the weakness — known by the code CVE-2017-5638 — had been disclosed by the Struts project in March, along with “clear and simple” instructions on how to fix it.“The fact that Equifax [was] attacked in May means that [it] did not follow that advice,” he said. “Had they done so, this breach would not have occurred.”Equifax could not be reached for comment.The disclosure is likely to heighten pressure on the company and Richard F Smith, its chief executive, who last week said that Equifax did not realise it had been breached until late July.Earlier on Wednesday, a bipartisan group of US senators called for sweeping federal investigations of Equifax over stock sales by company executives “within days” of the discovery of the raid.In a joint letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the 36 senators — led by Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Republican John Kennedy of Louisiana — called published reports of such stock sales “disturbing” and urged a probe of potential violations of insider trading laws.The lawmakers also asked for regulators’ findings on “whether Equifax management employed reasonable measures to ensure the security of the now compromised data”. “We request that you spare no effort in your investigations and in enforcing the law to the fullest extent against anyone who is found to be at fault,” they wrote.Mr de Moor of Semmle said that his group had disclosed a new Struts vulnerability (CVE-2017-9805) to the cyber security community last week, jointly with the Struts developers. Many companies reacted promptly, he said, singling out Cisco, the networking group, which put out a full account of the products that were affected by the vulnerability within 48 hours.“Forward-looking companies, which have the right procedures in place . . . reacted to the disclosure by taking remedial action,” he said.

Apple — the world’s most valuable publicly listed company — fell 1.3 per cent a day after its product launch.Equifax also kept a lid on the benchmark index’s gains, as the credit-report agency — which is under intense scrutiny after it revealed a massive data breach — fell another 14.5 per cent on Wednesday amid intensifying pressure from federal and state authorities.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day up 0.18 per cent to 22,158, thanks to rises of more than 1 per cent for energy giant Chevron and newly merged chemicals company DowDuPont, while the Nasdaq Composite bumped up 0.06 per cent to 6,458.3.The dollar continued to gather strength, rising 0.6 per cent to 92.43 against a basket of its peers. Gold dropped 0.5 per cent to $1,325.9 a troy ounce, and yield on the 10-year US Treasury note gained 0.025 percentage points to 2.19 per cent.US oil prices ended the day up significantly, with a 2.3 per cent gain bringing a barrel of West Texas Intermediate — the US standard — to $49.36.

58;EFX;Equifax Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

60;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-12T13:38:31Z;Equifax flaws exposed by hack attack;Questions about strength of cyber defences have fuelled rising anger over data breach;"US senator Richard Blumenthal did not mince his words. The cyber attack at Equifax that compromised personal records for about half the US adult population was “a historic data disaster”, the Connecticut senator wrote in a letter to the company’s chief executive on Monday. Equifax’s “pathetic” remedies were no compensation, he said, for the loss of a “treasure trove of information for any given user”.The letter is a measure of the anger  that has met the incident, disclosed late on Thursday last week, in which hackers stole names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth and other identifying information for 143m Americans over a period of about two and half months. That loss, combined with the theft of the credit card numbers of about 209,000 people, prompted New York attorney-general Eric Schneiderman to warn New Yorkers to “remain vigilant” against possible fraud attempts as he started an investigation.Equifax is the latest US company to be hit by a devastating cyber attack. In terms of accounts hit, the breach was not as big as Yahoo’s record data loss disclosed at the end of 2016 affecting more than 1bn users, but worries have been magnified by the fact that Equifax is a company supposedly expert at handling and protecting information. Chief executive Richard F Smith described it as striking “at the heart of who we are and what we do”. Yahoo users also lost no sensitive information; just usernames and passwords. As such, Equifax’s admission that up to 143m sets of records could have been accessed, makes the incident almost twice as serious as a 2015 hack at Anthem, a health insurer, which involved the social security numbers of more than 78m people.“This one is a different animal in the sense of the nature of the information that was breached,” said Richard Fairbank, chief executive of Capital One, at a financial-services industry conference in New York on Monday. “We have not been through the equivalent of this one.”Even now, many Americans will not know if they have had their details stolen by hackers — and even the fact that Equifax, one of the three big credit scoring agencies, had their details will have been a shock given its services are used by other companies to check credit worthiness of customers. Shares in Equifax fell another 8 per cent on Monday, following a 14 per cent plunge on Friday, wiping more than $3.5bn from its market value.Analysts warned of the threat of hearings on the affair in both chambers of Congress, regulatory probes from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, state-level investigations, and a “slew” of private legal actions.At the Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, analysts expect regulators to focus on the five-week gap between discovery and disclosure, and the insider stock sales in between. The SEC declined to comment on whether it had begun a probe, but one former enforcement official expressed confidence to the Financial Times that the agency would take action.“People will be fighting to open this,” the former official said. “[The chairman] is worried at a macro level about investors understanding the risks.”“The public flogging of Equifax has just begun,” said Isaac Boltansky, policy research director at Compass Point in Washington.Equifax has not been explicit about how the breach happened, or who might be behind it, but cyber security experts criticised Equifax for apparent flaws in its defences. The only comment from the company has been that the breach related to a web app in the US, leading to suggestions that the company had not been doing enough to protect vulnerable website access points. Alex Heid, New York-based chief research officer at SecurityScorecard, a cyber security monitoring platform, said that even a “cursory” analysis of the company’s online footprint showed several potential weaknesses, including applications written in relatively old and vulnerable languages.In particular, he said, hackers may have exploited vulnerabilities in Apache Struts — a popular open-source framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language. A spate of attacks earlier this year highlighted the risks of remote attackers stealing in to execute code on servers built using that Struts framework. Equifax, which used Struts, should have been on high alert following those “weaponised” raids, said Mr Heid.Apache Software Foundation, which makes the Struts software, said that “it is not clear which Struts vulnerability would have been utilised, if any”. Equifax did not respond to emails asking for comment. Other analysts queried Equifax’s handling of the incident, wondering why the company waited almost six weeks after discovering the breach, before alerting investors and the broader public. Unlike many other types of financial service providers, the cyber security practices of credit reporting bureaus fall outside of direct industry and regulatory authority purview. Even so, said analysts, a breach of this scale should have been disclosed earlier.The company said it went public after engaging an independent cyber security firm to conduct a forensic assessment and provide recommendations to toughen electronic security safeguards. Those affected have been disappointed by Equifax’s offer of a year of free credit monitoring with its TrustedID product.“This is cybersecurity’s Roswell incident,” said Mark Sangster, vice-president of industry security strategies at eSentire, a threat detection firm based in Kitchener, near Toronto. “How do you have this major event, and we hear nothing about it?”One head of an asset management firm said he was “incensed” both by the massive loss of data and the company’s presentation of it. “One thing that is quixotic to me, is that Equifax kept saying that the core part of the database was not breached. But what the f*ck is that, if not my social security number, my driving licence and so on?”A video message from the chief executive was no help either, says Elad Ben-Meir, vice-president of marketing at CyberInt, a Tel Aviv-based firm. “They should have had a proper response plan in place, all the way to an executive owner that will be able to handle the situation.”Class-action law suits are piling up. About two dozen proposals have already been filed, according to federal court records. Eric Johnson, dean of the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, drew a parallel with the ChoicePoint incident in 2005, when it emerged that the data warehouser — spun off from Equifax eight years earlier — had been duped into selling insurance-related information on 163,000 consumers to an alleged crime ring. In 2006, the Federal Trade Commission demanded a record $15m fine for failure to protect consumers’ financial and background data, and within a couple of years the company was sold to Reed Elsevier, re-emerging as LexisNexis Risk Solutions. A similar fate could await Equifax, said Prof Johnson, noting that one of Equifax’s business lines is identity theft protection.“This is the great irony: it is like going to the hospital and getting beaten up,” he said. “It is what’s driving a lot of the outrage.”Additional reporting by David J LynchEquifax is one of three companies in the US — along with Experian and TransUnion — that dominate the business of gathering information on borrowing habits from banks and other sources. They then organise and analyse that information to come up with scores that are used by lenders and other financial institutions to price credit. Revenues last year came to $3.1bn, up 18 per cent on the year earlier.Analysts warn that the company’s shares and bonds may remain under pressure. On Monday afternoon Standard & Poor’s revised its outlook on Equifax’s debt to “negative”, saying that its rating, three notches above junk, was threatened by the costs of the clean-up.Negative headlines will “weigh on [the Equifax] brand for the foreseeable future”, said Manav Patnaik, equity analyst at Barclays in New York.

61;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-09T01:06:08Z;Equifax faces legal storm over its handling of data breach;Credit agency criticised for delay in alerting consumers and earlier move on waivers;A category five legal and regulatory storm is headed straight for the credit reporting service Equifax over its handling of a massive data breach affecting 143m Americans.The company drew fire on Friday amid revelations that it required consumers to waive their rights to sue over the cyber failure, instead agreeing to arbitration of any claims in return for obtaining its “TrustedID” credit-monitoring service. Eric Schneiderman, New York state attorney-general, blasted the requirement as “unacceptable and unenforceable” and said his office had asked the company to drop the demand. On Capitol Hill, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee joined the criticism, tweeting: “ Equifax should remove forced arbitration from TrustedID immediately, not take advantage of customers they put at risk.” Late on Friday Equifax appeared to cave in on the waiver of rights, saying in a statement: “We have made it clear that the arbitration clause and class action waiver included in the Equifax and TrustedID Premier terms of use does not apply to this cyber security incident.”The company’s shares fell nearly 14 per cent in New York on Friday. The size of the Equifax breach, which could affect more than half of the US adult population, coupled with the sensitivity of the affected data and the 40 days it took in alerting the public ensure that the firestorm will not end soon. Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission are expected to launch potentially lengthy examinations of the company’s security measures and the response of Equifax executives once they discovered the failure. “This entire matter will get significant scrutiny by the SEC, FTC and state attorneys-general across the United States,” said Harriet Pearson, a partner at Hogan Lovells. “From the FTC and state AGs’ perspective, there will be an intense focus on the kind of security measures that were in place and what the company knew and when they knew it.” The FTC has reached consent decrees with several companies involving cyber-related consumer privacy violations. On Tuesday, the watchdog announced a settlement with Lenovo over charges that the computer maker had harmed consumers by preloading software on hundreds of thousands of laptops that disabled security features in order to deliver pop-up ads. The settlement, which included 32 state attorneys-general, requires Lenovo to obtain consumers’ consent before deploying such software in the future and to maintain for 20 years a software security programme that is subject to third-party audits, the commission said. The SEC, which also has highlighted cyber security for market participants in recent years, has yet to bring an enforcement action against a public company for failing to disclose a cyber incident in a timely fashion. Equifax should remove forced arbitration from TrustedID immediately, not take advantage of customers they put at riskBut commission officials are likely to examine Equifax’s handling of its breach. “In recent years, the SEC has indicated that it is interested in the issue of whether companies appropriately disclose to investors cyber breaches once they become material,” said Andrew Ceresney, the commission’s former enforcement chief. Equifax also may have run afoul of some state laws that mandate speedy notification of data breaches. Florida, for example, in 2014 reduced the deadline for notifying state residents that their data had been disclosed from 45 to 30 days. The company said it discovered the breach, which it disclosed on Thursday, on July 29. By itself, that nearly six-week delay may not amount to wrongdoing. The SEC requires companies to disclose cyber attacks when they become a material event. But in some incidents, the FBI advises corporate victims not to make a public statement while agents pursue the hackers. Equifax also could argue that it only learned at a later date that a material amount of customer data had been accessed without authorisation, according to Brian Hengesbaugh, a partner at Baker & McKenzie in Chicago. Determining when the notification clock starts running would depend on a detailed investigation of exactly what company executives knew as their in-house forensic investigation proceeded, Mr Hengesbaugh said. “Those are tough, tough questions,” he said.Follow David J Lynch on Twitter: @davidjlynch
62;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-08T18:22:44Z;New York, Illinois launch probes into Equifax cyber breach;;Attorneys general from Illinois and New York said on Friday that their offices were investigating the massive cyber-security breach revealed by US credit-reporting agency Equifax, and a US House of Representatives committee has said it plans to hold a hearing into the “troubling” incident.New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said that he had sent a letter to Equifax seeking additional information about the incident. “The Equifax breach has potentially exposed sensitive personal information of nearly everyone with a credit report, and my office intends to get to the bottom of how and why this massive hack occurred,” Mr Scheiderman said.His counterpart in Illinois, Lisa Madigan, echoed his concerns and called on the company to suspend charges in connection with placing a credit freeze on individuals’ accounts.And in Washington, Jeb Hensarling, chair of the House financial services committee, said his panel will hold a hearing to discuss the incident, at a date yet to be determined.He said in a statement: “This is obviously a very serious and very troubling situation and our committee has already begun preparations for a hearing. Large-scale security breaches are becoming all too common. Every breach leaves consumers exposed and vulnerable to identity theft, fraud and a host of other crimes, and they deserve answers.”Equifax, one of America’s big-three credit reporting agencies, has come under intense scrutiny after it said Thursday that personal records for 143m US consumers could have been compromised in a massive breach of its cyber defences.The company said it discovered the intrusion in July 29 and had reported criminal access to law enforcement authorities. It said it was continuing to work with those authorities as its own investigation into the incident continues.Equifax did not immediately return a request for comment. Its shares have plunged 13 per cent today.
63;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-08T17:10:41Z;Equifax shares drop as questions mount over data breach;Credit agency pressed to provide more details about hack that affected 143m people;Shares in Equifax dropped sharply on Friday as investors, regulators and lawmakers scrambled to assess the damage from one of the largest US cyber security breaches on record.Late on Thursday, the Atlanta-based consumer credit agency said hackers had accessed the social security numbers and other personal information of 143m Americans — more than half the adult population — along with files containing credit-card numbers for about 209,000 US consumers.About $3bn was wiped off the market value of Equifax on Friday morning, which is one of the three agencies that dominate the business of gathering data on consumers’ borrowing history. The shares dropped as much as 17 per cent before staging a partial recovery, ending Friday 13.7 per cent lower at $123.23.Analysts said the effects would be hard for the company to shake off, noting that at least one class-action lawsuit was filed overnight, accusing Equifax of failure to protect consumer data.Others said Equifax will face uncomfortable questions from federal and state regulators. New York attorney-general Eric Schneiderman on Friday started a formal investigation into the incident, asking Equifax for additional information about the breach.At issue will be the adequacy of the company’s security measures — especially given the volume and sensitivity of the information it stored — and the actions that executives took once they discovered the breach.The breach also hit consumers outside the US. In the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which oversees data privacy, said that it had been “in direct contact with Equifax” to establish the facts. It has advised Equifax to alert affected UK customers.Businesses in the US were urged to be on high alert for the risk of fraud, as cyber security experts warned that the card data stolen in the hack were likely already in the hands of criminals.Consumers, taking to online forums with worries that their details had been compromised, were advised by Equifax to sign up for a check — waiving their right to sue the company in the process.Gretchen Ruck, a director at AlixPartners, a strategy consultancy in New York, noted that the timing of the breach disclosure came 40 days after its discovery on July 29, possibly to comply with the 45-day reporting limited established by certain US states. Equifax could not be reached for comment on the timing of the announcement.It seems that when you’re dealing with a company with the mission of Equifax . . . you don’t do just what is required, but take affirmative action to alert people as quickly as possibleBut Bart Friedman, senior counsel at Cahill, a law firm in New York, argued that news of this “monumental” breach should have come sooner.“It seems that when you’re dealing with a company with the mission of Equifax, with the scale and scope and reach, you don’t do just what is required, but take affirmative action to alert people as quickly as possible,” he said.Mr Friedman added that the company’s board has a duty to investigate the sales of Equifax stock by a trio of senior executives on August 1 and 2. Equifax said on Thursday night that the executives — including finance chief John Gamble — had no knowledge of the breach that had been discovered days earlier.Democratic Senator Mark Warner, a former technology executive and vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the case “profoundly troubling”.He said: “It raises serious questions about whether Congress should not only create a uniform data breach notification standard, but also whether Congress needs to rethink data protection policies, so that enterprises such as Equifax have fewer incentives to collect large, centralised sets of highly sensitive data.”

Some UK and Canadian residents were also affected, it said.On a special website set up to address consumers’ concerns, chairman and chief executive Rick Smith appeared in a video, saying that the hack “strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I deeply regret this incident and I apologise to every affected consumer and all of our partners.”Another potential complication for the company is that public filings show that three senior executives, including chief financial officer John Gamble, sold shares worth almost $1.8m in the days after the attack was detected.With a breach like this, you’re going to be seeing fallout and aftershocks for many, many monthsAn Equifax spokesperson said the trio, who sold a “small percentage” of their holdings, “had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time they sold their shares”.Analysts noted that big companies are under near-constant bombardment from criminals, “hacktivists” and disaffected insiders, all trying to breach their defences.Attempts range from “watering hole” attacks, where employees gather at spoof websites that implant malware, to more complex schemes led by state-linked groups.The raid on Equifax comes in the wake of the WannaCry virus attack, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers in 150 countries this May, debilitating the British National Health Service and companies including FedEx and Renault.Yahoo revealed last December that attacks between 2013 and 2016 had compromised the personal information of more than a billion users, data which included names, phone numbers, birth dates and passwords.Equifax is one of America’s big three credit-reporting agencies, along with Experian and TransUnion. The companies gather data on consumers’ borrowing habits, so that potential lenders can see what type of risk they would be taking in supplying a new credit card or loan.Equifax said on Thursday it had found no evidence of unauthorised access to its core consumer or commercial credit-reporting databases.Such a breach would have been “the kind of hack that financial nightmares are made of”, said Joel Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham University School of Law. Credit-reporting agencies “have all the critical details of your financial life that would enable a wrongdoer to wreak havoc with your finances,” he said.But George Avetisov, chief executive of HYPR, a provider of biometric authentication software, said the potential theft of personally identifiable information was serious enough.Such data are “a gold mine, better than any username or password cache you could want,” he said, noting that the information could be used to open new accounts or to perform social-engineering attacks.“You can change your username and password, but what are you going to do with your social security number?” he said. “With a breach like this, you’re going to be seeing fallout and aftershocks for many, many months.”

The company admitted that hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses and driving licence numbers, as well as credit card information.Public filings also show that three senior executives, including chief financial officer John Gamble, sold shares worth almost $1.8m in the days after the attack was detected. An Equifax spokesperson said the trio, who sold a “small percentage” of their holdings, “had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time they sold their shares”.

67;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-09-07T23:39:05Z;Equifax: once more unto;Data breaches are bad for retailers, but far worse for credit scoring companies;For all their diligent shredding, American consumers may as well walk around with their financial information tattooed on their foreheads.A spate of data breaches reached a new peak on Thursday evening when Equifax disclosed that personal details, including social security numbers, of 143m US consumers had been illegally accessed.It is annoying when retailers such as Target and Home Depot fail to protect adequately the information of tens of millions of consumers.But the credit scoring company’s breach is bigger and worse for its business. Few customers were sufficiently upset by Home Depot’s 2014 data breach that they went elsewhere for paint and plant pots. But who now wants to buy fraud protection from Equifax, which noted previously: “Our Role as a Trusted Steward is a Key Execution Enabler.” Which company wants advice on how to handle data breaches, which Equifax sells with the helpful reminder that they can cause a “decline in shareholder value”?Equifax’s own decline was 13 per cent on Thursday night. That is far worse than the reaction suffered by Experian, the world’s biggest credit checking company, after it suffered a data breach in 2015 — the shares are since up 40 per cent — but that loss was a tenth of the size.The immediate costs will be large but mitigated by insurance and overshadowed by the longer-term hit to trust and revenues. The core business of credit scoring is already under pressure from free competitors such as Credit Karma. Equifax had sensibly pivoted to fraud prevention and identity management.At an industry conference in May, Richard Smith, chief executive, said these were the most exciting sources of future growth, with revenues increasing at strong double-digit percentages compared with an estimated 8 per cent increase this year for the broader company. Unbeknown to him at about the same time, the company suffered the breach.Its main response is to offer free access to its TrustedID product, which scans black market sites for stolen information. That implies some lost revenue in the next 12 months from customers who might have paid for it. More important, as Equifax knows better than most, bad credit can take years to put right.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly Best of Lex email at www.ft.com/newsletters.

It said that the unauthorised accesses took place from mid-May until July, and primarily involved information like names, Social Security numbers, birth dates and other personal information.Credit card numbers for about 209,000 US consumers were accessed, Equifax said, as were documents with personally identifying information about 182,000 consumers. The company said it is has reported the criminal access to law enforcement, while its own investigation remains ongoing.Equifax shares fell more than 5 per cent in after-hours trading.The company is one of the big three US credit bureaux, which provide credit scores used by lenders. Its chief executive Richard Smith said in a statement:“This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I apologize to consumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes. We pride ourselves on being a leader in managing and protecting data, and we are conducting a thorough review of our overall security operations. We also are focused on consumer protection and have developed a comprehensive portfolio of services to support all US consumers, regardless of whether they were impacted by this incident.”
69;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-01-03T22:34:22Z;Equifax and TransUnion fined for deceptive credit score practices;Consumers misled about usefulness and cost of credit scores they bought;Two of the three big US credit bureaux have been fined for deceptive credit score practices, putting under fresh scrutiny the ratings that play an important role in the personal finance of millions of Americans.In settlements with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Equifax and TransUnion are to pay more than $23m in restitution and civil fines for deceiving consumers about the usefulness and cost of credit scores they bought.Credit scores are widely used by US lenders to determine which consumers qualify for loans and the interest rates they charge. Consumer rights advocates have long criticised practices in the sector, questioning accuracy, methodology and the consequences of poor ratings.The penalties against Equifax and TransUnion relate not to how the scores are calculated, however, but rather the marketing of those that were sold to consumers — sometimes as part of wider “credit monitoring” services. Neither company admitted nor denied the findings.The bureaux, along with rival Experian, collate details about consumers — such as payment history — and sell the information to banks and other commercial users through so-called credit reports.The reports are distinct from credit scores, which are numerical summaries. Lenders use a range of scores from different providers.The best-known scoring model was developed by FICO, whose scores are used in the vast majority of credit decisions in the US. It uses information provided by all three bureaux.FICO has faced competition, including from online lenders who argue their own systems are superior.The credit bureaux themselves have also sought to sell scores: VantageScore in the case of TransUnion, and a proprietary score developed by Equifax.However, the CFPB said that these scores were not typically used by lenders to make credit decisions. The regulator found TransUnion and Equifax had in their advertising “falsely represented” that the scores were the same as those used by lenders.The CFPB also took issue with the fees the companies charged. The companies claimed that their products were either free or, in the case of TransUnion, cost only $1 — but unsuspecting customers could rack up more than $200 a year in charges.Consumers were signed up for free short-term trials, the regulator said, after which they were subscribed — for recurring monthly fees — unless they cancelled.The CFPB found the practices violated financial laws under the post-crisis Dodd-Frank reforms — TransUnion since at least July 2011 and Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014.TransUnion said in a statement: “We continue to believe that our consumer marketing has been clear and has complied with the law and other government guidance . . . However, we are committed to making improvements to our consumer experience.”Equifax said: “While Equifax does not believe it has violated any laws and has not admitted any liability, Equifax determined it was in its best interest to resolve the matter with the CFPB.”
70;EFX;Equifax Inc;2017-01-03T20:40:51Z;TransUnion, Equifax fined for deceptive practices;;"A US regulator has fined two of the three largest credit bureaus in the US for deceptive credit score practices. TransUnion and Equifax must pay a total of at least $17.6m in restitution as well as fines totaling $5.5m.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the companies had deceived customers about the usefulness and cost of credit scores they sold, writes Alistair Gray.The bureaus collate details about consumers’ payment history and sell the information to banks and other lenders through so-called credit reports. These are related to, but distinct from, credit scores, which are numerical summaries. Lenders use a range of different scores, which vary by provider and model, to make credit decisions.The CFPB found that TransUnion and Equifax had in their advertising “falsely represented” that the credit scores they sold to consumers were the same as those used by lenders. In fact, the scores sold were not typically used by lenders, the CFPB said.The regulator also found that the companies claimed that their products were either free or, in the case of TransUnion, cost only “$1.” In reality, the CFPB said, consumers were signed up for a free short-term trial, after which they were subscribed for a recurring fee
unless they cancelled.The CFPB found the practices violated financial laws under the post-crisis Dodd-Frank reforms – TransUnion since at least July 2011 and Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014.“We continue to believe that our consumer marketing has been clear and has complied with the law and other government guidance. Our trial credit monitoring service has given consumers low-cost access to their credit report and credit score and allowed them to conveniently cancel monitoring services at any time online or by phone,” TransUnion said in a statement.“However, we are committed to making improvements to our consumer experience, and over the past several months we have worked cooperatively with the CFPB to be the industry leader in designing the enhanced, voluntary marketing disclosures that go beyond the current legal and regulatory requirements to which we agreed as part of this settlement.”Equifax said:The CFPB’s investigation into these matters has been ongoing for nearly three years, and Equifax implemented changes addressing the CFPB’s concerns shortly after the investigation began. While Equifax does not believe it has violated any laws and has not admitted any liability, Equifax determined it was in its best interest to resolve the matter with the CFPB. Equifax remains committed to providing products and services that educate and alert consumers about their credit and identity and ensuring transparency and clarity about the value of those products and services."
71;EFX;Equifax Inc;2015-10-15T05:36:37Z;Being ‘wasted’ on Facebook may damage your credit score;Credit analytics groups explore new ways of assessing a consumer’s ability to handle loans;The US’s middle classes are drenched in debt and demand is slowing. So how do banks build profits? By bending the rules.Two of the top credit analytics companies are exploring new ways of assessing consumers’ ability to handle loans, turning away from traditional sources of data such as credit cards and car loans to scour phone and utility bills, change-of-address records and information drawn from DVD clubs and suppliers of rent-to-own furniture.The efforts could open up new classes of customer for the big US banks, and come as lenders struggle to generate steady profits in an environment of tightened regulation and ultra-low interest rates. In third-quarter results this week, the US’s three biggest banks — Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase — have reported year-on-year declines in quarterly revenue.One of the companies, FICO, has been working on a pilot project with a dozen US credit card companies, and now claims to have developed reliable ways to price loans to millions of people who have historically been off the grid.Will Lansing, chief executive of the San Jose, California-based company, said FICO was increasingly looking at data on a spectrum: with credit card repayment history at one end — the most reliable guide to creditworthiness — and at the other, information volunteered on social media platforms such as Facebook.“If you look at how many times a person says ‘wasted’ in their profile, it has some value in predicting whether they’re going to repay their debt,” he said. “It’s not much, but it’s more than zero.”Credit cards and car loans are likely to be among the bright spots in the US banks’ third-quarter figures, with much of the growth driven by segments considered subprime. But mortgages and personal loans should be patchier, suggesting that many consumers across the US have borrowed about as much as they can.Aggregate household debt balances were unchanged in the second quarter at $11.85tn, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve, and remain more than 6 per cent below the pre-Lehman peak.TransUnion, another credit-analytics group, has embarked on a project to tap alternative data sources to help people with blemished records get better terms.Both FICO and TransUnion say they are responding to demand from their ultimate customers, the banks, which worry that by declining people without traditional credit scores they are turning away potential sources of profit.“The market was absolutely hungry for a solution,” said Jim Wehmann, executive vice-president for scores at FICO.If you look at how many times a person says ‘wasted’ in their profile, it has some value in predicting whether they’re going to repay their debtFICO, which led the practice of custom scoring in the 1950s and whose scores are now used in about 90 per cent of credit decisions in the US, is pursuing its project in partnership with Equifax, one of the top three credit-reporting bureaux, and LexisNexis Risk Solutions.The new model gives high marks to people who have regularly paid phone and utility bills, and who have not moved around enough to suggest problems paying rent.Some of the new credit-eligible customers are new to the country, some are young — and some have simply not borrowed enough to generate traditional files. But the alternative data suggest that many are a good credit risk. “We can now score the previously unscoreable,” said Mr Wehmann.Mike Mondelli, Chicago-based senior vice-president of alternative data services at TransUnion, said a broader approach to scoring could lead to cheaper loans for 23m consumers — typically “someone who has some bumps in the road on credit, but who pays more than the monthly minimum”.From the banks’ point of view, he said, it is “good for adding more customers at an acceptable risk rate”.
72;EFX;Equifax Inc;2015-08-28T17:17:50Z;Credit scorers want to ‘friend’ consumers;Social media accounts could be used for financial product applications;Financial companies are more open than ever to the idea of using data from sites including Facebook and LinkedIn to assess the creditworthiness of potential customers but consumers remain strongly opposed.Banks, alternative lending platforms and mobile phone providers are all keen to use information from social media accounts as part of a wider credit-scoring process, according to a study by Equifax, the credit reference agency.However, its research shows that three-quarters of consumers would be unlikely to allow them access to this data.Paul Birks, director of decision solutions at Equifax, said: “With fraud on the rise, companies are turning to social media as a useful tool to verify an applicant’s identity.”“The number of contacts and the length of time an online profile has been established is a useful way to help judge whether an application is genuine or from a fraudster. A well-established, active social media presence is hard to fake,” he said.Although lenders are not using social media in this way at present, 76 per cent of consumers polled by YouGov said they would be against financial companies using information posted on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn to assess their application for a financial product. Over half said it would “make them angry” if lenders tried to access the information.Nearly two in five people believe they will no longer need to use cash in ten years as card and smartphone technology increasingly replace notes and coins. The “death of cash” has long been predicted amid the growing use of credit and debit cards. Contactless cards, mobile phone payment systems and advances in biometric identification have renewed claims that its convenience and popularity will eventually fade.Continue readingHowever, Mr Birks said it could be a good additional step for those with a “thin credit file” who may otherwise be denied credit. Consumers assume that any data for a credit assessment is going to be used to stop them from getting a product or a service, he said.“Where this could work really well is for a young worker who’s moved out of the family home to a new address, and hasn’t built up much credit history. If you have a history of behaviour on the internet that’s solid, and your social media identity is robust, then you are who you say you are. This data can be used as an entry point.”Mr Birks compared the use of social media data to internet retailers such as Amazon, which use customer data to predict potential purchases, which consumers “think is great, because it’s useful”.“All banks and lenders are already using social media to publicise their services, and whether you see an advert for a product is often based on what your internet searches have been,” he added.
73;EFX;Equifax Inc;2015-08-14T17:28:19Z;Carphone data breach is a wake-up call for consumers;Take steps to protect your identity online;Consumers have been urged to step up online security following a cyber attack affecting 2.4m customers of Carphone Warehouse who have been told that personal information and bank details may have been stolen by hackers.Three websites selling mobile phones operated by the company were targeted as it became the latest retailer to fall victim to an attack.“Because these records were taken from online transactions, the majority [of stolen customer data] do include email addresses,” the company said, adding that encrypted card data from up to 90,000 customers “may have been accessed”.Carphone is advising affected customers to inform their bank and credit card company, monitor account activity closely and check their credit rating to make sure nobody has applied for credit in their name.However, it has come under fire from customers who resent having to pay for credit monitoring services from Experian and Equifax which can cost up to £15 a month.Almost a fifth of companies have lost confidential information in at least one breach over the past two years, according to Experian research, but there are plenty of steps that online shoppers can take to minimise the risks of card fraud and identity theft before it happens.“If your home got burgled, you would change the locks. Today, your locks and keys are your online passwords,” says Jim Steven, head of data breach services at Experian. “Fraudsters will go to the door that’s slightly ajar, rather than the one that is locked and bolted.”Astonishingly, more than half of people who were informed that a specific online account had been compromised failed to change their password, the company’s research shows. And although many people use the same password across multiple sites, nearly 40 per cent admitted that they hadn’t bothered to change these either, leaving them at further risk.The UK’s data watchdog is investigating a security breach at Carphone Warehouse, after the mobile phone retailer revealed that up to 2.4m customers may have had their personal information and bank details stolen by hackers. The Information Commissioner’s Office — which specialises in safeguarding of personal data — said it was looking into the cyber attack, having been notified about the incident late last week.Continue reading“Password” is still by far the most common password, says Mr Steven. He warns against using any real words due to the increasing sophistication of password-guessing algorithms.If you’ve ever gnashed your teeth as an online retailer asks you to create a password with capitals, numbers and a special character, “This is because it massively increases the number of calculations an algorithm has to go through [to crack it],” he explains.A good way to remember a more random password is to memorise a phrase, then use the first letter of each word. For example, “Been around the world in eighty days” could become “Batwi80d”.Other decisions are a trade-off between functionality and security. Websites may offer to store your card details for convenience, but Mr Steven worries that this peels off “another layer of security”.He points to the rising popularity of third-party payment systems such as PayPal and ApplePay which are increasingly used for online transactions, and mean consumers don’t have to enter credit card numbers on to retailers’ websites.High street banks are increasingly using texts to determine whether Internet purchases are genuine or fraudulent — typically requiring a response of “Y” or “N”. But these are useless if the bank doesn’t have your current mobile number, so check your details next time you log in to online banking.Many banks will also allow you to set up free text alerts flagging transactions above a certain size, or when your balance dips below a certain level which could provide a valuable early warning of unusual activity on your account.
74;EFX;Equifax Inc;2015-04-20T13:18:26Z;TransUnion strikes deal with Global Debt Registry;Agreement seeks to stamp out underhand collection practices in $3.3tn US consumer debt industry;A debt-tracking registry has signed a deal with TransUnion, one of the biggest US credit bureaux, aiming to stamp out unscrupulous collection practices within the $3.3tn US consumer debt industry.The company, Global Debt Registry, says it is shining light into a murky area. There are thousands of agencies in operation across the US, from big banks to one-man bands, all of which buy past-due debts from creditors or other businesses — often for pennies on the dollar — and try to collect.Debts can be pursued for years after they have been charged-off or sold, including after they have been extinguished — so-called “zombie” debt. Most consumers do not know or understand their legal rights with respect to the collection of time-barred debts, meaning that some are scared into paying up, often on the basis of flimsy documentation.In other cases, debtors may dispute legitimate claims on the grounds that they do not recognise the amount or the collector. Two of the biggest publicly listed agencies, Encore Capital and Portfolio Recovery Associates, are companies that “99 per cent of consumers have never heard of”, said Mark Parsells, chief executive of GDR.GDR has tackled these problems by assigning each debt a unique ID number, so that it and its customers can keep tabs on debts in the same way that the Department of Motor Vehicles tracks car ownership.Over time, said Mr Parsells, broader adoption of GDR’s vast database — along with supporting statements and loan applications — should improve collection rates on legitimate debt while giving peace of mind to consumers, who can check claims via Debt Lookup, a free online tool.Regulators have struggled to keep watch over debt-collection practices as outstanding consumer credit in the US has roughly tripled over the past 20 years, to $3.3tn in February. About 77m Americans — one in three people with credit histories — are in some form of non-mortgage debt collection, according to a 2014 survey.Debt collection accounted for 11 per cent of complaints to the Federal Trade Commission last year — the second biggest source of grievances after identity theft. A 2013 study by the FTC estimated that more than 30 per cent of debts purchased by debt buyers were at least six years old, putting them beyond or near the end of statutes of limitations in many states.According to a January 2015 report from the National Consumer Law Center, the real percentage of zombie debt being bought by collectors is probably even higher, as the FTC’s sample was limited to the biggest debt-purchasing companies.GDR’s partnership with TransUnion — one of the top three credit bureaux in the US, along with Experian and Equifax — is the most significant in the 10-year history of the Wilmington, Delaware-based group, said Mr Parsells.Together, the pair will market its debt-registry services to buyers, collectors and other financial institutions.
75;EFX;Equifax Inc;2015-04-16T09:12:21Z;Warnings over electoral register data;Electoral registers are vital for identity verification, but your details could also be sold on;"The government has spent £2.5m encouraging citizens to register to vote before next month’s general election, but some experts warn that doing so could lead to personal details being sold on to companies.New data from credit rating agency Equifax found that two per cent fewer UK adults were registered to vote in 2014 compared to the previous year.Not being on the register can have a negative impact on your credit rating, as electoral roll data are routinely used by lenders, utilities, insurers and mobile phone companies to help verify a customer’s identity.Laura Barrett, head of Equifax consumer affairs, said: “If an individual is registered to vote, it will appear on their credit report as a ‘good’ risk signal. It’s important to be on the electoral register if you’re planning to apply for credit or a new service or utility contract.”She added that for those people moving home it is important to register with the local authority for their new address as soon as possible. It can take up to six weeks for changes to the electoral roll to appear on an individual’s credit report.Councils maintain two versions of the electoral register. The full version is used for voting records, identity checks and criminal investigations but its distribution is very limited.The edited register, which includes anyone who does not ask to opt out, is available for sale to direct marketing firms; councils are allowed to sell on the edited roll for as little as £10 a time to private companies, including estate agents, pizza delivery shops and direct marketing firms. At a time when council budgets are under pressure, it can be a useful source of revenue.Research published by Big Brother Watch, an organisation set up to challenge policies that threaten people’s privacy, showed that 307 councils sold their registers to 2,700 individuals and companies over the past five years — receiving more than £250,000.Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: “Registering to vote is a basic part of our democracy. It is quite simply bizarre that this process has been allowed to become a back door for our names and addresses to be sold to anyone and everyone.“The edited register is a pointless waste of council time, undermines trust in the electoral system and contributes to huge volumes of junk mail. It should be abolished,” she said.The Electoral Commission and Association of Electoral Administrators also believe the register should only be used for purposes related to elections and referendums.The easiest way to opt out of the edited register is when filling out your annual electoral registration form. There are also a few free services to stop junk mail and unwanted telephone marketing calls. You can ask Royal Mail not to deliver junk mail (email:optout@royalmail.co.uk) and sign up to the mailing preference service (mpsonline.org.uk) and telephone preference service (tpsonline.org.uk), which will remove your name from junk mail and landline and mobile phone sales lists.Personal data are also held on share registers, which list active owners of a company’s shares. These registers include each person’s name, address and number of shares held, but can also further detail the holder’s occupation and the price paid for shares.Share registers are public documents, but changes to the law in 2006 mean that access is now more carefully controlled. Stuart Ellen, managing director of registration services at Equiniti, said there are safeguards to prevent wholesale copying of data.“Our databases have multiple levels of both physical and logical protection, including numerous layers of passwords and authentication.“All staff undertaking the administration of register details have very granular permissions to control which parts of the registers they may access and can only undertake processes or changes where they are specifically authorised. No direct bulk access to data is allowed,” he said.The Companies Act 2006 requires that enquiries relating to share registers follow a “proper purpose” process. It is an offence for a person knowingly or recklessly to make a request that is misleading, false or deceptive and the enquirer must also sign a declaration relating to the purpose of their inquiry and continuing use of the data.Individuals’ names only appear on the share register if they are the legal owner of the stock — usually because they hold share certificates. Those with holdings in nominee accounts, including all Isas, are beneficial owners and not listed on the share register."
76;EFX;Equifax Inc;2015-03-09T14:45:50Z;Credit report companies agree to reforms;Overhaul makes it easier for consumers to resolved debts;The three largest US credit reporting companies will revamp the way they handle mistakes and unpaid medical expenses in an overhaul aimed at making it easier for consumers to resolve their debt.Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, which collect credit information on more than 200m Americans, agreed to the changes to settle a more than two-year investigation into their practices by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a spokesperson for his office said Monday.Consumers often feel powerless when dealing with credit reporting firms, whose reports are critical in determining whether a person can obtain credit cards, auto or home loans. More than half of the debt on credit reports come from medical expenses, one of the leading causes of personal bankruptcy in the US.“Credit reports touch every part of our lives,” Mr Schneiderman said. “This agreement will reform the entire industry and provide vital protections for millions of consumers across the country.”Although the agreement is with the New York state attorney-general, the credit reporting companies agreed to apply most of the changes across the US. The firms will not pay a monetary penalty as part of the agreement.As part of the changes, credit reporting companies will have to assign trained staff to review suggestions of mistakes in credit reports. The companies had previously relied on lenders and creditors to confirm errors, which usually made it difficult for a consumer to correct a mistake.Credit reporting companies will also have to wait 180 days before listing medical bills on a report to help consumers deal with delayed payments from insurance companies or handle other disputes.Under the new framework, medical expenses paid by an insurance company will be deleted from a credit report, no matter the timeframe in which the bill is paid. Other kinds of debt can stay on a report for several years, even after it is paid off.Some consumer advocates have argued that medical bill collections should not be included on a credit report because they are different from other kinds of debt as the expenses usually come up unexpectedly.About 15m consumers have only medical debt on their credit report, according to a December 2012 study by the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Overall, more than 43m Americans have healthcare-related debt on their credit reports.In December, the CFPB announced that major credit reporting companies now have to provide regular reports on how they deal with consumer disputes as part of their regulatory exam process.“While all three nationwide credit bureaux have been and continue to operate in compliance with the applicable federal and state laws, we have never hesitated to go beyond the letter of the law to voluntarily improve the existing credit reporting environment,” said Stuart Pratt, president and chief executive of the Consumer Data Industry Association, which represents the three companies.

TDX will have a 75 per cent stake in the new entity, Integrated Debt Services Limited, with the government holding the remainder.The new company will receive a proportion of any unpaid debts collected beyond the figure secured in 2013-14. The Cabinet Office would not reveal the percentage to be paid, citing commercial confidentiality.The move to establish the joint venture is the latest sign of how a smaller and leaner Whitehall is adopting different ways of working in the hunt for big efficiency savings. In the Autumn Statement last month, George Osborne, the chancellor, set a target of an additional £10bn in economies to be achieved by 2017-18.Initial clients will include HM Revenue & Customs, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Student Loans Company. The aim is to widen it by bringing in other areas of the public sector, including local government.The backdrop to the initiative is the government’s less-than-sparkling rec­ord in collecting what is owed to it from many sources. These include unpaid fees, taxes, fines and loans, overpaid benefits or grants, and unrecovered costs from court cases.Earlier this year the Commons public accounts committee criticised the government’s failure to establish a “cross-government approach” to managing debt and securing more money for the exchequer, despite the direct impact it had on government borrowing.This inaction had led to large volumes of old debts building up in departments that were unlikely to be collected, it said. The Cabinet Office said that working with TDX would allow the government “to access best-value private sector knowledge and expertise” on how to collect it. The other clients already signed up to the new venture are the Home Office, the Legal Aid Agency and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.TDX Group, a supplier of debt collection systems based in Nottingham, was founded in 2004 by Mark Onyett, a former executive of credit card issuer Capital One. The group helps large businesses, including some of Britain’s biggest banks, manage their debt collection. It was bought by US-based Equifax, a credit referencing agency, at the start of this year in a £200m deal.Mark Sanders, managing director of TDX Group, said it used data and analytics to understand what individuals in debt were able to pay. It then applied “the most appropriate and effective strategies using the best suppliers from the private sector”.TDX’s software analyses customer data to categorise loans in order to identify the most suitable company to collect them at the best price. Its Plato platform, for example, provides businesses with an outsourcing arrangement that takes over the management of their debt portfolios, giving tranches to a range of collection agencies.The business has grown substantially over the past decade, along with the expansion of consumer credit. TDX is estimated to have handled up to 50 per cent of total debt sales in the UK at one point, although that has dropped significantly over the past few years.A recent report found that TDX might have inflated debt sale prices while lowering barriers to entry, allowing smaller companies to buy segments of loan portfolios.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Taxpayers set for an even worse deal / From Lindsey Daniels
78;EFX;Equifax Inc;2014-11-19T00:04:56Z;Calls for free access to standard credit check;Widespread ignorance about access to credit file;More than 15m consumers have never checked their credit report, risking their ability to get a mortgage or take advantage of the best available financial deals, research has found.Credit check information is widely used by companies to determine whether to give people loans, credit cards or mobile phone contracts. Financial services firms increasingly use them to check the creditworthiness of potential staff while landlords want to know how likely their tenants are to keep up with the rent.Yet confusion and ignorance about the function and role of credit reports are widespread, according to a survey by uSwitch, a consumer finance website, which found that 76 per cent of those questioned had applied for credit but 41 per cent did not investigate their credit status.At a time of rising personal debt, over half (57 per cent) of respondents did not think credit checks had a noticeable impact on their consumer choices, in spite of one-third being refused credit.The three credit reference agencies, Experian, Equifax and Callcredit, have a statutory obligation to hand over individuals’ credit information for a fee of £2. A free one-month trial is available through Experian and Equifax, though users will pay around £15 a month after that if they fail to cancel the contract.USwitch called for people not only to have free access to their credit reports but for agencies to standardise the scores they use to judge creditworthiness, to allow for easier comparison.David Mann, head of money at uSwitch, said: “Consumers are flying blind, unaware how lenders are arriving at critical decisions about them and lacking the ability to do anything about it. We believe this is grossly unfair.”Backed by StepChange, a debt charity, uSwitch.com has launched an online petition which also calls for those who fail credit checks to have the right to be told why.New rules being brought in to clean up the payday lending industry may result in the eradication of the specialist high street lenders altogether, the head of the Financial Conduct Authority has admitted as he outlined a shake up of the controversial industry. Continue readingMr Mann said the UK had fallen behind other countries, such as the US, Germany and Hong Kong, which had legislated to provide consumers with free annual credit report information.He added that many people were unaware of the £2 statutory fee and that free trials among credit reference agencies were a hurdle to greater public awareness. “It needs to be done in a way that makes it as easy as possible for people to obtain their credit report.”Younger generations are particularly vulnerable to a lack of awareness about their credit score. They are more likely to live in rented accommodation, where landlords routinely use credit checks to influence their choice of tenant. Some 60 per cent of young adults did not realise that landlords ran such checks on their potential tenants.But the study found that the over-55s were the least informed age group, with 55 per cent of those applying for credit never having checked their score.
79;EFX;Equifax Inc;2013-08-16T21:52:48Z;Prospecting in the data gold rush;;Ready or not – financial companies have come to a fork in the road regarding their data practices. One path can lead to billions in profits – the other to a potentially crippling missed opportunity. And the clock is ticking.In the 19th century, the California gold rush lured prospectors seeking the promise of tremendous wealth. Today, an even more lucrative gold rush has emerged for the financial-services industry, in the form of warehoused data on costs, profits, operations, supplier practices, and customer behaviour.In fact, Booz & Company estimates that the revenue potential from commercialising data will be US$175bn in 2013 – ramping up to $300bn per year in the next three to five years across the financial-services industry.Yet far too many financial companies have left this treasure trove untapped – and nontraditional competitors are taking notice and moving in. If firms don’t act fast, they risk losing 10 per cent or more of top-line revenue to nonfinancial competitors within the next few years.For example, Tesco, a British supermarket chain, recently analysed its customer transaction patterns and made the decision to offer proprietary lines of credit, giving shoppers loyalty perks in order to lure business away from other credit cards.Tesco cards now represent 12 per cent of all Visa/MasterCard transactions in England, proving the company has successfully siphoned off market share from traditional credit card companies by using warehoused data to identify a lucrative business opportunity.Leaders of financial firms need a strategy to enable this enterprise-wide data and analytics transformation – and the first step in seizing this opportunity is picking an appropriate business model.Transforming the Approach to InformationWe have identified five essential models to use data profitably and effectively, which together make up a spectrum of activity for transforming your approach to information.These models range from the elementary, such as utilising data to improve your core business, increasing marketing return on investment through customer and transactional insights, and white-labelling the capabilities and infrastructure of other firms, to highly advanced, such as delivering new types of data directly to customers and evolving into entirely new product and service offerings.Each model offers the opportunity to generate increased revenue, and some companies will implement multiple models to reach various customers and address different needs. The farther along the scale a firm is willing to go, the more transformative – and potentially profitable – the data effect becomes.Equifax offers an example of how innovative use of customer data links closely to growth. The company, known for selling credit scores and ratings, has not only outperformed the S & P500 in recent years, but also set expectations of multiyear growth of 7 to 10 per cent.Like many other financial companies, Equifax interacts with a large and diverse set of data assets. What sets it apart is its skill in leveraging that data in order to expand into adjacent businesses, including its highly profitable Suspicious ID fraud monitoring product and its Analytical Sandbox product, which enables backtesting and scenario testing for specific customers.Designing for Data TransformationNo matter the business models being pursued, several core design principles must be put in place if companies are to drive a successful data transformation strategy, guiding through design to execution:1. Understand your customersAdvances in technology now provide companies fine-grained customer data that allows for unprecedented analysis of customer needs and patterns. However, it is no longer enough to leverage these analyses for product creation. In the digital age, you must also identify your customers’ workflow so that your products can seamlessly integrate into their platforms.2. Get Hands-On with Your DataThe abundance of the data you own can often feel as overwhelming as a cluttered garage. Successful organisation at your home requires an investment of time and toil. Data organisation is no different. Companies should catalogue and map their data (across business lines) to build an enterprise-wide taxonomy that can be mined for opportunities.3. Understand the Value ChainIt is crucial to understand how data plays a role in your customers’ partnerships and supply chains. For example, by understanding how merchants interact with order management system vendors, a payment company can identify potential partnerships and opportunities for its data.4. Size the ValueYou need to understand your competitors and your own key inputs, such as the various costs involved for implementation, as well as the level of demand for the solution in the marketplace. The data transformation process can yield a substantial internal rate of return, even becoming self-funded, if designed correctly.5. Enhance the InfrastructureData can never reach its full earning potential without a solid technological infrastructure in place to support it. This IT infrastructure must be sophisticated, transparent, and flexible enough to allow your company to unlock the full value of its data, emphasising single data-entry points, real-time data for messaging, and monetised transactions for smooth delivery.Great opportunities exist for financial-services firms sitting on latent gold mines of data, but there is little time to waste. Prospectors from outside the industry are already showing interest, and are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities if firms are not willing to act decisively. The gold is still out there – you just need a well-constructed mining plan to find it.Happy digging.John Plansky, Jamie Solomon, Rebecca Karp, and Carl Drisko are part of the financial services practice at Booz & Company.
80;EFX;Equifax Inc;2013-03-12T23:57:46Z;Michelle Obama said to be hacking victim;;The threat to US security from hackers reached the inner realm of the White House after the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed they were probing the publication of what was claimed to be Michelle Obama’s personal information on a Russian website.The website, exposed.su, also published private information, including Social Security numbers, credit scores, phone numbers and former addresses of vice-president Joe Biden, FBI director Robert Mueller, former vice-president Al Gore, and celebrities including Jay Z and Beyonce Knowles. The FT could not confirm the authenticity of the personal information or the veracity of the attack.Some of the information appears to have been obtained through the annualcreditreport.com website, which issues individual reports from Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. To access that information, people must provide personally identifiable information, such as the bank that holds their mortgage or the last time they made a payment on a particular credit card.Experts said hackers were probably armed with personal information about the individuals that was then used to access the credit report data. Even the most secure websites are vulnerable if a person visiting the site already knows all the information that they need to access private data secured there.The revelation came as a leading US intelligence official warned on Tuesday that automatic budget cuts were threatening to cause “insidious” damage to US intelligence services and leave the country more vulnerable to cyber attacks and terrorism.James Clapper, director of national intelligence, said the US risked the same sort of “downward spiral” in intelligence capabilities that it witnessed before the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.“The impact will be gradual and almost invisible, unless or until we have an intelligence failure,” he said at a congressional hearing.On Tuesday Equifax confirmed “fraudulent and unauthorised” access to four consumer credit reports through annualcreditreport.com and that it was investigating the matter and aiding authorities.“Our initial investigation shows the perpetrators had the [personally identifiable information] of the individuals and were therefore able to pass the required authentication measures in place,” Equifax said.TransUnion and Experian also said they were investigating, but added their systems had not been hacked.“This looks to be an isolated situation in which criminals accessed personal credential information through various outside sources,” said Experian.The Secret Service would not confirm the authenticity of the information about Mrs Obama or others. A law enforcement official said the investigation would take a long time because it would require subpoenas of internet service providers and the co-operation of other law enforcers, and possibly some foreign agencies.The story broke on the celebrity website TMZ, which had published that the credit reports of some celebrities had been compromised.James Lewis, a cyber security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the incident had sent a clear message about Americans’ vulnerability.“We depend on this insecure infrastructure. That is sort of slowly dawning on people. There has been this illusion of privacy but there is no privacy on the internet,” he said.The exposed.su website was intermittently accessible to visitors on Tuesday afternoon, although some attempts were blocked. Under the headline “The Secret Files”, the bare bones site featured the quotation: “If you believe that God makes miracles, you have to wonder if Satan has a few up his sleeve”. A traffic counter said that more than 250,000 visitors had accessed the site.Clicking on the link to Mrs Obama revealed another all-black website displaying a cartoon-like picture of the First Lady and the phrase, “Blame your husband, we still love you, Michelle, <3”. It then listed a number it claimed was her Social Security Number, birth date, phone numbers, address and a supposed link to her credit report.The site exposing what is claimed to be Mr Biden’s information displayed a photograph of him shedding a tear. The site exposing information about Ms Knowles showed a picture of President Barack Obama, covered with the text: “BEYONCE, Y U NO COME TO MY COOKOUT?”Exposed.su linked to a Twitter account with the username @exposedsu. The account, which had attracted more than 1,165 followers by Tuesday afternoon, posted two messages, both in Russian.Translated to English, one read: “Want to see Secret Files?” along with a link to the site. The other read: “Hello world. We are revealing ourselves. Our aim is to show you all that this is only one of a few tricks up the sleeves of lone wolves. #exposedsu”.Under the user’s description, it repeated the quotation: “If you believe that God makes miracles, you have to wonder if Satan has a few up his sleeve”, along with the phrase: “F*** the police” in Russian.The apparent breach came weeks after private emails between George W. Bush and other members of his family were obtained by a hacker, including a self-portrait of the former president sitting in a bathtub.

82;EFX;Equifax Inc;2012-12-12T21:59:58Z;Advertising gets the power of intimacy;;A married couple sit in their living room, arguing about the text messages she keeps receiving from an ex-boyfriend. The television, playing in the background, listens in on their conversation, detects that they are fighting and automatically selects an advertisement about a local marriage therapist for the next commercial break.This futuristic vision – outlined in a Verizon patent application published last month – is eerily similar to the two-way telescreens that monitor citizens in George Orwell’s 1984. But the idea is far from science fiction.Rather, it is within the realms of what is technologically possible today, and is just one version of how some of the world’s most pioneering media and marketing companies discuss using the rich profiles they are amassing about individuals. For marketers, the fast-growing business of tracking intimate details about consumers’ lives presents unprecedented opportunity. Lawmakers, federal regulators and privacy advocates, meanwhile, increasingly worry it is leading to a “database of ruin”.“I am concerned that the rich profiles being created about consumers can be used to harm them at work and in their financial lives,” Julie Brill, a commissioner with the US Federal Trade Commission, said last week. “I’m equally concerned that consumers are unaware of this data collection and use activity or the companies that engage in it, and so have very little opportunity to exercise any current rights they may have to opt out, access or correct this data.”Concerned by what information is being collected about individuals and how it is being used, lawmakers and regulators are stepping up their scrutiny of the so-called consumer data broker industry. They also are pushing for stricter guidelines to protect both children’s and adult’s privacy in the digital age.Some of the world’s largest data brokers, including Acxiom, Experian and Equifax, are being called to Washington on Thursday to participate in a congressional inquiry about how their multi-billion-dollar industry handles consumers’ personal information. The US Senate Commerce Committee has launched a similar investigation.These corporations – with names most people have never heard of – revealed in letters to lawmakers that they track everything from a person’s religious affiliation to their political leanings.They collect data on household incomes, public postings on social media and shopping activity. They know the type of credit card in a person’s wallet and whether they have expressed concerns about health conditions such as diabetes or arthritis.“The data brokers’ responses offer only a glimpse of the practices of an industry that has operated in the shadows for years,” the group of lawmakers said in a joint statement.Some marketers fear strict regulation could stifle business.Others argue that an industry operating with more transparency will allow them to explore new business models that involve personalising media and marketing messages to the benefit of consumers.
83;EFX;Equifax Inc;2011-08-09T13:18:55Z;Avoid the perils of holiday money;Spending your money abroad can be fraught with annoyances;"Millions of people will be travelling abroad this summer and most are likely to take their credit and debit cards with them.But while the benefits of using plastic mean travellers are covered should anything go wrong with a purchase, it can also mean travellers rack up exorbitant bank charges or become victims of ID fraud.Consumer comparison website uSwitch.com recently reported that individuals who use their cards abroad risk being hit with £457m in fees simply for accessing their own cash.So, what are the things you need to watch out for when using your flexible friend during a trip overseas? And, how can you avoid having to share so much of your money it with financial institutions?As the popularity of travellers cheques has dwindled, plastic alternatives which mimic credit cards are increasingly being adopted as the payment method of choice. This is because the charges for using a normal bank card abroad tends to vary so much between providers.For example, debit card holders at Lloyds TSB will be charged between £2 and £4.50 for each cash withdrawal from an ATM abroad depending on the amount, or a £1 surcharge for using a card in a store. On top of these there is a 2.99 per cent foreign exchange fee.Natwest is slightly different, levying a £2 to £5 fee for a withdrawal and £1.25 for each point-of-sale transaction; however their exchange fee is slightly lower at 2.75 per cent.HSBC customers won’t be charged for using their card in foreign stores and its cash machine fee tends to be between £1.75 and £5. But despite claiming to be the world’s local bank, British HSBC customers will still be charged fees at the bank’s many ATM machines around the world.Conversely, Barclay’s customers have access to a network of financial institutions who won’t charge them for taking out cash. These include: Westpac in Australia and New Zealand; Bank of America; BNP Paribas in France; Deutsche Bank and Scotiabank which can be found in Canada and Central America. However, there is still the exchange fee for all other transactions.To avoid some of these charges, you can buy a pre-paid Visa or Mastercard. While there is no credit facility and you can only spend what you place on it, they are more widely accepted than their paper ancestor and are just easily replaced if lost.The main benefit is that they aren’t linked up to your bank account - and so are less susceptible to fraud, still come with chip & pin protection and you can choose between seven currencies.They’re called Cash Passports and can be bought online or through a number of retailers including Thomas Cook, Travelex or one of the big supermarkets.However, each retailer has its own terms and fees, for example where Travelex’s card doesn’t charge for ATM withdrawal abroad, Thomas Cook’s one does even though they’re essentially the same card.Buying one online is usually fee free, however buying it in a shop may come with a purchase price, so it’s best to have a look at the set charges and see how you could maximise your money without losing too much in additional charges - particularly if you use ATMs frequently.But in spite of the safety that chip & pin provides, fraud is still rife.Data analyser Equifax has provided some tips to avoid ID theft such as don’t write your home address on luggage. Instead you should opt to use your work address or simply your mobile number; also keep your identification materials such as driving license and passport away from your credit and debit cards and leave your passport number with somebody at home in the UK, in case it gets lost or stolen - do not carry surplus details with you.HSBC advises consumers to keep their banks informed of their travel plans so that fraud detection systems are updated. It also says not to “take advice from ‘helpful’ strangers that happen to be standing near an ATM, especially if your card has been unexpectedly retained”. Also, don’t let your card out of your sight when making purchases in bars and restaurants.Losing or getting your card stolen is ultimately frustrating, but it’s a lot more difficult to prove the theft of cash. A police report must be lodged within 24 hours of the incident. If this does happen, it’s your travel insurance that should hopefully pay out.Some travel insurance providers will cover you for loss of cash. Insure & Go’s Black level policy will cover a £500 cash limit with no excess, however, it’s their highest level of insurance so the premium will match. Elsewhere, Marks & Spencer’s Premier travel policy covers £300 worth of bank notes, with a £50 excess for each claim and Sainsbury’s offering is similar.On the upside, Santander announced last month that it is going to offer free cash withdrawals for its debit card customers who travel to Spain."
84;EFX;Equifax Inc;2011-08-05T17:40:51Z;Irate, after high rates;Santander offers best rates, but service can be problematic;Santander offers some of the best interest rates on the market for savers and borrowers, including a new bonus offer of £100 plus £25 in gift vouchers for those who switch to its current account. However, the bank’s customer service record has been problematic.Since its merger with Alliance & Leicester (A&L) in 2008, officially completed in May 2010, there have been a spate of complaints from customers about mishandled accounts.One customer found herself threatened with action when the bank failed to act on her instruction to close a savings account.Mrs Margaret Donovan opened three separate A&L savings accounts in 2008, attracted by the high rates of interest offered online. Once the introductory rates came to an end, she opted to close all three accounts and asked the bank to send the money to her by cheque.But only two accounts were closed, forcing Donovan to visit her local branch and withdraw the money from the third account herself.That account, a Premier Plus account, was still not closed by the bank and began to accrue fees because it was ’underfunded’. As the fees rolled up, the bank sent letters informing Donovan that she was overdrawn. On three separate occasions, Donovan visited her bank and was told that the account had now been closed, but the letters continued – culminating in a threat of “further collection action”.According to credit checking agency Equifax, unauthorised overdrafts will be reported to agencies and can have an impact on credit records – and, consequently, the sorts of loans and rates a customer is offered in future.“If the bank corrected the files and removed all trace, then it may not have any impact, although there have been occasions when something has been removed but then reinstated at the start of the next month,” said Equifax external affairs director Neil Munroe. “Alternatively, the bank may have added a note to say the matter has been settled. This will still leave the customer looking as though they were struggling.“Santander said that it had manually amended the reference to the overdraft and that no record of it should appear with any credit rating agency. The bank also told the Financial Times that it has apologised to Donovan and made a goodwill payment to the former customer – who now says the matter has been resolved to her satisfaction.http://podcast.ft.com/index.php?pid=1265
85;EFX;Equifax Inc;2010-12-23T16:45:36Z;Santander admits statements mix-up;;Santander has reported itself to the City regulator after accidentally mixing up bank statements sent out to current account holders in an error that could affect up to 35,000 UK customers.Santander, which provides current accounts to 5m in the UK, said that thousands of its customers received bank statements that contained other customers’ account numbers, sort codes and transaction details because of a technical glitch at its printers.The Spanish bank, which emerged from the financial crisis as one of UK’s biggest lenders through its combination of the old Abbey National with Alliance & Leicester and part of Bradford & Bingley, said the maximum number of customers affected would be 35,000 – the total number of statements printed in the affected batch.The bank said it had immediately informed the Financial Services Authority after customers complained about the statements on Wednesday lunchtime, and claimed that the risk of fraud as a result of the mistake was minimal.“Even if you are in possession of account and sort code there is very little you can do due to the security measures we have in place,” it said.The FSA confirmed it had been notified of the data breach, and that it was in dialogue with Santander.Santander will write to all the 35,000 customers possibly affected to explain the mistake and apologise. The bank has not suffered from a similar mistake before, it said. The statements were dated December 18, and were distributed across the UK.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, the consumer website, said: “The bank is continually coming bottom in customer service surveys and this is yet another example why.”“The thing people need most from their bank account is to trust it will be secure – sending statements to the wrong people doesn’t do that,” he said.Equifax, the credit reference agency, added that while the risk of fraud was reduced because the statements had gone to other customers rather than having been stolen by criminals, there was still a possibility of some “opportunist behaviour”.“Some people could try and blag their way through a call centre [to make a withdrawal from an account] or try and take out new credit [in the account holder's name],” said Neil Munroe, director at Equifax.The Information Commissioner’s Office, the government regulator monitoring data protection, said that it would investigate the data breach before deciding if any action would be taken against Santander.
86;EFX;Equifax Inc;2010-11-17T09:24:16Z;Experian bolstered by US banking recovery;;US banks are becoming more willing to lend to consumers and companies, Experian said after a recovery in its most important market helped the credit services group lift underlying interim profits 12 per cent.Shares in Experian rallied 44½p to 748p after the FTSE 100 company lifted its interim dividend 29 per cent to 9 cents on the back of figures ahead of brokers’ forecasts.The first quarterly organic revenues improvement in almost three years at Experian’s credit services division in North America, which also provides data for healthcare and car companies, helped to offset an improving but dull performance in the UK and Ireland.Don Robert, chief executive, said of the US: “Bank clients are starting to invest in growth again by spending money with us to market for new customers. Those marketing dollars turn into credit applications and credit activity.”The improvement comes even though data from the Federal Reserve show that bank lending in the US has contracted throughout the year. Mr Robert cautioned that Experian’s performance “should not be construed as any real signs of immediate bullishness on the US economy”.The first half was also boosted by a strong showing in Latin America, where sales rose 22 per cent, stripping out exchange rate movements.Experian also said it was expanding its presence in the small and medium enterprise market and launching into consumer protection.In the six months to September 30, underlying profits rose from $401m to $450m (£283m) on sales of $2bn ($1.9bn). Diluted earnings per share were 18.8 cents (22.8 cents).A swing in the value of the debt at the group, which plans to refinance $2.5bn of debt two years before it matures with new loans and bonds, meant that pre-tax profits fell 10 per cent from 2009, to $283m. Experian has completed $147m of its $300m share buy-back programme.● FT CommentMoving into new markets, such as utilities and telecoms, has helped shield Experian from the worst of the financial crisis. Thus the signs of improvement in the area for which the group is best known – checking credit records for banks and retailers – are reassuring. But the shares have already rallied 22 per cent since May, when they traded at a discount to Equifax, its US-listed peer. With the stock at its highest level since the group was spun off from GUS during the credit boom four years ago, Experian now trades on a prospective multiple of more than 17 times forecast earnings per share of 67 cents, which is a premium to Equifax’s 15 times. But with the group looking at further ways for returning its surplus cash to its shareholders, that rating need not be too demanding.
87;EFX;Equifax Inc;2010-05-20T10:41:42Z;Beginners’ Guide: Checking your credit score;;Have you ever been refused a credit card and don’t know why? It could be one of a number of details about your financial history that are tracked and recorded by credit reference agencies to help lenders assess you for credit.“The credit crunch and lenders’ subsequent aversion to bad debt mean that our financial histories are being placed increasingly under the microscope,” says Neil Munroe at Equifax. “Credit ratings can be affected by anything from the basics – such as your history of repaying debt – to the finer details such as whether you own a fixed-line telephone.”But having a good rating won’t just affect whether you are offered credit, it will also affect the interest rate that you are offered so it could be worth getting a breakdown of your score before you apply for a mortgage, loan or credit card.So, what is my credit score based on?An individual’s credit rating is based on a range of information about their financial history. It takes into account how that person has handled credit in the past and how much debt they have.Agencies usually hold files going back around six years, although some information – such as bankruptcy filings – can be held for longer. But an individual’s rating tends to be linked to their immediate payment history recent activity, going back just 18 months.Lenders generally supply credit reference agencies with details of credit cards and loans you have taken out and what repayments you have made. Agencies are also aware of any late or missed payments, county court judgments and bankruptcy filings. They will also take into account your credit limit and any instances you may have applied for credit and been refused. In addition they will look at other personal details such as whether you are on the electoral roll at your current address.How is my actual rating calculated?The UK’s credit rating agencies will pass on to lenders the information they compile about individuals. Lenders then combine this with other information such as that person’s salary and employment details. They award points for various pieces of information.There is no definitive way to calculate someone’s credit rating and different lenders adopt different approaches depending on their attitude to risk and the type of product they are offering.There is, however, a generic “code”, which lenders must abide by when calculating credit scores. Lenders generally compare you with customers with similar profiles to see how these customers fared in repaying their debts.How do I get a good credit rating?There are a number of myths about what affects a good credit rating, most of which are untrue. For a start, unless you are financially connected to someone – by having a joint bank account or investments – no-one else’s financial situation can affect your rating. So, for example, an unpaid bill in a housemate’s or previous occupant’s name cannot reflect negatively on you.Another myth is that being late with one bill won’t affect your score. Paying any credit arrangement late will be recorded on your credit file, and is likely to have a detrimental effect on your rating. The golden rule for building a strong credit score is never to miss repayments. Even if you just pay the minimum amount due each month, proving you are reliable in paying off debt will serve you well.Also, contrary to popular belief, your file won’t show you were turned down for credit. Nine in 10 consumers think being rejected for a loan or credit card will affect a credit rating. The truth is that this won’t even be recorded on your credit file. however, all applications for credit will be, and if there are many within a short time this can ring alarm bells, regardless of whether the credit has been granted or not.The other most important factor is making sure you are registered on your local electoral roll as this will be used to verify your address. It’s how lenders check your address.It is true that if you have never had any debt or used credit, your credit rating may not be as strong as someone who has taken out credit and kept up repayments. This is because a blank credit report does not prove to the lender that you would be a reliable customer.Experian, a credit checking agency, suggests a good way to build up a positive rating is to use a store card or credit card occasionally and pay back the full balance every month.Why should I look at my credit rating?If there is any factor on your credit history that might be an obstacle to receiving credit then it is worth knowing about as often it can be rectified. This is especially the case if you are thinking of applying for a mortgage or other sizeable loan. No lender can look at your credit history without your consent so you could resolve any issue before the lender sees your details.If you do notice something on your account then you can rectify it quickly or perhaps put a note on the account to help your case.Also, identity fraud is rising fast with hundreds of thousands of cases each year. Experian says the average time it takes a consumer to realise their personal details are being used fraudulently is 416 days so checking your credit rating regularly can help detect anomalies.How do I get my credit rating?The three credit checking agencies are Experian.co.uk, Equifax and Callcredit. You can log on to their websites to obtain a report, which gives details of the information lenders can obtain of your credit history. You can also get a full credit scoring, which indicates how your credit history would be rated by a typical lender.Equifax has a 30-day trial for free and then £6.99 monthly. Or you can simply pay £2 each time you want to see your credit report. Download the free Equifax report.Experian is also offering a free-30 day trial for its Credit Expert service (after this the service is £7.99 per month). Once you have signed up you will be given free access to your credit report, which costs £2 for non-members. A full report and credit scoring service costs £5.95 with Experian. Download a free report from the Experian website.Callcredit also allows you to view your credit report online for £2.These agencies also offer services such as alerting you by text if there is any significant change to your report, to help detect fraud.What happens if my rating is bad?A poor credit rating can hinder your chances of getting a mortgage, loan, credit card or store card. It can result in you getting lower credit limits and higher interest rates.But credit agencies say many of the reasons behind a poor rating are reversible as long as you identify them and take action as quickly as possible. The main agencies will offer you generic advice on ways you could improve your credit rating and you can also contact them to talk through more personal information to your situation.You can add a statement on your file. But that will also push your application into a manual review situation. You know there's something on there. Then the lender is required to read. It gives you an extra way of making circumstances.
88;EFX;Equifax Inc;2010-05-07T16:43:52Z;Business failures down 2.8%;;The number of business failures dropped 2.8 per cent last month, according to figures published by Equifax, a business information provider.The improvement in company prospects is another tentative sign of a return to business confidence in the UK, despite the unsettling effect of the general election campaign.The construction and retail industries fared better than other parts of the economy, with drops in failures of 12.3 per cent and 9.1 per cent respect-ively. The wholesale sector saw a 2.8 per cent rise in failures. Regionally, the north-east performed best, followed by London and the East Midlands. York-shire and Humberside, the east of England and Wales were the only parts of the UK to see an increase in the number of businesses going bust.
89;EFX;Equifax Inc;2010-04-16T15:49:32Z;Business failures fall;;The number of business failures has fallen by 11.1 per cent in the past 12 months, according to Equifax, a corporate data provider.Nic Beishon, head of commercial information solutions at Equifax, claimed that the figure reflects a slowing down of the downturn – although the recovery is weak.Business failures continued to fall during the first three months of 2010, but were down only 0.5 per cent on the same period a year earlier. “The economy is still incredibly fragile, but these figures do seem to give some hope that UK businesses are fighting hard to come out of the recession alive and kicking,” he said.There was a decline in business failures in the transport, communications wholesale and services sectors. In retail, however, the number of companies going under rose 11.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2009.
90;EFX;Equifax Inc;2010-03-04T22:03:57Z;US banks urged to reveal credit scores;;Credit scores – those closely guarded three-digit numbers that determine how much money Americans can borrow and at what cost – are for the first time set to become widely available to consumers.FICO, the company that develops the most popular type of US credit score, is pushing large banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo to share the information with their customers, people familiar with the discussions said.Banks buy scores from FICO and use them to evaluate risks. Because banks typically keep the information under wraps, consumers who want to know their credit scores must buy them from FICO or one of the large credit bureaux, TransUnion, Experian or Equifax.The move to share credit scores with customers is part of a push by financial institutions to regain consumer trust after the financial crisis, which exposed predatory lending practices in the mortgage and credit card industries.“Financial institutions need to start dealing with their customers in a more transparent way,” said Shon Dellinger, who runs the FICO division that sells credit scores. Mr Dellinger estimates that only 5 per cent of consumers have unencumbered access to their FICO score, a number that could rise to 75 per cent if the top 10 financial institutions made scores available.A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the FICO effort. Wells Fargo said it was reviewing the programme.To create the scores, FICO buys data from credit bureaux and funnels that information through proprietary algorithms. Mr Dellinger said FICO did not plan to provide the scores directly to consumers for free, because it relied on revenue from lenders and consumers to offset the costs of compiling the data.Two-thirds of a person’s FICO score is determined by the timely payment of bills and outstanding credit card debt. Even a one-time late payment can hurt a person’s credit score. Although developed initially to help lenders assess a borrower’s likelihood of repaying debt, credit data is now widely used by insurance companies and even some employers.“FICO scores should be free given their importance to consumers,” said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. “Consumers who know their credit scores and understand their significance manage their finances more prudently.”Congress passed a law in 2003 that required credit bureaux to provide consumers with a free credit report once every 12 months, but not the score, which still costs anywhere from $7.95 to $30.HSBC became one of the first banks to make FICO scores available free of charge two years ago.
91;EFX;Equifax Inc;2010-03-03T20:11:06Z;One step closer to a single sign-on for the web;;A new alliance should make it a bit easier to get around the web without accumulating yet more usernames and passwords.The Open Identity Exchange will enable users of PayPal, Google and Equifax to sign into certain US government websites using their credentials from those sites.The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the first government website accepting these credentials. Once signed into the NIH website with, say, a PayPal ID, users can perform customized library searches, access training resources, register for conferences, and contribute to medical research wikis.Announced today at the RSA Conference in San Francisco, the Open Identity Exchange is funded with initial grants from the OpenID Foundation (OIDF) and Information Card Foundation (ICF).A number of companies in the private sector already allow the sharing of credentials. The OpenID alliance includes Google, PayPal and others. Facebook is allowing its users to log into thousands of sites with Facebook Connect. And while this is a limited rollout for the government to begin with, it’s another small step in the direction of a single sign-on.The merits of a single sign-on — one username and password you can use across the web — are debatable. While the convenience might seem appealing, there are serious security concerns. Already, most people use the same password for multiple sites, leaving themselves vulnerable to identity thieves.The Open Identity Exchange believes it has addressed these concerns by implementing a “trust framework” — a stricter verification process — to comply with the tight security standards of government websites.“Trusted identities and consumer control of personal information are essential to the effectiveness of transactions on the Internet,” said Andrew Nash, senior director of identity services for PayPal. “Trusted frameworks that provide identity assurance are a critical factor in the success of the digital identity ecosystem.”
92;EFX;Equifax Inc;2009-12-31T17:25:24Z;Matthew Vincent: Resolve to repay;;How are you getting on with those New Year resolutions? If you are reading this on day two of your new jogging/ celery munching/nicotine craving regime, don’t worry about it. Psychologists at the University of Hertfordshire say it is quite normal for nine out ten of us to give up giving up/cutting down/working out in the first few days of January. Those who do keep on keeping on never make it past 77 days anyway, according to the insurer PruHealth (‘Death of the Diet Day’ is March 18, if you’re looking to pencil dinner dates in to your new dairy). But those who don’t bother at all end up healthier, mentally, as they avoid feelings of failure and worthlessness, according to the charity Mind. So, go on, lighten up… or stop lightening up…or just light up.If, however, you are reading this on day two of your new financial planning regime, do worry about it. Researchers at the credit reference agency Equifax have found that nearly two thirds of us will make financial resolutions for 2010 and, for six out of ten, “reducing debt” is a priority before building up savings. Those who tried last year found that paying off didn’t pay off, according to Unbiased.co.uk (non-mortgage debt levels at the end of the third quarter were nearly double the level on 1 January 2009). But many didn’t bother at all, according to the Markit/YouGov Household Finance Index, which registered another increase in debt in December. So, is it time to just give up?No. Behavioural economics experts at Yale University have found that financial ‘commitment contracts’ can be a highly effective tool in helping people to lose weight, give up smoking, pay off debts or save money. All you need is a financial stake that you agree to lose (or donate to charity) if you fail to meet your commitment, a referee to check on your progress, and supporters to help you reach your goal.With £4bn of personal debt to clear, the financial stakes are already high. What we need are strong supporters, to provide added encouragement. I have a few in mind…● The Department of Work and Pensions. With the new ‘personal accounts’ pension scheme delayed until 2016, why not introduce the government- sponsored debt-repayment scheme that I outlined at the end of last year: allow employers to divert their pension contributions, matched by employees’ payments, into a debt-repayment scheme for a few years, on the understanding that employees will then pay the same amount into a pension?● The Office of Fair Trading (OFT). Having quietly dropped the investigation into banks’ “unfair” overdraft fees, why not champion the responsible in 2010, rather than the irresponsible? Go after “unfair” early repayment charges on loans and mortgages instead.● The Investment Management Association. Having admitted that “costs matter in investment”, on these very pages, why not incorporate the FT Money Fund Fees Manifesto , calling for full disclosure of all fund management costs, into your submission to The Committee of European Securities Regulators on “greater clarity and disclosure”?If you support these ideas, let me know. And if you need help with your own financial resolutions, why not sign your own commitment contract, at www.stickk.com?matthew.vincent@ft.com
93;EFX;Equifax Inc;2009-11-20T19:27:22Z;Sharewatch: Experian;;Shares in Experian have risen 20 per cent in the past six months as the credit checking company has delivered a robust performance in challenging markets. Experian is battling against a sharp decline in the amount of new lending to individuals and businesses, which means less demand for credit checking. The group has, however, managed to maintain its income level – organic revenue grew 1 per cent in the first six months of the year – and has impressed analysts with its ability to increase margins while those of its rivals are coming under pressure. As a result, Experian’s shares are trading at a p/e ratio of around 14.5 times, a significant premium to Equifax, its closest rival, which is on around 12 times.
94;EFX;Equifax Inc;2009-07-13T23:02:44Z;Companies’ optimism leaps ahead;;Optimism among companies about their financial prospects has jumped sharply to its highest for two years, according to a quarterly survey of finance directors by Deloitte, the professional services firm.But while nearly three-quarters expect the economy to recover in 2010, 59 per cent do not expect an acceleration in demand for their own companies’ products and services for at least another 12 months.The survey of 117 chief financial officers – covering a third of the quoted equity market as well as large private companies and UK subsidiaries of multinationals – supports other evidence suggesting Britain’s emergence from recession is likely to be slow. A minority, 23 per cent, do not expect economic growth to return until 2011 or later.“This is hardly a return to ‘business as usual’. It seems that optimism is returning, but nobody is getting carried away,” said Margaret Ewing, Deloitte’s vice-chairman. “While CFOs may believe the end of the recession is in sight, they are of the opinion that the business environment will remain very difficult during the first year of any recovery.”She added: “It will be a very different environment to the last years of the boom – CFOs don’t see a return to the robust growth of late 2006 and early 2007.”With growth expected to be weak, finance directors think cost reduction should remain a priority. Eighty-five per cent believe unemployment will continue to rise through at least the first year of recovery.A net 22 per cent of CFOs are more optimistic about their company’s financial prospects than three months ago. Credit conditions have improved for the second consecutive quarter but remain tough, which companies expect to continue into the recovery.One of the underlying causes of the crisis, excessive debt, remains. Eighty per cent expect “deleveraging” to continue, with twice as many companies planning to reduce gearing in their own business as those planning to increase it.In spite of an improvement in credit availability, bank borrowing is out of favour. Enthusiasm about issuing equity and corporate bonds hit its highest level since the survey began two years ago. Equity is seen as the most popular form of finance and bank borrowing the least popular.Ian Stewart, Deloitte chief economist, said CFOs were bullish about mergers and acquisitions, with 83 per cent expecting M&A activity to rise in the next year. “Sentiment on private equity activity has also turned positive for the first time in two years. A more positive view on M&A seems to reflect an improved economic outlook, depressed asset valuations, and a better financing environment,” he said.Equifax, the business information provider, said the growth of business failures had slowed in the second quarter. While the total of 8,874 was nearly 40 per cent higher than last year, it was only 2.2 per cent ahead of the first quarter.
95;EFX;Equifax Inc;2009-05-29T16:25:30Z;Rise in borrowers checking credit files;;"Greater numbers of consumers are checking their credit files after being rejected by lenders. Credit reference agencies are reporting an increase in requests for credit reports as more consumers are having their loan and card applications turned down.Equifax, a credit information provider, says requests for its reports in the first quarter of this year were up nearly 10 per cent on the previous year.“This is quite a significant rise,” said Neil Munroe, external affairs director of Equifax. “More people are getting copies of their credit report to find out why they were rejected.”Lenders use data held by credit reference agencies to compile a credit score that can determine whether finance is advanced, how much and what interest rate is charged.Information held on agency files includes not only whether individuals have kept up with repayments, and how much borrowing they have, but other data such as how long they have been at their current address and whether they are on the electoral roll.But even getting a copy of a credit report may not provide all the answers as to why an application was declined – because lenders have been raising their in-house credit “cut-off” points.“The odd late payment – perhaps on a mobile phone contract or mail order account – can now seriously jeopardise new credit applications and can affect existing credit facilities,” said James Jones of Experian, a credit reference agency.“In the past, such relatively minor indiscretions might have been overlooked.” He reported that one third of individuals reviewing their files now cite credit refusal as the reason – slightly up on last year.Levels of indebtedness are also coming under closer scrutiny.“We are certainly advising people to close unused credit cards as these could unfavourably affect their credit scores,” added Jones.One area where lending criteria has tightened considerably is the unsecured market, such as storecards and motor finance.Unlike mortgage borrowing, this sector has not benefited from government efforts to boost credit flow, with lending rates now down 40 per cent year-on-year.With the unsecured credit pool shrinking, consumers are being left with fewer options to obtain finance and this is changing their behaviour.“Previously, a consumer might not have challenged the reasons for being declined because they could get credit elsewhere,” said Munroe. “But now, with more stringent lending criteria meaning that more consumers are unable to obtain the right product or rate, they are likely to start
challenging the lender’s decision which is, in turn, requiring lenders to be better focused on how they deal with consumers who may not meet their own risk criteria.”Consumers who have been turned down for credit do have the right to ask why.Industry codes states that lenders should give applicants the “main reason” why they have not met lending conditions.“In some cases, lenders will give main reason as ‘you have not met the minimum credit score for this product’,” explained the Finance Leasing Association (FLA), the industry body for storecard and motor finance providers.The British Bankers’ Association (BBA) code requires lenders to tell their customers if they did not pass their credit score and provide an indication of the type of information that was included in the scorecard.The code says: “Generally, this information will be grouped into categories such as your ability to repay, your credit history, and stability factors such as how long you have lived at your address.”Consumers can boost their chances of obtaining finance by improving their credit profile, with paying bills on time being the single most important contributor to a good credit score.Consumers are, by law, entitled to obtain copies of credit reports from the reference agencies for a fee of typically £2."
96;EFX;Equifax Inc;2008-11-19T17:58:53Z;Experian sees itself as a cure for credit crisis;;Experian, the world’s biggest credit-checking company, said it was “part of the cure for the credit crisis” on Wednesday after reporting resilient half-year results that sent its share price up 7 per cent.The company announced a 3 per cent rise in revenues from the businesses it also ran last year that, along with increased sales from acquisitions, contributed to an increase in group turnover from $1.79bn to $2.1bn. Pre-tax profit rose from $270m to $318m.Experian said its core business arms, including credit and marketing services in the UK and US, produced smaller revenues, but it was able to counteract these declines with strong performances from some of its counter-cyclical businesses and activities in emerging markets.While revenues from credit services have dropped 5 per cent as global credit markets shudder almost to a standstill, there was a strong performance from its consumer direct business, which provides online credit scores for businesses.The company also operates across various markets, and has grown like-for-like revenues 22 per cent in Latin America and 8 per cent in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.Don Robert, chief executive, said its counter-cyclical businesses, especially debt recovery services, would help provide “the cure for the credit crisis”. However, he did admit the company’s most profitable arms were likely to struggle.The interim dividend increased 4 per cent to 6.75 cents, payable from earnings per share of 25.5 cents (22.2 cents). The shares rose 22¾p to close at 329¼p.FT CommentIn spite of a strong performance, investors remain unsure about Experian, and before Wednesday’s share price rise it remained cheap, trading at about nine times predicted earnings.They are unsure for a few reasons. First, neither Experian nor its main competitor, Equifax, has been through a recession before and nobody is sure how this business model will cope. Second, any strong growth reported this year is compared with weak comparatives last year. Finally, Experian’s tax rate remains low, at 23 per cent, compared with the 30 per cent Equifax pays.This is why the EV/ebitda, which stands at about seven times for both companies, may be a more accurate valuation. But if cost-cutting progresses as planned and the counter-cyclical businesses continue to expand, Experian may survive the downturn better than many apparently pro-cyclical businesses.
97;EFX;Equifax Inc;2008-02-08T22:50:36Z;Credit crackdown gets personal;;People late paying their mobile phone bills or who forget to settle even a minor credit card payment are being blacklisted for credit cards and loans as lenders take a hardline approach to protect themselves from bad debts.Lenders are securing access to ever more personal data when deciding whether to offer credit cards and loans, and lapses that would have had little effect on a credit rating a year ago are being used to deny credit.Credit card companies, banks and reference agencies are now privy to details of mobile phone bills, mail-order accounts, overdrafts and high-street finance agreements, as well as other credit. Some even know whether tenants pay their rent on time.A black mark on any of these accounts could damage your credit rating and render it more difficult to obtain credit.The move will be welcomed by those – such as consumer debt agencies – who have long attacked lenders for making credit too easily obtainable.Peter Brooker, public affairs director at the Experian reference agency, said: “It is very positive that lenders are making use of all available information so they can make responsible decisions.”However, even people who never miss payments can fall foul of the ever more aggressive searches being used to weed out potential defaulters.Those with spotless payment records are being rejected for credit cards, or seeing their spending restricted, if the lender fears they could run into difficulty in six or 12 months’ time.People with several credit cards – and thus a high maximum limit – could be refused more credit even if they rarely or never use their cards, because of the potential for large debts.Borrowers are sometimes denied loans because they have too many other credit cards – or simply because they sometimes use them to withdraw cash.Neil Munroe at Equifax, one of Britain’s biggest credit reference agencies, said: “Traditionally, lenders have looked at your ability to repay debt but are now trying to spot earlier indications of stress.”Equifax said tighter credit checks had a “definite impact” on consumers applying for loans last year. A recent survey of Equifax customers found the number of people refused credit in 2007 increased to 63 per cent, from 54 per cent the year before.While minor credit slips would not have made much difference to a credit rating a year ago, in today’s more straitened times, they can mean lower limits or the denial of loans.Mr Munroe said: “Many people don’t realise quite how much information lenders have access to. They often know about accounts – such as mobile bills and letting agreements – that people may not even associate with credit.”Lenders cannot yet see utility bills or council tax records. But on the basis of how much these services cost, credit reference agencies say these too could start to appear on customer records.
98;EFX;Equifax Inc;2008-02-08T18:20:34Z;Reference agencies track consumer spending patterns;;"Credit card providers use a whole host of information about borrowers to decide whether they are an acceptable risk. They no longer just focus on past behaviour but use specialist information to assess what customers are likely to do in the future.Callcredit, a reference agency, says that while historically it has been fairly easy for lenders to see how borrowers have dealt with previous debt, they have had little information about income and spending patterns.Now, thanks to the wealth of information obtained by credit reference agencies, lenders can take a more holistic view.Neil Munroe at Equifax, a credit agency, says lenders have access to more data than borrowers might realise.“Maybe people are not aware that missing a mobile phone or mail order payment could affect their credit record,” he says.Lenders now have access to detailed transactional data – what you buy, where you buy it and how you pay for
it – alongside how you service other accounts.Callcredit monitors borrowers daily on behalf of at least 10 credit card providers, including HBOS. It looks for signs that a borrower is getting into financial difficulty and will feed any information that could affect their credit rating back to their lender. This could be a few missed payments, or evidence that they were applying for a lot more credit.
The group also has an “over-indebtedness” index, which provides a batch of information about an individual’s income and outgoings. Callcredit compiles this from data other companies provide and information borrowers provide themselves, such as details on salary and expenditure, on application forms for other loans or bank accounts.“It’s all about being on the case if someone begins to experience problems,” says Mel Mitchley, director of industry relationships at Callcredit.Signals that could lead lenders to reduce credit limits include:●missing a payment on a mortgage, loan or another credit card, or even a mobile phone, mail order account or student loan.●having multiple cards with a large combined credit limit.●drawing closer to your credit limit each month, while just paying the minimum payment.●missing a payment date, even by a few days.●applying for additional credit, especially if the lender believes you are doing this to reduce or juggle other debt."
99;EFX;Equifax Inc;2008-01-18T18:23:23Z;Failures rise across sectors;;Business failures increased across most sectors during the last quarter, according to Equifax, the credit reporting company.The construction industry suffered most with a 16.6 per cent rise in failures, followed by the services sector, where failures rose by 13.8 per cent.Neil Munroe, external affairs director at Equifax, said: “Small businesses are very vulnerable to bad debt.

100;EFX;Equifax Inc;2008-01-18T18:23:23Z;Warning over new manslaughter law;;Business owners are being urged to review their health and safety procedures ahead of the corporate manslaughter legislation, which is due to come into effect from April 6.Under the new offence, companies and organisations can be found liable for a work-related death if actions at a senior level amount to gross breach of a duty of care to the deceased.The legislation removes the need to find an individual responsible, making it easier to convict a business.Doug Barnett, head of customer risk management at Axa, the insurance company, advised directors to evaluate their companies’ current health and safety management system themselves. “Involvement from the top level of an organisation will demonstrate that health and safety is a high priority. It will also help ensure that practices are implemented correctly,” he said.The government was accused of making a U-turn this week in its effort to reduce the red tape burden when the prime minister announced the creation of a new forum to better understand the relation between risk and regulation.The risk and regulatory advisory committee, an independent advisory body, was launched by Gordon Brown on Wednesday and was welcomed by the CBI, TUC and the National Consumer Council.However the move was criticised by David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, who said the government had ruled out a similar body when it was proposed by the Better Regulation Commission last year.Frost said: “It is vital that there is a powerful independent voice within Whitehall to scrutinise regulation and regulatory policy, but today’s announcement is a retrograde step.”The cost of manufacturing in China is set to increase, an accountancy firm has warned.Grant Thornton said UK clients setting up in China are now having to pay 25 per cent corporate tax on their operations, up from 15 per cent or less.Businesses that have already set up have been able to continue to use tax holidays for a limited period, but will soon have to pay the 25 per cent too, according to Stephen Weatherseed, head of the Grant Thornton UK China group. “China no longer needs to encourage overseas investment to such an extent and its focus is now on measured growth, domestic companies and on encouraging high-tech and energy-efficient industries,” he said.In spite of the tax increases, China will remain a low-cost manufacturing location, according to Nick Farr, a tax partner at Grant Thornton. He said that although factory gate prices are rising in China, continuing efficiency improvements make it a good location for investment by UK companies.Business failures increased across most sectors during the last quarter, according to Equifax, the credit reporting company.The construction industry suffered most with a 16.6 per cent rise in failures, followed by the services sector, where failures rose by 13.8 per cent.Neil Munroe, external affairs director at Equifax, said: “Small businesses are very vulnerable to bad debt. It only takes one customer to go bust to jeopardise the future of a business.”The best way to secure the future of a business is to run rigorous credit checks on customers and suppliers, he added.The threat of strike action by Revenue & Customs staff means that self-assessment tax returns should be filed as soon as possible, the Forum of Private Business has warned.The Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents about 70,000 Revenue employees, is due to announce the result of a strike ballot on January 23, days before the deadline for completed tax forms.Self-assessment forms can be posted or completed online, but those who miss the January 31 deadline will be fined £100. Last year about 150,000 self-assessment forms were received in the final 24 hours.The FPB, which has 25,000 members, is offering support for those struggling to file their returns through its partnership with The Business Software Centre, an accounting software supplier.
101;EFX;Equifax Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Credit market worries hit Experian;;What did Experian do to deserve that? Fairly solid figures from the world’s largest credit information company pushed its shares down 7 per cent on Wednesday. That was the biggest daily drop since it was spun off from GUS, the former conglomerate now known as Home Retail Group, a year ago.The company was bound to suffer from a slowdown in bank lending – the less money lent, the less checking is needed. Organic sales growth, Experian’s most closely watched metric, dropped to 5 per cent year-on-year in the three months to September. That is hardly shattering, given that growth during last year’s credit fiesta was just 8 per cent.True, the company is heavily exposed to two markets under duress: the US, which accounts for three-fifths of group profits, and the UK, which contributes a quarter. But in spite of the gloom in sales of mortgages and unsecured loans, the company says full-year earnings should be unaffected, offset by growth in counter-cyclical businesses such as data analysis and marketing. Geographic diversification is helping: contributions from Brazil-based Serasa, the world’s fourth largest consumer credit group, are already ahead of targets.The share price punishment is in part a consequence of the decision to list Experian in London, rather than New York, home to peers such as Equifax, Fair Isaac and Acxiom. The London listing was a sop to GUS’s mainly UK investor base, many of whom could not have held US-listed stock. But the result is that Experian is now poorly understood in Europe and lacks a strong following among US institutions. Often seen by speculative buyers as a lazy proxy for bank stocks, it has underperformed Equifax – its closest rival – by about 15 per cent this year. The company’s outlook has undoubtedly worsened, but the core problem seems to be one of communication rather than business performance.
102;EFX;Equifax Inc;2007-09-05T21:16:15Z;UK lenders toughen checks on borrowers;;Borrowers are facing tougher credit checks as lenders try to minimise the risk of defaults following August’s market turmoil.Subprime mortgage lenders have been quick to raise interest rates in recent weeks and, while rates for mainstream borrowers have remained largely unchanged, many banks and building societies have tightened lending criteria.That could mean limited access to credit for first-time buyers, homeowners seeking to remortgage and consumers hoping to take out credit cards and loans.Jill Stevens, the director of consumer affairs at Experian, the credit ratings agency, said: “We are seeing a tightening up across the board on lending. Lenders realise there are lessons to be learnt from the US subprime mortgage market.”Lenders are looking more closely at borrowers’ credit histories, any other outstanding debt and their level of disposable income, according to mortgage brokers and credit agencies.Minor blemishes to a borrower’s credit rating – such as a missed payment on a mobile-phone account – are now being taken more seriously.“Lenders are looking deeper into people’s credit histories,” said Neil Munroe, director of external affairs at Equifax, another credit agency. “They will be looking in more detail for early warning signs of how borrowers deal with credit.” Agencies believe that lenders are now more interested in how borrowers service their debt than simply whether they have kept up with payments in the past. Ms Stevens said lenders were looking more frequently at whether borrowers had paid back just the minimum monthly amount or the full balance on existing credit accounts.Banks are likely to impose the toughest checks on mortgage lending, due to the significantly larger loan sizes involved. Borrowers taking out riskier mortgages – typically those with higher loan-to-values – are likely to come under the most scrutiny.Mortgage brokers say lenders are unlikely formally to restrict how much people can borrow as a proportion of a property’s value or a multiple of their earnings. But they can make subtle changes to how they assess applicants’ credit scores without public fanfare.Simon Tyler, of the broker Chase De Vere Mortgage Management, said another area in which banks were likely to take a tougher stance was self-certification mortgages. These allow borrowers to state their incomes without formal proof.Mr Tyler said: “Lenders may well ask more probing questions about income levels, which could make it harder for people to get larger loans or remortgage.”Banks are also becoming stricter when lending to those with little or no deposit. This week, the Leeds Building Society said it would lend 100 per cent of a property’s value only if the borrower had a guarantor, such as a parent, to back repayments.So far, lenders have not generally passed on higher borrowing costs to mainstream borrowers. Some fixed rates have, in fact, fallen in the past month to reflect a more stable base-rate environment. But if the banks’ borrowing costs continue to rise, brokers believe that mainstream mortgage rates may not be far behind.…………………………………………..Turbulence could push up cost of home ownershipThe turmoil in the credit markets may seem remote to most people, affecting only banks and other financial institutions taking on too much risk, reports Scheherazade Daneshkhu, Economics Correspondent.But it has implications for the mainstream mortgage market. So far, the greatest impact has been on those with a bad credit history, as lenders shy away from exposing themselves to the risk of more bad debt.Rates of interest for the least creditworthy customers have gone up by more than 2 percentage points since the financial turmoil began more than a month ago, according to Ray Boulger, senior technical manager at John Charcol, the mortgage advisers, and lenders have been tightening their criteria for these customers too.But if the recent rise in the inter-bank overnight lending rate were to persist, providers who rely on wholesale rates for much of their funding could raise interest rates on their floating and tracker rate mortgages, thereby further raising the cost of home ownership.
103;EFX;Equifax Inc;2007-08-21T18:46:06Z;Fraudsters target social networkers;;Millions of people signing up to Facebook, MySpace and other social networking sites could be leaving themselves, and their companies, open to online crime, IT security experts are warning.The practice of posting up personal information such as birth dates, addresses and phone numbers is proving to be a goldmine for identity fraudsters.Businesses, meanwhile, are at risk from hackers who use details posted on em­ployees’ social networking sites to find passwords and other details to help them get past corporate security.David Porter, head of secur­ity and risk at Detica, the IT consultancy, says social networking sites are a treasure trove for hackers searching for details about companies. “Even the most innocuous information about a business – people and the departments they work for, day-to-day processes, jargon and codes – can be valuable stepping stones for persistent criminals who want to infiltrate corporate security,” he says.This week Monster.com, the US-based jobs website, suffered an attack in which hundreds of thousands of user details were accessed. While Monster.com is not a social networking site, the details it holds – names, e-mail and home addresses and phone numbers – are similar to those displayed on social networking sites.Experian and Equifax, the credit information compan­ies, warn people to limit the information they display.“People should be thinking twice about what they share on the sites because this information is gold dust to criminals. Your date of birth and name of your first school may seem like innocuous bits of information, but they are the building blocks to your identity,” says James Jones, consumer affairs manager at Experian.He says Experian has seen a huge rise in identity fraud that was well researched and highly targeted.MessageLabs, the internet security company, also says it has seen a large increase in highly targeted “phishing” e-mails, which purport to be from trusted contacts and try to trick people into revealing details such as bank account numbers and passwords. Millions of phishing e-mails are sent each day, but a relatively small proportion are carefully targeted, getting details such as job titles correct.In 2005 MessageLabs was intercepting about two of these a week and by early 2007 it had risen to 10 a week. In June the numbers exploded, with MessageLabs picking up more than 500 targeted e-mails in a few hours, all addressed to top executives.“They were all headed toward board level executives. The names and job titles corresponded to the real ones. Somebody somewhere had really done their homework. It looked like the information on who to go for had been gleaned from a social networking site,” said Mark Sunner, chief security analyst at MessageLabs.Security officials say companies should tell staff not to post details about their jobs online. Sophos, the IT security company, says about 50 per cent of employees are already blocked or restricted from using sites such as Facebook. This is mainly because of concerns about decreased productivity.“Something seems to happen to people when they go online – they drop all caution,” says Mr Porter. “A generation of potential workers is growing up who think it is perfectly OK to disclose everything.”Social networking sites such as Bebo, MySpace and Facebook have recently increased their security tips to users and included privacy settings, specifying what is displayed and who can see it. Generally, full details can be seen only by people accepted as “friends”.However, only 20 per cent of Facebook users change the default privacy settings, and research shows many people are accepting strangers as “friends”.Sophos created a Facebook profile featuring a small frog called “Freddi Staur” – an anagram of “ID fraudster” – and invited random people to become friends. Some 41 per cent accepted. Of these, 72 per cent revealed e-mail ad­dresses, 78 per cent their address or location and 23 per cent a phone number.“What is worrying is how easy it was for Freddi to go about his business. He now has enough information to create phishing e-mails or ‘malware’ (malicious software) specifically targeted at individual users or businesses, to guess users’ passwords, impersonate them or even stalk them,” says Graham Clueley, senior technology correspondent.Tellingly, many security professionals are reluctant to join Facebook themselves. “I have just one line on Friends Reunited mentioning which county I live in,” says Mr Porter. “Perhaps I’m more paranoid because of this job.”
104;EFX;Equifax Inc;2007-02-01T19:32:09Z;Broad rally lifts FTSE;;The FTSE 100 had one of its most unusual days in recent years on Thuesday. Not a single constituent closed in negative territory as the London market enjoyed one of its strongest sessions in 2007.The blue chip index closed 79.1 points, or 1.3 per cent, higher at 6,282.2 – its third best daily performance this year – tracking a global stock market rally that was spurred by upbeat comments from the US Federal Reserve overnight.The index was also boosted by strong results from Royal Dutch Shell, up 1.9 per cent to £17.39, and AstraZeneca, 2.2 per cent higher at £29.03. The mining sector added further support.Lower down the market, the FTSE 250 climbed 121.2 points, or 1.1 per cent, to 11,221.5. Market turnover was also strong with 4bn shares changing hands.Traders said they could not remember the last time the FTSE 100 had enjoyed such widespread gains.Just four stocks failed to close higher and dealers pointed out that three of them – Corus (601½p), Gallaher (£11.37) and Scottish Power (747p) – were takeover situations. Advertising agency WPP (747p) was the other stock to end flat.BSkyB spearheaded the advance. The pay-TV group rose 3.8 per cent to 567p after a flurry of broker upgrades following Wednesday’s results.Property company Hammerson was another strong performer, advancing 3.1 per cent to £15.12 on the back of strong figures from French rival Unibail.The results also stoked takeover speculation as Unibail passed on the opportunity to pay a special dividend. Hammerson, which has 25 per cent of assets in France, is widely seen as a takeover target for Unibail.Elsewhere, Experian, the credit checking group, moved up 2.3 per cent to 591p after strong results from US peer Equifax.Bid rumours continued to swirl round J Sainsbury, up 2.6 per cent to 445¼p, after Lord Sainsbury of Turville revealed he had sold 40m shares, reducing his stake to 13.9 per cent.The stock was sold through a blind trust to settle a foward sale derivative contract with Credit Suisse.As such, traders said it offered no indication as to whether Lord Sainsbury would sell the remainder of his holding when a lock-up agreement expired this month.Elsewhere, traders noted a late flurry of buying in Prudential. The life assurer closed 0.7 per cent higher at 691p on talk that it was making progress on the review of its UK operations.Rumoured takeover target Whitbread firmed up 1.3 per cent to £16.42 after house broker ABN Amro increased its target price to £21.Balfour Beatty topped the FTSE 250 leaderboard. Its shares rose 9 per cent to 454¼p as investors welcomed the £186m acquisition of Centex Construction, a deal that will give the company greater critical mass in the US.LogicaCMG, the IT services group, firmed up 1.7 per cent to 173¾p on rumours of a disposal. In a recent research report, house broker ABN Amro identified several niche businesses that could be put up for sale.The biggest was Logica’s telecoms products division, which is valued at about £200m.Housebuilder Redrow added 1.1 per cent to 626½p after an overhang was cleared. There was also talk that the company could be a target for Barratt Developments, 2.3 per cent stronger at £12.09, if Barratt failed to win the battle for Wilson Bowden, 0.6 per cent better at £23.Unlike the FTSE 100, some mid-cap stocks ended lower. F&C Asset Management, which tumbled 18 per cent on Wednesday after a profits warning, fell a further 5 per cent to 162¼p as investors continued to sell.British Energy was also in the doldrums, easing 1.8 per cent to 429½p on rumours that third-quarter results, due this month, could reveal further problems at its Hunterson and Hinkley power stations. Repairs at these two nuclear reactors are due to be completed by the end of March, although they could over run.A “sell” note from ING also weighed on British Energy. Setting a target price of 345p, the broker said the company remained exposed to the twin challenges of reactor reliability and falling wholesale power prices.Rightmove, the property website, dipped 1.4 per cent to 468¼p on fears that Countrywide, unchanged at 534p, may sell its 22.5 per cent holding to appease shareholders who recently voted down its attempted management buy-out.
105;EFX;Equifax Inc;2006-11-10T12:17:03Z;So when it comes to loans, what’s the score?;;"The level of debt is climbing in this country as the “buy today, pay tomorrow” culture continues to drive many peoples’ spending patterns, including stretching beyond their
limits to buy property.If you have debt therefore, it is important to manage it as sensibly as possible to distinguish yourself from problem cases.Poor management – such as missing minimum monthly repayments – can damage your credit record which in turn can mean higher borrowing costs.But there are many other factors which to the layman may seem completely irrelevant but to the credit scoring companies say a lot about how you are likely to manage your finances.Do you have a telephone land line? If the answer is no, you are considered a fairly serious risk. Why? Lenders worry that if you have only a mobile phone, you would be harder to locate if you were to default on your payments.“People don’t realise the extent to which floating around can have a bad impact on your credit rating,” says Neil Munroe of Equifax, the credit agency.A second practice which might weigh down your score is residing outside the UK for say, two or three years. Many within the industry think the difficulty some UK citizens face getting credit when they return home is unfair. So, credit agencies are in discussions with the Foreign Office to find ways to improve the credit scores of UK citizens who are repatriating.Another circumstance which could drag down your score is your neighbourhood. “Postcode profiling” is becoming an important part of the credit scoring process as lenders look to avoid lending to those who live in less desirable neighbourhoods.Not only do lenders keep tabs on the debt levels in certain areas of London and Leeds, they also analyse
levels of fraud perpetrated in these neighbourhoods.“You might have a perfect payment record, but if you don’t live in the right neighbourhood – beware,” says Stuart Glendinning, managing director of Moneysupermarket.com, a financial
advisory website.“Lenders are now examining levels of fraud and bad debt per every 100 households.”If you have a family member with a similar name who has bad credit, there is also a chance this could affect your score. If this is the case, you should contact a credit agency. If no financial agreements exist between you and your doppelgänger, it will be easy for the agency to “dissociate” your finances.“It used to be quite easy to confuse people’s identities. But the tracking data has improved and this type of mistake does not occur frequently,” Munroe claims.Have you been the victim of identify fraud? If so, your credit score could be impaired for years. And if you’ve had a dispute with a creditor over a fine of even just £50, this could come back to haunt you in the form of a county court judgment.“If you’re quibbling over a fine of £100, it’s best to swallow your pride and pay it. County court judgments are really damaging for credit scores,” advises Glendinning.Also, whether you rent or own your home could have a great influence. Being a
tenant is a black mark. And if you are a temporary worker, unskilled labourer or self-employed, this could also count against you.Even frivolous mail-order purchases can damage your chances. The rule is that if you’ve bought a dress from a catalogue and returned it, some lenders will frown, according to Experian, the credit agency.These days, lenders’ reliance on credit scoring is
pivotal. Faced with soaring levels of debt, they are adjusting their techniques to get a better sense of how worthy customers are.Recently, some have moved to provide credit agencies with more information about prospective customers’ incomes. This allows agencies to get a better sense of how salaries compare with debt.It has always been the case that lenders employ slightly different formulas to figure out your credit record. “That’s why it’s quite common for people to get approval for a mortgage from one lender and be rejected by another,” says James Jones of Experian.But on one level, the structure of the scoring business is quite basic. Three credit agencies operate within the UK: Experian, Equifax and Callcredit. When you apply for a loan, most lenders approach one of these three agencies and ask them to run a credit check. In addition to getting an opinion from a third-party, lenders will also use their own scoring systems to come up with a grade. Information they have on file if you were a
customer previously will be factored in.The scores agencies supply to lenders are good indicators of whether lenders will decide to extend credit.If you are curious about their likely conclusions, you might want to log on to the website of an agency and fill out an application for a report.Most banks will extend loans only to those who have either “good” or “excellent” credit. Some secondary lenders such as second mortgage operators and secured loan operators are willing to accept customers with riskier profilesStruggling to improve your rating? The experts say that if you follow a few pointers, it can be done in time.The first step to recovery is to settle your bad debts and meet payments on your existing loans. Analysts say cards offered by retailers which often carry high interest rates are a good way to re-establish credit.Unpaid credit and county court judgments will stay on your file for six years, but they will be marked as settled once you pay them. This could be taken into account when you’re making future applications.Lenders will often allow you to write a statement to balance out a bad report, which could explain circumstances that might have tarnished your rating.Do not be afraid to haggle if a lender calls your credit into question. If you are refused a loan, call an agency to get a copy of your file. Once you have it, check the details. If you find information that is incorrect, tell the agency.“There’s no quick-fix,” Munroe says. “But if you take out less competitive loans and meet your payments, your score should improve within five years . . . You just need to get some visibility on your credit rating.”"

With Wall Street opening higher following a benign US inflation report, the FTSE 100 ended 41.8 points, or 0.7 per cent, higher at 6,150.4. Lower down the market, the FTSE 250 index climbed 122.3 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 10,342.British Energy was the top FTSE 100 performer, rising 5.3 per cent to 474p as the nuclear power generator continued to recovery from Monday’s 25% drop. The advance came amid rumours that a European utility company might make an offer for the UK government’s 65 per cent stake in the company.In the same sector, National Grid slipped 1.6 per cent to 674½p after Citigroup placed 26m shares for an institutional client at 675p.Experian, the credit checking company recently spun out of GUS, was also in demand. It shares gained 3.8 per cent to 581p amid talk third quarter figures from US rival Equifax, announced after the market closed, would impress. Traders said tracker funds were also buying Experian ahead of a reweighting.Experian’s weighting in the FTSE 100 will increase by 16.5 per cent on Thursday to reflect its recent £800m equity fund raising.Elsewhere, reports that Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse have been asked to work on a demerger of its Man Financial brokerage division saw Man Group, the hedge fund manager, close up 4.6 per cent at a record high of 481¼p.Corus improved 1.7 per cent to 487 on reports, denied after the market closed, that Brazilian steelmaker CSN was set to trump Tata Steel’s 455p-a-share offer.Intercontinental Hotels Group improved 2.4 per cent to 978½p after Deutsche Bank reiterated its “buy” rating and set a £10.71 price target, citing the potential for capital returns.“Our analysis highlights that a further £1-£1.1bn could be returned to shareholders given the company’s debt targets,” analyst Simon Champion said.Next, the clothing retailer, shed 1 per cent to £18.51, unsettled by rumours of a profits warning.John Guy, retail analyst at Man Securities, was sceptical. However, because of the recent warm weather he believes underlying sales in the second half of the fiscal year to January 2007 are likely to fall by as much as 5 per cent - the bottom end of the minus 2 to minus 5 range indicated by Next at the time of interim results in September.Elsewhere in the retail world, Tesco improved 1.5 per cent to a record high of 390p amid rumours that the company is guiding earnings forecasts higher.Royal Bank of Scotland firmed 0.05 per cent to £18.82p despite being linked with a bid for Dutch bank ABN Amro.Among the mid caps, Wood Group, the oil field services group, rose 3.2 per cent to 247¾p after the Economic Times of India claimed Reliance Industries, India’s biggest company, is in talks to buy the Aberdeen-based company.That report, which was rubbished by Wood Group, also excited Petrofac 5.2 per cent higher at 342p, and Abbot Group, 3.9 per cent higher at 294p.Cobham, the defence and aerospace manufacturer, rose 4.4 per cent to 194½p on rumours of a bid from private equity group Kohlberg, Karvis, Roberts.

Devon Energy, which drilled the well, and owns a 25 per cent stake in the project, added 5.3 per cent on the week to $67.56.But the rest of the energy sector sagged as crude oil prices slipped to five-month lows. Sunoco tumbled 9.8 per cent to $65.50. Oil refiner Valero Energy dropped 10.4 per cent to $51.75 after Citigroup changed its rating on the stock from “hold” to “buy”. Valero has fallen 20 per cent since the beginning of August.Coal miners also sold off during the week. Peabody Energy said coal shipments in the third quarter would be lower than forecast because of rail transportation difficulties and mining equipment problems. The news prompted analysts to cut their earnings forecast for Peabody, sending its shares down 13.6 per cent for the week to $38.63.Consol Energy slid 10.4 per cent to $33.20 and Arch Coal dropped 9.9 per cent to $30.32. The Dow Jones Wilshire US Coal Index has dropped 28 per cent in the past eight weeks.Investors returned from the Labor Day holiday on Tuesday with some confidence. But data released on Wednesday by the Labor Department showed unit labour costs – a measure of inflation – had risen 4.9 per cent in the second quarter, significantly more than analysts had expected.The news damped equity markets for the following two days as investors fretted that further interest rate rises might be on the horizon to keep inflation at bay.A mild recovery on Friday was not enough to bring the main indices into positive territory for the week.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.9 per cent on the week after a gain for the day of 0.4 per cent, or 4.90 points, to 1,298.92. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.5 per cent, or 10.50 points, for the day to 2,165.79 for a weekly loss of 1.2 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent, or 60.67 points, on the day but down 0.6 per cent for the week at 11,392.11.“The market has been gripped by inflation fears again,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach, who added that a speech by regional Fed presidents during the week did not help allay investor concerns.“We’re beginning to see Fed members preparing the markets for a possible rate hike, not in September, but maybe at the end of the year,” he said.Apple Computer leapt 6.1 per cent to $72.52 amid speculation that it would soon launch a film download service. UBS also raised its price target on the stock from $82 to $90.Equifax, one of America’s three main credit reporting agencies, was the week’s best performer in the S&P 500, leaping 12 per cent to $36.34 after it said that its full-year earnings for 2006 would beat analyst expectations.Carmakers made strong advances on the week. The S&P automobile manufacturing index leapt 5.3 per cent to its highest level since last October. General Motors announced it was increasing the warranty on its vehicles to 100,000 miles or five years, sending its shares up 5.6 per cent to $31.95.Ford Motor jumped 6 per cent to $8.77 after it announced that Bill Ford would be replaced as chief executive by Alan Mulally of Boeing.Boeing, however, was the week’s worst performer on the Dow, losing 3.5 per cent to $72.80, its lowest level since March.Starwood Hotels climbed higher through the week. Moody’s raised its rating on the company’s debt to investment grade and takeover talk on Friday helped push shares up 7.1 per cent to $57.91.Dairy processor Dean Foods leapt 6 per cent to $42.10 – its best week since May 2005 – after Morgan Stanley added the company to its US model portfolio.Paper maker Temple Inland said third quarter shipments would fall after it sold one of its plants in California and closed another in New York due to flooding.

108;EFX;Equifax Inc;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Reclaimed information is a challenge for old order;;Omar Ahmad gained an insight into the impact of identity theft when his brother-in-law, a Department of Justice attorney, fell victim. “Even with all the tools at his disposal, he had a problem,” says the co-founder of TrustedID, an online company that provides protection against such fraud.The only tool that proved effective for his beleaguered relative was a calendar on the wall. It was there to remind him when to ring each of the three US credit bureaux – Equifax, Experian and TransUnion – to renew his instruction to call him for approval whenever credit was applied for under his name. Such instructions expired every 30, 60 or 90 days depending on the bureau and it was more than two years and thousands of dollars in fraudulent transactions before the thief was eventually caught.Cases like this have rocked consumers’ faith in financial institutions and the credit industry that supports them. The upshot is a new Web 2.0 wave of companies that enable individuals to take control of their personal data.“Unless we start protecting consumers, we are going to kill the whole premise of online banking and purchases using the web,” warns Tom Harkins, a former Mastercard executive in charge of fraud investigations.Mr Harkins is now chief operating officer of Edentify, which provides the technology behind Identitysweep, a $5 a month service that helps its members remove their information from internet lists. It also alerts them if their credit card numbers are sold online.TrustedID, offers an $8 a month service that includes removing subscribers’ details from the marketing databases frequently sold by the three credit bureaux. This can stop pre-approved credit card offers – a leading source of identity theft.“The way our business and other businesses like us will eventually become disruptive is that I may be willing to pay more for these companies not to sell my data than they make actually selling it,” Scott Mitic, TrustedID’s other co-founder, told the PC Forum internet trends conference recently. “Equifax made $806m in 2005 selling the data of 200m consumers – $4 a person roughly. I’d be willing to pay $4 not to have Equifax sell my data.”TrustedID also protects data by telling credit grantors to double-check its members’ identities through contact information it puts on their credit files with the bureaux.“We thought: ‘How come this is only available to victims? Why can’t I proactively do that?’” says Mr Ahmad, recalling how his brother-in-law’s story inspired their approach.The company has been aided by changing legislation. Twelve US states now allow individuals effectively to freeze use of their data and federal legislation is being debated in Congress.Car dealers, retailers and the credit bureaux are lobbying strongly against any law at the national level. They point out that the availability of credit data has helped consumers by lowering interest rates, as it allows more accurate assessments of credit risk to be made.But, at the same time, identity theft cost the US economy between $20bn and $50bn last year, according to varying estimates, and 95 per cent of consumers surveyed say they want more control over their data.Such control could lead to more personal data being made available rather than less. Opinity, another internet start-up, allows users to make their information available selectively in order to build reputation and trust. It sees uses for the service in establishing identity on auction sites, introducing new members of online communities and even helping singles on dating sites prove who they are.LinkedIn, an online network of more than 5m professionals, also encourages members to share their data in the form of job histories and experience. This can generate links to old colleagues and others with similar experience. Networking between members can further careers and headhunters use the service to spot executive talent.A new classified service, Edgeio.com, allows sellers to combine online profiles – their Ebay seller’s rating, their LinkedIn profile and their Flickr photo collection. “If you put those three things together it’s a fairly powerful combination in terms of you deciding whether you trust someone,” says Keith Teare, Edgeio co-founder.Seth Goldstein founded Root Markets last year to enable consumers to make money from their personal information. Root Markets has individual data “vaults” where users can store 28 fields of personal information along with their credit ratings, purchase histories and a history of their clicks through different websites.This can be of value to retailers and financial services companies, which currently pay middlemen for such leads. Just as someone clicking on an advertisement on Google generates money for the search engine, Root Markets believes users themselves can put a price on properly authenticated “web trails” that show their interest in buying certain goods.If it works, Root Markets will provide greater transparency on the pricing and value of personal data. Similarly, peer-to-peer lending sites such as Prosper.com of the US and Britain’s Zopa.com are already demonstrating users can gain credit and loans at far lower rates than those offered by financial institutions.At Prosper, would-be borrowers list an amount they want to borrow and the maximum interest rate they are prepared to pay. Individual lenders, acting as if they are banks or loan companies, place bids for the amount and rate they are willing to provide. Prosper combines the bids with the lowest rates into one simple loan.Zopa of the UK, which plans to launch in California this summer, carries out stringent credit checks on would-be borrowers and allows lenders to choose criteria such as lending to members of the same social group or professional association. The average rate for lenders and borrowers is 7 per cent, far better than standard savings and loan rates. Bad debts represent 0.05 per cent of loans and Zopa mitigates such risks by spreading lenders’ loans across at least 50 borrowers.“Zopa is providing people with the kind of service the banks have kept to themselves for a hundred years,” says Richard Duvall, the company’s chief executive.

HSBC has already agreed to share full data, and other high street banks say they hope to share full data by the beginning of next year.Eric Leenders, a director at the BBA, says the move will improve lenders’ risk assessment capabilities.For instance, a person with a wallet full of maxed-out credit cards who has never missed a payment could be far more risky to lend to than someone who has had a brief bad patch where they’ve missed a couple of payments, but then regained their financial discipline.“The principle is that the more data shared, the decision on [whether to grant a customer credit] is more valid, and the grounding of the decisions [lenders] take will have a far more robust basis,” says Leenders.Still, he adds that it’s not necessarily true that if a customer with a questionable credit past is declined by one lender, he will also be declined at another. “It’s entirely up the lenders themselves what their appetite is for risk,” he says.The goal of complete data sharing, says Melanie Mitchley, a director at Callcredit, the credit reference agency, is to promote responsible lending.“Lenders will be getting the full picture of someone’s borrowing history and it’s quite conceivable that all financial organisations will be sharing full data within a couple of years,” she says.Until then, how do banks and credit card companies decide what they really think of you?Lenders use credit reference agencies to access your credit report, which is an exhaustive history of your accounts and personal data. They then amalgamate the information to come up
with a score that determines if you’re eligible for credit, how much you can borrow and at what interest rate.“The credit scoring system allocates points for each piece of relevant information and adds these up to produce a score,” explains Leenders.“When your score reaches a certain level then banks may agree to your application. They may also have policy rules to determine what sort of financial products they are prepared to offer and at what price.”Different lenders use different scoring methods because they each have their own set of requirements, explains James Jones, consumer affairs manager at Experian.“It depends on who you’re applying to, what their criteria are and what sort of customer profile they’re after,” he says.“[Lenders] are looking to minimise their risk and maximise their profit – but remember: those two don’t necessarily go hand in hand – you could be a good risk, but not very profitable.”Scores are based on a number of factors, but it boils down to your history of paying off debt and your ability to pay it off.“It’s based on historical analysis of the lenders’ existing customers,” says Neil Munroe, of Equifax. “They’re trying to predict the future based on the good and bad borrowers they’ve had in the past.”Lenders also dispel the notion of any boycotting. “There is a myth that a credit blacklist exists,” says Munroe. “But this is not true: banks make decisions about opening accounts and granting credit by using statistical techniques to measure the likelihood that a
customer applying for credit will be an acceptable risk.”First, say the credit reference agencies, lenders want to get an idea of your perceived stability.For instance, they look at whether you’ve stayed in one place for a number of years, or whether you’ve moved around a lot. They look to see if you’ve had the same bank, or if you tend to switch. “They also want to know if you’re registered on the electoral role – and the longer the better,” says Jones. “This means that you’re statistically a better bet than someone who is not on it and has moved around a lot.”Second, lenders look at other public records – bankruptcy orders, court judgments and voluntary arrangements that might give an indication of whether you’re a serial bad debtor.“If you’ve declared yourself insolvent or there’s been a county court judgment against you, it will show up, but the lender will also be able to see if you’ve started to pay back what you owe,” says Munroe.Third, lenders examine your credit application history – or how many requests for credit you’ve made over the years. “Lenders are interested in this information because if you’ve made a lot of credit applications in a short span of time, this could signal desperation and that you’re very credit-hungry,” says Jones.Finally, the lion’s share of your report is the information pertaining to your credit accounts. “The report shows the various credit arrangements you’ve run – loans, current accounts, mobile phone agreements, TV rentals, mortgages and credit cards, the balances and also how much you owe on each of these,” says Jones.“This allows lenders to establish whether you’re prompt with payments, whether you make the odd late payment or whether you’re completely hopeless,” adds Jones.Customers are generally not privy to the scores from lenders; however, it is possible to obtain your credit score, a snapshot of your creditworthiness based on data from the big reference agencies, for a nominal fee. “It’s a really good guide for how a lender might rate you,” says Jones.It’s wise to keep your score in perspective however, says Jim Hodgkins, managing director of Credit -Expert, the monitoring service. “If you’ve got a better score, that should help you but it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve got a great advantage [in obtaining credit],” he says. “We don’t want people to get paranoid.”"
110;EFX;Equifax Inc;2004-11-03T07:34:05Z;Software giant joins battle for hearts and minds;;In the race for supremacy in the world of operating systems, “tuk”, the benign penguin that is Linux’s mascot, is undeniably a force to be reckoned with. Although Linux is primarily viewed as a low cost replacement for Unix, its popularity is causing concern to another leading player in this space, Microsoft.Not known for pulling its punches, the US software group is sparing no effort to counter the Linux threat, and is focusing strongly on educating customers about what it sees as the benefits of Windows against Linux. Some customers are willing to listen - even if they are already using Linux.Phil Dawson, senior program director for the technology research services at Meta group, the analyst firm, says that, technically and commercially, it does not make sense to replace the Windows platform with Linux, he says. The prime attraction of Linux, he adds, is the low cost of ownership and this cost benefit is achieved only when it replaces Unix installations rather than Windows.Industry experts estimate that for the same performance, a Unix operating system on a high-end RISC platform can be up to six to seven times more expensive than Linux on an Intel platform. But there is hardly any cost differential between Windows and Linux running on Intel platforms. In fact, according to Dawson, if the incumbent technology platform is Microsoft, then replacing that with Linux was rather inadvisable since all Microsoft applications are very tightly integrated. “The cost of change would be too high,” he says.Equifax, a US-based business solutions company, decided on Windows while moving its direct marketing and credit marketing services from mainframes to a supercomputer that was already based on a Windows operating system. “We have already used Linux quite extensively and felt that from a technology perspective or a support and licensing perspective, there were no serious benefits or disadvantages of either Linux or Windows. Total cost of ownership (TCO) was the main issue,” says Joe Chappell, senior vice-president of technology at Equifax.“Since Windows was the embedded operating system in the supercomputers, migrating to Linux would have involved both time and cost efforts,” says Mr Chappell. Equifax claims to have gained a six-month time-to-market advantage and a 14 per cent cost advantage through the decision to use Windows Server System instead of Linux.As technology decisions in companies increasingly boil down to a Linux vs. Microsoft evaluation, one of the key points that Microsoft highlights is the stability and commitment of a large organisation behind Windows. “I feel much more confident that there is a vendor investing people and money, testing the product for security and release patches than knowing that a generic user community is working on it,” says Gianluca Moretto, chief information officer of Fondazione Enasarco, an Italian organisation which administers social security contributions and pension schemes of sales agents and businesses in Italy.A major technology transformation project has been underway at the organisation, in which it decided to deploy Windows as against Linux. “From 2005, contribution payments for all sales agents will be administered through the internet, which would not have been possible with our heterogeneous technology environment consisting of both Unix- and Microsoft-based applications. I was asked by the board to reduce the cost of IT and improve system performance,“ says Mr Moretto.Realising that the highest cost component of the legacy infrastructure was the Unix platform, both because of high hardware costs and the cost of external consultants and Unix experts, Enasarco decided to migrate the Unix applications to a Windows environment. “When we saw the difficulties of integrating the Linux systems with our existing applications, it strengthened our conviction to migrate to Microsoft,” says Mr Moretto. Issues such as Enasarco already having a Microsoft-based mail server that could easily integrate in the new environment, and the IT department having better Microsoft skills, only served to reinforce the case for Windows.According to Mr Moretto, however, each organisation has to design its technology infrastructure according to its specific requirements. “the same solution is not good for all companies, the context we are working in is very important,” he says.At Raiffeisen Bank, Austria’s leading retail bank, the challenge was to replace the existing Unix-based banking servers at nearly 2,000 branches in Austria. While it would have been very easy to move from the Unix to a Linux environment, the decision was not so simple. All the branches already had a relatively new Windows server running the bank’s mailing system and the bank’s key concern was to utilise this existing infrastructure. It ended up porting the banking software both on to Windows and Linux, and has now finally decided to stay with Windows Server 2003.Rudolf Strubreiter, head of software development at Raiffeisen Bank says, “We first ported the banking solution to Windows NT, which took nearly two years, but the performance was very bad. Then we ported from Unix to Linux, which was very simple and took us only one month, and the performance improved quite considerably. But then we received some assistance from Microsoft consultants, and made some changes in the Windows environment to finally get even better performance than Linux.”In this ongoing battle between Linux and Windows, while the technical aspects are in most instances quite cut and dry, the emotional aspects are not. Both represent radically different ideologies. Windows has the might of a large enterprise behind it, which brings about the concept of stability but also the negative associations of Microsoft’s image as an aggressive monopolistic organisation. Linux on the other hand represents a dramatically different open and collaborative paradigm, with a magnetic appeal to the developer community and an increasing staunch set of supporters.
