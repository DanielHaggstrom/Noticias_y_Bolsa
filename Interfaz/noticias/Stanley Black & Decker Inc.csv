0;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2019-01-22T21:20:54Z;Housing stocks lose footing on fears of slowdown;;Shares of US builders and real estate groups tumbled on Tuesday as investors digested fresh signs of a housing slowdown.Sales of previously owned homes slipped in December, hitting their lowest level since November 2015 and marking the gauge’s first drop in three months. The larger-than-expected decline renewed concerns over the impact of rising interest rates and elevated prices, which have pushed more buyers to the sidelines.Meanwhile, Stanley Black & Decker cited a softer housing market when it provided full-year earnings guidance that fell short of Wall Street’s forecasts. An economic slowdown in the US and overseas is not “catastrophic,” chief executive James Loree said, but the company warned that its tools business was hurt by rising interest rates that dragged on housing activity.KB Home was the worst performer among the largest US homebuilders with shares dropping 3.8 per cent. The stock fell more than 5 per cent at its lows during the session. PulteGroup dropped 1 per cent, while DR Horton lost 2 per cent. The S&P homebuilders select industry index was down 1.8 per cent.Redfin, the online real estate brokerage, shed 12.6 per cent of its value. Zillow saw its shares drop 7.6 per cent.
1;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2019-01-22T17:15:32Z;Stanley Black & Decker hammered amid housing, tariff headwinds;;A gloomier forecast than expected from Stanley Black & Decker sawed more than 13 per cent off its shares on Tuesday as the company warned of continued headwinds from tariffs and the housing market.Stanley Black & Decker, the purveyor of cordless drills and lawnmowers, reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street’s estimates, reflecting market share gains and the rollout of new Craftsman products. But the company said it “overcame multiple external headwinds” during the year and expects a similar environment in 2019.“While these headwinds will gradually abate as 2019 unfolds, they will be with us for a while, and the economic growth backdrop also looks to be slowing as well,” chief executive James Loree said during a conference call with analysts.For the current fiscal year, Stanley Black & Decker said it expects to record earnings of $8.45 to $8.65 excluding one-time costs, well below analysts’ forecast of $8.79 a share.Stanley Black & Decker shares tumbled 13.2 per cent to $118.87 on Tuesday morning. The stock was down nearly 16 per cent at its lows, threatening to surpass its biggest single-day drop on record — a 15 per cent sell-off on October 2, 1992.The downbeat outlook also hit shares in Home Depot and Lowe’s, the two largest US home-improvement retailers. Home Depot fell 1.1 per cent, while Lowe’s — which carries Craftsman products made by Stanley Black & Decker — was down 2.3 per cent.The New Britain, Connecticut-based tool maker, which acquired the iconic Craftsman name from Sears Holdings, began selling Craftsman-branded products through Lowe’s, Ace Hardware and Amazon.com last year.Stanley Black & Decker makes everything from power tools and lawn-care equipment to vacuums and toasters. Its portfolio includes several staples of the hardware aisle such as DeWalt, Porter-Cable, Mac Tools and the company’s namesake brands, Stanley and Black & Decker. It also provides commercial security, manufacturing and construction services.Mr Loree said the tools and automotive markets began to lose momentum in the third quarter due in part to interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve that hurt real estate and car buying. Meanwhile, economic and political turmoil in Germany, the UK and Italy have created challenges in Europe, he added.Chief financial officer Donald Allan Jr. noted that negative impacts from higher commodity prices, tariffs and currency fluctuations dragged on operating margins in the tools and storage business during the fourth quarter.They also cautioned that Stanley Black & Decker will see continued pressure on margins as the company balances sales volume with raising prices to offset rising costs.While these challenges “don’t magically disappear,” Stanley Black & Decker has created the “strongest pipeline of revenue-generating catalysts we’ve ever had during my almost 20 years as a C-level executive in this company,” Mr Loree said, citing the Craftsman rollout and other recent acquisitions.In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 5 per cent to $3.64bn on higher tools and storage volume and strength in the industrial segment. The company reported a net loss of $66.7m, or 45 cents a share, compared with net income of $281.5m, or $1.84 a share, in the same period a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, earnings were $2.11 a share. Analysts had forecast fourth-quarter earnings of $2.10 a share and revenue of $3.62bn.
2;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2018-07-26T04:00:47Z;Cost impact of tariffs laid bare in corporate earnings;From toys to tools and trucks, manufacturers tweak supply chains and plan price rises;Donald Trump’s multi-front trade battles are prompting warnings from some of the largest US companies that higher tariffs will squeeze their profit margins, force them to pass on the pain to suppliers and push prices up for consumers.An analysis of executives’ comments since the start of the second quarter reporting season shows that most US companies see little immediate impact from the trade actions announced by the Trump administration, most of which have yet to take effect, but makers of toys, tools and trucks have begun to take steps to respond.“This is a very dynamic situation that changes by the day . . . and we’re giving it substantial focus,” Honeywell chairman and chief executive Greg Lewis told analysts. With inflation accelerating in transportation, logistics and metals, the industrial conglomerate was adjusting its pricing “as necessary”, he said, and had begun evaluating “more structural solutions” to weather the tariffs over the longer term, including finding new suppliers.“I think it’s going to be one of those things that goes through into consumer pricing,” cautioned James Quincey, chief executive of Coca-Cola, after the soft drinks group increased prices in response to increases in an array of costs, from freight to the metal used in Coke cans.Whirlpool also told investors it had raised its pricing in response to the “significant headwind” of steel and aluminium tariffs pushing up the cost of raw materials for its washing machines, and companies from Danaher to United Technologies said they were eyeing similar price increases.Stanley Black & Decker said higher prices had so far helped the tool maker fend off the effect of tariffs and unfavourable currency movements, but executives said they may still have to make changes to its supply chain should higher tariffs stay in place for the long term.Companies from 3M to General Electric expressed confidence in their ability to change their sourcing if needed, citing their diversified global supply chains. “Sometimes the hardest part is figuring out what the rules are. But once it’s communicated, we can adapt pretty quickly,” said Scott Roe, chief financial officer of VF, the owner of clothing brands from Vans to The North Face.A few companies have spelt out the tariffs’ likely toll: the White House’s trade measures will cost Ford an estimated $500m-$600m this year, would cost GE $300m-$400m if it had taken no mitigating steps and are forecast to add $45m-$55m to Harley-Davidson’s 2018 costs, executives said.Harley, which last month drew fire from Mr Trump by shifting some production from the US after the EU targeted it in retaliation for US steel and aluminium tariffs, said it planned to keep the prices of its motorbikes unchanged. But that will put pressure on operating profit margins this year, for which it shaved its guidance by half a percentage point, to 9-10 per cent.The warnings come against the backdrop of an unusually strong earnings season for corporate America, despite other challenges including labour shortages, higher transportation costs and currency swings.Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S projects earnings growth of 21.4 for the second quarter, and said on Wednesday that of the nearly 150 S&P 500 companies to have reported so far, 86 per cent had exceeded Wall Street’s expectations — a record since it began collecting the data in 1994.The executives’ comments also represent a striking change of tone from three months ago, when attention focused on calculating the benefits to companies’ bottom lines of the corporate tax cuts Congress passed at the end of 2017.CEOs broadly welcomed the Trump administration’s agenda of cutting taxes and rolling back regulations, but growing fears of a trade war have prompted some to speak up for the principle of free trade in the hope of changing its protectionist trade policy.“We are a company that’s built for fair and open trade,” said John Flannery, chief executive of GE.Brian Goldner, chief executive of Hasbro, put the message more starkly. The toy maker was already moving some production from China to the US, he said, but it was talking to the administration and members of Congress to communicate “just how terrible an impact an ongoing tariff or trade war would be”.

Toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker is banking on him continuing to do so.This week, Stanley said it would buy the well-known Craftsman tools brand from Sears, which had been hawking it around in its latest attempt to pump up liquidity. Sears will get $525m upfront and another $250m in three years from Stanley. But Stanley will also pay an annual royalty on a sliding scale to Sears for 15 years on Craftsman sales it records. It says the present value of all payments is $900m. But for Sears to get only 60 per cent of them upfront betrays who had the leverage here.Rating agency Fitch recently put Sears on a bankruptcy watch list. But Mr Lampert always seems to have a rabbit to pull out of his hat — usually a package of Sears or Kmart locations that he can sell or borrow against. Asset sales and property financings have raised $10bn since 2012.It may seem as though Mr Lampert is seeing just how long he can play out the string at Sears; many of the financing transactions have been with his own hedge fund. But Sears insists it is deploying strategy based on being an asset-light, membership-based retailer.Financial engineering cannot be an end unto itself, though. Through the first three quarters of 2016, operating cash outflows totalled nearly $750m. While annual sales are more than $20bn they continue to decline nearly 10 per cent a year on a like-for-like basis. Constantly selling assets to stay afloat brings the risk that future earnings power is commensurately eroded.It also creates opportunities for rivals such as Stanley, which will be able to market Craftsman tools outside Sears locations. In 15 years, Sears itself is supposed to be paying a royalty to Stanley on the Craftsman tools its stores sells. Many do not think that Sears will be around then, at least not in its present form. Yet its resilience has surprised so far."

The US toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker has released a hyped portable power system called Flexvolt where various saws and drills can be charged and used cordlessly. The accompanying media blitz includes blogs and social media influencers that rely on images of beefy men in hard hats and tool belts.On Wednesday, Stanley announced another tools move — it would buy the power tool brands of Newell Brands, a conglomerate that is slimming down, for $1.95bn. The purchase price multiple is a healthy 13 times operating cash flow. Stanley says with cost savings it comes down just eight times, a figure below its own trading multiple.But unlike Tesla, Stanley investors have demanded strong profits to back up its deals. The company has delivered impressive profit growth: its stock price doubled in the past five years and its market cap has reached nearly $20bn.Stanley’s power and hand tools business accounts for two-thirds of the group revenue (its other segments are physical and electronic security, and industrial products such as fasteners). Half of the group’s business is in the US with another quarter in Europe. While the demand for tools is strong (organic growth was 8 per cent last quarter), Stanley’s operating margin of above 15 per cent has reached all-time highs.Since 2000, when it began to bulk up and diversify, Stanley has boasted a total return of 400 per cent, citing its ability to manage costs and tightly manage working capital. Of late, its industrial peers have done just as well. Shares of Honeywell, Danaher, and Illinois Tool Works have all surpassed the performance of Stanley in the past five years. Industrials have broadly outperformed even with worries about slowing global economic growth and adverse currency movements. This deal may make sense but it is Stanley’s operational innovation that will make the difference.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
5;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2016-06-06T17:29:25Z;US economy: capital punishment;Investors in capital-intensive sectors will hope US data are misleading;Last week Brent crude futures closed above $50 for the first time since November. Sighs of relief all round: how bad can the economy be when fuel prices are rising? Then came the lousy US job numbers on Friday: maybe it can be pretty bad, after all. And the jobs data are not the only sign that the commodity bounce does not reflect strong US output.Data from the Association of American Railroads reveal startlingly low demand for carload and container shipments since the beginning of the year. This can be explained, in some part, by producers’ unwillingness to ship coal and petroleum products at the low prices prevailing earlier in the year. Lower raw material costs should provide a boost to manufacturing and building, though. This does not seem to be working. The Federal Reserve reported in April that the year-on-year increase in total dollars spent for building construction and improvement is among the lowest observed since the financial crisis. The Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index is hovering near post-crisis lows, having dipped below 50 (indicating contraction) five times in the past year.The railway sector has already taken its lumps, although stocks such as CSX and Union Pacific have recovered somewhat since the beginning of the year. Not all sectors that should be sensitive to weak industrial activity have suffered, though. The ratio of prices to historic earnings in the capital goods sector has pushed out to 20, compared with a one-year average of 18.The likes of Illinois Tool Works and Stanley Black & Decker, for example — both sought-after, high-quality stocks with attractive dividends and limited commodity exposure — are up nicely over the past year. This looks odd, if US housing and industrial activity is rolling over. And the economic data are at least consistent with such a slowdown.Economies are devilishly hard to predict. Talk of “leading indicators” is misleading in most every case. Some stock prices, however, look like a poor fit with where the economy appears to be right now.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
6;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2014-08-21T13:16:13Z;Techtronic: trade of the tools;Hong Kong manufacturer deserves more attention;"Americans are hammering, drilling and sanding. Home Depot’s very strong numbers this week, and respectable results from its weak sibling Lowe’s, show as much.Hong Kong tool manufacturer Techtronic has benefited. First-half profit, announced on Thursday, increased 16 per cent year on year, just shy of the 20 per cent Home Depot achieved. Techtronic’s outlook, like Home Depot’s, was positive. The similarities end there. Home Depot has rallied nearly one-tenth since reporting; Techtronic dropped 6 per cent.Owner of brands including Ryobi, Hoover and Milwaukee, Techtronic looks, from many angles, as attractive as the retailer. Techtronic says it has been gaining market share from the competition, which includes Bosch, Makita and Stanley Black & Decker. Its 10 per cent revenue growth outpaced the market; Europe (a fifth of sales) grew at an even faster 15 per cent. Even in countries such as the UK, where the desire for home improvement has been waning and third-party handymen are becoming more popular, Techtronic’s exposure to higher margin professional tools allows the company to benefit.The good news does not end there. Gross margins have been slowly expanding across the group, and stand at 35 per cent. With margins at Makita and Stanley around 2 per cent higher, there may be room for more. Over a third of Techtronic’s revenues come from innovative products. While not always as high end as those made by its competitors, Techtronic’s new products are faster to market and boost margins.Compared with Home Depot, trading on 20 times expected earnings, TTI, at 18 times, looks cheap given its lively growth rate. Stanley trades at a slightly lower multiple – 17 – but has half the growth. And Techtronic is generating enough cash to increase the dividend. Techtronic has outperformed Home Depot, Makita and Stanley over one, three and five years. That pattern looks set to continue.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com"
7;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Shutdown to continue to hurt US companies;;"The deal may be done, but the US will be living with the consequences of the debt showdown for a long time to come, in the form of corporate profit warnings, economic uncertainty and the enduring disgust of international investors.Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, criticised Congress, reflecting widespread views in the business community, saying investors abroad were “disappointed and concerned” by some politicians’ willingness to countenance a debt default.“The fact the narrative in Washington is even about whether we extend our debt ceiling is just not acceptable. If you are a debtor nation your job is to make sure your creditors like you,” Mr Fink said. “Even with a deal to avoid a default, the damage has been done and the result will be a slowdown in economic growth.”Stanley Black & Decker on Wednesday became the first US company to tie a profits warning to the shutdown. James Loree, the company’s chief operating officer, said there was usually a surge in demand in September related to government spending, but this year “it just didn’t occur”.WW Grainger, the industrial supplies company, reported a “high-single digits” decline in sales to the federal government, and warned: “Sequestration and the government shutdown remain significant headwinds”.Housebuilder sentiment is also ebbing. Yet global equity markets rallied after Senate leaders unveiled a deal that could be put to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.Earlier, billionaire investor Warren Buffett likened the last-minute negotiations over raising the government’s debt ceiling to wielding a “political weapon of mass destruction”.If Congress did damage to the “237-year period of good behaviour” by causing a technical default on bond payments it would be a “pure act of idiocy”, Mr Buffett told CNBC.“I know it’s been used in the past, but we used the atomic bomb back in 1945 and we decided we weren’t going to do something like that again.”Market participants continued to make contingency plans for a default: CME Group, the exchanges operator, demanded clients trading US interest rate swaps deposit more collateral to absorb potential losses; Bank of New York Mellon said its fund management customers had been liquidating short-term government debt in favour of holding cash.William Demchak, chief executive at PNC Financial, said that, even if Congress lifted the debt ceiling in a timely manner, “we’re still likely to see an impact in the form of a slowdown in broader economic activity as we go to the fourth quarter. So, things are not going to get any easier and we’ve plenty of work to do.”Tim Hopper, chief economist at TIAA-CREF, the investment firm with $523bn under management, said: “If Congress and the president are able to reach a long-term deal that offers investors some certainty, it could unleash a wave of growth. However, a short-term deal that doesn’t provide clarity about future fiscal intentions would likely continue to restrain growth.”"
8;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2020-04-25T19:58:26+0000;Stanley Black & Decker: not a drill;Shares fall 14% amid cut to earnings target;It is hard to believe – as Stanley Black and Decker’s management claimed while cutting earnings targets on Wednesday – that the government shutdown has hurt US tool sales. Has nobody hammered together underground shelters in which to greet the apocalypse? Do furloughed workers make no home improvements?The government shutdown was only a tertiary explanation. More important were lowered hopes for margin expansion in the security business and slowing emerging markets. The market was unamused regardless, whacking Stanley Black & Decker’s shares 14 per cent. This probably has less to do with the severity of the earnings target cut than with the company’s valuation, which had become toppy in a recent rally. An industrial company that is growing organically in the low single digits should not trade at 17 times earnings.This sober moment invites a look back at the $4.5bn all-stock merger that brought Stanley and Black & Decker together. The share price drop wipes out their outperformance against industrial stocks since the deal was announced in late 2009. One might have hoped that the cost synergies ($350m) and increased emerging market presence that were promised would have given the combined company more of a boost. If Stanley Black & Decker’s margins and profits during the past 12 months are compared to the aggregate results the two groups achieved in 2007, it looks like little has changed. Free cash flow is lower today, as capital expenditures have risen.This is too harsh. Using merry 2007 as a stick to beat 2013’s results with is as unrealistic as it would be to use dreary 2009 as the comparator and declare the merger a success. The companies predicted that the combination would have $1.5bn in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation three years after the merger. They have delivered that and a little bit more. The merger came off more or less as planned. Whether Stanley Black & Decker needs more sanding and polishing is another question.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
9;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
10;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2012-11-01T17:29:06Z;Debt issuance rebounds in wake of Sandy;;US debt capital markets returned to life with a bang with companies rushing to issue deals after a shutdown in the wake of hurricane Sandy.A slew of companies including the finance arms for Caterpillar and BP, Stanley Black & Decker, the provider of hand tools, General Dynamics, a defence contractor and Capital One Financial sold about $11bn combined in new bonds.The rebound came after no new corporate debt deals were offered in the US market this week, according to data provider Dealogic. The bond market was officially closed on Tuesday.Corporate borrowers also rushed to sell the bonds ahead of market-moving events that could trigger volatility and push borrowing costs higher.US companies have timed new deals opportunistically throughout year, seeking to avoid rapid turnround in markets. Thursday’s “window of opportunity” comes as the Bureau of Labour Statistics said it would proceed with the release of the critical US non-farm payrolls data on Friday – the last of the big economic news before the US presidential election on Tuesday.“The new issue market has come back with a vengeance today as investors were again operational post Sandy and had substantial cash to put to work,” said Greg Hall, managing director in debt capital markets at Barclays.He added that volumes were expected to remain high in November with “some issuers looking to get ahead of that supply, while others are conscious of taking any risk associated with the election off the table”.Thursday’s sales will push the total for US debt issuance over the $1.15tn mark so far this year, the busiest on record for dollar-debt sales, according to Dealogic. The new sales are set to meet strong demand.Investors have favoured corporate bonds as returns have outpaced that of government securities this year.On average, US corporate bonds have returned 10 per cent year-to-date compared with 1.9 per cent for US Treasuries and a 13.1 per cent return for high-yield corporate debt, according to Barclays indices.John Higgins, senior market economist at Capital Economics, said a rally in corporate bonds was beginning to show signs of running out of steam. But corporate debt may continue to benefit from an extended period of potentially open-ended quantitative easing.“In the absence of another recession, such as the one which hit the US in 1937-38 a few years after the Great Depression, a major spike in spreads and yields seems unlikely,” he said.Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie
11;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2012-10-10T18:28:41Z;Bain Capital buys Apex Tool for $1.6bn;;Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said it would acquire Apex Tool for about $1.6bn, the second big US hardware deal announced in two days.Apex Tool, a joint venture formed in 2010 by Danaher Corp and Cooper Industries, is a leading manufacturer of power tools, drill chunks and soldering products.Danaher and Cooper own equal shares of Apex Tool, which is based in Sparks, Maryland, and the sale to Bain will allow each company to shed a non-core asset. At the joint venture’s inception, the two companies combined their tools businesses into a consolidated operation.“With the support of Danaher and Cooper, we’ve succeeded in combining two premier tool manufacturers into a single world-class company,” said Steve Breitzka, Apex Tool chief executive, who will continue to lead the company, on Wednesday.A wave of disposals, led by industrials groups, has led to divestitures accounting for a record share of deal volume this year. Dealmakers expect the trend to continue, with more tool deals in particular.On Tuesday Stanley Black & Decker, a rival of Apex Tool, sold its hardware and home improvement unit to Spectrum Brands for $1.4bn in cash.The deal gives both Danaher and Cooper welcome room to focus on their core businesses.Danaher in February acquired Beckman Coulter, a diagnostic equipment maker, for $6.8bn, part of the group’s continued push into the healthcare and life sciences market. Cooper is in the process of combining with Eaton Corp, after their $11.8bn deal was announced in May, a move that will see the new group focus on industrial components instead of consumer goods.Bain, meanwhile, has been an active acquirer of divisions being disposed of by big groups. In 2010 it paid $1.6bn to Dow Chemical for the Styron basic plastics unit. And later that year the private equity group joined with Advent International to pay $2.7bn for Royal Bank of Scotland’s credit card processing group.“We’ve been impressed with the global platform of market leading positions that the Apex Tool team have been able to build. In the market, Apex Tool is known for its long tradition of quality and manufacturing excellence and portfolio of well-known tools brands,” said Seth Meisel, a managing director at Bain.Barclays and RBC Capital advised Bain, with Kirkland & Ellis providing legal counsel.

12;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2012-10-09T16:58:30Z;Disposals underscore asset-shedding trend;;Two disposals on Tuesday continued the trend of industrial groups shedding non-core assets, a theme that has led to divestitures accounting for a record percentage of US deals this year.Stanley Black & Decker, the toolmaker, said it would sell its Hardware and Home Improvement Group to Spectrum Brands for $1.4bn in cash. The unit, which makes locks and taps, was put up for sale this summer, and attracted interest from private equity buyers.But Spectrum Brands, a publicly traded holding company for a collection of consumer products brands, won the deal, and will use the Hardware and Home Improvement Group to diversify its geographic footprint and the range of stores where it sells its products.The new unit, with revenues of $985m for the past year, sells brands such as Kwikset at stores including Home Depot and Lowes, with 85 per cent of its sales coming from North America.John Lundgren, Stanley chief executive, said: “While HHI is a healthy and profitable business, its characteristics are inconsistent with Stanley Black & Decker’s strategic objectives of diversifying our revenue base through further expansion into targeted end-markets with higher growth and margin profiles, including emerging markets.”Spectrum’s other brands have stronger sales in stores such as Walmart and it has had a substantial portion of sales coming from overseas.Greg Gluchowski, current president of the unit at Stanley, will join Spectrum to run the group there, reporting to chief executive David Lumley.Spectrum also said it would continue with its plans to pay a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend. Shares in Spectrum were up 12 per cent as investors cheered the news early in the day.Stanley shares were off one per cent in early trading. Spectrum was advised by Deutsche Bank and Barclays.Also on Tuesday, Cytec Industries said it would sell its coating resins business to Advent International, a private equity firm, for $1.15bn, including debt.The sale will allow Cytec, a chemicals company based in New Jersey, to focus on its more profitable units, such as carbon-fibre manufacturing. Cytec also authorised an additional $452m in stock buybacks, bringing its total repurchase programme to $650m.Private equity firms are sitting on billions in undeployed capital, and limited partners are pressuring sponsors to put such so-called “dry powder” to work. Cytec’s coating resins business, with its consistent sales, is the type of business that often appeals to private equity firms.Shares in Cytec were off one per cent in early trading. JPMorgan advised Cytec.

New rules allow shareholders to press for the right to nominate candidates for board membership on the proxy voting materials distributed to shareholders ahead of annual meetings.Norges Bank Investment Management, manager of the $550bn Norwegian government pension fund, has filed shareholder proposals for proxy access at six US companies for the first time.“Board members must be held accountable,” said Anne Kvam, head of ownership policy at NBIM. “When they fail to meet our expectations, we as shareholders should be able to propose alternatives without incurring prohibitively high costs.”Long an aim of corporate governance activists, new SEC rules designed to enforce such access for shareholders were defeated in court last year by the US Chamber of Commerce, which challenged the cost benefit analysis undertaken by the regulator in designing the regulations.However, the SEC has allowed individual shareholders to press for proxy access at a company by company level, leading to a free-for-all to set rules such as how large or longstanding a shareholder must be to gain access, and what costs the company must cover.Charles Elson, head of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, advocates reimbursement for all the cost of solicitation – the public relations, travel and advertising costs associated with mounting a proxy campaign – but only when shareholders approve the action.Simple proxy access, by comparison, merely pays for the cost of printing and distributing voting materials to shareholders, not the advocacy that accompanies it.“The problem with access is who gets to use it,” he said. The Chamber of Commerce, for instance, argued that it would be abused by unions and narrow special interest groups.“I think it’s more democratic and ultimately allows the shareholders themselves to differentiate between effective and non-effective proxy contests,” said Mr Elson. Health South is the only large company to adopt the measure so far, however, and shareholders still face an uphill battle to win access, and from there to police corporate behaviour.
14;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US industrials prepare for risk of double dip;;American industrial companies are preparing for a slide back into recession with plans to make job cuts and other cost savings, even though they have yet to see any slackening of demand from recent financial and political turmoil in the US.Some manufacturers, including mining and agricultural equipment companies, are still projecting strong growth. Others say orders and sales are holding up.However, in the past few days several companies have said they are keeping a close watch on demand and have identified savings that could be made if demand falls.Hudson La Force, chief financial officer of WR Grace, the chemicals company, said: “We are digging through our customer order data to ensure that if we do see any slowdown in demand, we pick that up very quickly.”Michael Griffin of the Corporate Executive Board, a consultancy, said manufacturers were “stress testing” their plants and thinking about measures to stabilise financial positions they took in the downturn in 2008.“The volatility is adding to the concerns among executives that we have seen for six months,” he said. “It is reinforcing that and adding to the pullback in hiring and investment expectations that we started seeing last quarter.”Employment in US manufacturing, which recovered only very modestly after its steep decline in 2009, has been little changed in recent months. Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management survey is still showing that the industry is growing but has been falling since March, indicating a slowdown.Michael Larsen, chief financial officer of Gardner Denver, which makes pumps for the oil and gas industry, said the company had not yet seen any slowdown in the US or Europe, but it would be “foolish” to think the weaker outlook for economic growth, the volatility of financial markets and the fall in the oil price would not have any impact.“We have been working since April on our contingency plans,” he told a conference organised by Jefferies, the investment bank, in New York last week.“We got the team together and we prepared a list of the plants that we are going to go after, and we have a number in terms of headcount reduction that we are ready to pull the trigger on, if we do see a slowdown in orders.”Jim Loree, chief operating officer of Stanley Black & Decker, the tool company, said it could respond to weaker demand by driving through the integration of the business following last year’s merger of Stanley with Black & Decker.“We certainly don’t want a market downturn, but if we get one, we’ll deal with it. We’ll bring our cost structure down accordingly,” he said.
15;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2011-06-23T18:14:27Z;EQT sells Securitas Direct for €2.3bn;;EQT has agreed to sell Swedish alarm company Securitas Direct to Bain Capital and Hellman & Friedman for almost €2.3bn ($3.26bn) in what has become a rare case of private equity groups outflanking a strategic buyer.The private equity consortium trumped a rival offer by US power tools maker Stanley Black & Decker for the provider of alarm products and services, several people close to the situation said.The sale, set to be announced on Thursday evening, is set to give EQT a spectacular return by tripling the initial investment it made three years ago when it took Stockholm-listed Securitas Direct private.Bain and Hellman & Friedman will pay 14.5 times the company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the past year, reflecting Securitas’ fast profit growth plan and its non-cyclical business with long-term contracts.The buyers have agreed to pay at a given time in the future up to Skr900m ($138.8m) on top of the Skr21bn enterprise value if Securitas Direct’s performance will be as planned.EQT declined to comment, as did Bain Capital and Hellman & Friedman.The deal marked a rare occasion this year in which private equity groups managed to outstrip cash-rich strategic buyers.Stanley Black & Decker had joined forces with US private equity groups Carlyle and Clayton Dubilier & Rice, but the latter earlier this week dropped out of the consortium in the auction that was run by Morgan Stanley and Nordea.Private equity groups have lost out against industrial buyers in Europe in several large transactions in the past few months, including US dental group’s Dentsply International’s $1.8bn acquisition of rival Astra Tech this week.Securitas Direct, a provider of burglar and assault alarms and smoke detection for private homes and small businesses, was spun out of Securitas Group in 2006 and was taken private two years later in a deal valuing it at Skr10.1bn or 13 times earnings.It has embarked on a rapid expansion spree since then, increasing its number of customers throughout Europe by almost half to 1.4m and its ebitda by a fifth each year since 2007.In the past year, Securitas Direct reported revenues of Skr5.51bn and an operating profit of Skr1.45bn.In the next few years, the group aims to expand outside Europe, which could include further acquisitions.The deal marked the second large disposal for EQT this year after its €3.2bn sale of German cable group Kabel BW to US peer Liberty Global in March.It comes as the Swedish private equity group, which is partly owned by the Wallenberg family, is passing the hat to collect money for its sixth fund, which has a target size of €4.25bn and came to a first close this month.
16;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2011-04-25T20:32:55Z;Talking cure eases remuneration tension;;"It is fashionable on Wall Street to malign the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation as a rushed piece of lawmaking likely to cause multiple, unfortunate, unintended consequences.Yet one of the few provisions of the bill to affect the broader corporate world, the introduction of new “say on pay” rules, appears to be having an immediate effect on the traditionally adversarial relationship between shareholders and corporate executives.“Both sides are reporting that they are talking more to one another, and investors like that, they want to hear from the companies, for the companies to explain what they are doing and why they did what they did,” said Robin Ferracone, head of Farient Advisors, a consultancy.Dodd-Frank requires companies to hold non-binding shareholder votes at their annual meetings on executive pay programmes, on the frequency of future say-on-pay votes and on “golden parachutes” – payments to executives in the event that the company is sold.Initially these votes were regarded as of little consequence since companies could technically ignore the result.Attention instead focused on the procedural matter of how often the vote should be held, and the challenge investors face in considering the sheer volume of proposals.“Say on pay threatened to suck all the oxygen out of the room this proxy season,” said Patrick McGurn of proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services.But the advisory nature of the vote appears to have actually encouraged its use.“Most investors report that the non-binding nature of the Say on Pay vote gives them a ‘hall pass’ to express their discontent, without severe consequences to the directors or the employees,” said Ms Ferracone.So far Jacobs Engineering, Beazer Homes, Shuffle Master, Hewlett-Packard, Ameron International and Stanley Black & Decker have been subject to “no” votes on say on pay.In most cases the cause appears to be poor performance, with a study by ClearBridge Compensation Group of the first 30 votes at Fortune 500 companies finding a clear link between shareholder returns over three years and voting patterns.But the study, which examined proxy materials – the documents sent to investors ahead of annual meetings – published by the first 100 large companies, found companies already responding to investor
concerns.Potential compensation, the overall package available to executives if targets are hit, actually appears to be falling.“A few companies, including General Electric, took this disclosure a step further by including a summary of the compensation programme and why shareholders should vote for it at the very beginning of the proxy statement,” said Russ Miller, partner at ClearBridge.More companies also appear to be talking to investors pre-emptively.“It’s not a magic bullet,” said Tim Smith of Waldon Asset Management, a prominent advocate of socially responsible investing. “But the acoustics in the dialogue are changing, expanding and deepening those exchanges.” Historically, corporate governance has been pitched as a battle between shareholders and management. Indeed, another Dodd-Frank reform – proxy access rules – are tied up in court. These force companies to distribute as part of their own proxy materials rival candidates for directorships proposed by activist investors. This vastly reduces the cost of challenging a board. The US Chamber of Commerce has criticised the rules, arguing that they will be abused by special interest groups.Such clashes contrast with shareholder behaviour in countries where the opportunity for investors to make advisory votes on pay are long-established. In the UK, for example, companies very often consult investors before potentially controversial changes to head off any pay revolt.Improved communication may also diminish the role of proxy advisers such as ISS and Glass Lewis.“It’s healthy,” said Ms Ferracone. “It’s like instead of talking to a marriage counsellor, we’re communicating directly and that’s much better than having an intermediary there interpreting everything.”Additional reporting by Alison Smith"
17;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2009-11-03T19:14:02Z;Buffett rail deal offsets banking concerns;;"Wall Street clawed back early losses in volatile trading on Tuesday after news of Warren Buffett's biggest takeover deal offset lingering concerns over the banking sector.Financial stocks had led the market lower after UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, reported a larger loss than expected for the fourth quarter.Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, the UK's two partnationalised banks, also announced that they were raising £54bn in an effort to appease European Union concerns about state aid.Technology stocks also suffered after Morgan Stanley lowered its rating on the semiconductor industry from ""attractive"" to ""cautious"" and downgraded Intel, causing its shares to lose 2.7 per cent to $18.50.""EPS, gross margins utilisation and growth metrics tell us that we are in the final innings of the semi cycle,"" Mark Lipacis, Morgan Stanley's chip analyst, wrote in the research note.Inventory concerns also led the brokerage to cut its ratings on several of Intel's smaller rivals.The market had been set for steep declines as a result but deal activity helped Wall Street to regain ground. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it would acquire Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the second-biggest US railroad by revenue, for $26bn in cash and stock.The deal valued Burlington Northern at $44bn, pushing its shares up 27.5 per cent to $97. Berkshire gained 1.7 per cent to $100,450. The takeover, which is the biggest acquisition made by Berkshire, prompted a rally in other US rail companies, pushing Union Pacific up 7.9 per cent to $59.41 and CSX up 7.3 per cent to $45.97.Stanley Works was up 10.1 per cent at $49.69 after the tool supplier announced after the closing bell on Monday that it would buy Black & Decker for $3.46bn in stock.Encouraging data on September factory orders also helped push stocks higher, lifting the market into positive territory and prompting a late recovery in financial stocks. After early losses, Bank of America closed 1.2 per cent higher at $14.80 while Citigroup gained 1.3 per cent to $4.04.However, investors re-mained cautious before today's closing comments from the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting.The S&P 500 finally closed 0.2 per cent higher at 1,045.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 9,771.91 and the Nasdaq gained 0.4 per cent to 2,057.32.""The downgrade on Intel is weighing on the market somewhat but the big story is Berkshire buying Burlington Northern,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon. ""The M&A [activity] fortifies the notion that corporate America is feeling good about the prospects of economic growth next year and the factory orders were also another plus point for the economy.""Cognizant Technology Solutions also helped to mitigate losses in the technology sector after reporting better results than expected from the third quarter and raising its full-year profit forecast. Its shares were up 8.2 per cent to $41.97.Synchronoss Technologies, the communications software maker, gained 12.2 per cent to $13.02 after posting a 34 per cent rise in quarterly earnings owing to strong demand from wireless carriers.Viacom, which owns the MTV Networks and Paramount film studios, posted profits above expectations after video-game sales and box office hits including Transformers helped the company overcome a slump in advertising revenues. The shares gained 1.3 per cent to $30.17. A late recovery in oil prices also helped lift energy stocks into positive territory before the closing bell.However, Johnson & Johnson weighed on the market after it announced a significant restructuring plan. The healthcare company said it would cut up to 7 per cent of its global workforce, or 8,000 positions, generating savings of between $1.4bn to $1.7bn in 2011. Its shares dropped 0.9 per cent to $58.93.Ferro, which produces materials such as enamel and plastic compounds, fell 6 per cent to $5.60 after announcing the pricing of a common stock offering."
18;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2009-11-03T01:03:17Z;Stanley seals $4.5bn Black & Decker tie-up;;Stanley Works has agreed to purchase of Black & Decker for $4.5bn in an all-stock tie-up uniting two American household brands.Stanley, whose hand tools have been a ubiquitous presence in US hardware stores for more than a century, will pay a 22 per cent premium, based on Friday’s close, to purchase Black & Decker’s equally well known line of drills, screwdrivers and other power tools.The companies said on Monday they planned to wring out about $350m in annual costs through the transaction, which they expect will add about $1 in per-share earnings within three years. “The driving motivation of the transaction is the present value of the $350m in annual cost synergies,” Nolan Archibald, Black & Decker’s chief executive, said on Monday in a statement.The combination might also help both businesses extract better terms from both retailers and suppliers just as an improving housing market rekindles demand for tools.“Mass merchant retailers – Walmart, Home Depot, Lowe’s – and raw material suppliers beware,” Brian Sozzi, an analyst with Wall Street Strategies, said. “The combined purchasing power of Stanley Black & Decker is coming online in 2010.”Under the terms of the all-stock deal, investors will receive 1.275 Stanley shares for each share of Black & Decker they own. Following the merger’s completion, expected in the first half of 2010, Stanley shareholders will own 50.5 per cent of the combined company.John Lundgren, Stanley’s chairman and chief executive, will be chief executive of the combined company, to be named Stanley Black & Decker. Mr Archibald will be chairman for three years. Black & Decker shares jumped 21 per cent in late trading on Monday after the agreement’s announcement, while Stanley rose 4 per cent.Moody’s Investors Service placed Stanley’s “A3” senior unsecured debt rating under review. “The review will focus on the company’s ability to integrate Black & Decker’s diverse businesses with its own while not adversely disrupting key customer, supplier and employee relationships, and realise cost and operating synergies,” Moody’s said in a statement.Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs advised Stanley’s financial advisers on the deal, while Cravath Swaine & Moore served as legal counsel.Black & Decker’s advisers were JPMorgan Chase, Hogan & Hartson and Miles & Stockbridge.
19;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2009-11-02T21:49:00Z;Ford drives Wall St higher;;US equities were volatile on Monday, turning sharply negative during the afternoon as financials slumped, before recovering some lost ground.Initially, stocks rallied, boosted by upbeat economic reports and a surprise swing to profitability for Ford.The US carmaker posted its first quarterly profit in more than a year as cost-cutting and the government’s “cash-for-clunkers” rebates helped produce earnings of nearly $1bn, or 29 cents a share, during the third quarter.That confounded expectations of a 12-cent-a-share loss and Ford closed up 8.3 per cent at $7.58.After the closing bell, Stanley Works announced it would acquire Black & Decker in an all-share deal valued at $4.5bn.After dipping as much as 0.7 per cent during the afternoon, the S&P 500 closed 0.7 per cent higher at 1,042.88, half its earlier rise of 1.5 per cent.It was a wild ride on Monday for Vix, the index of S&P options volatility. After dropping 8.5 per cent to 28, Vix powered back above 30, only to ease a tad as stocks recovered. Last week, Vix closed above 30, for the first time since July a sign of rising fear for stocksThe S&P financials also rebounded from an afternoon slide of 1.8 per cent, sparked by worries that the banking system remains vulnerable in the wake of CIT filing for bankruptcy on Sunday.“Weakness among financials was also likely reflecting investor concerns as how the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp will build reserves against future loses in an environment that’s already seen 100 banks fold this year,” said John Stoltzfus, strategist at Ticonderoga Securities.Elsewhere, the Nasdaq Composite closed higher by 0.2 per cent at 2,049.20, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 9,789.44.The behaviour of equities on Monday came after last week’s decline of 4 per cent for the S&P, which helped drag the broad benchmark into negative territory for October, its first monthly decline since February.Investors enter November facing a busy week of data, the end of the earnings season and a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Any change in the central bank’s policy statement as to the timing of removing easing policy could weigh on sentiment, notably in the bond market.Later in the week, attention will focus on the release of the October employment report. Economists expect a decline of 175,000 jobs during October with the unemployment rate rising 0.1 percentage points to 9.9 per cent.“The bottom line in Friday’s jobs data is likely to be that the labour market remains a significant source of vulnerability for the economic recovery,” said Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson Icap.On Monday the market was propelled to its intra-day highs after the Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched manufacturing index was 55.7 for October.That was higher than an expected rise of 53 and was the best reading since April 2006. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion.Meanwhile, construction spending for September rose 0.8 per cent, its biggest gain since September 2008, and pending home sales for September were up 6.1 per cent as the home buyer tax credit boosted activity.Sentiment for stocks was also boosted by other earnings, brokerage actions and a deal in the energy sector.Denbury, the oil company, announced a deal to buy Encore for $3.2bn with Encore shareholders receiving $50 a share, consisting of $15 in cash and $35 in Denbury common stock.Denbury fell 10.3 per cent to $13.09 while Encore rose 20.5 per cent to $44.67.In other earnings news, Humana, the health insurer, posted a 65 per cent rise in third-quarter profit.The company reported earnings of $301.6m, or $1.78 a share, up from $183m, or $1.09 a share, a year before. Revenue rose 8 per cent for the quarter to $7.72bn and the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $37.01.Shares in Loews Corp rose 2.4 per cent to $33.90 after the conglomerate reported a higher-than-expected third-quarter profit of $469m, or $1.08 a share, beating a forecast of 89 cents a share. That compared with a loss of $144m, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.Sysco Corp, the food distributer, recorded an 18 per cent rise in quarterly profit, just above estimates. The stock gained 0.2 per cent to $26.50 as sales fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.Shares in Clorox rose 0.3 per cent to $59.40 after the maker of bleach products posted a 23 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit, beating estimates.Shares in Motorola rose 5.4 per cent to $9.03 after Citigroup upgraded it to a “buy” from a “hold” and raised the target price to $10.50 ahead of the new Droid cell phone.Nordstrom gained 1.6 per cent to $32.29 after Deutsche Bank upgraded the retailer to a “buy” from a “hold” with a target price of $45 from $36on expectations of better store sales in October.
20;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2008-12-11T21:49:00Z;Financials suffer on USB writedown warning;;Financial stocks led an afternoon retreat on Wall Street on Thursday after a warning from US Bancorp heightenend concerns that the forthcoming earnings season would bring heavy writedowns.Shares in US Bancorp have outperformed the financial sector by 92 per cent over the last year, as the bank appeared to have avoided the serious difficulties others have endured during the financial crisis.But they tumbled 10.2 per cent to $24.85 on Thursday after the bank said it could incur $1bn in credit costs and writedowns in the fourth quarter.A note from Richard Bove, analyst at Ladenburg Thalman, helped push Wells Fargo, a close peer, down 11.3 per cent to $25.90.“Near-term concerns about loan quality and margins are going to be most important and the outlook here is not good,” he said.The financial sector overall tumbled 8.5 per cent. JPMorgan Chase sank 10.7 per cent to $29.94 after Jamie Dimon, chief executive, told CNBC Television the bank has endured a “terrible” December.Real estate investment trusts sustained particularly heavy losses. The FTSE REITS index sank 15.5 per cent and came under pressure from a bearish Citigroup note on the banking sector.“We now forecast a severe credit cycle in commercial and commercial real estate,” the analysts said.XL Capital, which sank 33 per cent on Wednesday to the lowest level since the company went public, fell a further 11.8 per cent to $3.44. The insurer said it expected to report losses of at least $200m from its alternative investment portfolio and appointed Goldman Sachs to “explore value-enhancing opportunities”.Visa was one of the bright spots for much of the day after the credit card group reiterated earnings forecasts for next year, but it too succumbed to stand 2 per cent lower at $52.09 by the close.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 2.9 per cent at 873.59, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.2 per cent lower at 8,565.09 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 3.7 per cent weaker at 1,507.88.Advances in oil stocks had helped the wider market stay broadly flat for much of a session as crude rose sharply ahead of the Opec meeting next week.However, the sector finished lower after a heavy sell-off into the close. Exxon Mobil, at one point on course for its highest close since August, finished 0.1 per cent lower at $80.02.Elsewhere, glum economic data, downbeat corporate outlooks and signs that political wrangling could delay a bail-out of the ailing car industry held the market back.General Motors and Ford fell 10.4 per cent to $4.12 and 10.8 per cent to $2.90, respectively, amid fears that Republican critics could scupper $14bn in emergency loans to the industry.“The risk of Senate non-passage remains substantial,” wrote JPMorgan’s car manufacturing analysts in a note to clients.Meanwhile, the number of new workers filing claims for unemployment benefits jumped more than forecast last week to a 26-year high, according to the Labor Department. The figures came after traders were shocked by last week’s non-farm payrolls figures, which showed the biggest drop in 34 years.Meanwhile, industrial stocks suffered following a glut of gloomy news from companies in the sector.Reduced earnings guidance from Cummins and Stanley Works pushed shares in the pair down 7.1 per cent to $24.92 and 5.9 per cent to $32.30, respectively. The sector was one of the worst performing, down 4.2 per cent overall.Consumer stocks also performed badly. Among the heaviest losses, Urban Outfitters sank 20.6 per cent to $14.98 after the clothing and housewares retailer warned sales could worsen over the crucial festive season.Costco lost 3 per cent to $52.06 even after the warehouse chain said quarterly profit rose slightly, as strong results from its petrol stations helped the figures.Lorillard, down 3.9 per cent to $58.70, was among the losers in tobacco stocks after Goldman Sachs downgraded its view of the sector to “neutral”.Goldman analysts warned that a probable increase in excise tax could push volumes down 7 per cent next year.
21;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2008-05-05T19:16:38Z;Out of the door: Tax treatment tempts businesses to move country;;When Halliburton moved its headquarters from Houston to Dubai last year, the oil services group provoked a political storm. Despite assurances that the company was not seeking to avoid tax or scrutiny, the move was lambasted by Democrats as an example of corporate greed. Senator Hillary Clinton led the attack, denouncing the move as “disgraceful”.On the other side of the Atlantic, the spotlight is also on corporate defections after two big UK companies said last month they were shifting to Ireland for tax reasons. Others have also hinted at leaving. When United Business Media, a trade publisher, announced the move of its headquarters to Ireland, Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury affairs spokesman, criticised this as “blatant tax avoidance”.Politicians fear loss of jobs and tax revenues when companies move their headquarters. But their moral indignation cuts little ice with multinationals whose ties with their home countries have diminished because of international expansion and cross-border mergers.Over the last decade, 6 per cent of multinationals have relocated, partly for tax reasons, according to research from Oxford University’s Centre for Business Taxation. Companies competing with rivals based in lower-tax regimes are under pressure to cut their tax bills. Moreover, they are being wooed as never before by small countries keen to attract skilled jobs or create a larger tax base.UBS, the investment bank, predicts a “gradual erosion of governments’ ability to tax”. When Shire, the UK pharmaceutical company, announced its move to low-tax Ireland last month, Amit Kara, director of UBS, said: “This is the kind of tax competition we should expect. The pressure will remain on countries such as the UK to continue lowering corporation tax especially for the fleet-footed. The tax burden may shift to smaller companies.”At first sight, there is little reason for governments to panic about the threat of shifting headquarters. Companies will still pay tax on the factories, sales and other profitable activities in the countries where they operate. But finance ministries fear that migrating companies will find new ways to strip the tax base of the countries where they operate. Academic research published last year showed that foreign-owned manufacturers in Europe paid less than half as much tax as domestically owned businesses.Julian Alworth, an associate fellow at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, sees fiscal reasons as dominant in determining relocations. He told a recent conference: “When you look at why companies are moving headquarters, it is often to reduce the liability in the country where their headquarters are located and where they have their operations.” He cited a controversial attempt by Stanley Works, the US tool manufacturer, to move its headquarters to Bermuda in 2002, which was ditched after a political outcry.The suspicions of finance ministries are also aroused by the mobility of the income that companies derive from intellectual property or financing operations. Many big countries attempt to trap this income in their tax net using anti-avoidance rules. By moving to a more lenient regime, companies hope to escape these restrictions.Boasting an attractive tax regime for intellectual property has become part of the marketing pitch for countries wanting to attract foreign corporations, particularly the regional European headquarters of US multinationals. Kraft, Google, Electronic Arts and Yahoo have all recently switched their European headquarters from the UK to Switzerland. Ebay, Amazon and Microsoft have moved to Luxembourg. The Netherlands boasts names such as Cisco Systems, Nike and Starbucks.As multinationals become more skillful at managing their intellectual property, there are tax as well as commercial advantages. By holding brands and patents in low-tax countries and charging other subsidiaries for their use, profits are lowered in high-tax countries.Unsurprisingly, these shifts of intellectual capital are unpopular with many tax authorities. Two years ago, Mark Everson, former commissioner of the US Internal Revenue Service, warned that the increasing transfer of intangibles was a “high-risk compliance concern”, adding: “Taxpayers, especially in the high technology and pharmaceutical industries, are shifting profits offshore.”The small, low-tax countries that encourage profit-shifting of this sort are also criticised. Ireland’s success at attracting knowledge-based companies is seen as overly aggressive by some rival governments. Arnauld Montebourg, a French politician, last year accused low-tax Switzerland of “predatory practices”. The Netherlands – which attracted Ikea from Sweden and Gucci from Italy – was lambasted for its approach to taxing mobile income by the Amsterdam-based Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations, a non-profit research group. “All the empirical evidence indicates that the Netherlands is a tax haven,” it said.These criticisms are shrugged off by tax competition advocates, who believe tax competitiveness encourages investment. But resentment from larger rivals poses risks for small countries eager for foreign business. One of the worst fears of Ireland’s politicians is that the republic will be arm-twisted into adopting the European Commission’s proposals for a common method of computing corporate taxes. When Christine Lagarde, French finance minister, said last month that France would push this concept forward in its European Union presidency, Bertie Ahern, the outgoing Irish prime minister, dismissed it as a “daft” idea.Big countries are meanwhile strengthening their defences. In the US, the IRS is fighting the migration of intellectual property, inflicting tax demands running into billions of dollars on pharmaceutical companies. Germany has just reinforced its rules on the transfer of assets to foreign companies. The UK has proposed tightening its anti-avoidance rules by taxing the worldwide “passive” income of companies with UK headquarters.But the problem is that these tougher regimes impose a hefty compliance burden on companies and expose them to the risk of double taxation. In the UK, the complexities of the proposed anti-avoidance system have exasperated big businesses already disenchanted with Britain’s tax regime. Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, the British employers’ federation, says companies “are seriously concerned about the high level and rising complexity of taxation in the UK and are increasingly prepared to vote with their feet”.Shire said it was leaving to “help protect the group’s tax position”. UBM said its long-term interests would be helped by Ireland’s “less complex system of taxation”. But nobody can confidently predict whether this trickle will become a flood. There are some powerful factors that deter companies from migrating, including the prospect of capital gains tax bills and the threat of reputational damage.Also, for all the criticism of Britain’s tax regime, it has an enduring appeal for some multinationals because of its generous treatment of interest costs and payments to shareholders. Barclays, Britain’s third-largest bank, thought hard about moving its tax domicile when it tried to acquire ABN Amro last year but calculated that its shareholders would be better off if it stayed in Britain.Nonetheless, more big companies are considering leaving the UK. International Power, WPP, AstraZeneca and GSK have all hinted that the matter is under review. A few years ago, this could have been viewed as sabre-rattling. But a big barrier to migration has recently been lifted: companies are no longer required to have a UK base to be included in the FTSE index.Nor can the government rely on exit taxes to stem the tide. Unlike the US, which has tried to devise laws to keep companies on American soil, European governments are under pressure to remove barriers to movement within the single market.In Britain, the threat of an exodus has sparked a debate about how policymakers should respond. Insurers are lobbying the Treasury for concessions to stem migrations to Bermuda. Deloitte, the professional services company, has argued for a special tax rate on mobile income such as trademarks. Another radical option being discussed is imposing a minimum tax for multinationals on their UK profits, as an alternative to stringent anti-avoidance measures.The Treasury has an awkward dilemma. It depends on corporate taxpayers for a tenth of its revenue. It does not want to make overly generous concessions. Nor does it wish to single out specific sectors or types of income for concessions, which might create new loopholes for avoidance.So far, the Treasury’s focus has been on making the tax regime more attractive for multinationals by exempting foreign profits from tax. This move could help stop corporate migrations, were it not accompanied by tougher anti-avoidance rules. One of the main reasons why DaimlerChrysler based itself in Germany rather than the US after its 1998 merger (subsequently unwound) was that Germany exempted foreign profits from tax.The UK has also promised to cut the corporation tax further, following a 2 percentage point fall to 28 per cent this year. Gordon Brown last week told business leaders that one of his aims as prime minister was “to reduce corporation tax even further when we can afford to do so”. Some businesses are clamouring for radical cuts. A recent CBI taskforce called for the corporation tax rate to fall, over time, to 18 per cent.A view sometimes aired in government is that large countries such as the UK should be more sanguine about losing the headquarters of big domestic businesses and focus on attracting “real business” into the country, regardless of who owns or controls it. Genuine investment goes to countries where it can be deployed. Tax is far less important in these considerations than proximity to markets, infrastructure and the availability of skilled staff.Yet if countries such as Britain become reconciled to losing headquarters to lower-tax rivals, they will pay a price. As well as shedding well-paid jobs and advisory work, they risk a decline in influence and investment as decision-makers go elsewhere. When world-leading businesses uproot themselves, more is at stake than national pride.
22;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2007-10-31T06:03:53Z;Debating point: A blend of debt and equity;;Hybrid is a term that has traditionally been used to refer to securities that have features of both debt and equity.Beginning in 1993, US companies began issuing a type of hybrid called “trust preferreds”. Similar to debt, these securities called for periodic interest payments that were deductible when calculating corporate income tax.But unlike conventional debt, the issuers of trust preferreds retained the option to defer interest payments when facing financial difficulty. This ability to defer interest, when combined with maturities of 30 years or more and a subordinated position in the capital structure, allowed the securities to gain partial “equity credit” from the rating agency Standard & Poor’s.More importantly, for bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve in 1996 began to allow such securities to qualify as Tier 1 capital when determining a bank’s capital ratios.Despite S&P’s and the Fed’s acknowledgement of the equity-like function of trust preferreds, Moody’s for many years viewed trust preferreds as an expensive form of debt. This view helped limit their issuance mainly to financial institutions.In February 2005, Moody’s changed its guidelines for assessing the equity credit of securities generally, specifically preferred stock. When the new guidelines were released, several issuers took advantage of the opportunity by issuing non-tax deductible preferred stock which received 50 to 75 per cent equity credit from Moody’s. However, the market remained limited until tax-deductible, 50 to 75 per cent equity credit structures from Moody’s were possible.Beginning with deals from Lehman Brothers, Stanley Works, and the Reinsurance Group of America in late 2005, a wave of structural innovation resulted in a $76bn market for hybrid securities in the US.Since 2005, large commercial banks such as Citigroup and JP Morgan have each issued more than $5bn of the new hybrids to meet their Tier 1 regulatory capital requirements. At the same time, holding companies of US insurance companies such as American International Group and MetLife have issued hybrids to reduce debt, buy back stock, and, in a handful of cases, fund acquisitions. Issuance by corporates remains light.The main challenge in structuring hybrids is satisfying the rating agencies that the securities are sufficiently equity-like to merit at least partial equity credit, while at the same time preserving sufficiently debt-like features to maintain tax-deductibility.The equity characteristics that Moody’s and S&P look for in hybrids are long maturities and permanence in the capital structure, flexibility in payment of coupons, and subordination in the capital structure. At the same time, tax looks for shorter maturities, certainty about regular interest payments, and a strong assurance of repayment of interest and principal.Qualities that make a security more equity-like often make it less debt-like for tax purposes.For this reason, the most likely candidates to issue hybrids are companies that are either seeking more capital, but have already exhausted their debt capacity (at least for conventional straight debt) in their targeted ratings range and are reluctant to issue new equity, or they wish to repurchase equity while maintaining their current rating.In such cases, the equity credit accorded hybrids by the rating agencies has the effect of expanding corporate debt capacity (and the interest tax shield that comes with it), while avoiding the possible dilution of value from issuing underpriced equity.For a significant majority of investment grade borrowers, even in today’s more volatile credit market, the after-tax cost of hybrid capital will be much less than an equivalent market of senior debt and common equity.Therefore, even companies that feel they already have an optimal mix of debt and common equity may issue hybrids so as to reduce their overall cost of capital.Accordingly, besides refinancing debt and buying back stock, the proceeds from hybrids have been used for a variety of purposes, including funding acquisitions. In short, tax-deductible hybrids are likely to prove effective capital planning instruments for many companies.During the spring of 2006, the US institutional market for hybrid capital shut down for two months, as US state insurance commissioners required insurance company holders of hybrids to hold additional capital against their hybrid portfolio.The commissioners’ position was resolved through a compromise and the market began its tightening trend in September 2006. Entering 2007, the hybrid market was strong, having significantly outperformed the broader credit market in late 2006Between June and September, as credit volatility increased, hybrid markets weakened and there were no institutional deals. However, the retail market was busy, as financial institutions sought to shore up capital, and retail became the viable alternative for capital raising during this dislocation in the institutional markets.Despite this, in late August, GE Capital entered the European market and priced the single largest high equity content tax-deductible hybrid ever executed by a US issuer. Then, on September 10th, Florida Power and Light reopened the US institutional market and triggered a re-marking of the entire product with secondary hybrids market moving wider.The market picked up significantly after the Fed cut the interest rate by 50 basis points in September. Hybrid issuance so far for 2007 is 38 per cent higher than for the total of 2006, and we expect this trend to continue into 2008, particularly with financial institution issuers that need to shore up their balance sheets.Kevin Ryan is managing director, global capital markets, at Morgan Stanley
23;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2006-02-07T22:51:08Z;Appeal of hybrids has bankers chasing ‘holy grail’;;Hybrid bonds represent the closest investment bankers have come to what some call the “holy grail” of the capital markets – an instrument that looks like debt to its issuer, the tax man and investors but like equity to credit rating agencies and regulators.Financial institutions have for years issued earlier generations of hybrid instruments, but issuance by industrial companies has been scarce. Linde, the German chemicals group, sold €400m ($480m) of hybrid bonds in 2003, but issuance did not take off until last year, after the credit rating agencies changed their policies to give hybrids a more favourable rating treatment.Hybrid bonds combine features of bonds and equities. The benefits can be big, including a near-halving of cost compared with alternative financing, and the range of potential uses is wide.Regulated banks can use the new hybrids to refinance more expensive instruments while retaining or improving their level of regulatory capital. US Bancorp did that in December with a $375m issue.Bayer, the German chemicals company, used the proceeds of a hybrid issue to tender for debt, boosting its credit quality. Henkel, the German consumer goods maker, issued hybrids to plug its unfunded pension liabilities.Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a US railway company, was one of many companies that sold hybrids partly to buy back stock – leaving ratings largely unchanged, but cutting the cost of capital and pleasing shareholders. Other companies, including Südzucker, the German sugar producer, and Stanley Works, the US tool maker, issued hybrids to finance acquisitions.Investors find the hybrids attractive because of the extra yield they carry, but some recent events have highlighted risks.Hybrid bonds have been much more volatile than senior bonds – as expected from an instrument that is more sensitive to credit problems. Linde’s hybrid bonds, for example, have sharply underperformed its senior bonds after it bid for BOC, the UK chemicals group.Nicola Sanders, credit analyst at Daiwa Securities, said: “This volatility is likely to remain, at least over the short-term, as many investors remain cautious of investing in this new corporate asset class and until a curve for these instruments is well established.”Investors in Thomson, the French media company, have seen the value of their hybrid bonds tumble 20 per cent since their launch in September. The company faces a likely credit rating downgrade from Standard & Poor’s following a profit warning.But operating performance is not the only risk bond investors face.The company was seen as the first potential takeover target to test the new hybrid market. This led it to include a clause that would jack up coupon payments by five percentage points if a takeover were to occur. However, the regular payments on Thomson’s hybrid – as on many others – can be deferred. The deferred coupons are not cumulative, so there is no guarantee investors will receive coupon payments if the group is acquired by a third party.Other risks lie farther ahead. Hybrid bonds can be called, or bought back, after, say, five or 10 years, depending on the issue. A “step-up” in the coupon payable on the securities is often used to give the issuer an incentive to do this.But while investors in bank capital can assume their bonds will be bought back because banks need access to the market on a frequent basis, an industrial company might be more inclined to leave the hybrids in place. “If an issuer has to refinance the instrument at higher [yield] spreads, it will likely be uneconomic for the issuer to exercise the call option,” said Willem Sels, credit strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. “As spreads start widening towards this level, the likelihood that the instrument will not be called increases.”If hybrids are not called they can be perpetual, or have a maturity date decades away.That could leave investors owning a deeply subordinated bond that pays a rate of interest below market levels.
24;SWK;Stanley Black & Decker Inc;2005-07-18T17:20:59Z;Stanley acquires Facom of France for $500m;;Stanley Works, the US industrial tools and security company, on Monday agreed to acquire Facom Tools of France for €410m ($494m) in cash as it attempts to expand in Europe.The deal will give Stanley control of several well-known European tool brands including Facom, Usag and Virax, which together produced sales of about €370m last year.John Lundgren, chief executive of Stanley, which is based in Connecticut, described the acquisition as part of the company's strategy to reduce its dependency on big box retailers in the US.“This was a perfect opportunity to continue the shift towards higher-growth and higher-margin businesses with less dependency [on big-box retailers],” he told the Financial Times.Stanley will increase the proportion of its sales generated outside North America from 30 to 40 per cent as a result of the acquisition.Wall Street investors responded positively to news of the planned purchase. Stanley shares were up 7 per cent at $50 by lunchtime in New York.The deal will unite two companies with long histories in their businesses. Facom was founded in 1918 when Louis Mosès, a young French engineer, opened a small tool shop in Paris, making its first products for the national railways. Stanley was born in 1843, when Frederick Stanley, an entrepreneur, began manufacturing door bolts and other hardware items in New Britain, Connecticut.Stanley expects the acquisition to close by the end of the year or shortly thereafter. Cost savings should be in the order of €35m. Mr Lundgren said he was not yet “committing” to either maintaining or reducing jobs.Mr Lundgren has not shied away from making acquisitions since taking up his post last year. In January, Stanley bought Security Group, which makes locks and provides security installation and repair services. The company also acquired distributor Cal-Dor Specialties and ISR Solutions, boosting first quarter revenues to more than $800m.Bank of America advised Stanley.
