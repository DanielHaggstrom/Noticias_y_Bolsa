0;HFC;Hollyfrontier Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US refining: hell from high water;Some relief for the oil markets should be expected soon;Everyone remembers hurricane Katrina, today a byword for US natural disasters. Fewer will recall Ike in 2008, which remains the worst hurricane to hit Texas in living memory. It may not hold that position long. The devastation wreaked this week by Harvey may yet make it the costliest ever for the Lone Star state in terms of lives and damage. While the human hardship will no doubt linger, the impact to US gasoline supplies should be over quicker.Powerful storms are a seasonal hazard on the Gulf of Mexico coastline. One could rightly ask if putting so much refining capacity there — Texas has a quarter of the US total — was sensible. The region’s energy industry is at least well-versed in disaster recovery. Good thing, as Gulf coast refining capacity has expanded by a fifth since Katrina and Rita (another powerful storm) struck in 2005, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Even so, Harvey was a doozy. Flooding forced some refiners to shut, while pipelines from the west Texas Permian shale region also ceased deliveries. October US gasoline futures surged 14 per cent on Thursday, yet local crude prices fell because output had nowhere to go. Refineries and export facilities were closed.Expect some relief soon. Imports are on their way to the east coast, which accounts for over a third of US petroleum consumption. A scramble is under way to ship refined products to the US, attracted by the higher product prices. Tanker rental rates from the UK have almost doubled this week. Refiners worldwide, including the rest of the US, should fill any product supply gaps. That helps explain relatively modest gains for refiners outside the Gulf such as Andeavor and HollyFrontier. US gasoline inventories were already above five-year seasonal averages. That means prices should soon level off and then fall back.Texas will not quickly forget Harvey and its devastation. Oil markets, though, have selective amnesia.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly Best of Lex email at www.ft.com/newsletters.
1;HFC;Hollyfrontier Corp;2016-03-18T16:43:38Z;Investors renew taste for energy debt;Lowly-rated bonds offer enticing potential returns — for now;The US corporate bond market has made up lost ground quickly. After a long pause — imposed by this year’s financial turbulence — and a deep exhale, debt underwriters in New York have found little downtime.In the matter of three weeks, activity sprung back to life: Berkshire Hathaway, Wells Fargo and Ford have drummed up demand for multibillion-dollar offerings. As did ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, two energy groups taking advantage of the more stable crude oil market. Investment grade bond offerings are now running near a record clip — companies have collected more than $300bn through new debt sales already this year.But one riskier deal stands out. Amid the commotion and excitement, investors agreed to buy a bond issued by one of the more lowly-rated energy companies — something that would have been almost unthinkable a month ago.Anadarko Petroleum, a US independent oil producer, sold $3bn in debt earlier this week. Not only did it go well, investors clamoured for a piece, with the order book surpassing $20bn.The company is what investors call a “crossover credit”. Anadarko is rated below investment grade by Moody’s, but still enjoys investment grade opinions from Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.The unexpected reopening of debt markets to energy companies without pristine ratings worries some investors who see little evidence of the oil market escaping a supply glut anytime soon. The recent surge is “fragile”, after all, Deutsche Bank notes.Investor discipline, however is showing signs of weakening. Several “hung” deals that had to be stuck on the balance sheets of investment banks after investors shunned them late last year, have been sold, with fund managers finally biting on bonds offered by Solera and Kraton Polymers.The cause is clear. Many portfolio managers are sitting on a lot of money — a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey put cash holdings at their highest levels in February since 2001 — and say their options have been limited.Grateful bankers have as a result used the market reopening to clear their books of some old deals gone sour.Still, not all investors are biting. While the investment grade market has roared back to life, junk bond sales are running at the slowest pace since the US emerged from recession in 2009. Moreover, of the 40 high-yield debt sales this year, none has come from the energy sector.This reflects in part how portfolio managers remain more conservative than the indices they track. Data analysed by Marty Fridson, chief investment officer of Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors, shows that the top 46 high-yield funds had an average indicated yield of 5.51 per cent, compared with 8.57 per cent on a BofA index. The lower the indicated yield, the less risk the managers are taking.Such caution does come at the cost of performance. Only two of those 46 high-yield funds outperformed their index in the 30 days to March 10. For investors that have underperformed their benchmark, the temptation to dive back into junkier credits to pick up juicier yields will only build.That was apparent in the investor scrap for a slice of Anadarko’s bond sale, which Cam Albright, head of investment strategy at Wilmington Trust, calls a “food fight”. Bankers say this year’s seven investment grade energy bond sales have attracted particularly intense interest.Given the success of the Anadarko sale, the return of lower quality bond supply loiters on the horizon.BofA strategists note that Anadarko was not the only energy company rated triple-B — among the lowest investment grade notches — to dip into the market. This week, HollyFrontier, the independent petroleum refiner, sold $250m of triple-B minus paper, a single notch above junk.Whether investors remain discerning and avoid mouthwatering yields from the junk rated energy sector — despite the remaining risks — is an open question.Lowly-rated energy bonds clearly offer enticing potential returns — as long as the “credit cycle” does not take another turn for the worse.And as Valeant reminded investors over the past week, idiosyncratic corporate credit shocks are lurking.

2;HFC;Hollyfrontier Corp;2011-11-18T19:24:41Z;Bears dominate Wall Street despite positive data;Major indices finish week down sharply;US markets spent the week threatening to break free from their eurozone shackles, only to be thwarted as the threat of contagion reared its head again.Bullish investors pointed to a flurry of positive US economic data – new unemployment claims fell to their lowest since April, while retail sales accelerated in October – but bears remained transfixed by sovereign bond yields in Europe, which spiked during the week.A warning from Fitch Ratings an hour before markets closed on Wednesday on US banks’ exposures to eurozone sovereign debt settled the tussle decisively in favour of the bears. The S&P 500 tumbled 2 per cent in an hour, turning a modest gain into a heavy loss.”Europe has been driving the market for a long time, and it will be driving the market for a long time to come,” said Channing Smith, a fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.The financial sector of the S&P 500 ended the week off 5.6 per cent, yet again falling more than any other sector.The investment bank Jefferies plumbed new year lows of $9.50 on Thursday, as yields on its benchmark 2018 bond soared above ten per cent, amid fears of interbank lending strain. The bank has been trying to reassure investors that its eurozone exposures are manageable. Shares recovered somewhat but were still ended the week down 9.6 per cent to $10.16.Other investment banks, which investors target when the eurozone is in the news, also fell. Morgan Stanley was down 13.1 per cent to $14.21 and Goldman Sachs was off 9.6 per cent to $91.91.The bankruptcy of MF Global continued to cast a shadow over the CME Group, the futures exchange, partially responsible for regulating the broker.The CME fell another 5.6 per cent this week to $248.89, as regulators publicly floated responses to the MF Global collapse.“We still think CME’s futures business remains strong,” said Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS. “But investors have no way of knowing what the regulatory fallout from the MF Global bankruptcy will be, so it’s no surprise the shares are soft.”The S&P 500 was closed the week down 3.8 per cent, trading at 1,215.66, its worst week since an awful September.The Dow Jones was off 2.9 per cent to 11,796.23, given ballast by Boeing, which ended the week up 0.8 per cent to 67.46, after securing its largest ever civilian aircraft deal from Emirates.The Nasdaq Composite index was down 4 per cent to 2,572.5.Despite the positive October sales data, several high profile retailers sold off after posting disappointing quarterly results.Abercrombie & Fitch fell 16.7 per cent to $47.30, as a high profile bet on European growth failed to pay off. Quarterly earnings per share of 56 cents were a full 15 cents lower than expected, as sales at flagship European stores disappointed.Walmart, whose exposure to value seekers normally helps it outperform in a falling market, fell 3.3 per cent to $57.23. The discount retailer reported sales growth at its US operation for the first time in two years, but analysts were alarmed by the large spending on discounts and special offers required to drive those sales.Sears slumped 13.5 per cent to $64.27, as its quarterly losses widened by almost 50 per cent compared to the same period in 2010. The loss of $2.57 a share followed a poor performance at the department store chain’s Canadian subsidiary.Midwestern oil refiners took a hit on news that the flow in a key oil pipeline will be reversed, alleviating the glut of West Texas Intermediate crude oil at Cushing, Oklahoma.Refiners with access to the WTI crude have benefited from cheap oil, but the discount of WTI compared to Brent crude narrowed sharply on the news.HollyFrontier, which is almost completely dependent on WTI crude, fell 14.4 per cent to $24.38. Other refiners were affected. Shares in Tesoro fell 16 per cent to $23.69. Although WTI only accounts for 20 per cent of Tesoro’s output, Citigroup had expected that output to produce 60 per cent of 2012 earnings.Semiconductor stocks had a volatile week with the Philadelphia Sox index tumbling 5.2 per cent.NetApp slumped 17.6 per cent to $34.74 after lowering guidance for the current quarter. The data-storage products maker blamed “unexpected weakness” at nine large accounts, and some analysts gave management the benefit of the doubt.“In our view, NetApp’s woes seem to be macro and competitive in nature and not due to execution mis-steps,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote to clients.Applied Materials fell 11.8 per cent to $11.23, despite unveiling solid profits of 34 cents a share in the third quarter.Orders from solar panel manufacturers for the company’s semiconductor products tumbled almost 75 per cent quarter-on-quarter to just $86m, forcing the company to lower forecasts for the current quarter, as solar firms cut back on expansion.Micron Technology jumped 15.8 per cent to $16.20, after a jury dismissed claims it had colluded with Korean firm Hynix Semiconductor to fix the prices of computer memory chips.Additional reporting by Johanna Kassel and Jason Abbruzzese
3;HFC;Hollyfrontier Corp;2011-11-16T23:00:16Z;US crude jumps on pipeline reversal plan;;US crude oil futures sprang back above $100 a barrel on plans to reverse a key pipeline that would reconnect the supply of West Texas Intermediate to global markets.Enbridge, a Canadian pipeline company, said it would pay ConocoPhillips $1.15bn to buy a 50 per cent stake in the Seaway pipeline and, together with co-owner Enterprise Products Partners, would reverse it to run south from landlocked Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf of Mexico.The plan had important implications for energy markets. Elevated stocks in and around Cushing, the delivery point for West Texas Intermediate crude listed by CME Group, have caused the oil blend to trade at a severe discount to similar oil types, challenging its status as a benchmark.The plan unveiled Wednesday is the first attempt to reverse an existing pipeline to help drain Cushing’s 32m barrels in inventories.“The bottleneck is being resolved,” said Antoine Halff, economist at the Energy Information Administration in Washington. “This is going to cause inventories to rebalance and prices to realign between inland and coastal locations.”US crude for December delivery rose $3.22 to $102.59 a barrel, surpassing $100 for the first time since July. Brent, the benchmark linked to North Sea oilfields, fell 30 cents to $111.88. Last month the US benchmark briefly dipped to a $28-a-barrel discount to Brent.Andy Lipow, president of consultants Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said: “The spread could continue to narrow as any crude oil inventory overhang is moved down to the Gulf coast.”Betting on the spread has become a popular trade among hedge funds and trading houses, with some analysts arguing that the glut around Cushing could cause the spread to blow out to more than $40. Barges and trains already handle some of the surplus.The pipeline plans also hit shares of US refining companies that have enjoyed discounted oils linked to Cushing. CVR Energy fell 16.3 per cent, HollyFrontier was down 10 per cent and Western Refining dropped 13.5 per cent.“For Midwest refineries, it’s welcome back to reality,” said Michael Wittner, oil analyst at Société Générale.Enbridge and Enterprise said that the reversed line could carry 150,000 barrels a day by the second quarter of 2012. By early 2013, capacity would rise to 400,000 b/d.As the US state department extends a review of TransCanada’s Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada’s oil sands to Texas amid environmental concerns, the Seaway project could help deliver similar crude to Texas by a different route. Cushing’s stocks have soared with an influx from Canada, the US’s largest foreign crude supplier, and North Dakota.Enbridge and Enterprise had earlier proposed a new, 800,000 b/d pipeline from Cushing to Houston called Wrangler. That project will now be incorporated into Seaway, Enterprise said.“The Seaway Pipeline reversal provides an early opportunity to offer Gulf coast access to midcontinent producers and other crude oil shippers,” said Patrick Daniel, Enbridge chief executive. “A Seaway reversal will provide capacity to move secure, reliable supply to Texas Gulf coast refineries, offsetting supplies of imported crude”.
4;HFC;Hollyfrontier Corp;2011-10-25T20:49:13Z;Netflix plunges 35% as subscribers fade away;Indices open lower but remain up for the month;A sharp narrowing of the spread between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and Brent hit US refiners who have benefited from access to cheap WTI.WTI has been trading around $25 a barrel cheaper than Brent crude since the start of September, but the spread narrowed to just $18 on Tuesday.CVR Energy was down 9.2 per cent to $23.23 and Holly Frontier Corporation fell 12.1 per cent to $28.61.Kansas-based CVR and Holly Frontier, which operates refineries in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Utah, deal almost exclusively in WTI crude, which is stored in Cushing, Oklahoma.Valero Energy fell 6.1 per cent to $21.84 and Marathon Petroleum was off 8 per cent to $32.98. Up to a third of the crude refined by both companies is WTI.The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to 1,229.11, its second worst daily performance this month, after worse than expected house price data, and cautious trading ahead of Wednesday’s eurozone summit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.7 per cent to 11,706.7, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 2.3 per cent at 2,638.42, back into negative territory for the year.Netflix shares plunged more than a third after the movie-streaming and DVD delivery service said domestic users fell by almost 1m during the third quarter – a larger fall than the company had predicted in mid-September.The stock fell 34.9 per cent to $77.37. The setback followed a tumultuous month, after the company increased the price of its joint DVD and streaming service by 60 per cent before announcing and then retracting a decision to divide the two units.Netflix’s market capitalisation has fallen by two-thirds since September 15, when the company first told investors it would lose subscribers.James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities, one of the few analysts who had maintained a “buy” on the stock through its stormy month, downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a “sell”.Goldman Sachs also dropped its “buy” rating on Netflix.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar plunged 25.3 per cent to $43.27 in just a few minutes of extremely heavy trading mid-afternoon, after the company announced the departure of its chief executive without explanation.Quest Diagnostic was the standout performer in the S&P 500, jumping 10.9 per cent to $56.50, after the clinical testing company eked out positive earnings on stronger margins, despite falling sales. That helped Quest’s rival Laboratory Corporation of America rise 1.2 per cent to $84.07.Analogue semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments was down 2.3 per cent at $30.95, after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue estimate disappointed the market.An earnings miss and bleak fourth-quarter guidance from industrial conglomerate 3M hit cyclical industrial and energy stocks. 3M was down 6.3 per cent to $77.04, Cummins was off 5.1 per cent to $93.81, after the engine manufacturer also cut full-year earnings guidance, citing weak demand from China and India, and a strong dollar.Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations Illinois Toolworks fell 5.4 per cent to $45.65, after the company forecast weaker demand from Europe in the fourth quarter.AK Steel Holding shed 13.6 per cent to $7.47 after the company declared a loss of $3.5m or 3 cents a share.Coal miner Peabody Energy ended a volatile day down 3.1 per cent at $39.66. The stock fell as much as 8 per cent at the start of trading after ArcelorMittal pulled out of a joint bid for Australian miner Macarthur Coal, leaving Peabody needing $5bn to fund the acquisition on its own.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Management used an earnings conference call to reassure analysts the company will be able to raise the finance through debt markets, rather than by issuing new equity, leading the stock to rally back towards $40.94 where it closed on Monday, before falling again.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Analysts had spent Tuesday morning debating the breadth of the current rally. Bespoke Investment Group found 90 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 were trading above their 50-day average at the close on Monday. That is the highest level since October 2010 and suggests the rally has extended beyond large-cap stocks, multinationals and high dividend payers, which led the two previous rallies since the August slump.But fund flows into exchange traded funds appeared to suggest the opposite, with $900m withdrawn from funds targeting small-cap companies.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, also played down the strength of quarterly results. Aggregate earnings reported by S&P 500 companies have exceeded consensus expectations by 5.4 per cent. But excluding financials, the margin has been 1.9 per cent, which is below the 5.3 per cent margin in the second quarter and the 6.1 per cent margin in the first quarter.
5;HFC;Hollyfrontier Corp;2011-07-25T19:00:52Z;Shares in small refiners surge with crude spread;;A batch of obscure US petroleum refiners has become one of the hottest trades of the commodities market as hedge funds bid for their shares to profit from an anomaly in global crude oil prices.Shares of refiners such as CVR Energy, Delek, HollyFrontier and Western Refining have surged between 75 and 130 per cent year-to-date, well above the 10-15 per cent rise of better-known oil companies such as ExxonMobil and Valero, the largest independent US refiner.Hedge funds such as Third Point, run by Daniel S. Loeb, Appaloosa, Eton Park, 1798 Global Partners and D E Shaw have all built significant positions in some of the small companies, according to regulatory filings. The refiners operate in the US mid-continent region where the benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude now sells at an extreme discount to other crude streams.For years WTI traded at a premium to Europe’s Brent and other light US crudes. But a glut at its delivery point in Cushing, Oklahoma, after regional production surged has imposed a large markdown. This month WTI’s discount widened to a record $23 a barrel. No pipelines run from landlocked Cushing to the refinery corridor along the Gulf of Mexico, or to refineries in the east and west coast, so regional refineries able to tap the hub to make fuel have seen profit margins widen sharply.Western, which has two small refineries that supply less than 0.9 per cent of US fuel needs, said in a filing the imbalance was “a positive development for us as all of our oil purchases are based on pricing tied to WTI”. CVR, with a lone small refinery 100 miles from Cushing, enjoyed margins of more than $20 a barrel in the first quarter, from $6 a barrel a year before. The reporting season for the refiners, to start this week, is likely to show even better economics in the second quarter of the year.“They are benefiting because they have a raw material cost advantage,” said Andy Lipow, of consultants Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.Analysts believe the regional refiners could get even cheaper oil in early 2012, further attracting investors to bid up their shares.Evan Calio, at Morgan Stanley, said that the WTI-Brent discount could expand to $50 a barrel by next spring. “Less than five per cent of global refining capacity can process WTI-advantaged crude oils, capturing the differential and directly increasing gross margins,” he said.Ed Morse, at Citigroup, said the US mid-continent had become an island separated from the global oil market as a “wave of more, and more, and more oil output” had nowhere to go because of a “lack of ability to evacuate oil from the region, whether by pipeline, rail, truck or barge”.Morse, who in 2009 was among the first to predict the collapse in the WTI-Brent price relationship, said that WTI prices could drop so much relative to other benchmarks that some US oil producers shut down output. Refiners in the central US were last week operating at 96.6 per cent of capacity, suggesting a limited appetite for additional crude.
6;HFC;Hollyfrontier Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
