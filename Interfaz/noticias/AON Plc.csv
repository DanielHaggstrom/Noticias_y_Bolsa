0;AON;AON Plc;2020-03-09T18:49:00Z;Aon/Willis: a bad day for a big deal;Shareholders should step back sceptically from an offer launched amid a market rout;Aon is in the business of connecting companies with insurers to find the best deals. The insurance broker thinks it has landed its own bargain with a $30bn all-share swoop on rival Willis Towers Watson. Aon has offered 1.08 of its shares for each of its target. Shareholders in the two companies should step back sceptically from a deal launched amid a market rout.The deal comes nearly a year after Aon abandoned plans to bid for Willis. The transaction would bring together the industry’s number two and three to create the world’s biggest insurance brokerage by revenue. As such, the tie-up faces antitrust challenges. You cannot fault the opportunism of Aon boss Greg Case. The insurance industry is under pressure from low interest rates that are heading ever lower. Brokers depend on commissions, but are also feeling the squeeze. Scaling up lets them pool resources. Marsh & McLennan cemented its position as the world’s largest insurance broker last year when it bought Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group for £4.3bn. Willis was itself formed from the 2015 merger between Willis and Towers Watson.Before Monday’s collapse, a 30 per cent rally in its share price over the previous year had given Aon more deal currency. Based on Friday’s closing price, Aon was offering a 16 per cent premium for Willis, or about half the premium that Marsh paid to acquire Jardine. That figure falls to just 6 per cent after Monday’s global market rout wiped more than 17 per cent off Aon shares. The $800m of annual cost savings that Aon is forecasting, worth over $6bn taxed and capitalised, will easily cover the premium. As such, Aon is not paying much to take 67 per cent of the new combined company. Instead the challenge will come in the form of integration. Marsh has suffered a series of high-profile staff losses at JLT since its takeover.Investors need to feel happy with the deal, as well as top sales people. They would be right to ask whether terms should be revised to reflect the crash in world markets.
1;AON;AON Plc;2020-03-09T13:31:53Z;Aon to buy Willis Towers Watson in $30bn deal;Tie-up will combine world’s second and third-largest insurance brokers;Aon is to buy Willis Towers Watson for $30bn in an all-share deal that will combine the world’s second and third-largest insurance brokers into a new industry leader.The deal marks the latest stage in the long-running consolidation of the insurance broking industry, and throws up a challenge to Marsh & McLennan, which until now has been the world’s number one in the sector by revenues. It comes a year after Marsh & McLennan completed the acquisition of Jardine Lloyd Thompson in a £4.3bn tie-up.Aon considered a bid for Willis Towers Watson last year, but dropped the idea last March. There had been growing speculation that it could take another look at the company. Willis Towers Watson shareholders will receive 1.08 Aon shares for every Willis share they own. That values Willis Towers Watson’s equity at $30bn, a 16 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price. Willis Towers Watson shares had been hit hard by the recent market volatility, falling by a tenth since they reached an all-time high of $220 last month.Aon chief executive Greg Case said that the deal “makes us fundamentally a more capable firm in addressing client need . . . it’s about how we address client demand in a very distinctive way”. He highlighted cyber threats and a growing urgency to protect intellectual property as two areas in which the combined firm would be stronger than the separate companies were today. “We have distinctive capabilities,” he said, adding that the combination would allow the companies to be more innovative and improve their data analytics. Aon said there would be $800m of synergies from the combination of the two groups, whose head offices are just metres away from each other in central London. Mr Case added: “Cost reduction is not the objective . . . it’s not the focus.”Three quarters of the savings will come from the “consolidation of business and central support functions”, with the rest coming from technology and real estate.Aon said that the deal would be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the acquisition. The combined company will be the world’s biggest commercial insurance broker, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute, with total revenues of $19bn based on 2018 figures. That would put it just ahead of Marsh & McLennan with revenues of just under $17bn. The new number three, Arthur J Gallagher, will trail some way behind with revenues of $5bn. Given the size of the two companies, the latest deal could attract interest from regulators, but Mr Case said: “It’s not about size — it’s not about bigger, it’s about better. It is a very competitive industry and will remain so.” Combining the two companies could be challenging. Willis Towers Watson was itself the result of a 2015 merger between Willis and Towers Watson. Two years later chief executive John Haley told the Financial Times that putting the two companies together had been “more difficult than we thought”.Mr Haley had been due to retire next year, but following this deal he will become executive chairman of Aon, with responsibility for growth and innovation. Mr Case and Christa Davies, Aon’s chief financial officer, will retain their positions. Aon was advised by Credit Suisse, while Willis Towers Watson was advised by Goldman Sachs. 
2;AON;AON Plc;2019-03-17T05:00:25Z;US higher education crisis: lessons from the Chicago schools;Amid calls to make university tuition free, one city’s training model is boosting the jobs market  ;Making college free is one of the biggest rallying cries among Democratic White House hopefuls. Given the lengths to which many wealthy parents go to game the system that is unsurprising. Last week’s FBI arrest of dozens of parents, coaches and college administrators shows just how valuable admission to the best universities has become. One Yale applicant’s parents lavished $1.2m in bribes and fake profiles to gain entry.The contrast to how the other 99 per cent fares could hardly be starker. The price of US higher education has skyrocketed. A four-year college degree now costs anywhere between $80,000 and $300,000 for tuition alone, while America’s median household annual income is $61,000. Meanwhile, a growing share of Americans have been dropping out. Less than half of students complete their degree within six years. Many are saddled with debts, now totalling more than $1.5tn, that take a generation to pay off. Led by Bernie Sanders, the “democratic socialist” who popularised the pledge when he first ran four years ago, free college has become a litmus test with the party’s base. Yet the Democrats are silent about the deepest problems in American education. Even if tuition were free, many Americans still do not want to go to college because other costs are steep and not everyone is cut out for four years of college. Many fail to complete high school because the sole purpose of doing so is to qualify for university. The result is a stubbornly large precariat of semi-skilled and underemployed Americans. “We don’t have a person to waste in America,” says Rahm Emanuel, Chicago’s outgoing mayor. “Too many kids are still slipping through the cracks.”The solution, according to a growing number of governors and mayors, Republican and Democratic, is to reboot the antiquated system of technical education. Loosely speaking, America’s 1,332 community colleges are the equivalent of Germany’s vocational institutes. The biggest difference is that in Germany a trade is still highly valued. In America, the community college suffers from the “soft bigotry of low expectations”, says Bridget Gainer, a senior executive at Aon, the Chicago-based insurance company. “Everyone is in favour of community college — but for other people’s children, not their own,” says Janice Jackson, head of Chicago Public Schools. Chicago has been leading the way in trying to retool the community college system. Since becoming mayor in 2011, Mr Emanuel has demonstrated two things. First, there is a large pent-up demand for technical education among young Americans, particularly in depressed urban areas. Second, it does not have to be free to all. Mr Emanuel’s model is to make vocational education free to any high school student who achieves reasonable grades. Following the German model, employers are integrated closely with the curriculum. The aim is to offer them marketable skills. The results have been impressive. Students qualify for Chicago’s fully-funded Star Scholarship if they get a grade-point average of 3.0 or higher — roughly equivalent to a B grade. At just over 80 per cent since its launch in the autumn of 2015, the completion rate among Chicago “star scholars” from community college is roughly three times the national average. “People respond much better if they have skin in the game,” says Mr Emanuel. The impact of the reforms is not just being felt in the further education system. High school students, even from Chicago’s deeply troubled south side, can also pick up vocational credits while still in high school. Chicago’s so-called “dual credit dual enrolment” system, allows kids still in high school to amass certifications at community college. Since Mr Emanuel became mayor, the city’s high school graduation rate has leapt from 56 per cent in 2011 to 78 per cent in 2018 — the largest jump in the US, where a fifth of students fail to complete high school. Much of the credit goes to the dual-enrolment system, which gives students a very different incentive to finish high school. “I am the first person in my family to go to college,” says Victoria Hernandez, a 17-year-old who is simultaneously studying to become a nurse and finishing high school. That means her vocational training is free. Eventually she wants to be a radiologist. Her school day lasts from 8.45am until 2.45pm. Her college day begins at 3pm and ends at 9pm. Her mother works at Walmart and her father at UPS. She can expect to be earning more than either of them by the time she is 20. “The whole system is about giving you practical qualifications,” she says. Much like the German system, Chicago’s City Colleges specialise in core skills. Each also has partnerships with nearby private sector employers who provide paid work experience to their students. For example, Malcolm X, one of the City Colleges, focuses on healthcare in partnership with the next door Rush Presbyterian hospital in Chicago’s medical district. Malcolm X recently opened one of America’s largest simulated hospitals. Richard J Daley college focuses on manufacturing. Its recently-opened facility includes laser machines, robotic simulators and vinyl cutters. Harry S Truman, meanwhile, focuses on education. Wilbur Wright specialises in information technology. And so on. Chicago high school graduation rate, up from 56 per cent in 2011. A fifth of US students still fail to complete high schoolChicago high school graduates who go straight on to a four-year university course (2016 figure)Median American household annual income. A university course can cost $300,000 in tuition fees aloneBig local employers, such as Accenture and Aon, have gone from being sceptical about vocational education to becoming cheerleaders. When he became mayor, Mr Emanuel would ask large gatherings of employers to raise their hands if they had hired anyone from a City College. None would go up. Now plenty do. The fact that there is near full employment in the US has forced employers to become more inventive. Nowadays jobs go to people, rather than the other way round. Both Accenture and Aon now sponsor apprentices in a German-style system where they pay their tuition and employ them at the same time. “When we started to look closely we realised we had plenty of jobs that did not actually require a four-year degree,” says Ms Gainer. “With the automation of HR, a four-year college degree had become a proxy of safety — a way of screening people out. Today I can honestly say I would far prefer the drive of someone who doesn’t have a college degree who has shown the drive to be hired by us.” Chicago’s universities, which used to look down on community colleges, have also changed their tune. All now accept transfers from community colleges. “The key to the system’s success is transferability,” says Juan Salgado, chancellor of the City Colleges. That means the credits that students earn from two years at a City College can count towards half of a full degree at Northwestern, the University of Illinois or even the University of Chicago. Universities often find that the students from tougher backgrounds are more resilient than those from the other end of the spectrum, the children of so-called helicopter parents, whose entire lives seem to be one long — and expensive — university prep session. “As a society we have forgotten about the trades — we have abandoned technical education,” says Kevin Browne, vice-provost at the University of Illinois. “We can measure students’ academic grades. But we have no metric for grit.” A sampling of Chicago’s star scholars drives the point home. Chloe Caston-Sanders, a 19-year-old from Chicago’s south side, commutes for two hours to Truman College and two hours back every day to study to be an anaesthesiologist. She spends her time on public transport reading. “If you look at the clock time goes slower,” she says. Rather than complain, she prizes her scholarship. “Debt makes people not want to get out of bed in the morning,” she says. Jessica Hamilton, 23, turned up at Chicago O’Hare airport from Ghana five years ago expecting her biological father to meet her. He never showed up. It turned out to be a sex trafficking scam. Later this year she will graduate with a degree in finance from the city’s Loyola University. She started at a community college. Ms Hamilton has still not tracked down her father and neither she, nor the police, know whether he was involved in the scam. Nor, because her US legal status is still pending, has she been able to go home to see her mother. But she has strong opinions about American education. “High schools want their students to go to big name universities because it helps with their branding,” she says. “But it isn’t them who pay for the debt students get into.” Despite the focus on higher education in the Democratic primary, there has been little attention on community colleges. Instead, there is a political bidding war over who can promise the most. Mr Sanders has gone from free public tuition to “debt-free” college education. Of the main hopefuls, only Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, has not yet endorsed this new benchmark. In spite of having paid lip service to apprenticeships and vocational education, President Donald Trump has repeatedly tried to slash federal support for community colleges — by roughly a tenth in his most recent budget proposal. Debating the merits of a German-style system may be too granular for US politics nowadays, but opinion polls show that strong community colleges rate very highly among the electorate’s priorities. “You could be living hundreds of miles from the nearest Ivy League university,” says Mr Salgado. “But there’s sure to be a community college somewhere in your neighbourhood.” Beneath the radar of national politics, many local governments are adopting Chicago’s example. Tennessee, a Republican-run state, has embraced it wholesale. All state students are now eligible for free community college. Other states including Democrat-run Hawaii, Oregon and Rhode Island have similar models. Louisville in Republican-run Kentucky is also hoping to adopt a variation of it. Germany’s vocational and educational training (VET) system is a tried and tested route to employment. Courses either combine company-based work with in-school training, or focus on school-based training with different work placements. More than 388,000 mainly small- and medium-sized companies participate in the scheme. About 50 per cent of all school-leavers enter vocational training, with more than 1.3m students currently in VET courses. Although critics say the expertise gained is often not easily transferable, the system helps Germany enjoy both low youth unemployment and high skill levels. The current focus is on digital innovation.Since community colleges cost so little compared with four-year degrees, many argue that a far more pressing issue is to slash the epidemic dropout rate in vocational schools. Fewer than one in four students finish — a topic the presidential debate has barely touched on. “If you make something free, you massively boost demand without improving supply,” says Austan Goolsbee, a professor of economics at University of Chicago. “In my view it would be far better to improve the facilities, quality of teaching, counselling services, and other support systems, to ensure that students stay the course.” Whichever way the 2020 US election goes, America’s advantage is hidden in plain sight. Its community colleges are rusty, but they do not need to be invented. The celebrated GI bill, which provided free education to second world war veterans, created a platform for the booming postwar middle class. Most of them went to community colleges, rather than university. It was only after the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 caused a national security panic that resources switched from the technical colleges to big research-led universities. “We already have the system in place,” says Mr Emanuel. “It is not only a question of equipping people to thrive in the labour market. It is about making a value statement about who we are as a society.” To large numbers of Americans, Operation Varsity Blues represents something far greater than an FBI investigation. The arrest last week of 50 parents, college administrators and coaches in a multimillion dollar admissions bribery scheme has struck a raw nerve. It involved some of the most reputable institutions in the world, including Yale and Harvard, and spanned private equity partners, Hollywood stars, sports celebrities and pillars of the academic community. Wealthy parents paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to get their children admitted to some of America’s most academically demanding universities. Ruses including parents paying more able students to impersonate their children in the standardised aptitude tests. Others paid vast sums to fabricate superlative sporting records for their children along with Photoshopped action shots, fake athletic records and invented curricula vitae. It is the largest admissions corruption investigation in US history.Yet to many Americans, Operation Varsity Blues is only the tip of the iceberg. In a society where wealth inequality is greater than it has been since the Gilded Age, the sense that the system is heavily rigged in favour of the wealthy finds its most acute expression in higher education. Ivy League universities admit more students from the top 1 per cent income bracket than the bottom 60 per cent. In some schools more than a fifth are “legacy” students — children of alumni. The gap between what is legal and what is not is increasingly blurred. Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, donated $2.5m to Harvard shortly before his son was accepted. Countless such examples abound. For many Americans it is not what is illegal that causes most resentment but what is allowed in broad daylight. 
3;AON;AON Plc;2019-03-07T05:08:41Z;Why Aon abandoned efforts to buy rival in under 24 hours;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;"FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.Insurance brokers are supposed to help you to prepare for the unexpected. But Aon, the industry’s number two player, caught the market off-guard on Wednesday when it said it had abandoned plans to buy Willis Towers Watson in an all-share transaction.

How long did it take for Aon to change its mind? Less than 24 hours from when it confirmed its interest.To be fair Aon never even got close to combining with Willis Towers, the third-largest broker. On Tuesday afternoon it was forced admit it was considering a tie-up with its rival Willis, a deal that would have created the largest player in the industry. By Wednesday morning another statement landed: the potential all-share bid was being withdrawn.What prompted Aon’s quick about face? Here are some reasons:the prospect of a lengthy, market-by-market examination of where the two compete by the antitrust regulators;the share price reaction after the leak, which saw Aon’s shares drop sharply. It recovered most (but not all) of the lost ground on news that the idea was dead;the challenges associated with smashing together the cultures at two big, people-dependent businesses. DD understands that is was highly unlikely Willis boss John Haley (pictured below) would have been keen. He may have forcefully got that message across to Aon last night.It was just last year that the UK’s competition regulator investigated whether insurance brokers were engaging in anti-competitive behaviour.The Competition and Markets Authority looked at whether some of Britain’s largest investment consultants — including Willis Towers Watson and Aon — should be forced to split off their consultancy and fiduciary management businesses.It eventually determined that it wasn’t necessary to force a split but it said trustees should try to secure better prices.The incident does leave Aon with questions to answer though, not least why it was looking at such a big and risky deal.In an interview with the FT less than a year ago, chief executive Greg Case (pictured below) said he was keen to build up the company’s data and analytics capabilities. He mentioned nothing about bulking up in traditional insurance broking, which is what a Willis Towers Watson deal would have done.Marsh & McLennan — the world’s number one insurance broker — bulked up last year with the £4.3bn acquisition of UK based Jardine Lloyd Thompson. Marsh boss Dan Glaser can now watch from the sidelines as his rivals work out how to respond.GSO. Those three letters mean a lot in the world of credit, and yesterday we took DD readers behind the scenes of the latest palace intrigue at Blackstone’s $130bn debt investing unit.The private equity giant has slapped golden handcuffs on Bennett Goodman — the G in GSO — in a bid to prevent the co-founder of their powerhouse credit business from following his two original partners out of the door.While Mr Goodman’s firm likes to present itself as diversified and wide ranging credit investor, GSO has unfortunately become best-known for one highly controversial practice using credit default swaps: the manufactured default.The FT last year took a deep dive into this sharp-elbowed trade pioneered by GSO, which caused an uproar even in the aggressive world of distressed debt trading.But now trading powerhouses such as Goldman Sachs and Apollo Global Management have worked with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association in a bid to close the loophole that Blackstone’s credit unit so ruthlessly exploited.CDS geeks can read the full text of these proposals here. But for the rest of us, there’s one key point worth noting: in the recent internal shake-ups at GSO, the senior executives who helped pioneer this aggressive CDS ploy have left the firm.GSO’s once-fearsome distressed debt unit has seen a string of senior departures over the past year, as Blackstone has looked to move away from these highly contentious and public spats. It seems Mr Goodman may have a much quieter time over the next few years as his $200m share award vests.Trains, planes and err . . . well in Italy that combination is enough to cause concern.In one of the odder industrial combinations being contemplated in Europe, travellers in Italy may soon find out what happens when you put together the country's flag carrier with its state-backed railway operator.Policymakers in Rome have been wrestling with a way to rescue Alitalia, the perennially lossmaking flagship Italian airline. The leading option: merge it with Italian railway operator Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane alongside co-investors easyJet and Delta.It is a plan that is raising eyebrows and that could ultimately end in tears. While Alitalia would get badly needed funds, it would not fix the structural issues plaguing it: namely overcapacity across Europe, which has driven down fares. Add in a probe by the European Commission into a loan Alitalia received from the government, as well as large unionised and pension holding workforce, and there's a good question on how Delta and easyJet would help the airline reduce its cost base.For any DD readers who are not following the situation (or if you're not planning a summer flight to Bologna or Verona), there’s something else at stake that should get your attention. Any deal between Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane and Alitalia would signal a growing willingness by Italy’s populist coalition to intervene in the economy.Read the FT’s full take on the transaction here.Mike Turner is to join the growing list of directors stepping down from the Barclays board as activist investor Edward Bramson piles on pressure for an overhaul.

4;AON;AON Plc;2019-03-06T12:29:29Z;Aon drops plans to bid for Willis Towers Watson;Combining rival insurance brokers would have faced regulatory scrutiny;Aon has dropped plans to pursue a bid for its nearest rival Willis Towers Watson, just one day after confirming it was considering an all-share offer for the insurance brokerage.In a statement on Wednesday, the company said it had been forced to make an announcement about the potential tie-up on Tuesday while talks were still at a very early stage because of regulatory requirements under Irish law.Bloomberg’s report on the talks on Tuesday had pushed Aon shares down, and Willis Towers Watson shares up.A combination would have bolted together the second and third-largest companies in the insurance brokerage industry and likely faced tough scrutiny from competition regulators.Aon shares clawed back some of Tuesday’s losses and are up 6.5 per cent in pre-market trading. Shares in Willis Towers Watson, which has a market value of about $24bn, were largely unaffected by the news.The combination of the two companies would likely have run into competition concerns in several markets. People in the industry also said that differences in culture could have made it tricky to put the two companies together. Insurance brokers such as Aon and Willis Towers Watson are people businesses, so keeping star performers happy is important.The brokerage industry is consolidating rapidly. The target is itself the result of the merger of Willis and Towers Watson announced in 2015. Marsh & McLennan, the largest insurance broker in the world, bulked up further late last year with the £4.3bn acquisition of UK based Jardine Lloyd Thompson.
5;AON;AON Plc;2019-03-05T21:39:44Z;Trump Organization’s insurance broker subpoenaed;New York state investigators seek information after testimony by Michael Cohen;New York state investigators have subpoenaed The Trump Organization’s insurance broker, the latest sign of the intensifying scrutiny of the US president’s business practices.The New York Department of Financial Services sent a subpoena to Aon late on Monday, seeking documents about its dealings with Donald Trump’s company, according to a person familiar with the matter.The subpoena, first reported by The New York Times, followed congressional testimony by Michael Cohen, Mr Trump’s former lawyer, that raised questions about the president’s insurance affairs.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic representative from New York, asked Mr Cohen if Mr Trump had ever provided “inflated assets to an insurance company”. Mr Cohen said: “Yes”.A DFS spokesperson declined to comment. Representatives for The Trump Organization did not immediately return a request for comment.Donna Mirandola, a spokesperson for Aon, confirmed the company had received a subpoena from the DFS.“As is our policy, we intend to co-operate with all regulatory bodies. We do not comment on specific client matters,” she said.The investigation by the DFS, which has authority over financial institutions and insurance providers in New York, adds to a broad range of investigations by US federal and state authorities who are examining Mr Trump’s dealings.In addition to the Russia probe and congressional inquiries in Washington, Mr Trump must also contend with several groups of investigators in his home state, including the DFS, the state attorney-general and federal prosecutors in Manhattan.The Manhattan US attorney’s office, which prosecuted Mr Cohen for campaign finance violations and other crimes, has been examining both The Trump Organization and the Trump presidential inaugural committee.Letitia James, the Democratic New York attorney-general, has vowed to “use every area of the law” to investigate Mr Trump. Her predecessor, Barbara Underwood, brought a lawsuit last year against the Donald J Trump Foundation, which later dissolved.While the DFS does not itself bring criminal prosecutions, it can pursue both civil and criminal investigations, and refer cases to state prosecutors.The agency’s subpoena on Monday demanded documents stretching back to 2009, covering Aon’s communications with The Trump Organization as well as internal records, according to the person familiar with the matter.
6;AON;AON Plc;2019-03-05T19:54:30Z;Aon says it is considering bid for Willis Towers Watson;Deal would bring together world’s No 2 and No 3 insurance brokers;Aon is evaluating an all-stock combination with rival insurance brokerage Willis Towers Watson, in what could create the largest group in the industry.The company said in a statement its plan for a bid is in “early stages of consideration” but according to one person close to the company an official offer could come within days.A combination would be a game changer for the insurance brokerage industry, although any deal is likely to face tough scrutiny from competition regulators because it would bolt together the number two and three companies.Aon is considering the move three years after Willis merged with Towers Watson in an all-stock deal. Marsh & McLennan, the largest insurance broker, bolstered its own position last year with the acquisition of UK based JLT.“The company emphasises that, at this point, its evaluation of a potential transaction is at a preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that any transaction will take place nor as to the form or terms on which any transaction might be pursued,” Aon said in its statement.Shares in Willis Towers, which has a market value of about $24bn, rose more than 6 per cent after the Aon statement. News it was considering a bid was first reported by Bloomberg.Aon stock fell 7 per cent as the market reacted negatively to the potential merger. Many analysts fear a transaction would face huge regulatory hurdles as well as opposition from underwriters worried about concentration of power in the hands of the brokers.
7;AON;AON Plc;2018-07-18T16:28:56Z;Investment consultants: switched off;Financial watchdogs send warning shots over the bows of the big three advisers;The UK’s competition regulator has decided that pension fund trustees need to try a bit harder to get better prices for institutional advice. Shop around for competitive rates. Sound familiar? That’s because the regulator once suggested something very similar to electricity consumers.But inertia from electricity users responsible only for their own household budget differs drastically from the duties incumbent on pension fund trustees.There is still a serious question to ask about whether the UK’s largest investment consultancies should be forced to split off their consultancy and fiduciary management businesses — a type of asset management service. Of the £1.6tn in UK defined benefit schemes, about 73 per cent use investment consultants. Trustees of these schemes are increasingly asking advisers to take on the duty of asset allocation as well as choose managers. That presents potential conflicts of interest which need investigating.Last autumn the Competition and Markets Authority was asked to make a call on anti-competitive behaviour. Reporting its provisional decision on Wednesday, the CMA decided that no split was required. The big three — Mercer, Willis Towers Watson and Aon — account for 41 per cent of the consultancy market. Yet the CMA decided that insufficient market concentration existed to merit separation. It recommended more legwork by trustees to secure better prices instead. Cue a large sigh of relief from the industry.Even so, there remains a sense that the report provides a warning shot both from the CMA and the Financial Conduct Authority, which has already asked for more authority to oversee these consultants.The CMA’s report does not resolve the issue of conflicts of interest. Fiduciary management has grown dramatically in the UK — up threefold in the five years to 2016 to reach £255m. One might argue that rapidly rising revenues will attract new entrants, not all of which are pure consultants. But that does not mean the customer will be well served.A tension surely exists inside investment consultancies. If revenues continue to grow quickly, the temptation would be to allocate better staff and resources to the fiduciary units. The CMA’s decision merely sheds some light on a murky area of the business. More illumination is needed.Do the largest UK investment consultants need to split off their fiduciary management arms? Or is the FCA and CMA on a witch hunt? The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.
8;AON;AON Plc;2018-07-18T06:34:55Z;UK’s investment consultants avoid forced break-up;Review proposes mandatory tenders for ‘big three’ advisers to £1.6tn pensions industry;The gatekeepers of the UK’s £1.6tn pension fund industry have avoided a forced break-up of their businesses after the UK’s antitrust body stopped short of recommending an overhaul of the investment consultancy sector. But they face increased regulation and mandatory tendering.The so-called “big three” of Mercer, Willis Towers Watson and Aon had feared they could be forced to spin off either their investment consultancy or fiduciary management businesses — a type of asset management service — after the Competition and Markets Authority launched a probe into the sector last September.The CMA on Wednesday, however, decided against a break-up, despite warning of an “adverse effect on competition” in the sector that could cause a “material customer detriment”.The provisional findings mark a significant moment for the institutional advice sector, which has largely flown under the radar of regulators despite advising UK pension funds, insurers and charities on how at least £1.6tn of assets should be invested.John Wotton, chair of the CMA’s investment consultants market investigation, said the sector was “extremely important” and “influences how well millions of people’s pension savings are invested”.“That’s why we’re proposing a number of important reforms to the sector, including requiring pension trustees to run a competitive tender when they choose a fiduciary manager and ensuring that trustees have much better information about fees and investment performance.”Investment consultants advise trustees on which fund managers to use and which asset classes to invest in. Some retirement funds also outsource investment decisions, in a process known as fiduciary management. According to the CMA, the revenues of fiduciary managers have more than trebled over five years, reaching £255m in 2016.The rapid growth of investment consultancy and fiduciary management has led to calls in recent years to tackle potential competition problems in the sector. There are fears that big investment consultants push clients to use their lucrative fiduciary management services, leading to calls for companies to be forced to spin off their fiduciary arms.The CMA found that just 34 per cent of customers buying fiduciary management carry out a formal tender. It also warned that the three largest investment consultancy providers have increased their share of the fiduciary management market rapidly in recent years to about 50 per cent, and said it feared market concentration could increase in the future.But the competition authority said a forced spin-off would “not be effective or proportionate in addressing the problems we have provisionally found” because companies offering both services would lose economies of scale and costs for providers and prices for customers could rise.The CMA’s decision came after heavy lobbying from the investment consultants, who have forked out tens of millions of pounds in fees to lawyers and other advisers to help them deal with the probe and fend off a forced break-up.As well as mandatory tenders for first-time fiduciary management, the CMA proposed that companies should include warnings when selling such services. The competition authority also said it would recommend that The Pensions Regulator provides new guidance for pension schemes to help them purchase investment consultancy and fiduciary management.The CMA has also proposed that most investment consultancy and fiduciary management services be brought under the regulatory perimeter of the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK financial watchdog. The competition authority embarked on its probe after the FCA referred the sector to the CMA because of “serious concerns” about how investment consultants operate last September. It marked the first time the FCA used these powers since they were introduced three years ago.The big three investment consultants broadly welcomed the CMA’s provisional findings. Fiona Dunsire, chief executive of Mercer UK, the UK’s largest investment consultant, said: “The CMA has proposed measures which aim to help trustees better evaluate providers and create consistency across the market. We support steps to further increase transparency and provide greater information to trustees.”But Nikesh Patel, head of investment strategy at Kempen Capital Management, said that while the proposed remedies would help treat some of the symptoms afflicting the industry, they did not go far enough. “If the CMA is looking for a cure, this medicine is not strong enough,” he said.“It has been a long two and a half years,” a senior figure at an investment consultancy said of the CMA’s review. “You end up dreaming about it and talking in your sleep about it. I just want it put to bed.”
9;AON;AON Plc;2018-06-30T09:00:25Z;‘Big three’ fire first shot as CMA finalises report;Antitrust body to publish findings of 9-month probe into investment consultancy;The UK’s antitrust body has so far shown little evidence of a lack of competition in the investment consultancy market, Mercer, Aon and Willis Towers Watson have said.The Competition and Markets Authority is gearing up to publish provisional findings on the sector after a nine-month investigation.The industry, which advises on £1.6tn of pension fund and other assets in the UK, was referred to the CMA by the Financial Conduct Authority after the financial regulator warned of a lack of transparency and conflicts of interest.The probe has included hearings and the publication of working papers examining the biggest issues in the market.Just weeks before the CMA is expected to reveal its initial conclusions, the “big three” resisted suggestions of bad behaviour in the industry.In a letter to the CMA, Aon, which advises on £300bn of pension fund and other assets in the UK, said: “The CMA has not made a clear case to conclude there is an adverse effect on competition.”Separately, Mercer, the UK’s largest investment consultant, said: “To the extent the CMA has identified potential concerns, evidence presented falls well short of that required to support a finding of an adverse effect on competition.”Willis Towers Watson added that evidence provided by the CMA so far suggested that the “market is competitive and clients are very satisfied with the services provided”.Investment consultants and fiduciary managers, which offer a type of asset management service that is popular with pension funds, have been forced to redirect staff and hire external advisers to cope with the probe. Companies are said have forked out millions of pounds in fees.In its working papers, the CMA said investment consultants failed to identify actively managed funds that beat their benchmark after fees. It warned that investment consultants could be forced to split off their advice and fiduciary management businesses or face compulsory tenders under potential new remedies designed to boost competition.In submissions to the CMA, however, the big three rejected suggestions that the sector was too concentrated and dismissed the idea of a split.One industry figure said the feeling was that the CMA was leaning towards behavioural rather than structural remedies, meaning a forced spin-off was unlikely.
10;AON;AON Plc;2018-06-07T03:00:40Z;Insurers pay premium for cyber security experts;Advising clients and pricing risk is a boom industry, with huge salaries on offer;When Jim Trainor came to the end of an illustrious, 20-year career in the upper echelons of the FBI in 2016, the then 50-year-old had no shortage of options. Consulting, cyber security companies and start-ups were under consideration.But he ended up heading to Aon, an insurance broker, where he advises clients on how to deal with their cyber risks.Mr Trainor said he was attracted to Aon because it was investing heavily in its cyber business. Getting to grips with the technicalities of insurance was, he admits, “a challenge”. For insurers and insurance brokers, cyber is big business. Spooked by attacks such as WannaCry and NotPetya in 2017, companies are seeking guidance on how to avoid being attacked, and insurance to cover the costs that arise if they are.According to analysts at investment bank Jefferies, the global cyber insurance market will grow from $3bn of premiums last year to $7bn by 2020.Finding enough qualified, experienced people to service that demand is proving hard. Unlike more established areas of insurance, there is no big pool of talent readily available.“There are not enough people in cyber who understand all the issues. There is a broad range of skills needed in cyber and no one person would be able to have all of them,” says Mr Trainor. “This is going to be a problem for the next five to 10 years.”He is not the only public servant who has been persuaded to move to the insurance world. Jason Hogg, Aon’s head of cyber solutions, also spent time at the FBI. In the UK, two former directors of electronic surveillance agency GCHQ — Sir Iain Lobban and Robert Hannigan — are cyber security advisers: Sir Iain at Marsh and Ripjar and Mr Hannigan at Hiscox.“Former FBI agents and government attorneys have the ethos of wanting to help and protect people,” says Mr Hogg. “We see the human impact of data breaches and hacks. It is a compelling story when you are recruiting.”Elsewhere, UK-based insurer Beazley has recruited from the legal profession, bringing in Raf Sanchez who had been working as a lawyer for investment banks, while other companies, such as AIG, have hired people from the cyber security industry. The insurers and insurance brokers tend to put these outside specialists into advisory roles. Mark Camillo, the head of cyber at AIG, says: “When we bring in cyber security people we tend to use them as experts for the underwriters themselves.”Michael Tanenbaum, executive vice-president at insurer Chubb, says: “We’ve hired lawyers to look at compliance. We’ve hired several attorneys to look at the rules and regulations.”At Beazley, Mr Sanchez’s role is to support companies when they are attacked, guiding them through what can be a bewildering process at a stressful time. These services are an important part of the cyber insurance offering. “You can have people crying down the phone or acting completely irrationally,” Mr Sanchez says. “You need to persuade them what they should be concentrating on, and whether they need to let in outsiders. It’s quite a skill to get that buy-in.”When it comes to some of the most technical parts of the insurance process, however, insurers usually stick to what they know. Cyber insurance underwriters — the people who decide which policies to sell and how much to charge for them — tend to have an underwriting background rather than a cyber security or public sector background. It is easier to train a cyber security expert in insurance than it is to train someone who has come out of the insurance world in cyber securitySome of them have moved over from other parts of the business. “We recently had someone underwriting kidnap and ransom [insurance] who moved into the cyber team because a lot of the risks are similar,” says Mr Camillo. Joel Westley, a researcher at Eames Partnership, a specialist insurance recruitment firm, says that cyber underwriters often have a background in professional indemnity insurance or liability insurance. Cyber is also attracting those straight from university. “On the junior end, when bright graduates are coming in, kidnap and ransom used to be attractive. Now cyber is the sexy market,” says Mr Westley.The alternative to moving underwriters into cyber from other parts of the business is to poach staff from competitors. There is a thriving market for qualified, experienced cyber insurance underwriters.Movers this year include Alex Jomaa, who went from CFC Underwriting to Tokio Marine Kiln in London in February, and Kara Owens, who in March moved to US-based Markel from rival TransRe.Lateral hires are not cheap. Mr Westley says that cyber is “one of the best paid markets in insurance”, with cyber insurance underwriters earning about 15 per cent more than underwriters with similar experience in other parts of the industry. “At the 10-year experience mark — on a £90,000 to £130,000 basic salary — they are scrapping to get to the top, so they move quite a lot,” says Mr Westley. He points out that, as the market evolves, “insurers’ appetites are changing”.The top cyber insurance underwriters, he says, can earn about £270,000 as a basic salary, with the same again as a bonus and another 70 per cent of the basic as a long-term incentive package.One entrepreneur has decided to give the experienced underwriters, together with their experienced underwriter salaries, a miss.Joshua Motta has an impressive CV. At 14 he was Microsoft’s youngest employee, coding for the software company in his spare time after school. He went on to stints at the CIA, Sprint, Honeywell, Goldman Sachs and in private equity.Now 34, he has turned to cyber insurance and, although he admits it has been “a steep learning curve in terms of jargon”, he has created a San Francisco-based start-up called Coalition that is aiming to do things a little differently to more conventional insurers. Coalition started selling policies in January 2018 and has sold $10m of insurance.“We’ve probably built the first underwriting company that doesn’t have an underwriter,” says Mr Motta. “We use machines to make decisions, so the underwriters are our software engineers.” In his view, “it is easier to train a cyber security expert in insurance than it is to train someone who has come out of the insurance world in cyber security”.Given that his software engineers have maths degrees, he says, they take to the arithmetical concepts behind insurance like “fish to water”. The result, says Mr Motta, is a company that “looks more like a Silicon Valley start-up than a traditional insurance company”. At Aon, Mr Trainor is aware of the fight he now has to attract the best tech talent that the cyber security world has to offer. “[Insurance] is not top of the list because it is less technical,” Mr Trainor says. “Some folk like to be innovative technically. Most people think of [cyber security specialists] Palo Alto Networks or Symantec,” he says.“My job is to change people’s minds. We are trying to be very innovative. We are trying to be disrupters.”
11;AON;AON Plc;2018-04-25T11:20:40Z;Aon chief warns that insurance industry is losing its relevance;Greg Case says lack of innovation has led to failure to keep pace with client demands;The insurance industry is losing its relevance by failing to address its clients’ changing needs, according to chief executive of insurance broker Aon.Speaking to the Financial Times, Greg Case said that the industry had not innovated enough, and so had not kept pace with client demands.Cyber insurance is one example. “The industry has $3bn of premium written in cyber at a time when clients in the US have $450bn in reported loss. That’s not response, that’s not relevant.”He pointed out that property and casualty insurance losses as a proportion of US gross domestic product have almost halved since the 1980s, to 1.8 per cent. “If I ask you, how is the risk industry doing in terms of relevance to the global economy, you have to say, we’re becoming less relevant.”Mr Case was speaking after announcing that he has extended his contract with Aon, the world’s second-largest insurance broker by market capitalisation, for another three years. He is now due to leave in 2023, by which time he will have held the job for 18 years.Christa Davies, Aon chief financial officer, has also extended her contract until 2023.Mr Case said that one of his main priorities was to change Aon so that it focuses more on broad risks to clients’ strategies, and less on selling individual insurance products that address specific risks.He said that the insurance industry had focused on selling products for too long, with the result that there had been little innovation.“CEOs want us to be able to respond to a broader definition of risk . . . across their business, operating performance and balance sheet strength . . . even across pension and retirement or healthcare,” he added.Aon will try to fulfil that demand by providing more data and analytics services. He said that the insurance industry as a whole has failed to turn all its data into usable ideas.The changes could have an impact on Aon’s business model. Insurance brokers have historically generated income from commissions on policies sold, but Mr Case expects the company’s revenue mix to “evolve over time”.“Traditional insurance broking will always be part of what we do,” he said, adding: “As we create value and get recognised for the value we create on behalf of clients we’re quite comfortable that we’ll be compensated fairly.”Mr Case said that Aon could invest $10bn in the business over the next five years as he builds up data and analytics, or “content”, capabilities.In 2016 the company bought Stroz Friedberg, a cyber security specialist, to boost its ability to help clients facing cyber attacks.“They brought a massive database,” he explained. “[A] 50,000 incident database on what’s happened in cyber.”Mr Case also defended one of the most controversial recent developments in insurance broking — so-called facilities where brokers bundle up demand from a large number of clients, and take it en masse to insurers, rather than shopping around for each individual policy.The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority is looking at facilities as part of a wider study of wholesale insurance broking. It is particularly interested in whether the facilities give clients the best possible coverage.Mr Case said that Aon’s facility, called Aon Client Treaty, was a good example of how it has used data to analyse and aggregate client demand, creating a better overall product.“Aon client treaty has been an absolute home run. We have clients every day taking part.”On the growing regulatory interest in his industry, he said: “We all have the same vision which is making sure clients have full transparency and full choice and are getting a set of solutions that are responding to their needs.”
12;AON;AON Plc;2018-04-16T03:00:30Z;Fiduciary managers sign up to new standard as regulators circle;Far-reaching probe addresses concerns over lack of competition and transparency;Willis Towers Watson, Mercer, Aon Hewitt, BlackRock and 10 other influential advisers to pension funds have started to disclose investment performance data in the same way for the first time, as the sector responds to unprecedented regulatory scrutiny.The Competition and Markets Authority, the UK antitrust body, is looking into the role of fiduciary managers, which oversee investment of £135bn assets for pension funds. The CMA is concerned about a lack of competition and transparency.As regulators circle, the 14 fiduciary managers that make up most of the UK market have signed up to a new reporting standard. This should enable pension funds to compare companies.The initiative means that fiduciary managers will no longer be able to cherry-pick performance data to make it as attractive as possible to potential pension fund clients during a tender. Instead all data must be reported consistently.Peter Dorward, managing director of IC Select, the company that led the development of the code, said: “Pension funds from now will be able to go to fiduciary managers and ask for performance data in line with the standard,” he said.He said fiduciary managers had benefited from low interest rates but a rise in bond yields and fall in markets could prove to be a test. This made it important for managers’ skills to be assessed.The CMA warned in March that “competitive processes are not providing customers with the necessary information to judge the value for money of investment consultants and fiduciary managers”.It said: “The potential competition concern is that customers are not well equipped to choose and subsequently monitor the performance of their provider, and in turn to drive competition.”It suggested a “standardised approach” could improve outcomes.Patrick McCoy, head of investment at Xafinity Punter Southall, the consultancy, pointed out that the new standard did not address worries over conflicts of interest.The big three investment consultants — Willis Towers Watson, Mercer and Aon Hewitt — have been accused of pushing clients to use their highly profitable fiduciary management services.According to the CMA, while demand for fiduciary management has “grown strongly”, it found that a significant proportion of investors ultimately used their investment consultant’s own fiduciary management service.The CMA has raised the prospect of forcing the big three to spin off their fiduciary businesses to tackle conflict.Mr Dorward said work on the standard had predated the CMA review but the regulatory attention helped propel the project. Plans for the standard were revealed by FTfm last year.Managers backing the standard include Cardano, Charles Stanley, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, JLT Investment Solutions, Kempen Capital Management, Legal & General, P-Solve, Russell Investments, Schroders and SEI, according to IC Select.Ben Gunnee, head of the fiduciary management business at Mercer, said the standard was an important step. “If the [fiduciary management] market is to grow, transparency has to be at the heart of that,” he said.The CMA said it expected responsibility for the standard to be transferred to the CFA Institute, followed by the development of a global standard and implementation.
13;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:01:26+0000;Oracles of the investment industry are blind to performance;Investment consultants must demonstrate they provide a service worth paying for;The word “expert” now has a strange taint. Michael Gove, the British politician, summed this up at the time of the UK Brexit vote in 2016 by suggesting the “people in this country have had enough of experts”.Oracles in the investment industry have attracted scepticism, too. They include stockpicking experts who stand accused of failing to select strongly performing shares.In the asset management industry, however, it is investment consultancy where experts’ proficiency is under most scrutiny. These consultants wield huge power, advising on more than £1.6tn of assets in the UK alone. They are tasked with helping pension fund trustees navigate the complexities of ensuring that workers past and present have enough cash to retire on. It is no easy feat in the current environment.Consultants’ expertise was called into question last year when the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, warned of “serious concerns”. The FCA said that on average, consultants cannot identify fund managers who offer better returns. The consultants played down the accusation but in March the Competition and Markets Authority, the UK antitrust body, issued a damning working paper that backed the FCA findings.The CMA, which is investigating possible competition problems in the industry, cast doubt on consultants’ ability to pick funds that generate better returns.It found no evidence that, net of fees, the funds to which investment consultants gave “buy ratings” outperformed their benchmarks to a statistically significant extent on average. It also said there was no evidence that buy-rated products outperformed unrated funds.There was one bright spot. The consultants, according to the CMA, did identify hedge funds that outperform their benchmark net of fees.The results applied across the industry and held true for all investment consultants individually. The CMA looked at funds rated by Willis Towers Watson and Aon Hewitt, two members of the so-called big three, which controls up to 80 per cent of the market.Capita, Hymans Robertson, Redington, Russell Investments, KPMG and LCP, smaller consultants, were also included. But it was unable to examine Mercer, another big three company, because the consultant did not subscribe to eVestment, the data service the CMA used to look at performance. The CMA findings are immensely worrying. With tens of thousands of funds available, many pension funds rely on investment consultants to shine a light on the best. They pay good money for this. These results suggest pension funds are missing out on possible returns.The consultants will say that picking funds is a small part of what they do. Their argument is that the asset allocation advice they give is more important. This may be true, but that does not excuse failing miserably in one area of their work. As the CMA said: “Whilst we recognise that manager recommendations are only one part of the service that [investment consultants] provide, manager recommendations is an area that potentially adds value and can reasonably be measured, and where claims [of expertise] are commonly made.”It is not just pension funds potentially losing out. Asset managers with good performance but without that coveted buy rating, will have found it hard to attract pension fund money. Many small asset managers struggle to get investment consultants to even speak to them. They claim the big and powerful dominate buy lists even if performance is poor. All of this could have an effect on wider competition and stifle innovation.The investment industry has until April 5 to respond to the working paper, which is the first of several the CMA will release before it unveils its provisional report on whether competition is working in the investment consultancy industry later this year.Its findings will be crucial for pension funds globally. Consultants are a vital part of the value chain — their proper functioning is essential in order to ensure we all have enough money to retire on.People who oversee pension funds often need expert advice, no matter how untrendy experts are. It is time for investment consultants to improve their service.
14;AON;AON Plc;2018-03-22T18:38:00Z;Investment consultants fail to select funds that outperform;UK competition watchdog’s finding undermines central claim of powerful industry;Investment consultants fail to identify actively managed funds that beat their benchmarks after fees, according to the UK’s competition watchdog, undermining a central plank of an industry that wields enormous influence over how more than £1.6tn of pension and insurance assets are allocated.The findings come amid an industry probe after the Financial Conduct Authority last September referred the entire investment consultancy and fiduciary management sector to the Competition and Markets Authority.The CMA tested the claim made by investment consultants that funds they recommended beat their benchmarks when it examined performance between 2006 until 2015.“Several parties have claimed . . . that, on average, ‘recommended’ products outperform their respective benchmarks. The empirical analysis we have conducted has found that this is only the case on a gross of asset management (AM) fees basis,” the CMA said in a working paper published on Thursday.Although “buy-rated” products outperformed their peers “to a statistically significant extent on average”, this was only on a gross return basis. There was “no evidence to date” that, net of fees, they outperformed.It added: “While we recognise that manager recommendations are only one part of the service that ICs provide, manager recommendations is an area which potentially adds value and can reasonably be measured, and where claims are commonly made.”The CMA tested actively managed asset management products with data provided by eVestment, which included contributions from Aon Hewitt, Capita, Hymans Robertson, Redington, Russell Investments, Willis Towers Watson, KPMG and LCP.Mercer, one of the so-called big-three consultants alongside Willis and Aon Hewitt, was not included as it does not subscribe to eVestment.Willis Towers Watson said it was confident it added real value to clients. “[But] we do share the CMA’s concerns about lack of clarity and comparability of performance data on asset manager product recommendations across investment consultants, and support appropriate steps to address those concerns.”Aon Hewitt declined to comment.The FCA has also warned of possible conflicts of interest when investment consultants advise pension funds and other investors on which asset managers to use while also operating their own investment services, and of “high levels of concentration” in the sector. Aon Hewitt, Mercer and Willis Towers Watson collectively control up to 80 per cent of the British market.The CMA stressed these were “emerging findings,” with its provisional report into the sector expected in July.
15;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Investment consultants questioned over climate change backing;Failure to support green initiatives puts influential advisers under spotlight;"Investment consultants advising on trillions of dollars of assets are failing to back high-profile initiatives calling for more to be done in combating climate change and for companies to disclose how they are dealing with global warming.Eight out of the world’s top 10 investment consultants or asset managers offering investment advice, including Aon Hewitt and Russell Investments, have not backed a series of recent major climate change initiatives, according to campaign group Preventable Surprises and research group Sustainix, despite the growing importance of the subject to investors.The poor scorecard shines a light on the role of investment consultancies who generally fly under the radar but exercise huge influence over how pension funds, insurers and charities allocate their funds.“Investment consultants are so influential — able to substantially sway the opinions of managers and asset owners alike. They must get behind changes to market structures and industry norms,” said David Murray, chief executive of Preventable Surprises. “Without this we won’t address climate change in time and for advisers to long-term investors this should be a matter of big concern.”The research examined the signatories of three initiatives — Climate Action 100+, which calls on companies to cut greenhouse gas emissions and improve disclosure and oversight of climate-related risks; the Ceres G20 letter, in which large investors urge politicians to uphold the 2015 Paris climate accord; and the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (TCFD), which is backed by the Financial Stability Board, a body that makes recommendations to the G20 group of nations.Leading policymakers and asset managers have warned that understanding and addressing climate change risk is of critical importance to investors.Of the 10 only Willis Towers Watson signed the TCFD. Preventable Surprises has sent an open letter to the remaining nine, eight of which are headquartered in the US, calling for them to publicly endorse the TCFD recommendations which ask that companies set out the risks and opportunities linked to climate change and how boards are dealing with these issues.“Not to sign sends signals to fund managers and others, and we therefore hope you will take immediate corrective action,” the letters state.However, investment consultants said they were taking climate change risk seriously when providing advice to clients and argued not signing up to those three initiatives in particular did not signal a lack of commitment to the issue.“The three initiatives highlighted are all really worthy but there are other initiatives out there,” said Tim Manuel, head of responsible investment in the UK at Aon Hewitt, pointing to its endorsement of other programmes including the UN-backed principles for responsible investment.Russell Investments, also a signatory of UNPRI and a member of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, an organisation in Europe, said it was an “advocate for best practices in ESG investing”.Mercer, which supported the Ceres G20 letter, said it “continue[s] to review other related initiatives that constructively advance ideas and solutions to this critical issue”.Amin Rajan, chief executive of asset management consultancy Create Research, expressed surprise that more consultancies had not signed on to recent proposals but added there had been many similar-sounding proposals in recent years.“There have been so many initiatives in this area. [They may argue] judge me by what I do rather than what I say,” he said.The other six sent letters by Preventable Surprises are Cambridge Associates, Callan Associates, Nomura Securities, RVK, Wiltshire Associates and Pension Consulting Alliance."
16;AON;AON Plc;2017-12-12T05:00:29Z;Legal sector rethinks push for efficiency;Planning ahead pays off in efforts to achieve more with less;"North American law firms are notoriously slower than their European counterparts to adopt new ways of working. After all, if a firm is very profitable, why change? However, some forward-looking firms and in-house legal teams are moving on to the offensive to tackle inefficiency and create new ways of delivering their services to clients.A common theme among this group is that they view fixing the problems as a continuing process, in which they rethink ways to practise law, rather than one-off tasks. They are also likely to borrow tactics and technologies common in the business world, but which the legal profession “hasn’t always embraced”, as Lawton Penn, an employment lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine, puts it.Ms Penn heads DWT’s De Novo team, which was created to help clients procure legal services better. She had noticed costly inefficiencies in how work was delivered from the start of her career 26 years ago. “I’ve been passionately dissatisfied [about this] for most of my career and finally have an opportunity to work on the solution,” she says.De Novo’s “tricks and tools that businesses have been using for years”, she says, include techniques such as process-mapping, data capture, analysis and visualisation, and the use of dashboards to help clients track the progress, status and cost of legal matters. The team also benefits from including people with fresh insights, she says. Their backgrounds range from legal tech and recruitment to consulting and information science, as well as law firm and in-house experience.The work falls into several categories, whether better ways to handle routine, high-volume tasks, or using visual tools to digest large amounts of data, such as a map with filters to show how and where trademarks are used around the world.De Novo’s work can help pre-empt disputes and claims. “Say you’ve got a spike in a type of harassment claim in a certain business division. We can help our client focus its resources to discover whether there are any process breakdowns, or reveal trends that show HR or management is overloaded,” Ms Penn says.She cites a client where “one very small group in the company [had] more than four times the cost in legal fees and settlements. The claims were all similar in nature. After spending a year on cultural change and awareness initiatives with that group, the data could be used to show that figure drop steadily in the three years following that effort.”Successful companies are constantly reinventing themselves. We don’t have that culture in our professionTaking time to create a strategic framework for problem-solving has also paid off for Aon, the insurance and consultancy group. Audrey Rubin, chief operating officer of Aon’s global law department, held a series of workshops that mix its own lawyers with those at outside firms to work on a common business problem, using real legal issues.The workshops have opened up channels of communication between the department, its law firms and other legal support staff and taught them a common approach and shared vocabulary for solving problems, Ms Rubin says. They have also led to an “appreciation of the need to invest in planning, in regular, larger-team communications”, Ms Rubin says. Even the simple act of mapping certain routine tasks can help identify inefficiencies. At one meeting, participants had to guess how many steps were involved in handling a subpoena. One senior partner thought 12; in fact, there were 52. That led to a cut in the time and resources allocated to the task.“They have seen for themselves that the traditional habit of a lawyer jumping in right away to start the work is not as effective or efficient as waiting until multiple perspectives and disciplines are communicating together regularly,” Ms Rubin says.The traditional habit of a lawyer jumping in right away to start the work is not as effective or efficient as waitingCatherine MacDonagh, a former corporate counsel who advised Ms Rubin on improving project management at Aon, says: “These are very smart people — they don’t need a lot of hand-holding, but they need the framework and they need the right way to think about this stuff.”In-house departments everywhere are under pressure to do more with less, particularly on the high-volume tasks that consume lots of time and money.Citi Legal, Citigroup’s in-house legal department, initially undertook a bottom-up review of its work, with a particular focus on harmonisation across myriad offices, jurisdictions, time zones and divisions. It has since developed ways of streamlining payment processing and managing suppliers, and has made its automated e-billing systems more sophisticated.The bank’s general counsel, Rohan Weerasinghe, says it is also investing in tools such as natural language processing, and “freeing up our lawyers’ time to focus on the issues, risks and subjective decision-making”.The sheer size of the bank’s legal requirements is “one of the most significant challenges we face”, he says. Citi has more than 200m customer accounts, doing business in 160 countries and jurisdictions, and the in-house legal team has a physical presence in 63 countries.Like other innovators, Citi aims to tear down silos between in-house and outside lawyers. This year it held an “innovation briefing” with a group of nearly 20 law firms across its network to discuss how to deliver better services and prices, and adapt to disruptive practices, he says.By taking time to create a framework and process to find and follow through on improvements, some US firms and legal departments are laying foundations that will potentially reshape how the legal sector works.“Successful companies are constantly re­inventing themselves,” says Ms Penn, at DWT De Novo. “We don’t have that culture in our profession . . . What it’s going to take is business and clients and consumers saying, ‘we need more from the legal profession’.”"
17;AON;AON Plc;2017-11-14T12:22:32Z;Investment consultants dominate UK fiduciary management;Small number of advisers to pension funds win almost three-quarters of contracts;Investment consultants that advise pension funds have won almost three-quarters of fiduciary management contracts in the UK despite the British financial watchdog warning of potential conflicts of interest when advisory work is mixed with investment services.The so-called big-three investment consultants of Willis Towers Watson, Mercer and Aon Hewitt, as well as JLT and P-Solve, which are smaller advisers, control 598 of the 805 fiduciary mandates in the UK, according to KPMG, the professional services firm. Fiduciary management involves making investment decisions on behalf of clients.Questions regarding the dominance of investment consultants come as the UK’s antitrust body investigates the industry. In September, the Financial Conduct Authority referred the entire investment consultancy and fiduciary management sector to the Competition and Markets Authority because of “serious concerns” about how it operates.The FCA warned of possible conflicts of interest when investment consultants advise pension funds and other investors on which asset managers to use while also operating their own investment services. Many pension funds enter fiduciary management contracts with companies that are already providing them with actuarial or investment consulting advice.The watchdog said this could lead to situations where “investors cannot assess whether the advice they receive is in their best interests”.Despite increased scrutiny from regulators, the fiduciary management industry is growing quickly, according to KPMG. About 546 pension fund investors chose to fully outsource their asset allocation decisions to a consultant or other fiduciary manager by June this year, up 19.7 per cent on the previous 12 months.At the same time, few pension funds are seeking independent help to continually assess their fiduciary manager. Just 17 per cent of pension funds employ regular third-party oversight of their manager’s decisions.Anthony Webb, head of fiduciary research in KPMG’s investment advisory practice, said the dominance of big investment consultants and the lack of oversight suggested the trustees of some pension funds were not shopping around for the best services.“We see examples of trustee boards that will just accept the first offer made to them,” he said, before adding that others have more robust procedures.But the KPMG report also showed some pension funds are becoming aware of possible conflicts, particularly when appointing a fiduciary manager initially. Roughly 60 per cent of the fiduciary contracts awarded in the year to June were advised by an independent third party, almost double the previous year’s figure.Andrew Kirton, global chief investment officer at Mercer, which oversees £750bn in assets in the UK, said the KPMG survey showed concerns about the sector were not merited.“The latest KPMG survey demonstrates clearly that the market for fiduciary management services is working well and is highly competitive,” he said.He said 65 per cent of Mercer’s new clients in the same period had taken independent advice before appointing them.“In reality, it is now relatively rare for a client to opt for a fiduciary management solution without considering alternative fiduciary management companies in the market,” he added.It is not yet known whether the CMA will publish proposed remedies for the sector, but Mr Webb said ensuring a greater take-up of independent oversight would alleviate some of the concerns about the sector.“We clearly think that having an independent third party . . . will improve the ability of trustees to determine whether things are going well,” he said.
18;AON;AON Plc;2017-11-09T18:22:36Z;Big Three investment consultants denounce FCA’s ‘flawed’ report;Willis Towers Watson, Mercer and Aon Hewitt under scrutiny from antitrust regulator;The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has been sharply criticised by Willis Towers Watson, Mercer and Aon Hewitt, the three leading investment consultants, over the financial watchdog’s analysis of the powerful sector that advises on how trillions of pounds are invested.In September the FCA said it had “serious concerns” about the investment consultancy industry as it referred the sector to the UK antitrust authority for a full-blown competition probe.But in response to a call for evidence from the Competition and Markets Authority, the so-called Big Three of Mercer, Aon and Willis Towers Watson played down the FCA’s worries.Willis Towers Watson criticised the FCA’s market study, saying some of its findings were “based on misconceptions”, as well as suggesting that its analysis about the value of manager selection advice provided by consultants “included significant flaws”.“WTW strongly believes that investment consultancy is a market with demonstrable competitive characteristics, both for advisory services and fiduciary management,” Willis Towers Watson said. “We face significant rivals in both areas.”Mercer, which has £750bn in assets under advice in the UK, said that because the FCA’s analysis of investment consultants formed part of a wider study of the asset management industry, it believed it would be “inappropriate for the CMA to attempt simply to update or extend the FCA’s work”.“We have significant reservations about the robustness of [the FCA’s] analysis, particularly in respect of manager selection and competition among asset managers,” it added.Aon said: “The CMA will find that competition is far more dynamic and wide-ranging than the FCA market study indicated.”Although largely unknown outside the asset management industry, consultants play a significant role in the investment market around the world. In the UK, the largest consultants collectively oversee £1.6tn of assets.They advise trustees who oversee pension schemes and other investors about which asset classes to invest in and which investment managers to use, meaning they yield huge influence over the retirement incomes of hundreds of millions of people around the world.In their response to the CMA, the Big Three denied there was any need to break up their businesses to foster competition, despite concerns that there is a conflict of interest when investment consultants offer investment management services through a service known as fiduciary management.“Given the positive nature of competition in this market, WTW does not believe there can be any justification for a structural remedy splitting up the investment advisory and fiduciary management businesses,” it said.But others were more critical of investment consultants. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, which represents 1,300 UK retirement funds with combined assets of £1tn, said that it welcomed the CMA’s investigation as PLSA members have “persistently expressed concerns” about transparency standards and alignment of interests in the services provided by investment consultants.The PLSA said consultants often bundled together their fees for advice and support services, which could make it difficult for pension trustees to understand the structure of these charges.It said that it would comment further if any adverse effects on competition from the behaviour of investment consultants were uncovered and urged the CMA to proceed cautiously as any potential reforms could bring unintended consequences.

20;AON;AON Plc;2017-11-05T19:00:55Z;Insurance brokers face far-reaching FCA inquiry;Aon, Marsh and others will have to show that the market is working competitively;Wholesale insurance brokers are gearing up for a sweeping inquiry by the financial watchdog, just weeks after a similar study resulted in a landmark referral of parts of the market to antitrust authorities.The FCA will launch this week its long-awaited study into the wholesale insurance-broking market, which has about 160 players, from large, international conglomerates such as Aon, Marsh and Willis Towers Watson to niche players. The regulator said in April that it wanted to “ensure that the wholesale insurance market is working well and fosters innovation and competition in the interests of a diverse range of consumers”.The industry expects the FCA to look at the way commercial insurance is bought and sold in and around Lloyd’s of London. The industry prides itself on its ability to offer cover for a wide range of risks, from property policies to cover for sportspeople, astronauts and luxury yachts.But multiple layers of insurers and brokers all jostle for business, and some practices are especially contentious. One of them is what the industry calls “broker facilities”: rather than shopping around the market for individual clients, brokers group a large number of risks together and present them to insurers. In some cases they charge additional fees for doing so. Brokers are expecting facilities to form part of the FCA’s study.Insurers have long complained about the cost of doing business in London. In his letter to shareholders this year, Chubb chief executive Evan Greenberg  hit out at “ abusive behaviour on the part of some brokers who enrich themselves at the expense of both their customers and underwriters”.The focus on wholesale insurance brokers is the latest in a series of market studies that the FCA has launched since it inherited competition powers in 2015. Market studies are sweeping in nature, taking up to two years to complete. They can result in rule changes, enforcement investigations or referrals to the Competition and Markets Authority, which can ultimately order companies to break up, even if there is no technical breach of competition law.“Market studies always have the potential to make far-reaching changes,” said Adrian Magnus, a competition lawyer at Dentons. “One of the challenges with market studies is they are inherently unpredictable.”The FCA’s last study, into the asset management sector, led to its first referral to the CMA. The sector’s investment consultants — including arms of Aon and Willis — now face a more in-depth probe by the CMA.”The FCA hasn’t had its competition powers long but it is really ramping up,” said Marc Israel, a competition lawyer at White & Case. “The advantage here is that the FCA warned that this was coming, and so firms can have given some thought about potential remedies.”The planned study comes as the industry is being hit with other competition concerns. European antitrust watchdogs have taken over an enforcement investigation into alleged sharing of information that the FCA had been pursuing into aviation brokers — the first FCA probe of its kind to be made public.The FCA’s probe comes as London is embarking on a renewed push to market itself as the global centre for specialist insurance. Under the tagline “London makes it possible”, the city’s underwriters and brokers hope the campaign will remind companies around the world about the range of risks that can be covered in London.
21;AON;AON Plc;2017-10-25T13:35:18Z;The great British pensions cash-in;Reforms gave Britons the freedom to spend their pension how they pleased. But concerns are growing over sales tactics, scaremongering and mis-selling;"Gareth Slee cannot believe his luck. “The money is life-changing for me,” says the 55-year-old former steelworker who has traded in his gold-plated final salary pension for a six-figure cash sum. “I will never have to work again. I didn’t feel like I had won the lottery, but it is not far off.”Mr Slee is one of more than 220,000 people in Britain who have taken the irreversible step over the past two years to opt out of schemes with secure retirement benefits and shift their money into riskier personal pensions, where cash can be used to pay down mortgages, buy new cars or spend in one go. “I know it’s risky but I trust my adviser,” says Mr Slee, a native of Port Talbot in Wales.This dramatic shift, for people aged 55 and over, was largely triggered by radical reforms to pension rules introduced in 2015. The aim was to give people the freedom to do as they wanted with their pension pots rather than force retirees to use them to buy an annuity, which delivers a secure income for life. “People who have worked hard and saved hard all their lives, and done the right thing, should be trusted with their own finances,” said George Osborne, the then chancellor, as he announced the “freedom and choice” reforms in parliament in March 2014.Millions of workers in the UK have built entitlements to traditional final salary pensions. But since 2015 around £50bn in defined benefit pension payments has flowed out of private sector schemes, according to Mercer, the consultancy. Experts report heavy outflows from bank and insurance staff pension schemes, including Barclays, Aviva and the Tata Steel retirement fund.As well as giving pensioners more freedom over how to spend their money, the reforms have coincided with soaring transfer values, in some cases 30 to 40 times their projected annual pension income, a multiple that has risen as bond yields tighten.The Financial Times has uncovered early signs of potential major problems with the operation of the UK’s new pension freedoms. While the Financial Conduct Authority has forced a number of firms advising on transfers to suspend their activities, the FT is also aware that the regulator is looking into reports that members of final salary schemes are being targeted by advisers , using high-pressure tactics to drum up business.To take advantage of the reform, an individual must convert their defined benefit, or final salary, pension rights to a lump sum, then transfer this to a personal, or defined contribution, pension.There are circumstances where this makes sense: when a person is in poor health or has no spouse or dependants. But the FCA believes that most people are better off in their “Rolls-Royce” final salary pensions because of the benefits of a secure, indexed income.Transferring introduces important risks for individuals, who will either be responsible for managing large investment portfolios themselves, or paying someone to do it for them. And there are now signs emerging that the surge in people opting to trade their pension for a lump sum could lead to a fresh mis-selling scandal in the UK retirement income market. The last one, in the 1980s, led to £13bn in compensation payments to pensioners who had been advised to take out personal plans when they would have been better off remaining in a company scheme.Defined benefit scheme members who have transferred funds since April 2015 (Mercer)UK regulator’s estimate of defined benefit transfers from April 2016 to March 2017Estimated number of defined benefit transfers in 2017/18, according to Royal LondonValue of cash lump sum transferred by private sector defined benefit schemes since April 2015 (Mercer)Monthly value of final salary transfer payments processed by JLT Employee Benefits, an administratorSchemes administered by Aon Hewitt which have seen a rise in transfer requests since April 2015Critics allege that the charging models being employed by consultancies are creating unhealthy incentives for advisers. The FCA, which has already looked at the growth in transfers, is widening its probe of the market.It is not just the advisers who are coming under scrutiny — MPs are also worried that some FTSE-listed companies, weighed down by large pension deficits, are incentivising existing and former staff to leave defined benefit schemes. This may ease the pressure on balance sheets and placate major investors, but the tactics of some companies, including providing staff with free pensions transfer advice worth thousands of pounds, represent a potential conflict of interest.Frank Field MP, chair of the parliamentary work and pensions select committee, is concerned that companies are subsidising the cost of advice for pension scheme members to encourage people to transfer out of defined benefit schemes. “It’s important they get independent expert advice, not from a pension salesmen sent by their employer,” he told MPs.“This early work by the FCA is very concerning,” says Keith Richards, chief executive of the Personal Finance Society, which speaks for more than 35,000 financial planners and advisers. “The market absolutely warrants further scrutiny.”The role of the financial adviser is crucial. If defined benefits are valued at more than £30,000, an individual is required to obtain independent financial advice to transfer their fund. And demand for transfer advice has soared since the reforms were launched. Companies providing it can also benefit from generous one-off fees, typically 1 to 3 per cent, and subsequent management charges if individuals choose to cash in.Alarm bells about the quality of advice sounded earlier this year when around half a dozen firms quietly suspended their transfer advice activities, following a review by the FCA. Among them was Heather Dunne IFA, a Kent-based company offering specialist technical transfer support to advisers. Its website described the market as “lucrative” and said “we look for a reason to transfer, rather than a reason not to”. The company says this statement had been removed from its website.The regulator does not comment on individual cases, but has made public the results of a review of 88 transfer recommendations made by the 13 firms most active in the market since October 2015. Of these cases, only 47 per cent were deemed to be suitable for a customer’s personal circumstances, with 17 per cent seen as unsuitable.The FCA found that only 35 per cent of the investment products recommended to individuals transferring their funds were judged to be suitable. The figures contrast with the quality of advice in the broader market; the FCA has previously found that 91 per cent of retirement income advice was suitable. As a result of its assessments, four firms which the FCA did not name have stopped advising on final salary scheme transfers.Since the new rules were introduced, many company pension schemes have started to add transfer value quotes to the option packs sent to members approaching retirement, alongside the traditional quote about what pension income to expect in retirement.Some employers, including FTSE 100 groups, are now going a step further and arranging seminars to encourage members to explore their retirement options. The inheritance tax benefits are often cited — if a defined benefit pension is transferred, a £1m pot could theoretically pass to heirs tax free if the investor dies before the age of 75.Aon Hewitt, the pension consultancy, says schemes that automatically quote transfer values in retirement packs see an average of 5-10 per cent of members transferring out of defined benefit schemes. However, this rose to 30-40 per cent when members were also offered advice, paid for by the employer. “The provision of free or subsidised advice has a significant impact on volume of transfers,” says Ben Roe, partner with Aon Hewitt.Research from consultancy Willis Towers Watson says 55 per cent of pension scheme members, who are aged over 55 and who received advice paid for by their employer, decided to transfer.“Anecdotally, the more and the better the communication, including subsidised transfer advice, the more likely pension scheme members are to take a transfer option,” says Charles Cowling, director with JLT Employee Benefits, which is currently processing around £100m a month in defined benefit transfer payments for the schemes it administers.Many companies and trustees argue that there are circumstances when it is right to transfer their pension into cash. However, Jon Hatchett, partner with Hymans Robertson, says a number of employers are motivated by the desire to shed their defined benefit scheme liabilities from their balance sheets.“The cost of a transfer is typically well below the cost [for the employer] of insuring the same liabilities with an insurer,” he says. “With take-up rates for over-55s in organised [transfer] exercises in the region of 20-30 per cent, there is a clear financial motive.”The FCA is also investigating reports of the re-emergence of “ambulance-chasing”-style tactics used by unscrupulous advisers following the earlier push to deregulate the pension market in the 1980s. Then, large direct sales forces, working on commission, would hang around factory gates touting for business from final salary scheme members recently made redundant.“I have heard new examples of some IFAs, who may not be reputable, factory-gating, or touting for business, which is concerning,“ says Margaret Snowdon, chair of the Incentive Exercises Monitoring Board. “In addition, we have heard some IFAs are asking clients to refer friends or co-workers, or even asking for advertising leaflets to be left in the workplace. This is poor practice.”There is also anecdotal evidence that some consultants are seeking to win business by exploiting fears over the security of company pension funds. If an employer goes bust, responsibility for pension payments passes to the Pension Protection Fund — the lifeboat for failed schemes. Some advisers have openly suggested this provision may be at risk of being swamped by failing businesses.The dispute over Sir Philip Green and the failed pension scheme at collapsed retailer BHS has been used in some adviser/client discussions, according to a senior insurance executive. The bankruptcy of Monarch Airlines earlier this month has added to the concerns.“The collapse of Monarch is a not-to-be-ignored red flag for people on the cusp of retirement,” said a recent press statement issued by the DeVere Group, which describes itself as one of the world’s largest independent financial services organisations. “With UK final-salary pension schemes now having an alarming £1.6tn of liabilities and a £224bn deficit, and the problem is only getting worse, it can be reasonably assumed that it [the Pension Protection Fund] is perhaps seriously feeling the squeeze. How many more high-profile collapses could it sustain?”The DeVere group says the purpose of its alert was to suggest people review their pensions and their wider financial planning. But David Penney, chartered financial planner with Penney Ruddy & Winter, says it would be “dangerous” for advisers to be making recommendations for people to transfer their final salary pension based solely on the risk of their employer becoming insolvent.“There is a real risk that transfers are being made based on scaremongering, and that the members will ultimately have given up a secure income due to fears that never materialise,” he says.The early action by the FCA suggests that any problems with the marketing of pension transfers could be quickly nipped in the bud. But some observers have identified what they believe are a combination of factors pointing to a repeat of past mis-selling scandals.“We know from history when you combine commercial incentives and conflicts of interest with poor regulation of parts of the advice market, then things can go wrong,” says Mick McAteer, co-director of the Financial Inclusion Centre, an independent think-tank, and former FCA board member.“I hope we will not see a repeat of the worst excesses of the 1980s mis-selling scandal but the signs are worrying.”With the regulator taking a close look at the UK pension transfer market, one of the most controversial issues is the use by some advisers of a “contingent charging” price model, where the firm only earns money if the customer decides to cash out their pension fund.The typical fee for moving pensions is 1-3 per cent of the cash transferred, although charges as high as 7 per cent have been reported.On this basis, a £500,000 transfer offer would attract fees of between £5,000 to £15,000, though many advisory groups cap their charges, or scale down their fees for larger pots. The risk of such a practice is that it creates an unhealthy incentive for pension advisers to encourage their clients to transfer their fund.“It should not be allowed that the adviser gets ‘rewarded’ for a transfer — they should advise as a professional with no vested interest,” says Baroness Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister.The Financial Conduct Authority has acknowledged that contingency charging is riskier for consumers but has not banned the practice. “If a firm charges on a contingency basis this may give rise to a conflict of interest,” says the FCA. “We expect firms operating contingent charging to recognise this risk and have adequate controls in place to manage [it].”Tideway Investment Partners, an independent financial adviser that employs contingent charging, says it is popular with consumers and that many of its clients are not interested in the alternative arrangement that charges for advice by the hour.“Criticism of contingent charging is wholly misplaced and that in fact for many transactions, non-contingent fees are likely to deliver worse outcomes for customers,” says Peter Doherty, chief investment officer and managing partner with Tideway. “Does anyone think that fairness comes from charging someone £10,000 to make no change to their financial circumstances? That cannot be right.”"
22;AON;AON Plc;2017-09-17T04:01:03Z;Investment consultants brace for competition probe;Influencial but rarely scrutinised advice sector prepares to face the UK regulator;For almost two years, Willis Towers Watson, Mercer and Aon Hewitt have waged a private, and later public, battle to avoid a competition probe and to convince British regulators that all was well in the investment consultancy industry.The Big Three even joined forces to develop their own proposals to reform the industry as the UK financial watchdog circled the sector and concerns rose that investment consultants would face a full-blown antitrust investigation.It was a rare move by the fierce rivals. But the trio, which controls up to 80 per cent of the UK investment consultancy market by client assets, feared the effects an investigation would have, not just on their UK businesses but on their global operations.Their efforts, however, were in vain.On Thursday, the Financial Conduct Authority referred the investment consultancy and fiduciary management sectors to the Competition and Markets Authority, citing “ serious concerns” about how the industry operates.For the next 18 months, investment consultants and fiduciary managers will be subjected to tough scrutiny. Their entire business models will be put under a magnifying glass as the CMA carries out its far-reaching investigation.Many investment consultants have already begun preparations. Several people working at investment consultants in the UK say staff have been redeployed from various functions to work on the competition probe, while others are eyeing up recruiting top competition lawyers and other experts.“We have already assigned staff to the team. It is a tight, concentrated team. Informal discussions are already under way with the CMA,” says a senior figure who works for one of the Big Three.Another senior partner at a Big Three consultancy says: “We are ready.”But the intense review will be a huge change for an opaque sector that has largely avoided scrutiny, despite playing a vital role in the retirement incomes of hundreds of millions of people across the world. In the UK alone, they advice on assets of at least £1.6tn, providing pension funds and other investors with recommendations on which asset classes to invest in and which fund managers to use.Caitlin Wilkinson, director in the economics team at KPMG, the consultancy, says a competition probe is “an intense process” for companies under review.“There is a lot at stake for companies, because the CMA has a lot of broad powers,” she says.In the past, the UK competition authority has forced BAA, the airport group, to sell off various airports in order to break up a monopoly.Forced disposal of assets is a huge fear of the Big Three.Ms Wilkinson adds that companies will need to get senior members of staff involved. “There will be a lot of information requested from them. The initial stages will be information gathering. The CMA will use information from the FCA, but try to add to that,” she says.“There will be quite a few decision points, and it will require very in-depth responses. It is an intensive process and it’s something that needs very senior views.”There is no standardised framework to assess the quality of advice or help investors assess whether they are achieving value for moneyThe competition probe traces its roots back to November 2015, when the FCA announced a review of the asset management industry. As part of this, the regulator flagged that it would look at investment consultants.In its interim report, released last year, the financial watchdog signalled huge problems in the sector — not least that it found little evidence that investment consultants were good at doing their job. It warned that consultants, on average, were not able to identify managers that offer better returns to investors. They also failed to drive down pricing from asset managers.The FCA added: “The advice provided by investment consultants on asset allocation and investment strategy is significantly more influential in terms of outcomes than the advice on manager selection.“However, many institutional investors struggle to assess the performance of the advice they receive. There is no standardised framework to assess the quality of advice or help investors assess whether they are achieving value for money.”The FCA has also flagged several other concerns about the sector, including the dominance of the Big Three. It highlighted that many consultants had started offering their own asset management services, through a practice known as fiduciary management, which it raised as a potential conflict of interest.Lianne Craig, a partner at Hausfeld, the law firm, says it was particularly noteworthy that the FCA rejected the Big Three’s proposed package of remedies.“[This] may be indicative of the nature of the underlying conduct and a lack of regulatory confidence that such reform would be effective,” she says.“Whilst resources at the CMA are understood to be stretched, as at the FCA, the magnitude of the problems within the asset management industry mean that it will inevitably climb up the regulators’ priority list.”Publicly the three companies have welcomed the review and said they will work with the CMA. An individual at one of those consultants says that, since June, when the FCA’s final report on the asset management industry was released, he had expected the probe, but feared it would focus solely on the three largest companies or on fiduciary management only. He says the fact that the entire sector is under review is a relief.The review will be the first under new CMA procedures.In the past, the CMA released a report outlining its findings, but without suggesting remedies, after a year. But now the competition authority’s report will be released within 12 months and will include suggested remedies.This means that investment consultants, fiduciary managers, asset managers, pension funds and investors will need to be engaged in the process from the start if they want to have any sway over how the industry could change.“Companies have to be on the front foot, because the CMA will be thinking about problems very early,” says Ms Wilkinson.Despite the extra workload, some investment consultants are delighted about the investigation.Richard Dowell, co-head of clients at Cardano, an investment consultancy that oversees £40bn in assets, says: “We think the industry needs a fresh look. If you look at the funding position of pensions, it’s not working. It’s not a functional market.”Another senior member of a mid-sized investment consultancy adds: “[The probe] is not before time.”He believes his business has struggled to grow because of the dominance of the Big Three.Even without the probe, practices in the industry are changing.Consultants recently agreed to create a so-called standard to make it easier for investors to compare the performance of their fiduciary management businesses. Some hope that the sector will also be able to agree a performance standard for their investment advice, making it easier for clients to assess their value.Pension funds have already begun eyeing up new consultants. A survey by SEI, the fiduciary manager, found during the summer that 19 out of 35 pension plans polled plan to re-evaluate their relationship with their existing investment consultant.Alex Koriath, head of the European pension practice at Cambridge Associates, an investment consultant that has a large US business but which has struggled to crack the European market, says: “The FCA review and resulting public scrutiny have already raised awareness among many trustee boards of the issues identified.“For our firm, this has led to prospective clients asking us to take part in investment adviser review exercises,” he said.“This is encouraging and we believe that a continued shining of light on the issue will, in itself, be very helpful for increased competition.”A legislative cure / From Keith Wallace, London, UK
23;AON;AON Plc;2017-09-14T18:20:34Z;FCA/fund consultants: given leave to cleave;"Conflicts of interest run deep; structural remedies are needed";When a regulator switches on the lights in a dim corner of finance, it often finds an ethical line trampled out of shape by businesses hungry for fees. Reform tends to mean redrawing a tighter and brighter boundary for behaviour.In the case of the UK’s investment consultants, the Financial Conduct Authority found three powerful companies having a kickabout with the demarcation between consultancy and fiduciary. Aon Hewitt, Mercer and Willis Towers Watson dominate the business of advising pension scheme trustees on investment. They have used this dominance as an entrée into investment management itself.The FCA has referred the industry for a competition inquiry, finding little prospect that the market shares of the big three are likely to change. Proposals for greater transparency, both on fees and performance, should help, as might mandatory rotation of advisers. The three largest investment consultants advise on more than half the £1.6tn of assets in the UK alone, just when pension scheme underfunding problems are widespread and worsening. A competitive market might at least produce clearer winners and losers in the clients of advisers, rather than a drab oligopoly.Part of the industry’s proposed solution is to bar businesses from acting as asset manager and consultant for the same client. However, the Competition and Markets Authority should go further, taking the opportunity to impose structural remedies. Consultants should do one or the other, not both. A group that advises pension fund trustees on how to invest should not also be in the business of fiduciary management, where it gets paid to do the investing.The reason is the conflicts of interest in the existing structure runs deep, with an incentive to favour complexity. If a consultant sells high fee fund management services, for instance allocating money to hedge funds that require expensive monitoring, it has an incentive to push those investments. Complexity bias would still exist — all consultants like to create work for themselves — but the academic consensus is pension funds should diversify and cut costs using cheap index funds. Simple, cost-effective solutions do not generate high fees. An impartial adviser would not care. If the CMA was prepared to force BAA to sell three of its airports to increase competition, it should be prepared to break up the investment consultants.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

24;AON;AON Plc;2017-09-14T17:10:23Z;Investment consultants to face competition probe;FCA acts on concerns over industry advising on £1.6tn of pension and insurance assets;Investment consultants around the world were put on notice on Thursday after the UK’s financial watchdog launched a full-blown competition probe into an opaque industry that advises on more than £1.6tn of pension and insurance assets.The Financial Conduct Authority referred the entire investment consultancy and fiduciary management sector to the Competition and Markets Authority, the antitrust body, because of “serious concerns” about the industry.In a warning shot to Aon Hewitt, Mercer and Willis Towers Watson, global investment consultants that collectively control up to 80 per cent of the British market, the FCA said it feared competition in the sector was suffering because of “high levels of concentration”.The competition probe marks a big step up in scrutiny of a sector that helps control the retirement incomes of hundreds of millions of people across the UK and around the world.Christopher Woolard, FCA executive director strategy and competition, said it was a “significant step” for the regulator, marking the first time the FCA had referred an industry to the CMA since it gained new powers more than two years ago.“Investment consultancy services play a significant role advising pension fund trustees when they are procuring asset management services. It is important that trustees can be confident they are getting good quality advice and value for money from their investment consultants,” he said.Ashby Monk, research director of the Global Projects Center at Stanford University, said the review would be closely followed by regulators around the world, which are increasingly concerned about the growing influence of investment consultants.“There are inherent conflicts of interest in the business model of investment consultants,” he said.The FCA said a competition probe was merited because it found evidence of barriers to entry for new companies, as well as conflicts of interests as consultants increasingly offer asset management services.It also warned of a “weak demand side”, where pension fund trustees rely heavily on consultants but have limited ability to assess the quality of their work or compare services, which affects switching rates.The big three consultants said they would work with the CMA.Tim Giles, partner at Aon Hewitt, which advises on $4.2tn of assets globally, said: “Throughout this process we have made it clear that we want to achieve the best outcomes for our clients and scheme members, helping to drive down the costs and increase the value of asset management.”During the next 18 months, the CMA will carry out its investigation before reporting its findings. The authority has the power to impose a broad range of so-called remedies to improve competition, including forcing businesses to spin off divisions that the antitrust body believes hurt competition.Adrian Magnus, head of competition practice at Dentons, the law firm, said the probe was likely to have big consequences. “The spotlight is on investment consultants. They are likely to get a greater deal of scrutiny and criticism than they have done before,” he said.“Business practices that have been accepted for years could face criticism. That creates a great degree of uncertainty for an industry and potential for change, even quite radical change.”The referral is the latest attempt by the FCA to show its teeth as it attempts to improve practices in the fund industry. In an extensive review of the asset management sector in June, the FCA raised concerns about the investment ecosystem, from consultants to fund houses to platforms that sell investment products.Consultants typically provide pension funds and other investors with advice on which asset classes to invest in and the best fund managers to use. In recent years, they have also begun managing assets for clients through a service known as fiduciary management, a practice that has proven contentious.But the sector has faced criticism for opaque practices. Unlike fund managers, they typically do not publish their performance records, making it difficult for clients to assess the value they add. There are also concerns that consultants have failed to stop the rapid rise of pension deficits in the UK.Bob Campion, senior portfolio manager and head of fiduciary management at Charles Stanley, said the review was a “much needed step in the right direction”.“If this market review is able to shine a clear light and introduce sensible changes that improve consumer confidence it will be good news for the pensions industry,” he said.A senior figure in the asset management industry, who did not want to be named, said consultants had for too long escaped proper scrutiny, especially compared to the heavily regulated fund industry.“It would be good to have a level playing field,” she added.Now that the UK Competition and Markets Authority has been asked to probe the investment consultancy sector, it will conduct a full-blown investigation that is expected to last until March 2019.Ahead of Thursday’s referral from the Financial Conduct Authority, the CMA has already held informal discussions with some of the companies involved about what data they will be required to provide.It then sent official requests for information on Thursday to a range of medium and large-size investments consultants and fiduciary managers.The CMA is promising a “bespoke market survey” and a “significant economic analysis” but it has not yet published specific guidance on the inquiry’s focus, though this is expected in the next few weeks.It has also not yet given details on who will lead the investigation, other than to say it will comprise a full team of economists, lawyers, other financial experts. If it concludes that there has been abuse of market power, it would then also add specialists in remedies.The Competition and Markets Authority is a relatively new regulator, set up in 2013. Two of its previous high-profile investigations into retail banking and the energy markets came in for heavy criticism over their recommendations on how to fix markets and improve competition.In November 2016, Andrew Tyrie, then chairman of Parliament’s Treasury select committee, said the CMA had “dropped the catch” by not being tough enough in its proposals for reforming high-street banking, published earlier that year.The authority, which carried out a two-year probe that cost about £5m, was attacked by critics for not proposing radical measures to break the dominance of the current-account market by four big banks, and for failing to cap overdraft fees as many observers had hoped.In its two-year investigation into the energy market, meanwhile, the CMA issued preliminary findings saying that companies had overcharged households £1.2bn a year and small and medium-sized businesses an extra £500m a year.This prompted a furious reaction from some of the biggest names in the industry and the CMA watered down its final proposals when they were issued in June 2016 — though one member of the panel then refused to put his name to the final report.
25;AON;AON Plc;2017-09-14T06:35:16Z;FCA refers investment consultants for competition probe over ‘serious concerns’;;The UK’s anti-trust body will carry out a full-blown competition probe into investment consultants after the financial watchdog found far-reaching problems in the powerful industry that advises on £1.6tn of pension and insurance assets.The Financial Conduct Authority said today that it was referring the investment consultancy sector to the Competition and Markets Authority, the anti-trust body. It is the first time that the FCA has referred an industry to the CMA since it gained new powers more than two years ago.The competition probe marks a seminal moment for the institutional advice sector, which has largely flown under the radar of regulators despite yielding huge power over the retirement incomes of millions of people across the UK.The FCA said it was concerned the investment consultant market was too concentrated. The watchdog said the so-called big three – Aon Hewitt, Mercer and Willis Towers Watson – account for up to 80 per cent of market.It also warned of a lack of transparency in the industry and high barriers to entry, and expressed concerns about conflicts of interests as consultant increasingly offer asset management services.Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said it was a “significant step” for the regulator to recommend a competition probe.“We have serious concerns about this market and believe that the CMA is best placed to undertake this work,” he said, adding:Investment consultancy services play a significant role advising pension fund trustees when they are procuring asset management services. It is important that trustees can be confident they are getting good quality advice and value for money from their investment consultants.Earlier this year, the Big Three consultants attempted to see off a competition probe by suggesting a series of reforms for the industry. But the FCA rejected their proposals, saying a full-blown probe was vital for the proper functioning of the sector.
26;AON;AON Plc;2017-08-10T06:07:42Z;Aegon sells Irish business to Athene for €180m;;Dutch insurer Aegon has sold its Irish business to Athene, a US-based pensions and life insurance provider, for about €180m.The move is the latest in a series of disposals as chief executive Alex Wynaendts streamlines the business. Last year it sold £9bn of UK annuities, while earlier this year it sold two large US run-off businesses to Wilton Re, releasing $700m of capital. On Tuesday this week it announced the sale of a Dutch financial advisory group it owned to Aon for €295m.The Irish business sells a number of offshore investment products, mainly to UK clients. Its sale will create a book loss of €125m for Aegon but is not expected to have a major impact on the group’s future earnings.Athene, which floated in New York late last year, has plans to make acquisitions in Europe where life insurers are under pressure because of low interest rates.Athene was advised by Fenchurch Advisory Partners.News of the sale came as Aegon announced results for the first half of the year. Underlying profits increased 23 per cent to €535m because of lower claims. Fee income rose thanks to strong equity markets.Aegon also said on Thursday that it would inject €1bn into its Dutch subsidiary to improve its capital position.Mr Wynaendts said:Today, we are also announcing a range of measures that significantly increase our solvency ratio, including a capital injection of €1bn in Aegon the Netherlands and agreement with our regulator on a number of outstanding solvency-related topics.These measures, together with the recently announced strategic divestments, increase our financial flexibility, strengthen our capital position and improve the outlook for capital generation – all of which give us confidence in our ability to return €2.1bn to shareholders over the period 2016 to 2018.
27;AON;AON Plc;2017-07-03T03:00:45Z;Investment consultants plan to fight UK competition probe;UK regulator rejects reforms proposed by Aon Hewitt, Willis Towers Watson and Mercer;The world’s biggest investment consultants plan to fight against a full-blown competition probe in the UK after the country’s financial watchdog suggested their proposed measures to reform the £1.6tn sector did not go far enough.On Wednesday, the Financial Conduct Authority said it would provisionally reject proposals put forward by Aon Hewitt, Willis Towers Watson and Mercer, which collectively control up to 71 per cent of investment consultancy revenues in the UK.The regulator is now consulting the wider industry on the trio’s suggested reforms, which include proposals for mandatory tenders and greater information on manager performance. It will make a final decision on whether to refer the influential sector to the Competition and Markets Authority, the antitrust body, in September.But the measures have been met with disdain from rivals, which accused the trio of acting like “poachers turned gamekeepers”.John Walbaum, head of investment consulting at Hymans Robertson, the UK’s fourth-largest consultancy in terms of revenues, said a lot of the undertakings from the Big Three are “not daft”. “But it doesn’t feel right that they are dictating rules that could affect the entire industry.”The three largest investment consultants, which advise pensions across the world on how to invest the savings of millions of people, plan to use the next month to convince the UK regulator and rival investment consultants to back their proposals, known as UILs, or undertakings in lieu.Andrew Kirton, chief investment officer at Mercer, the world’s largest investment consultant, with $9tn of assets under advice globally, said the company would work with the FCA to resolve its concerns. He said a competition probe would create uncertainty for clients.“We are hoping that the other investment consultants and fiduciary managers and broader industry read the undertaking and think about the significance and what it means for them. If logic were to prevail, I think there is a good chance the undertakings would be accepted [and a competition probe avoided],” he said.Andy Cox, chief executive of Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Aon Hewitt, added: “We look forward to opening the dialogue on these measures to other industry participants. We are confident that the UILs represent best practice.”The Big Three are keen to avoid a referral to the antitrust authority, as the 18-month competition probe process is expensive and time consuming. There are also fears that the increased scrutiny could prompt other regulators around the world to take a closer look at the sector.Although largely unknown outside the investment industry, consultants play a powerful role in helping pension funds, insurers and charities decide how to invest trillions of dollars of cash globally.But despite their huge influence, the FCA said in its landmark study on the asset management industry that it was difficult for investors to assess the quality of advice provided by consultants. It also flagged concerns about conflicts of interest in the industry, opaque fees and the dominance of the Big Three, arguing competition might not be working effectively.Mr Kirton said the trio’s package of measures would “transform” competition for the industry. The measures include mandatory tenders for both advice and fiduciary management, a service where pension funds entrust consultancies to oversee their assets.The trio also proposed that if a fiduciary arm were bidding for new business, its consultancy division should not handle that tender process.Odi Lahav, chief executive of Allenbridge, the investment adviser that is part of MJ Hudson, the asset management consultancy, called for a full competition review, arguing this is a “sensible first step in identifying systemic biases or market distortions”.“Given the influential role that investment consultants play in how institutional capital is allocated and managed in the UK, our view is that addressing issues of effective competition, transparency and conflict of interest is paramount for a healthy asset management sector, and critical for better investor outcomes,” he added.Danny Vassiliades, head of investment consulting at Punter Southall, added that he wanted a full-scale competition probe. “In our view, there is a clear requirement for remedies to increase competition, with the industry currently dominated by three big providers.”
28;AON;AON Plc;2017-06-25T04:00:45Z;Investment consultants and fund managers agree reporting standard;Influential advisers to pension funds back new way to publish performance data;Willis Towers Watson, Aon Hewitt, Mercer and 10 other influential advisers to pension funds have pledged to report investment performance in a consistent way after the UK financial watchdog warned of “opaque” practises across the sector.The 13 companies, which also include BlackRock and Schroders, have backed a new industry standard that sets out how performance data should be reported for fiduciary management, whereby pension funds entrust an investment consultancy or specialised fund manager to oversee their assets.The fiduciary managers’ support of the standard comes just days before the Financial Conduct Authority is due to release the findings of its investigation of the asset management market, including an in-depth assessment of how investment consultants operate.In its interim report last year, the FCA was deeply critical of fiduciary managers, warning that “performance and fees of fiduciary managers appear to be among the most opaque parts of the asset management value chain”.The new standard, which is due to be rolled out in early 2018, marks the first time fiduciary managers will report performance in a consistent manner, making it easier for pension funds to compare different companies.Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the consultancy, says a unified standard is “long overdue”. “Hopefully, the new one being rolled out fills the void by providing an apples-with-apples comparison.The sector will see a regulatory creep“But whether it will address concerns about the perceived conflicts of interest in this sector is open to question. It is doubtful if this single measure will placate the FCA. The sector will see a regulatory creep.”Fiduciary management has grown rapidly since the financial crisis, as pension funds sought help running money amid low interest rates and volatile markets. According to a 2016 survey by KPMG, the professional services firm, the sector has grown for nine years in a row in the UK to reach £123bn in assets under management.It is also highly profitable. The FCA found that on a per-client basis, fiduciary management generates more than twice the revenues that traditional advisory services generate.But in its report, the watchdog warned investors struggled to compare fiduciary managers.“A lack of publicly available, compared performance information on fiduciary managers . . . makes it hard for investors to assess value,” the FCA said.Peter Dorward, managing director at IC Select, a company that helps pension funds choose fiduciary managers, says investment consultancies and other providers of these services often “cherry pick” the most flattering performance figures when providing data to pension funds.“[Pension fund] trustees have almost been working blind [when assessing performance]. They were at the end of cherry-picked information. This [new] standard puts the trustees in control. That has to be good news for trustees,” says Mr Dorward, who also chairs the fiduciary management performance standard steering group, which is behind the new initiative.According to IC Select, fiduciary managers often report returns and risk information over different time periods, making comparisons difficult. Some fiduciary managers will highlight good short-term performance, while hiding a poor longer-term record.Anthony Webb, head of fiduciary management at KPMG, adds: “There was no real consistency in how fiduciary managers chose to report their performance data. That led to the ability for companies to report their data in the most beneficial way for them. [The new standard] is the most promising initiative we have in the industry to improve transparency.”For several years, there have been calls for fiduciary managers to publish their performance figures, a move the industry has resisted. Plans for the standard were put in place a year ago, but Mr Dorward said the FCA’s report propelled efforts.“The FCA report has brought the issue under more scrutiny,” he says.Under the new framework, a pension fund that is hiring a fiduciary manager should receive performance data that is reported in line with the standard. However, that information will not necessarily be publicly available.This is not about trying to produce league tables of fiduciary managers. It is about clients seeing performance calculated on a consistent basis“This is not about trying to produce league tables of fiduciary managers. It is about clients seeing performance calculated on a consistent basis,” says Mr Dorward.But fiduciary managers could face further scrutiny on Wednesday, when the FCA unveils its final report on the asset management industry. The regulator has already said it wants greater clarity on fees and performance, but it is not yet clear if the watchdog will take any measures to enforce this.Mr Dorward says the FCA is aware of the new standard and requested further information on it after the publication of its interim report. “We think this goes a long way to satisfying the FCA around the publication of data and transparency,” he says.Hannah Simons, fiduciary manager at Schroders, the UK fund house, adds: “Greater transparency across the fiduciary management industry is vital, as it enables trustees to make better-informed decisions. We are fully supportive of this standard.”The standard was developed by IC Select, along with a steering committee comprised of law firms, consultants and advisers to pension funds.Cardano, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, JLT Investment Solutions, Kempen Capital Management, Legal & General Investment Management, P-Solve, Russell Investments and SEI, which all offer fiduciary services, have backed the project, according to IC Select.The 13 fiduciary managers will report performance data to 468 investors, which IC Select says account for 98 per cent of the market.
29;AON;AON Plc;2017-06-19T14:46:48Z;UK pension transfers: mis-selling risks loom;Parallels may be teased from any number of controversies that define retail finance eras;Big UK companies have been moaning about staff pensions for years. Low interest rates have inflated the liabilities and funding costs of old defined benefit schemes. Now the hearts of finance directors have been gladdened by a trade-off: a stampede by members to swap guaranteed pensions for fat transfer payments. In just six months, one unnamed financial services group has shed liabilities of £100m, a tenth of its total, according to Aon Hewitt, a pension consultancy.Aon believes the expertise of financial types inclines them to quit legacy workplace schemes. The yield on 10-year gilts, a benchmark for low-risk returns, is a rock bottom 1.06 per cent. That means transfer values to a personal plan may be 30 times more than the annual pension the workplace scheme would eventually pay. Such bounty may not recur.Moreover, transferees can dip into the nest egg from age 55 and leave the unspent balance in their will. They shoulder investment risk. But they dodge the danger of the employer going bust, as store chain BHS famously did, which could result in lower benefits from an industry-funded relief fund.Employers are keen for scheme members to understand the potential advantages, sometimes subsidising financial advice sessions. They could have an ulterior motive. Transfer values are high. But they are sometimes “best estimates”, which may be less than the accounting liability, which must be “prudent”. As a result, big transfer campaigns may helpfully shrink anticipated costs, bolstering forecast profits.A mis-selling scandal may ensue if transfers are promoted too forcefully. Hymans Robertson, a benefits consultancy, warns of similarities with alleged mis-sales of annuities. Parallels may be teased from any number of controversies. These now define recent eras in UK retail finance in the way monarchs’ reigns subdivide the distant past. A new disaster is always coming down the track.Lex values readers’ views. Is it right to take a fat transfer and give up a guaranteed pension? Could transfer campaigns rebound on big employers? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.
30;AON;AON Plc;2017-06-19T04:07:15Z;UK financial services group cuts pension liabilities 10% in 6 months;Unprecedented drop at unnamed company as staff jump to cash in final salary schemes;A financial services company has reduced its pension liabilities by a tenth, or more than £100m, in just six months in a dramatic example of British workers increasingly leaping at the offer to cash in their final salary benefits.Liabilities on the unnamed company’s £1.5bn defined benefit pension scheme fell at a pace not seen before in a UK company, according to Aon, the pension consultancy.The revelation comes as companies sponsoring traditional “final salary” pension schemes report record levels of requests from members looking to cash in their pension benefits.A survey of more than 800 financial advisers by Royal London, the insurer, found that there had been a 50 per cent rise in the number of transfers out of final salary pensions last year, with the most common transfer value being between £250,000 and £500,000.At the same time, the Financial Conduct Authorityis taking a keener interest in the advice given to those making such transfers, prompted by concerns about the mis-selling of financial products.Defined benefit pensions pay a secure income for life, typically rising with inflation. But non-retired members are being tempted by high offers from schemes to trade their future pensions for a lump sum today.Aon, which administers pensions for 1m members in 205 defined-benefit schemes, said the number of pension transfers had increased six-fold since 2014, the last year before pension rules were relaxed to give savers more flexibility over how they spend their funds.“There’s been an increased awareness among members of the high transfers being offered,” said Ben Roe, partner with Aon Hewitt. “For example, we have seen a 15-times increase in the number of transfer offers made in excess of £500,000, particularly to members aged over 55.”Mr Roe said the banks and insurers were seeing the highest levels of pension outflows. “We typically find that pension schemes in this sector are better funded than average, and all else being equal, this tends to lead to higher transfer values,” said Mr Roe.Around 80,000 defined benefit transfers took place over the year to the end of March, according to the Pension Regulator, with some forecasting this figure will rise further if trustees begin to promote more widely the option to transfer.Transfer offers are being encouraged by low gilt yields, which have the effect of inflating the cost of future pension promises. That, in turn, means higher sums offered to those removing their share of pension risk today from the scheme.Increased transfer activity has taken place against the backdrop of stubbornly high pension deficits for the majority of the UK’s 5,800 private sector defined benefit schemes, which face a combined funding shortfall of about £510bn.Consultants said some companies were using transfer exercises as a cheaper way of reducing pension risk rather than offloading the scheme to an insurance company through a “buy out”.“For those companies who have got an end game mapped out it is far more efficient to encourage transfers than it is to buy out the benefits,” said Charles Cowling, partner with JLT Benefits.The Pension Regulator’s current advice to members is that most are better suited to keeping a defined benefit pension, given the guaranteed benefits it provides to the member, spouses and dependants.The sharp uptick in transfer activity has coincided with increased interventions by the FCA, which in recent months has removed advice permissions from several firms operating in the pension transfer market.“It is important advisers continue to assess each case on its own merits as defined benefit transfers will not be suitable for all clients,” said Old Mutual Wealth, a wealth manager.
31;AON;AON Plc;2017-06-15T17:44:14Z;US workforce: paying young Americans to learn the right skills;With more than 6m jobs unfilled, business is becoming the driving force behind a rethink of how to organise training;When Levi Hall first saw the advertisement for a 12-week technology training programme that offered a stipend to students with only a high-school qualification and helped place them with a decently paid full-time job at the end of course, he thought it was a scam.“They are going to teach you, pay you, give you a credential and then help you get a job? I thought for sure this is too good to be true,” says the 25-year-old, who was working in a minimum wage clerical job in Florida when he applied for the course. “When I filled out the application, just to be safe, I didn’t put in my real social security number.”Several of the other young participants and graduates of the programme, run by consulting firm McKinsey at a training centre on the campus of Florida State College in Jacksonville, laugh knowingly. Like Mr Hall, they all graduated from high school.But thanks to challenges such as an inability to pay for or complete a four-year college degree, secondary education that did not yield any marketable skills or personal problems such as single parenthood or a run-in with the law, they belonged to the growing group of unemployed or underemployed US workers. Nearly one in six American workers fits that description.Yet as participants in McKinsey’s “Generation” scheme, which brings together employers and educators to train workers for jobs in high-growth areas like technology, healthcare and customer service, they all have full-time jobs, many of them at top national and regional companies. Nearly 1,000 others have gone through the US programme, adding to the 12,000 graduates globally.“I wish I would have gone to a high school that taught me actual skills that would get me a job,” says Mr Hall, who earned a stackable computer programming certificate that qualified him for a better paid job in the IT department of a large regional healthcare practice. “But they don’t really exist any more. I felt like this was my last shot to make myself more employable.”***McKinsey’s initiative, which started about two years ago, has become the largest cross-border youth employment programme, which says a lot about the dysfunctional state of labour markets.For years, a gap has been widening between the skills that companies need and those that workers have and educators teach. This is true globally — 40 per cent of McKinsey’s clients say the skills gap is a key reason for job vacancies — but is particularly so in the US, where the lack of European-style vocational training programmes, social safety nets or extended family support has made it particularly difficult for many workers to learn the right skills that better jobs require.Harvard academics have attributed as many as one-third of the US jobs lost during the great recession not to declining demand but to the skills gap. Business leaders have complained about the lack of middle-market technical skills in particular, as too many students graduate with heavy debts and useless degrees — at least in terms of employability.The US is suffering a youth unemployment crisis, with rates in double figures nearly 10 years on from the financial crisis — not to mention record levels of long-term unemployment, particularly among displaced older men in the rust belt. This was one driver of the populist politics that led to the election of Donald Trump and the popularity of Bernie Sanders among Democratic voters.Yet more than 6m jobs remain unfilled. To get them, most workers will need a qualification between a high-school qualification and a costly four-year college education. There will be 55m job openings in the economy in the decade ending 2020, with 65 per cent of all jobs requiring some post-secondary education, projections by the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University show.Nearly two-thirds of those jobs will require some post-secondary education. But the majority of the fastest-growing categories will be those in the “sub-BA” market, which do not necessarily require a degree.This is where programmes like Generation, as well as other public and private partnerships that push vocational training as a stepping stone to greater social mobility and earning power, come to the fore.“Aside from countries like Germany and Switzerland, workforce training has been viewed in much of the world, and certainly in America, as a poor stepchild to a four-year college degree,” says Mona Mourshed, head of McKinsey’s education practice and president of Generation.In the US, this bias has a long history: since the 1960s, vocational education has been seen as a dumping ground for less fortunate students. Some worried that it could result in class- or race-based tracking.Yet given the dismal state of secondary and tertiary education in the US today — nearly one in three high school students take a degree, a tenth graduate from a two-year associates programme and a $1.4tn student debt bubble restrains consumption and economic growth — a fresh approach to vocational training is clearly needed.On Thursday, President Trump signed an executive order to expand apprenticeships and improve training programmes. He has been pushed on the issue by his daughter Ivanka and a number of Fortune 500 chief executives including IBM’s Ginni Rometty and Dow’s Andrew Liveris. Mr Trump has talked up workforce training as an alternative to a degree, and visited a training programme in Wisconsin.Ms Trump and Alexander Acosta, labour secretary, have spent time in Germany studying its vocational training model, which has helped bolster wages and employment relative to other rich economies, and would like to bring aspects of the model to the US.There are 500,000 official apprenticeships in the US. The White House wants to make it easier to expand the labour department’s model, which has been successfully deployed in the construction and building trade industries for years. Many manufacturing, technology and healthcare companies would like to run similar schemes geared towards their industries.It is noteworthy that, while unions pushed the previous wave of interest in vocational training decades ago, this time it is employers. Half of the Fortune 20 companies run some type of programme, including major technology companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and Aon.Such employers have realised that not only is such training necessary to create a 21st century workforce but it can also significantly reduce turnover and recruitment costs, which can run into the thousands of dollars per worker even for entry level positions.Aside from encouraging private sector efforts, the Trump administration wants to merge the 43 federal workplace training programmes that sit in 13 agencies and represent nearly $17bn in spending into a single programme within the labour department. This highlights the fragmented and varied nature of vocational skills training. Public spending in the sub-BA market is spread across 50 states that have a multitude of systems, measures for success and means of collecting and sharing data.Numerous private sector efforts make up the bulk of the $300bn-a-year market. There are small, high-end programmes, such as Siemens’ gas turbine apprenticeship in North Carolina that lures students from local schools into factory work by investing $175,000 in training them over three years. Public-private partnerships such as IBM’s Pathways in Technology schools aim to reinvent secondary and tertiary education.***It is a complex arena but lessons can be taken from some of the most successful and long running programmes in areas such as building trades and manufacturing: pay people while they learn, make sure that broadly accepted credentials and jobs are waiting for them at the end, and keep the skillset applicable to real work and different employers.“Sector-based training works best when you have an employer who partners a community college to create a training programme,” says Harry Holtzer, a labour economist and professor of public policy at Georgetown.States such as Wisconsin, with concentrated manufacturing sectors, have done well on that score. The much-copied Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, which has been running for more than 20 years, brings together large employers such as Harley-Davidson with smaller local components firms, community colleges and unions.Together they create advanced manufacturing programmes that allow workers to move in and out of different companies through the course of seasonal business cycles. Workers earn while they learn, gaining experience from full-time yearly employment in a regional industry, rather than a single company.This offsets risk for workers and companies, and keeps skill levels high in ways that mimic the German model.“You have a company like Harley, which might need a seasonal workforce for six to nine months, but they have a bunch of suppliers that need skilled people too,” says Mark Kessenrich, president of WRTP. “We work with the local educators to create training programmes and recruiting programmes that serve them both.“It works really well within an increasingly just-in-time manufacturing industry,” he adds.Encouraging the broader adoption of manufacturing-based apprenticeships like these will be a big focus for the administration as it tries to cater to the needs of the workers in a region such as the rust belt that helped vote the president into office.Yet there may be even more growth for skills training in services, and among the most vulnerable in society, like those being served by Generation. Not only is that where the greatest need is, it is also where the fastest growing job categories are.Generation trainees like the ones in Jacksonville may start low on the ladder, but the investment of even 12 weeks of training pays dividends for both companies, which see significant increases in retention and thus lower recruiting costs.The workers see an average fourfold increase in their weekly wages on completing the programme. They are statistically more likely to go on and finish further training and education.Mr Hall is looking to attend night classes at a community college. “I’d like to get a degree eventually,” he says. “But not if I have to go into a lot of debt. Right now, I’ve got someone who’s paying me to learn.”Most employers believe that skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or stem subjects, will be crucial for the workforce. But many companies think it is crucial that workers have a strong basic liberal arts education to go alongside the high-tech workplace skills that will be required for the “new collar” jobs of the future.That’s the idea behind P-tech, or the “Pathways in Technology” high schools that were set up in 2011 as a partnership between IBM and New York City Public Schools.The model, which has since spread into 57 schools in six states serving 20,000 students, as well as being launched overseas in Australia and Morocco, aims to reinvent secondary education by giving graduates not only four years of high school but a two-year associates’ degree, plus work experience along the way.“Six is the new four,” says Stan Litow, P-tech’s founder, noting that you need at least a two-year college degree to guarantee something more than a $15-an-hour future. P-tech graduates are first in line for positions at IBM and dozens of other blue-chip partners like SAP, Cisco and Global Foundries where many have already done their internships. It is a model that had broad support from Barack Obama, former president, as well as President Donald Trump, both of whom view it as a template for reinventing secondary education.Gabriel Rosa, a 19-year-old who graduated from P-tech in Brooklyn a year ago after he completed his six-year programme in four years, is a good advertisement. He is now employed in a well paid job as an interface designer for IBM in New York City, while taking night classes to complete a four-year degree in computer science. “I feel like I’ve gotten where I wanted to be so much faster than I would have otherwise,” he says.

Companies now face a fine of as much as 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover if they are found to have breached competition rules.While the FCA declined to comment, Marsh said in a statement on Friday that the probe was a civil competition investigation, and that “the FCA indicated that it had reasonable grounds for suspecting that Marsh Limited and others have been sharing competitively sensitive information within the aviation (re) insurance sector”. It added that it was fully co-operating with the regulator.JLT said in a statement that it was “participating in this investigation and confirms that JLT Specialty is providing all appropriate assistance to the FCA”.Aon said aviation broking represented just $100m of its global revenues and was “working diligently” with the FCA.Willis Towers Watson said it was co-operating with the watchdog and that “the focus of the investigation relates to and is limited to aviation broking”. UIB confirmed that it is also under investigation and co-operating with the FCA.Insurance Insider first reported that the brokers had been raided, adding that the airline business often shares information between brokers and underwriters, including the value of fleets and specific hulls of planes.“Information sharing can often be an issue in competition investigations,” said Adrian Magnus, a competition lawyer at Dentons. “What this investigation does is send a message that the FCA’s powers are there and likely to be exercised; those powers are hefty and can result in significant negative publicity and significant punishment down the line.”While the aviation probe is the first FCA competition investigation where details have become public, the watchdog has other efforts under way. Its head of competition said in a speech last year that the regulator had launched its first investigation under its competition powers. No details or companies were revealed on that separate probe.The FCA has both competition and financial regulatory powers, which gives it an advantage over other antitrust regulators. While most watchdogs can offer companies immunity from fines if they are the first to blow the whistle on cartels, the FCA can also draw on regulations that require financial companies to disclose any potentially compromising behaviour to the watchdog."

34;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

36;AON;AON Plc;2017-02-26T05:02:06Z;Asset managers turn against investment consultants;UK regulator seeks more control over ‘opaque’ and ‘uncompetitive’ advisory industry;Asset managers have called for stricter oversight of the UK’s hugely influential investment consulting industry after Britain’s financial watchdog warned of conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency in the sector.The Financial Conduct Authority expressed concerns about “opaque fees” and a lack of competition in the institutional advice sector in a damning interim report on the asset management industry last November.The regulator said it was considering seeking more regulatory powers over investment consultants, who advise on where £1.6tn worth of people’s savings should be invested. The FCA expressed concerns that a “very important part of the asset management value chain” is currently largely unregulated.The FCA’s stance has been backed by asset managers, trade bodies and some consultants, which claim greater regulation of the institutional advice sector is vital to improve services and investment returns for pension funds and other big investors.The Investment Association, the trade body for fund houses in the UK, said in its response to the FCA report: “Investment consultants play a central role in the institutional asset management market and the quality of their advice is likely to be crucial in determining outcomes for institutional investors.“Ensuring that this element of the investment value chain works well for institutional investors is therefore highly important.”The trade body added that it “strongly” supported proposals to bring institutional investment advice into the FCA’s regulatory perimeter and backed proposals to refer the investment consulting industry for investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority, a government department responsible for strengthening business competition.The FCA’s spotlight on the investment consulting market comes as concerns mount about the influence of the sector.In its 208-page report, the watchdog said consultants, on average, were unable to identify managers that offer better returns to investors and did not appear to have encouraged a rise in price competition between asset managers.But investment consultants wield huge power in the UK due to rules that require pension funds to seek investment advice. With the exception of the largest schemes, most pension funds turn to investment consultants for this advice.Consultants typically focus on helping pension schemes make decisions around asset allocation and risk, as well as suggesting suitable fund managers. In some cases, pension funds and other investors will entrust a consultant with the management of their assets, under a model known as fiduciary management.Because consultants in the UK act as gatekeepers to more than a trillion pounds in assets, investment managers have traditionally been reluctant to condemn them publicly. In private, however, fund houses have been highly critical of the sector, especially its push into fiduciary management.This move into fiduciary management has meant consultants are often in direct competition with the asset managers they are hired to assess independently.The FCA said: “We heard a persistent concern from asset managers and institutional investors that once an investment consultant has developed its own product offerings, it will recommend its in-house propositions even if there are better investment products offered elsewhere.”According to KPMG, the professional services company, three-quarters of all fiduciary mandates went to consultants last year.One senior executive at a UK asset manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, says: “The problem [with consultants offering fiduciary management] is it creates a massive conflict of interest.“[The consultants] have some clients who want to make their own investment decisions, but the consultant wants to push them down the route of fiduciary because it is hugely profitable.”According to the FCA, the value of assets managed by investment consultants under a fiduciary arrangement has tripled in the past five years to almost £60bn.While dwarfed in size when compared with the £1.6tn in assets under advice, the regulator said that on a per-client basis, fiduciary management generates much higher revenues than traditional advisory business.The FCA said that of consultants that offer fiduciary management services, 41 per cent of their combined advisory and fiduciary management revenues came from fiduciary management, despite representing just 4 per cent of assets under advice.The regulator also warned that performance and fees of fiduciary managers appear to be among the most opaque parts of the asset management value chain.John Walbaum, head of investment consultancy at Hymans Robertson, an investment consultancy that does not offer fiduciary management, says: “We would be in favour of more separation of the two roles [fiduciary and investment consulting]. We think these conflicts are unnecessary and they are too big.”The UK’s largest consultants, Willis Towers Watson, Aon Hewitt and Mercer, said on Friday said they had put forward a series of proposals to the FCA that are aimed at improving competitiveness and transparency in the investment consultancy and fiduciary management industries.Over the coming months, the UK’s financial watchdog will have to decide whether to officially ask for regulatory powers over consultants.Redington, one of the UK’s five largest consultants, backs this approach. It says: “We believe it makes sense to bring those areas of advice that are most meaningful to pension fund outcomes under the FCA regulatory perimeter.”Patrick Disney, European managing director of the institutional group for SEI Investments, a fiduciary manager, argues that more efforts need to be made to ringfence consultancy work from fiduciary management. SEI stopped offering consultancy services in favour of focusing on fiduciary management because of concerns about conflicts between the two services.He says: “More regulation is a logical next step, particularly if you have [companies] offering both [fiduciary and investment consulting] services.”The IA says: “We are particularly keen that, where consultants provide asset management products and services, they compete on a level playing field with asset managers, both in terms of regulatory oversight and client scrutiny of their performance.”The FCA will also have to decide whether to push the antitrust regulator to carry out a probe into the sector.In its report, it raised concerns about the dominant “big three” investment consultants: Willis Towers Watson, Aon Hewitt and Mercer. It estimates that the trio collectively control 60 per cent of the market and take an estimated 71 per cent of revenues, down from 78 per cent in 2011.Consultants have been quick to dismiss suggestions that the sector should be referred to the antitrust authority because of a lack of competition, arguing there has been an improvement over the past decade.But others are less sure. The Transparency Task Force, a campaign group, believes a probe by the antitrust authority is a “good idea”.“It will help to shine a light on the workings of the investment consultancy sector and it therefore has the potential identify and deal with issues that prohibit the efficient workings of the market, including conflicts of interest.”It also backed more regulatory oversight of consultants. “The fact that the institutional investment consulting sector has not been regulated to date may explain many of the suboptimal market practices that have been taking place,” the group argues.Fund managers and consultants have a reputation for enjoying a game of golf together, but potentially not for much longer.Last year, the UK’s financial watchdog warned that there is a strong culture of gifts and hospitality in the investment consultant industry, which could be seen to influence the ratings consultants give to asset managers.In a far-reaching report on the asset management industry, the Financial Conduct Authority said there was no evidence that consultants receiving hospitality or gifts from fund houses benefited the end investors, arguing that it introduced conflicts of interest instead.The FCA found there was a “statistically positive” relationship between the number of high ratings given to an asset manager and the level of gifts and hospitality received by the consultant.The regulator said there were a number of factors that could explain the increased level of positive ratings, such as consultants spending more time with fund managers when considering their strategies. But it added: “We cannot rule out the possibility that consultants may have been influenced by their acceptance of gifts and hospitality.”While the watchdog acknowledged that the value of gifts and hospitality accepted by consultants had fallen in recent years, it said it planned to investigate the possibility further that such benefits were influencing consultants’ ratings of asset managers.

The business it has sold administers employee benefits programmes and other HR work. It made adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) of $487m last year, giving the disposal an ebitda multiple of just under 10 times.It bought the HR operation as part of the $4.9bn Hewitt acquisition of 2010, although since then much of Hewitt’s advisory business has been integrated into other parts of Aon.Aon said that it would use the proceeds for a mixture of acquisitions and share buybacks.Greg Case, Aon chief executive, said:This transaction reinforces Aon’s position as the leading, global professional services firm focused on risk, retirement and health.The sale of our outsourcing platform creates incremental capital to strengthen growth in core operations, and accelerates the pursuit of inorganic growth opportunities that address emerging client needs, similar to recent acquisitions in cyber risk advisory and health brokerage solutions.
38;AON;AON Plc;2016-11-11T05:30:19Z;Best of Money: Lifetime Isa — savings magic or future scandal?;Our panel debates whether the Lisa is the answer to the savings crisis;"Millions of cash-strapped younger savers will soon be offered a new cash boost from the government to buy their first home or build a retirement nest egg.From April 2017, under-40s can open a new Lifetime Isa which will pay a government bonus of up to £1,000 a year on savings they make. These can be used towards buying their first home, or accessed tax free after age 60.Already predicted to be wildly popular with younger savers, experts warn that under-40s who opt for the Lisa could end up losing out. The generous 25 per cent bonus might be the incentive young people need to kick-start their retirement savings — but will its introduction tempt them to abandon more valuable workplace pensions, sowing the seeds of a future mis-selling scandal?And how do young people themselves view the latest addition to the Isa family? It might make pensions savings easier for them to understand, but critics argue that — as with pensions tax relief — the wealthiest stand to benefit most.Ahead of the Autumn Statement, the FT’s pensions correspondent Josephine Cumbo brought together a panel of experts to debate the potential consequences of the policy on the savings habits of millennials, the future pensions landscape and whether Philip Hammond could end higher rate tax relief.Baroness Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, has been an outspoken critic of the Lifetime Isa, which she believes will undermine existing retirement savings products that could prove more valuable for young people, such as company pensions and auto enrolment.Michael Johnson, research fellow at the Centre for Policy Studies, is widely regarded as the architect of the Lifetime Isa. Arguing that Generation Y are not engaging even with the word “pension”, he believes simplifying the current system of upfront tax relief will encourage young people to save more.Tom McPhail is head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK retail investment platform, which will be offering customers under 40 access to the Lifetime Isa from next April’s launch. He has previously argued in FT Money that Isa products are becoming too complicated.Iona Bain is an author and founder of YMoneyY, a financial website for young people. The only member of our panel who is under 40 and therefore able to open a Lifetime Isa account next April, she agrees that they are easier structures for younger savers to understand, but fears that future governments may scrap the policy.Is the Lifetime Isa a winner or a loser in policy terms?IB: I think the overwhelming atmosphere at the moment is one of confusion about the whole pensions and savings issue. Not that long ago, we had the launch of the Help to Buy Isa, which was supposed to be the silver bullet for young people’s housing problems, and then there was a lot of hullabaloo around auto-enrolment, so people are getting a vague idea that there’s already a product out there that is designed to help them get on the housing ladder, and already a vague initiative that’s helping them to save for retirement.So I think it would be understandable for young people to feel confused about why we now need another product on top of those two initiatives [that] also has a lot of critics.I think it [the Lifetime Isa] will probably end up being used more to save for a first home because that seems to be the more pressing priority.RA: I actually have a lot of sympathy with what Iona was saying. I don’t see who would really be better off saving for retirement with a Lifetime Isa; I actually think the name Lifetime Isa is wholly misleading because this is a product that has all the behavioural incentives to ensure it won’t last a lifetime.What we really need is a lifetime pension that will last into your 80s. The Isa construct is not suitable for that and I agree, a lot of people are going to be confused about what to do. This product, in my view, is fine if you want to buy a home but we’ve already got the Help to Buy Isa. This is a sort of souped-up Help to Buy Isa — but why do we need a souped-up one?TM: We certainly have concerns about the policy, and it feels like a solution in search of a problem. Picking up on Iona’s point, the best policy intervention the government could have come up with to facilitate house purchase for the 20 and 30-somethings would have been to build more houses, or to facilitate more house construction. Stoking the demand side of the equation isn’t going to fix the problem — it’s going to accelerate the problem.Future retirees in the dark about state pensionInsurers warn of Lifetime Isa threat to workplace pensionsFCA says some pension providers failing annuity customersWe are concerned at a policy level about the proliferation of Isa regimes. Iona, you spoke about confusion, and that is something that concerns us.As the ‘architect’ of the Lifetime Isa, Michael, how do you respond to these concerns?MJ: What is clear is that there is a lot of resistance to the Lifetime Isa from the industry, which is driven by commercial fear, not from listening to their potential customer base.The Treasury estimates that 200,000 new Lifetime Isa accounts will be opened every year for the next four years, with a net cost in the fourth year of about £850m. This is not a money-saving exercise, this is a net cost to the Treasury because they haven’t yet done anything [to curtail pensions] tax relief. The most recent survey, from Aon Hewitt, suggests that in the first year [the number of] account openings will be 2.25m. That is 11 times bigger than the Treasury estimate. If that comes to fruition, the Treasury will have a budget problem from a product that is proving to be too successful.And that is what is terrifying the industry, particularly the life industry. But let’s go back to why I sat down and conjured up the Lifetime Isa. It was to acknowledge reality, which is that Generation Y is not engaging with the “pension” word, and therefore Generation Y is not in receipt of tax relief. So how can we reframe what is ultimately an objective that probably all of us share, which is that we want to capitalise a broad-based savings culture? How can we reframe the language in a way that is going to encourage Generation Y to participate?Do young people find Isas easier to understand than pensions?IB: One of the issues is that young people don’t really understand tax-efficient savings vehicles. They don’t get why it’s important. They don’t necessarily feel that they pay so much tax it’s a problem anyway, so they do respond better to incentives. If you say [you can have] 25 per cent extra from the government, that’s something anyone can understand. You don’t necessarily need to study it in depth in order to get that.TM: I think there’s consensus around this table that the tax relief system needs modification.MJ: What I am trying to do is reframe the language to achieve that. Rather than us all having conversations in which the industry is fiercely defensive about how precious tax relief is to the industry.TM: I disagree. I think a lot of the industry has moved on. One of the things that emerged from George Osborne’s 2015 review was that a lot of the industry moved in favour of a flat rate [of tax relief].What are the main risks?RA: Number one: why are so many providers not going to provide this product? Because there is a massive risk of mis-selling. This is a complex product and if somebody opts out of a workplace pension to go into this, or if somebody gives up higher rate tax relief to go into this, or if somebody puts their money in thinking, well, I can get access to it, and does not understand this massive 25 per cent penalty that they will face, they will come back in a few years and say to whoever sold it to them, you didn’t tell me. This needs to be sold with suitability checks and risk warnings.TM: Have any of the product providers come out and said that? I’ve not heard a single one publicly say . . .RA: Of course they’re not going to come out and say it.TM: But I haven’t heard anyone say it privately, either.RA: If you think about the previous mis-selling scandals we have had; endowment mortgages, everybody was rushing to sell them; with-profits policies, everybody was saying this is a great idea — until later down the line, when the customer realised they didn’t have a clue what they were buying. Nobody warned them, nobody told them. It is difficult to see with a Lifetime Isa who would be better off in retirement.Is the Lifetime Isa really a threat to workplace pension saving?MJ: Aon Hewitt asked 600 pensions industry professionals whether the Lifetime Isa presented a threat to automatic enrolment and opt-out rates, and 58 per cent said it will have no impact at all. Two per cent said it would have a significant impact. [The respondents] make their living from the pensions industry, so one would expect a degree of caution in the answer.TM: That reflects our own consumer research findings.RA: But why do we need an addition to pension savings?MJ: Because Generation Y is not engaging with pensions.RA: That’s not true; look at the evidence with auto enrolment; they are engaging.MJ: To look at data of subscriptions and involvement with automatic enrolment right now is utterly misleading because the employee contribution is 0.8 per cent of band earnings next to nil. It is going to quintuple between now and early 2018; I am trying to head off the risk of opt-outs rocketing as a result of the quintupling of employee contributions, combined with what increasingly looks like a rapidly rising inflation rate.IB: Should we not be educating the workforce about what their options ought to be?TM: That’s a really important point. If you’re benefiting from a workplace employer contribution, you are almost certainly better off staying in that workplace pension arrangement. I think provided that message is delivered, I agree with Michael that opt-out rates will actually be pretty modest.RA: You can’t look at this in the short term. The first person to get any money out of this as a pension is going to be 20 years down the line. In the meantime, you could have a massive mis-selling scandal. We are about to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.MJ: The government has never presented the Lifetime Isa as anything to do with pensions. It is not going to be regulated as a pension product. [But] I would like to see it included in legislation for things like charge caps.RA: And suitability checks before sale?MJ: Absolutely.TM: I certainly think it’s premature to layer more regulation over the top of it. It is an elective product. I think if we ever got into a world where people were being auto-enrolled into it, then I think that questions of things like the charge cap and default funds and treating it more like a pension would become more relevant.How can we fix the problem of retirement under-saving, particularly among young people?MJ: I think we ought to perhaps have a blunt conversation about whether upfront tax incentives, irrespective of what you call them, make any difference at all. There is considerable evidence appearing from the likes of Denmark and Harvard University that [they] have no impact at all on the aggregate savings of a nation.IB: The research I’ve been looking at suggests that it’s more academic. Young people see those incentives and in theory think that it would be nice to be able to save more to get those incentives, but it doesn’t change the reality of whether they can save more.RA: But if our system is not understood — which we’ve all agreed around the table it isn’t — we’re giving people huge amounts of tax relief but they don’t know they’re getting it. The answer, then, is not to take it away or to tear up the system by turning pensions into Isas, but to make it so that people do see what they’re getting.MJ: But those who harvest the vast majority of tax relief, that is, the wealthiest 10 or 15 per cent, know exactly what they’re doing. It’s an inefficient use of government resource to be chucking 70 to 80 per cent of all tax relief back at the top 15 per cent of the income distribution.RA: I don’t disagree, but the people who will benefit from [the Lisa] the most will have money or wealthy relatives who can put money in for them.IB: Indeed — the people who would have saved anyway.MJ: The risk is many in Generation Y are not going to have that money to save in the current architecture of the pensions world.RA: They’ll have even less with the Lifetime Isa than they would in a pension.IB: We don’t know if the Lisa is actually going to last. If we had a scenario in which Jeremy Corbyn was the prime minister in another five years, say it did happen, what’s to stop him just saying “actually, I don’t think this is a very good idea”?Looking ahead to the Autumn Statement, does the Lifetime Isa signify the way all pensions policy is headed?MJ: I think it’s reasonable that something will happen in the Autumn Statement. The logical next step is to put an end to higher rate tax relief.TM: Are you actually making a prediction here, that in the autumn statement Hammond is going to say right, no more higher rate tax relief?MJ: I think it’s bound to be on the table for discussion, as it has been for several years. Philip Hammond made a statement very early on, abandoning the balanced budget by 2020-21, however his desire to cut the deficit is still pretty strong, not least because of the fears of the damage that Brexit can impose.RA: I think what the Treasury wants to do is not just scrap higher rate relief, because that is just cutting pensions and they know they would come under enormous criticism for that. Unless they can find a way to improve the position of the basic rate taxpayer I don’t think they will trumpet a new policy.This is an edited transcript of a debate which took place at the Financial Times in early November 2016, chaired by the FT’s pensions correspondent Josephine Cumbo"
39;AON;AON Plc;2016-10-17T04:31:35Z;UK pension saving shortfall ‘is £11bn a year’;Half of savers in defined contribution schemes could be undersaving;"Workers in the UK are undersaving for retirement by up to £11bn a year according to a new analysis of the pension savings challenges.A nationwide poll of more than 2,000 pension savers published on Monday found that only 16 per cent were saving enough to maintain their standard of living when they stop work.Aon Hewitt, the consultancy which commissioned the poll, said the analysis suggested around 4m people, or half the population saving into so-called defined contribution (DC) pension schemes, could be undersaving for later life.On average, Aon calculated that members of DC pension funds needed to pay an extra £1,400 a year into their pensions to avoid a sharp shock at retirement.This savings gap was estimated at £11.4bn when the poll of DC pension savers was applied more widely to the 8.1m saving into the schemes across the UK.“Auto enrolment has successfully increased participation in pension schemes, but the vital next step is to ensure that these new entrants save a sufficient amount for retirement,” said Sophia Singleton, partner and head of DC consulting at Aon Hewitt.“It is crucial for employers and trustees to have the right structures in place to make retirement saving easier to understand, which would encourage employees to contribute more.”FCA says some pension providers failing annuity customers

Analysis claims former chancellor’s reforms will spark problem in the long termThe survey, carried out by YouGov, found that 37 per cent of pension scheme members surveyed were paying less than 5 per cent of their annual salary into their pension.Just under half, or 48 per cent, were putting 5-10 per cent of their salary in pension contributions.However, Aon calculated that a 25-year-old man on £22,500 a year would need to save 18 per cent of his salary, or £4,050 a year, into his pension to maintain his standard of living if he planned to retire at the age of 65.A 40-year-old man, on a salary of £30,500, would need to set aside 19 per cent of his salary if he wanted a comfortable retirement at 65, even if he had already built up a pension pot of £61,000, Aon said.Up to 2.75m pension savers in the survey had no idea how much income their pension savings will deliver, highlighting an “enormous disconnect between scheme members’ expectations and the reality of pension saving,” Aon said.The poll results come as the government was urged to a delay a decision on increasing pension contribution rates for millions of workers automatically enrolled in company pension schemes.The government is also under pressure to address growing concerns about the coverage of its auto-enrolment policy, with its own figures last week revealing one in five workers had not been auto-enrolled because they earned less than £10,000 a year.Morten Nilsson, chief executive of NOW Pensions, a workplace pension provider, said: “While auto enrolment is working for many, it’s not working for all.“This reinforces the importance of examining the auto enrolment trigger as part of the 2017 review, as at the moment too many workers for whom auto enrolment was intended are being excluded.”"

ILS take money from investors and use it to back insurance policies directly, bypassing traditional insurance companies. They have been growing rapidly in recent years as investors hunt for yield in hidden corners of the financial markets. According to research from broker Aon Benfield, the total amount of capital in ILS products was $75bn at the end of June 2016.  But London has missed out on much of the business as the UK does not have rules which allow ILS to be issued. Instead, they tend to be issued in offshore locations such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and Guernsey. The Treasury’s move comes as many of the companies that operate in London’s wholesale insurance and reinsurance markets assess their post-Brexit options. There have been fears that the UK’s exit from the EU will force some business away from London. “The ILS project aims to provide London with the framework it needs to remain a world leader in reinsurance,” wrote Simon Kirby, Economic Secretary to the Treasury in a letter to the London Market Group, an industry body. Michael Wade, a senior adviser to the Cabinet Office, said that the ILS market could be a “game changer” for London.“It is enormously encouraging to note HM Treasury's continuing enthusiasm for the project to create an environment in London whereby ILS can flourish,” he said. In a report issued last week, Aon Benfield said that equity market volatility and negative interest rates made ILS an attractive alternative for investors. According to Aon’s indices, ILS have made an average annual return of 8.5 per cent over the past ten years.  Nicolas Aubert, chairman of the LMG said “We are heartened to hear that the ILS project remains a priority for the Treasury, and we very much look forward to working with them to ensure successful implementation of the UK's new ILS framework as soon as possible in 2017.”

45;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Never bite the consultant’s hand that feeds you;Chris Newlands finds asset managers refuse to criticise investment consultants on the record;If you locked 100 asset managers in a room and turned off the lights you might still only get one or two to admit their delight at the UK regulator’s decision to investigate investment consultants.Consultants decide which investment companies the UK’s largest pension funds should invest with and, such is the power they wield, asset managers refuse to criticise them on the record.“One should never bite the hand that feeds you,” says one chief executive of a fund management company. “There is no upside in me telling you what I really think,” says another.Off the record, however, and still with great reluctance, asset managers will whisper that the Financial Conduct Authority’s decision to examine the role of investment consultants is long overdue. They quietly believe it is now very necessary for the FCA to investigate the trend of advisers pitching their own asset management services to investors.The particular problem for fund managers is not just that they are so reliant on investment consultants to pass business their way but that there are so few advisers.One senior fund manager refers to them as a “cartel”. He says: “If I get on the wrong side of one of them there are not many other places left for me to go.”Consultancies Mercer, Aon Hewitt and Towers Watson are estimated to advise around half of UK pension funds. The six largest consultancies advise 70 per cent of the market.This reticence to speak out against consultants has arguably allowed advisers to muscle in on the traditional domain of fund companies and create the conflicts of interest that so concern the FCA.Asset managers have been silently watching consultants develop their fiduciary management operations, in which advisers make investment decisions on behalf of their clients, for many years. It is only now, behind the strength of an FCA review, that fund companies have found their voice — albeit one that is only heard in off the record conversations.“They [consultants] have never really been called up on this until now,” says the fund management chief executive. “We have to take some responsibility for that.”What investment consultants stand most accused of is promoting the idea of fiduciary management, a lucrative business for providers (fiduciary management fees are estimated to be triple those charged for providing investment advice), to their pension fund clients and then directing those clients to their own services instead of putting the contracts out to tender.Last year it emerged that three-quarters of fiduciary management contracts awarded to consultants were given without a competitive tender, according to research by KPMG, the financial services provider. Anthony Webb, fiduciary management head at KPMG, told FTfm at the time: “The number of mandates won without a competitive tender process remains uncomfortably high.”The FCA has other concerns, most notably that investment consultants may be advising pension schemes to use expensive active management strategies ahead of lower-cost passive strategies in order to justify their fees.Unsurprisingly, that is something it is difficult to get asset managers to talk about either on or off the record.It is indeed a great shame for pension scheme trustees that the once truly independent advice they took for granted from investment consultants has been brought into question. They valued it greatly.But while fund managers have remained quiet and watched advisers slowly drift into other areas of the market, investment consultants have been free to do all the talking. The problem for pension fund trustees is knowing who they are listening to: a trusted adviser or a salesperson?
46;AON;AON Plc;2015-11-22T02:41:17Z;‘Perverse’ investment consulting industry condemned;Heads of UK’s largest pension funds call for stricter oversight by the regulator;The heads of the UK’s largest pension funds have called for stricter oversight of the “perverse” investment consulting industry after the Financial Conduct Authority last week confirmed it would examine potential conflicts of interest in the sector.The UK financial watchdog said it will review the influence of investment consultants and the potential damage they cause as part of a wider investigation of the asset management market.The biggest concern is that consultants, who traditionally advised pension schemes on their investment decisions, are increasingly pitching their own asset management services to clients.The chief executive of a large UK pension fund said: “There can be no doubt [investment consulting] is a conflicted business model. How can consultants possibly give unbiased advice at the same time they are offering their own investment services? The system is perverse, and most definitely needs a review.”Last year it emerged that three-quarters of the contracts awarded to consultants for their investment services, known as fiduciary management, were given without a competitive tender, according to research from KPMG, the financial services provider.One investment executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “There are absolutely inherent conflicts of interest within the growth of fiduciary management. Trusted advisers end up pushing their own products on clients.“[Consultants] will claim there is always an open tender. The reality is somewhat different.”The executive, who estimated fiduciary management fees are triple those charged for providing investment advice, urged the regulator to ensure tender processes are more transparent and to force consultants to publish their fiduciary management performance figures.Andrew Clare, who holds the chair in asset management at London’s Cass Business School and is a trustee on the boards of two pension schemes, also questioned the reliability of the “Chinese walls” that are meant to divide consultants’ advice arms from their fiduciary arms.“The conflicts definitely need to be sorted out. The investment consulting industry is getting complex and it has muddied the waters,” he said. Mr Clare suggested consultants should be forced to spin off their fiduciary management businesses into separate companies.There is further concern that the three largest investment consultancies, Mercer, Aon Hewitt and Towers Watson, have become too powerful in determining how pension funds invest. The quality of the advice they provide has also come into question.Dominic Johnson, chief executive of Somerset Capital, the UK asset manager, urged the regulator to promote more competition among consultants, given “how concentrated the market is”.Mercer, Aon Hewitt and Towers Watson are estimated to advise around half of UK pension funds. The six largest consultancies advise 70 per cent of the market.The chief investment officer of one of the UK’s largest public pension funds said: “[Consultants] have too much influence. Hedge funds and currency funds have all found their way into pension funds’ portfolios at great expense and often with poor returns.“Many consultants feel obliged to recommend change to justify their fee, when, in fact, no change would be better.”Last year the Law Commission, an independent body that reviews law reform in England and Wales, highlighted these problems and urged the government to “actively monitor” how the investment consultant industry operated. “A lack of regulation in this area does appear anomalous,” it said.Tim Giles, a partner at Aon Hewitt, said: “We welcome the FCA review as we feel it will provide a great opportunity to debunk the myths that surround the role of the investment consultant. The consulting market operates competitively, with many players and no barriers to entry.”A spokesperson for Mercer added: “We believe the current regulatory environment enables pension funds to receive competitive advice from a range of providers. However, we remain open to alternative views and will work with regulators to serve the best interests of pension schemes.”Ed Francis, head of investment at Towers Watson’s European business, said: “It is widely accepted that total costs in the pension fund food chain are disproportionately high, despite a highly competitive marketplace. We hope the [FCA] review will address this.”Trustees stripped of decision-making power / From Keith Wallace
47;AON;AON Plc;2015-10-01T23:02:30Z;Law firms look for opportunities to enhance their client relations;Collaborating with in-house legal teams and bringing fresh ideas to corporate projects are two ways firms have enhanced their client relations;"It was a sunny September day two years ago, and Michael Hatchard, a partner with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, was having lunch with executives from insurance broker Aon at the law firm’s office at London’s Canary Wharf.The group was discussing the fallout since a radical move by the Takeover Panel, the UK’s mergers regulator, two years previously to enact new rules to make hostile takeovers of British companies more difficult. This had followed the contentious acquisition of food group Cadbury by US rival Kraft in 2010.“Break fees had become unavailable, which left the bidder exposed to costs,” Mr Hatchard says. Without those incentives for first bidders, an unsuccessful bid could end up costing tens of millions of pounds in some cases. The Skadden lawyers and Aon executives worried that the change was putting at risk a nascent revival in mergers and acquisitions in the UK, discouraging private equity bidders in particular.The result of the brainstorming was “topping insurance”, a new product that would act as break-up coverage for potential acquirers in deals, and pay the bidders any costs incurred — up to 1 per cent of the bid price — if a competing bidder emerged and won. “It’s about using insurance as a mechanism to reduce risk for both parties,” Mr Hatchard says.It is a rare instance of lawyers coming up with the idea for a commercial product for a client, and it helped Skadden by providing more work, boosting its standing with Aon and providing security for the sort of deals Skadden is often hired to advise on.It is also a sign of the times — lawyers are realising that to maintain and strengthen their relationships with clients they have to find innovative ways of providing value after a deal is done. That is especially true for mandates such as M&A, where the billing rates are highest.Increasingly, law firms are also being asked to leave their egos at the door by collaborating with other lawyers so that the client has the benefit of a wider range of expertise.A £1bn technology project to facilitate a move from a prime-contract to a multi-supplier model led Royal Mail Group to instruct Slaughter and May in 2011 to work with its in-house legal counsel, leading a team of up to 18 lawyers from Royal Mail’s panel law firms, including secondees from Addleshaw Goddard and DAC Beachcroft. The group was headed by Rob Sumroy, a Slaughter and May partner, and Sarah Draper, Royal Mail’s legal director for technology on the project.Pinsent Masons and Axiom have taken a similar approach with two of their clients, which effectively outsource part of their bulk legal work to the firms, which in turn allows the companies’ in-house departments to concentrate on strategic issues.Pinsent Masons has been working with one of its clients, the consultancy Mercer, a wholly owned subsidiary of professional services group Marsh & McLennan, to take on operational legal work, mostly on a fixed-fee basis. As a result, the company has saved more than £1m a year since the programme began in 2012.The partnership, dubbed “Getting Certainty”, came about after discussions on how the firm could help Mercer do some of its day-to-day work in order to free up its in-house legal department to focus on areas such as developing new consumer-facing products, de-risking pension schemes and improving internal risk and compliance systems.Up to 30 lawyers at the firm, across eight offices, may be working for Mercer at any given time, says Isabel Nurse-Marsh, a pensions litigation partner at Pinsents who has worked with the consulting firm for about 15 years.Pinsents has also signed up to conduct an annual review of hundreds of Mercer’s standard contracts with clients at a fixed price. This is to give the company easier access to information and allow it to assess risk more easily.“There’s an awful lot of collaboration,” Ms Nurse-Marsh says. “We would see ourselves as an extension of them: they have secondees from us; they have recruited people from Pinsents. We know them really well.”The arrangement means Mercer knows in advance how much the work will cost. The client will also pay Pinsents bonuses if the work meets certain efficiency targets.“It’s about sharing the risk,” Ms Nurse-Marsh says. “The more efficiently we do it, the better it is for Mercer and that ends up being better for us.”Lisa Tolaini, chief legal counsel at Mercer, says: “We believe we have developed an innovative approach to managing our legal spend without compromising the quality of the advice we receive, and which will also allow the legal function to focus more time on those areas such as product development that really add value to the business. We particularly like that our lawyers are sharing the upsides and downsides of our risk with us.”It’s about sharing the risk. The more efficient we are, the better it is for the client and that ends up being better for usAxiom, a firm whose lawyers are seconded in-house with clients on a project basis, is working with BT, the telecoms company, on a multi-million-pound project where a team of more than 30 lawyers in Northern Ireland, England, India, Singapore and the US is trying to transform BT’s contracting operations.The work of Axiom’s lawyers frees BT’s in-house team to focus on deals. The firm is using its proprietary technology, Iris, to provide BT with dashboards that allow the company to view the contracts the Axiom team is working on by type, geography, counterparty, originating requester, source of terms, business line, legal entity and date, and the status of each.The volume of work handled by Axiom has risen about 250 per cent since it launched the programme. The complexity of work handed over has also increased.Skadden’s Mr Hatchard and his team spent about 18 months negotiating with the Takeover Panel to approve the topping insurance. The product, which will cover deals with a value of up to £3bn, with potential for further coverage of up to £7bn, was packaged earlier this year along with support insurers. “It has deepened our relationship with [Aon],” Mr Hatchard says. “We can see it having applications in the US and elsewhere.”"
48;AON;AON Plc;2015-09-06T04:18:51Z;Pension schemes’ use of fiduciary management grows;More than half of the UK’s largest schemes now use a third-party manager;More than half of the UK’s largest pension schemes now use a third-party fiduciary manager despite questions as to whether their members’ interests are being served by such arrangements.Fiduciary management services are used by 66 UK pension schemes with assets of £60bn, according to the sixth annual survey of the fiduciary management market by Aon Hewitt, the consultancy. Almost half (46 per cent) of the survey’s 142 respondents now employ a fiduciary manager, up from 18 per cent in 2011.Pension fund trustees have faced growing criticism for awarding such contracts to their current investment consultants without completing a genuinely competitive tender process.Research published last year by KPMG, the financial services group, suggested 80 per cent of fiduciary management contracts were not being assigned on a competitive basis. KPMG said the number of mandates awarded without a competitive tender process remained “uncomfortably high”, leaving pension trustees vulnerable to agreeing contracts with potentially unsuitable or underperforming providers.Sion Cole, partner and head of European distribution at Aon Hewitt, dismissed the concerns. He said 85 per cent of Aon Hewitt’s fiduciary management clients had gone through a competitive process.The research found growth in the use of fiduciary management services has been particularly strong for large pension schemes with more than £1bn in assets. The uptake of fiduciary management has doubled to 51 per cent this year from 22 per cent in 2014.Mr Cole said: “It has been a common misconception that fiduciary management is used mainly by small schemes. Larger schemes are also recognising the benefits of delegating day-to-day portfolio decisions.”Anthony Webb, head of fiduciary management at KPMG, said it was vital for pension schemes to achieve a “good fit” with their fiduciary manager, as contracts tended to have a long life.“It can be daunting for trustees to have to evaluate a range of potential partners, but there are clear benefits in finding a bespoke service that fits a pension scheme’s needs at a competitive price,” he said.

50;AON;AON Plc;2015-07-06T15:07:54Z;Low rates weigh on insurers even as it feeds their merger mania;Cheap borrowing and efficiency seeking fuel a boom in M&A with 2015 on track to be a record year;The announcement of three vast insurance deals within a week is a sign of the times.Last Tuesday, broker Willis said it would merge with consultancy Towers Watson in an $18bn deal. Within 24 hours, Ace struck the largest pure insurance takeover in the sector’s history with the $28bn acquisition of local US rival Chubb. By the end of the week, Aetna had topped the ranking with the $37bn takeover of Humana in the US health insurance market.The string of deals puts 2015 on track to be the biggest year on record for insurance mergers and acquisitions, according to data compiled by Dealogic. So far, so similar to countless other sectors, where a brightening economic outlook and ultra-low financing costs are combining to persuade company boards to spend record amounts on deals.In some ways, the latest takeovers are idiosyncratic. The brokerage deal is an attempt by Willis to narrow the gap with the big two in the sector, Marsh & McLennan and Aon. The Ace-Chubb combination is part efficiency-seeking, part empire-building. And Aetna’s acquisition is likely to be one of a number in US health insurance, where underwriters are seeking ways to boost negotiating power with ever heftier drugs groups at the same time as new healthcare legislation is incentivising cost savings.But there is one common theme, too. Across the landscape of insurance dealmaking, the biggest impetus for M&A is a turbocharged version of the driver behind much of the market-wide M&A boom: low interest rates.For insurers, zero rates doesn’t just mean free financing for buyers, as in any sector. There is an indirect, defensive spur, too. As investors, hungry for yield, have flocked into the underwriting market with alternative sources of capital, the added competition has driven down prices, in some areas to uneconomic levels. A merger is a natural response — done right, it should both strip out capacity and generate cost savings. Even in the broking segment of the market, low interest rates are playing their part. In their search for decent returns to match their commitments, pension fund clients are increasingly turning to the likes of consultancy Towers Watson for advice.The last time there was this intensity of deals, it did not end well. Fifteen years or so ago, Hank Greenberg, the legendary boss of AIG, was buying up the likes of American General for $23bn and SunAmerica for $18bn. It was not long before this large, sprawling group had become the biggest blow-up of the financial crisis. Last week’s Chubb takeover, driven by Ace boss Evan Greenberg, smacked uncomfortably of family rivalry and a desire to build an even larger business than his father did at AIG.All the same, the dealmaking seems pretty likely to continue. Even if interest rates start to rise, upward moves are likely to be slow. For many, cost savings through M&A look like the only way to boost returns on equity that often barely exceed 10 per cent.Opportunities abound. Insurance remains a fragmented sector, particularly in the US. Mutually owned companies are numerous, keeping pressure on commercially owned underwriters to cut costs to remain competitive.US deals, despite the complexities of state-by-state insurance regulation, are more likely than takeovers in Europe, where the incoming Solvency II regulations leave little opportunity for merger talks.The appetite for insurance M&A contrasts starkly with the dearth of deals in banking, where regulators are hostile to any combination that would exacerbate the risks of institutions already deemed “too big to fail”. Of course, big, complex insurance companies have themselves been made subject to regulatory penalties — nine insurers ranging from Allianz and Axa to Ping An and MetLife are deemed “systemically important financial institutions”, though the ramifications have yet to be detailed.For now, though, neither the risk of Sifi designation, nor the fear of bubble valuations is deterring fans of M&A.But a third danger may be looming from outside the insurance world. As those deals were being struck last week, the Financial Times held its Future of Insurance conference in London. Relatively few delegates seemed to take seriously the advent of new tech-savvy competitors disrupting the old world of insurance. Bulking up through M&A might be a decent way to thwart upstart competition. But the flipside risk — of being so internally focused that you ignore the fast-evolving market environment — is just as big.patrick.jenkins@ft.com
51;AON;AON Plc;2015-04-29T07:16:49Z;Bidders circle Russell Investments arm auctioned by LSE;US asset manager expected to fetch as much as $1.5bn;At least six bidders are circling Russell Investments, the large US asset manager that is being sold by the London Stock Exchange Group, according to people close to the process.An auction process for the business, which has $273bn in funds under management and is expected to fetch as much as $1.5bn, is now in the second round.The LSE is shedding the operation, part of the Frank Russell Company, which it agreed to acquire less than a year ago for $2.7bn.The remaining strategic and private equity bidders include Towers Watson, the US human resources and risk management consultancy, and financial services group Ameriprise, which owns the UK’s Threadneedle Investments.These people said that the interest from Towers Watson, which is focused on consulting rather than asset management, may mean that other risk managers such as insurance brokers Aon and Marsh and McLennan are also following the process closely.Others bidders are believed to include at least one China-based group and a small number of private equity firms.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are running the sale process for the LSE. Both banks and the LSE declined to comment. Towers Watson, Ameriprise and Aon declined to comment.Several other private equity firms such as KKR and CVC had also taken an interest in the process. However, many did not make it through after first-round bids. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which has been seeking to ramp up its exposure to assets in the US, had been interested in the unit but it is not clear if it is still involved.Meetings with the management of Russell have been held in Seattle, Washington, in recent days and the next round of bids is due in the coming weeks.The LSE’s acquisition of the Frank Russell Company from insurer Northwestern Mutual highlights its ambition to grow in the US, which is the world’s largest market for fund management and for exchange traded funds.The LSE bid for the entire Frank Russell Company to ensure it won a competitive auction that attracted rival bids from other financial data providers and exchanges, who also coveted the index business.More than $5tn in assets are benchmarked to Russell indices, which include the well-known Russell 2000 for listed small-cap US companies.Some asset managers and investment banks had expressed concern that the exchange’s long-term ownership of its own asset manager could put it into conflict with its users.One person following sale process closely said that the decision to separate the fund management may have also exacerbated tensions internally at Russell.Additional reporting Alistair Gray, James Fontanella-Khan and David Oakley
52;AON;AON Plc;2015-03-15T07:12:08Z;UK defined benefit pension buyouts tipped for growth;Online tools enable more transactions but trustees say one size does not fit all;"Billions of pounds in defined benefit (DB) pension liabilities are expected to transfer from UK company balance sheets to the insurance sector this year as pension scheme sponsors and trustees become better equipped to price transactions, say advisers.Approximately £8bn worth of final salary liabilities were passed to the insurance companies in 2014 via bulk annuity purchases as companies look for new ways to shed their pension liabilities. This shift, however, represents just a fraction of the trillions of pounds of liabilities available in UK DB schemes.Pension consultants claim that part of the barrier to the completion of more of these buyout deals is an inability for trustees to secure a quotation from an insurance company that truly captures the final price they will pay for the deal. In response, advisers have developed systems which bring the quotation process online, offering what they call ‘real time’ pricing for sponsors and trustees.It can currently take months for schemes to obtain an initial quote from a selection of insurers and these prices soon become obsolete as market conditions change.Legal & General, one of the largest bulk annuity providers in the market, reports that just 34 per cent of prospective business on which it quotes ever reaches completion with any provider at all.PwC, a corporate pension scheme adviser, has launched Skyval Insure which it says provides trustees and sponsors with a realistic price for a buyout with an insurance company.Raj Mody, head of pensions at PwC, says: “It is not optimal for trustees to get a price for buyout at the moment; the market is not very efficient. It is a lot of effort for the trustee board to obtain a quote since the process can be long and complicated, and the resulting price is not always conducive or accurate.”Mr Mody says PwC’s system allows schemes to enter their actuarial data online from which a range of providers are able to calculate a price without revealing any commercially sensitive pricing methodology. The schemes can then track the prices and should the market environment change or liabilities rise or fall, the quotes can be updated in real time.Rival consultants Aon Hewitt and Mercer also offer online pricing tools, and argue that insurers will not favour any one adviser’s system over another.Martin Bird, senior partner at Aon Hewitt, says: “A number of people have got valuation tools; online valuation systems are where the industry is going. Some [consultants] say they have unique pricing information but insurers want to get in front of as many schemes as possible so they make it widely available to all consultants.”Alan Baker, partner in Mercer’s retirement business, adds: “The Skyval solution is just one of a number of options. It is likely that insurers will want to calculate any firm quotes on their own systems. Tools such as those proposed will nonetheless provide a fair indication of likely costs.”In addition to expecting the number of transactions to accelerate, Mr Mody expects more providers to enter the bulk annuity market.Following greater retirement flexibility announced in the 2014 UK Budget, some individual annuity providers have seen year-on-year sales dry up by more than 50 per cent, leading them to consider branching out into the bulk market.Mr Mody says: “We shouldn’t be cavalier about the fact that retail annuities are different to bulk, but the fundamentals are the same. If the individual annuity business is tailing off, and it is for a lot of companies post-Budget, [online valuation systems] provide another outlet for applying that capital to the bulk market in an efficient way.”However, retail annuity provider Friends Provident, which is actively looking at the bulk annuity market, says the development of Skyval has not accelerated its entry to market.Established insurers such as Legal & General welcome the online tools.Tom Ground, head of bulk annuities at Legal & General, supported Mr Bird’s view that insurers did not favour any particular system, but said he was keen to see the market develop since providing real time pricing was critical to the expansion of bulk annuity transactions.In theory these [online valuation systems] should be useful but in reality no two buyouts fit into the same mouldMr Ground says: “All of our business is introduced through consultants and every single one has their equivalent of the Skyval system, so we actively court all of the consultants. Moving pricing to real time will allow a lot more transactions to happen, and means trustees and insurers can choose the best time to transact.”Trustees are more sceptical about the role of real time pricing in driving the acceleration of bulk annuities since most DB schemes cannot afford to transact.Richard Butcher, director of independent trustee Pitmans Trustees, says: “The key barrier for most schemes is that they haven’t got sufficient funds to look at buyout so it’s pointless looking at any online valuation system. These really only help a relatively small proportion of schemes sponsored by well-resourced employers.”Mr Butcher also questions how far an online tool could go in securing the best price for a buyout since an insurer needs to consider the scheme’s own nuances; a skill which cannot be replicated by a computer.“In theory these things should be useful but in reality no two buyouts fit into the same mould. There are quirks and variations that can’t be translated by electronic data and inevitably there is horse-trading and negotiation to be done,” he says.——————————————-Final-salary pension schemes have become more expensive for companies to fund as people are living longer and returns from low-risk assets have dwindled. Changes to accounting rules mean pension deficits must be shown on companies’ balance sheets.As such a ‘buyout’, when a company’s pension fund is transferred into the hands of an insurance group, has become increasingly common in UK workplaces as companies look for new ways to shed their pension liabilities.The buyout enables the employer to wind up the scheme, ultimately, and therefore it no longer features in its accounts. The company winds up its pension scheme and hands responsibility for paying the pension promises to the insurance group. Once the buyout is complete, all links with the former sponsor and trustees are severed and the scheme member is issued with a contract from the insurance company."
53;AON;AON Plc;2014-12-09T18:21:19Z;Tesco’s insurers could face payouts for legal costs;AIG and Ace provide cover for supermarket group’s directors;The crisis at Tesco has put insurance companies at risk of multimillion pound payouts through policies that cover legal defence costs and potential damages from action against directors.AIG and Ace, the New York-listed insurers, are among the underwriters that provide the supermarket group’s so-called directors and officers (D & O) cover, people familiar with the matter said.Employers take out D & O policies on behalf of top executives and other board members to cover liabilities if they are accused of personal wrongdoing.Details of Tesco’s policy have not been publicly disclosed but brokers said D & O cover could be triggered in several ways.Tesco’s profits overstatement is being investigated by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office. Although fines and other criminal or regulatory penalties are not insurable, legal fees and civil damages can be.Stewarts Law, a litigation firm, has said it is planning a legal claim against Tesco on behalf of investors, which will seek to establish that shareholders are entitled to compensation for losses. It says it plans to allege wrongdoing by directors and senior management.Francis Kean, D & O insurance broker at Willis, said shareholder litigation had become “an increased risk for insurers” in the UK.“The ease by which they [legal claims] can be brought has risen” for various reasons, such as more internet appeals seeking out disgruntled investors.He added of Tesco: “It is an example of something arising out of the blue — where insurers assumed the landscape looked a certain way when in fact it now appears to be fundamentally different.”The Insurance Insider trade publication first reported the details of Tesco’s D & O policy, of which Aon is the broker.AIG would be on the hook for the first £25m of any Tesco D & O claims and Ace the next £25m. Several other insurers would step in for payouts above £50m, up to a maximum £100m.Aon, AIG and Ace would not comment.
54;AON;AON Plc;2014-08-15T16:13:33Z;Where’s the younger workers’ champion?;Few young people understand pensions;"The British pension system will fail to provide young people with a basic level of security in retirement. They may not understand exactly why, but they know it in their gut.Youngsters should have been alarmed to hear this week that out of every £1 that FTSE 350 companies spend on pension provision, 37p goes just on reducing defined benefit deficits. But they probably aren’t, because most of them wouldn’t know what a defined benefit deficit is. Young people have never been interested in pensions, and they probably never will be. The average twenty-something is incapable of imagining their life as a seventysomething. It’s simply too far away to feel real.But that doesn’t mean they aren’t worried about them. My friends ask me about pensions on a regular basis. They appear concerned and nod intently when I list the reasons why they should get one. But if I go further and attempt to explain the investments, they shrivel faster than a lettuce leaf on a sunbed.In previous decades, workers young and old could afford to be ignorant about the details of pensions. Defined benefit or “final salary” pensions were handed out like hot cakes, so workers could sit back while their employers made all the decisions, shouldered the costs and bore the risks. But outside the public sector, few young workers today are in such a luxurious position.Final salary schemes are all but extinct, and dwindling wages are increasingly served up with inadequate pensions on the side. Young people also lose out from reforms to the state pension; they will foot the escalating bill for the baby boomers’ retirement, but experts predict that by the time today’s twenty-somethings retire, the public pot will have dried up.The government hopes that automatic enrolment into workplace pensions will help fix this. It won’t. The retirement funds that younger people are building through the government’s auto-enrolment scheme will leave most poverty-stricken in old age.Millions of people have been automatically enrolled into workplace pensions for the first timeAuto-enrolment has been successful at getting young workers saving into pension schemes, but the policy only encourages them to save 8 per cent of their salary into a private pension. Even the government has admitted this will not be enough.Meanwhile, pension providers can smell the money rolling in. If 90 per cent of workers aged 22 to 30 started paying even the minimum auto enrolment contributions into a giant collective pension, it would be worth £600bn in 30 years, Aon Hewitt projections show.But the industry wants more. Providers are now dreaming up strategies to further “engage” young people with pensions.Michelle Cracknell, chief executive of The Pensions Advisory Service, answered readers’ questions in a live online Q&A on ft.comLast month, at an event in its Cheapside offices, the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) unveiled a survey which found that young people would accept a smaller pension pot if their money was invested “ethically”. It invited me to sit on a panel to discuss whether promoting “ethical” and “sustainable” investments could help “engage” young people with pensions.I told the room of delegates I thought they were deluded if they believed such nonsense. It’s all very well bunging a 22-year-old a tenner and a can of Coke to answer some hypothetical investment questions, but the NAPF knows if it asked the same question of a 70-year-old struggling to afford to heat their home, it would get a set of very different answers.Their discussion, I explained, was so far removed from reality, that had my friends been present they would have nodded off within five minutes. Far from being offended, the delegates seemed to rather enjoy the cold water treatment. They were grateful to be reminded that most twenty-somethings don’t even have three months’ salary in the bank. They wanted a young person to burst their bubble and provide a fresh perspective.The government’s next move must be to employ a person to represent workers in their twenties and thirtiesThe government has hired Ros Altmann, an economist and independent pensions expert, as an “ older workers’ champion” to help older people continue working beyond retirement age. This is good, because it will help them preserve their wealth and be less reliant on state help that must be paid for by younger taxpayers.But the government’s next move must be to employ an equivalent person to represent workers in their twenties and thirties. Young people might not be interested in pensions, but they are worried about them, and with very good reason.Auto-enrolment means millions who didn’t have pensions before have them now, because they can’t be bothered to opt out. This is their first step to security. What they need now is an influential voice that understands the detail and can fight for a fair deal.Katie Morley is a personal finance writer at Investors Chronicle. katie.morley@ft.com.

55;AON;AON Plc;2014-08-10T17:31:47Z;Rule switch threatens £25bn hit for UK companies;IASB was prompted to reconsider its guidance;More than £25bn could be wiped off the balance sheets of Britain’s biggest companies if changes to how pension surpluses can be booked come into force, it has been claimed.Current rules allow companies to recognise surpluses in their pension schemes as assets on their balance sheets.However, proposals under consideration by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) will no longer allow surpluses to be accounted for in this method, unless there is a realistic chance the company will eventually have access to the funds.“We estimate that this proposal, if enacted, could wipe £25bn off FTSE 350 balance sheets,” said Lynda Whitney, partner with Aon Hewitt, the accountants. “This could be a potentially significant change which not only affects business with surpluses now, but those who are still managing deficits.”The IASB was prompted to reconsider its guidance after receiving a request for clarification on the availability of refunds from a defined benefit, or final salary, pension plan managed by an independent trustee.The IASB’s interpretations committee, which is considering the clarification request, has discussed whether an employer has an unconditional right to a refund of the scheme’s surplus.Aon estimates that about 25 per cent of FTSE 350 companies have an accounting surplus in the DB schemes and the proposal, if enacted, could knock £8bn off their balance sheets.Ms Whitney said the proposals will also limit potential for companies to book future deficit contributions as a balance sheet asset.“Aon estimates that, for the FTSE 350, this will add £20bn to balance sheet liabilities,” added Ms Whitney. “The changes could also negatively affect the P & L account of a company by increasing the charges relating to pension schemes.”At its July meeting, the interpretations committee requested further investigations into the impact of the proposal. However, observers said it was too early to make definitive statements about the outcome.“It is not yet clear from the committee’s discussions where this is going to end up,” said Charles Rodgers, senior consultant with Towers Watson, the actuarial consultants. “The proposals are not yet so sufficiently clear as to make a statement about the intended scope.”A spokesman for the IASB said that the proposal was due to be put before the committee again in September. However, he added that any amendment to current rules would be subject to a full public consultation.
56;AON;AON Plc;2014-07-18T17:13:50Z;Pensions and the risks of de-risking;Members of workplace schemes need to be aware of the pitfalls;"Deep within the balance sheets of some of the UK’s largest companies lingers a trillion-pound headache.These are companies, many of them household names, with traditional “final salary” pension plans, where the employer is on the hook for paying the retirement income of members for as long as they live.As longevity has increased, so the pain has intensified for thousands of employers, who have had to dig deeper into their pockets to make good their pension promises. Money that could have been used for investment or returned to shareholders is instead being used to honour promises made to employees years, or even decades, ago.Against this backdrop, insurers, banks and investment experts have stepped forward with complex new deals aimed at easing the burden of pension liabilities, which have collectively amassed to more than £1tn.These de-risking deals, known as “buy-ins” and “buyouts”, give employers an opportunity to shed some or all of their liabilities – for a price. Since the early days of the market in 2006, when about £1bn of de-risking deals were struck, the “bulk annuity” business has grown at a rapid pace, driven by more favourable market conditions and the entrance of new players bidding for business. About £9bn of deals, covering 200 employers, were struck last year, with an estimated 1m pension members affected. But 2014 is expected to be record-breaking.“Not so long ago a billion pound deal would have been a rare event,” says Jay Shah, co-head of business origination, of Pension Insurance Corporation, a leading player in the de-risking market.“But we are certainly seeing these deals get bigger with the trend for more mainstream companies wanting to de-risk.”While buy-ins and buyouts are helping employers cope with pension headaches, there are growing concerns that members’ interests are not being adequately safeguarded as the market rapidly evolves.——————————————-Your benefits in their handsIn the UK, pension de-risking is supported by regulators, who say the arrangements can help employers manage risks and improve member security (see below).De-risking deals fall broadly into two camps: buy-ins and buyouts.Under a buy-in, or “longevity swap”, responsibility for continuing to pay a member’s pension if they live longer than expected falls to an insurer or a bank, not the employer. Under these deals, members remain part of the company pension scheme but do not see any practical change to how their income is paid. The employer is effectively buying insurance against employees living longer than expected.“Buyouts” are more complicated arrangements negotiated between employers and insurance companies, and have the most impact on members. Under these deals, the employer severs its links with the scheme and farms it out to an insurer.“The argument for de-risking pension plans, for both sponsors and employees, is to improve the stability of the scheme,” explains Martin Bird, head of risk settlement with Aon Hewitt, the consultants.“As people have continued to live longer, pension costs have increased and getting rid of longevity risk is one way of making the scheme more stable.”Scheme trustees act as a safeguard for members in the de-risking process, but many lack the expertise and knowledge fully to understand the deals put before them. Trustees can also come under pressure to focus on the employer’s drive to get the best, often lowest cost, deal.“It can be a challenge for trustees really to understand what’s happening as these deals are incredibly complicated,” said David Cule, partner with Punter Southall, which provides actuarial and investment advice to trustees.“Some trustees will be experienced in this, but they are few and far between.”——————————————-Safety firstEmployers will often hire professionals to help trustees. But even with professional guidance, trustees can face pressures which can act against them securing the best possible outcome for members.One of the most critical jobs of the trustees is to ensure that members’ benefits, such as income or spouse’s benefits, are properly transferred to the insurers, who will write a contract for the member. The better these data are matched, the less chance of problems down the line for members. However, this task is not always given priority.“Data checking is time-consuming and should be the among very first thing done in a de-risking exercise,” says Emma Watkins, partner at Lane Clark & Peacock, the consultants. “But in some situations this is left until later in the process, largely as it is an upfront cost to the employer. In our view it should be done as early as possible to minimise the risk of future mismatches.”One other area of potential tension for trustees is the consideration given to the financial strength of the business taking on responsibility for members’ benefits, in whole or part.There’s been a bit too much focus on getting the best price for the employer, and not quite enough focus on making sure that you’ve got the best security for your members’ benefitsDarren Redmayne, UK chief executive of Lincoln International, which advises trustees, explains that more complex buyout deals tend to be arranged by actuarial or investment consultants who are focused on securing the best deal for the employer. They do not provide due diligence on counterparty risk or the financial strength of the insurers pitching for the deal.“I would suggest there’s been a bit too much focus on getting the best price for the employer, and not quite enough focus on making sure that you’ve got the best security for your members’ benefits,” says Mr Redmayne.“A working presumption for some trustees is that all buyouts and buy-ins provide similar security – they don’t.”“Like all insurance products, there are trade-offs between the premium you pay and the level of protection you get, both in terms of what the policy covers and the quality of provider.”Mr Redmayne notes that in the US, fiduciaries, who play a similar role to trustees in the UK, are legally bound to buy insurance for their members from the “safest” provider, no matter what the cost. However, in the UK there is no such obligation on trustees.“In the UK, if an insurer is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), it’s authorised to write the business and trustees are free to select on whatever basis they choose,” adds Mr Redmayne.“No one is requiring them to do due diligence on the providers.”——————————————-Boardroom trade-offsIn the case of a buyout the pension scheme is wound up and replaced by individual annuity policies issued by an insurer. One of the grey areas in these deals is what happens to benefits that were previously at the discretion of the trustees – such as whether to continue payments to a dependent after the death of a member. While a deal is being hammered out, these discretionary benefits form part of the bargaining process and are effectively up for grabs.“Codifying benefits, previously left to the discretion of the trustee, could result in a bigger premium for the employer,” notes Mr Cule.“Ultimately, these deals all come down to cost so trustees have to make some difficult decisions about what gets included and what doesn’t.”Another consideration is whether any commutation or transfer value payments from the insurer are equivalent to, or better than, they would have been under the scheme rules.“There are some differences in the regulatory environment that insurance companies and pension schemes operate within, which mean that the benefits may not be identical,” said Tom Ground, head of bulk annuity business with Legal & General.“A good example of this is that insurance companies, when offering a transfer value, have to be gender neutral and the pension scheme does not.”However, Mr Ground added that he believed that members in “the vast majority of instances” were slightly better off when taking a transfer value from an insurance company than from their employer’s scheme.——————————————-Complex strategiesThe rapid growth of the de-risking market is worrying consumer groups, who are concerned it is evolving without adequate member protections and joined-up regulatory oversight.In a 2013 report, academics at The Pensions Institute, part of the Cass Business School, expressed concerns about how well-equipped trustees were, particularly in smaller schemes, to act for members.“The overarching impression I have is that banks and insurers are increasingly keen to sell complex de-risking strategies to smaller and medium-sized schemes,” says Debbie Harrison, visiting professor at the Pensions Institute.“These are still uncharted waters for many trustees. The regulator has previously raised concerns in its reports about the capabilities of trustees of these schemes.”Get an idea of how much you should consider contributing and how much you could receive when you retireRegulators are also being called upon to pay closer scrutiny to insurers who have moved into the bulk annuity business since wide-ranging personal pension reforms were announced in the Budget.“There are concerns that some insurers are now pushing bulk purchase annuities because they have to make up for the massive losses they are suffering on retail annuities sales post-Budget, “adds Ms Harrison.“The FCA, the Pensions Regulator and the actuarial profession should consider the risks in existing bulk annuity buy-ins and buyouts, where an insurance company’s covenant has been weakened by the loss of business in the retail market and a fall in the company’s share price.”“A company’s financial strength is crucial for members.”While the PRA requires companies doing these de-risking deals to have appropriate capital and solvency to write their business, there have been casualties. In 2010, Paternoster, a specialist buyout company, was put up for sale, with tens of thousands of members under its charge, after closing its doors to new business. Buyout specialists Lucida and Synesis were also bought out after withdrawing from the market.We need trustees to act as a safeguard in the de-risking process, so it is essential that they work closely with their advisers to understand detailsThe Pensions Institute is now calling for a code of practice to be drawn up to ensure the market develops safely and efficiently with consistent regulation from both the FCA and PRA.The Pensions Regulator, which oversees workplace schemes and has previously underlined the importance of trustees exercising caution with regards to new or complex products, says it is “continuing to monitor developments in the de-risking sphere”.“The regulator supports de-risking products that offer value for money, assist in managing risks and improve member security,” said Stephen Soper, interim chief executive of TPR. “We need trustees to act as a safeguard in the de-risking process, so it is essential that they work closely with their advisers to understand details – including the extent to which risk is being managed, shifted into the future, or exchanged for risk of another sort.”——————————————-Q&A: pensions buyoutsEMI, InterContinental Hotels, the Rank Group and Carillion are just some of the major UK companies to have severed links with their pension schemes through a buyout in recent years. We explain how members are affected.What happens in a buy-out?Normally, your employer, or former employer, and the pension scheme trustees, are responsible for making sure pension promises are honoured when you retire.In a buyout, the company winds up its pension scheme and hands responsibility for paying the pension promises to an insurance company.All links with the former sponsor and trustees are then severed and the scheme member is issued with a contract from the insurance company.Do members have a say?Legally, sponsors must tell members soon after such a deal has been arranged. But there is no requirement to consult members on a proposed buyout.What will change for the member?Members’ entitlements, such as income and spousal benefits, should remain intact as they are written into the scheme rules. The scheme trustees are required to secure benefits in full, and obtain funding if needed for the buyout cost from the employer.What might change are the terms previously decided by the scheme actuary and trustees. These include terms such how pension income is converted into a cash lump sum; transfer valuations and payments for those retiring before or after the scheme’s normal retirement age,Is it possible for my benefits to be cut?No. In rare instances, the income can be boosted – 40,000 members of the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund secured a 2.2 per cent pension increase after a recent buyout.What is my safety net if things go wrong?Members of defined benefit schemes are protected by the Pension Protection Fund. On buyout, the protection regime switches from PPF to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.If an employer becomes insolvent, retired final-salary scheme members can generally expect to continue receiving 100 per cent of their pension. Those who are not yet retired will have 90 per cent of their benefits protected, up to a cap of about £31,000.The FSCS will pay 90 per cent of all benefits to all members – retired and not yet retired – with no cap. Buyouts are more common for schemes with retired, rather than active, members.While the PPF safety net appears more generous for pensioners, annual increases are restricted, with no increases on pre-1997 service.Whom do I deal with after a buyout?Once a buyout is complete, communications about your pension will come from the insurance company and not your employer, or former employer.What if I have a problem with the insurance company?If you cannot resolve the complaint with the company, you can take your dispute to the Financial Ombudsman Service, whose decisions are binding on both parties."
57;AON;AON Plc;2014-07-06T03:18:48Z;Investment consultants’ stranglehold on pensions questioned;UK legal body publishes review into investment consultants’ influence;The stranglehold investment consultants have over the pension fund industry has long been a source of frustration for fund managers, but it has now begun to alarm lawmakers as well.Last week the Law Commission, an independent body that reviews law reform in England and Wales, urged the government to “actively monitor” how the investment consultant industry operates. “Lack of regulation in this area does appear anomalous,” it said.In a report issued by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the legal body said the government should also consider commissioning independent research into how consultants are regulated.The aim would be to investigate whether the three biggest investment consultants, Towers Watson, Mercer and Aon Hewitt, have become too powerful in determining how pension funds invest the money saved by their members.Gary Mairs, a partner at investment house TCF, says: “As investment consulting is often bundled up with other services, [such as] wider employee benefit work and HR consulting from the same provider, there is clearly much scope for conflicts of interests.“Moreover, there is a significant lack of transparency and it is very difficult to compare the success of the investment recommendations from one investment consultant to another.”The former head of legal at one of the UK’s biggest fund companies adds: “I saw how much control consultants have, and how much asset managers quivered in their boots when they showed up. With that level of power, there should be more accountability.”The dominance of these consultancies potentially leads pension schemes to receive similar advice and creates “herding” patterns of investment behaviour, the commission’s report found.Its findings were based on feedback from 61 market participants, including the National Association of Pension Funds and the Association of British Insurers, as well as several law firms and investment consultancies.Of these respondents, more than three-quarters said there was a need to review how investment consultants are regulated. Only 10 per cent believed such a review was redundant.Towers Watson agreed that “the regulation of investment consultants now seems somewhat dated”.The respondents also raised fears about the possibility of conflicts of interests if, for example, an investment consultant has a close relationship with a fund manager, or if a consultancy steers investors towards in-house products.Although the investment market broadly recognises that the investment consultant industry is imperfect, many are opposed to the introduction of new laws.Karen Shackleton, senior adviser at AllenBridge Epic, an investment advisory company, believes the industry can come up with its own solution.She says: “Regulation is sometimes necessary and it may be that is ultimately the route authorities have to take, but this is an area that could be resolved by having an independent adviser who sits on the side of trustees to challenge the consultants and ensures interests are aligned.”Ms Shackleton says this would not add an extra layer of fees as pension fund trustees would not follow all of the advice consultants put to them, which would ultimately reduce costs.Michael Johnson, a pensions expert at the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, believes the greater problem is the fact that many pension trustees are amateurs who lack investment expertise, or are conflicted in their business objectives.He says: “Regulation of investment consultants would add to costs and, most likely, ultimately achieve very little. [It is the] wrong solution for the wrong problem. Trustees should be personally liable, in law, as per Australia.”The commission acknowledged difficulties in applying new rules to the investment consulting industry, in particular given that this would require diverging from the Mifid regulations, Europe’s rule book on financial markets.Nonetheless, the legal body does appear to favour some kind of rule change, according to Paul Lee, head of investment affairs at the NAPF.He says: “The regulatory route is clearly the commission’s favoured route for the investment consultants. Although they note the limitations of the scope for regulating investment consultants, they are in effect saying there is a need here and [regulation] is the way that need should be filled.”Vince Cable, the UK business secretary, will examine the commission’s report, which also looked at the wider role of investment intermediaries and their fiduciary duties, with the help of the Pensions Regulator and the Financial Conduct Authority.Mr Cable is expected to decide whether to take up the commission’s suggestion of issuing independent research on consultants in September, alongside his response to the commission’s recommendations.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Market works well . . . in some cases / From Dr J E Woods
58;AON;AON Plc;2014-06-30T23:00:26Z;Call for pensions consultants to be regulated;;The Law Commission has urged the UK government to consider regulating pensions consultants as concern grows over the power of the big three investment advisory firms.The commission, an independent body that advises on changes to the law in England and Wales, is concerned that Towers Watson, Mercer and Aon Hewitt, the biggest companies in the consultancy market, have become too powerful in determining how pension funds invest the money saved by their members.In a report published on Tuesday the commission said: “The lack of regulation of investment consultants does appear anomalous, and we would ask that the government actively monitor this area.”Concern has grown that large investors are wasting money on advice from investment consultants given the funds they recommend often do not outperform.The dominance of these consultancies potentially leads pension schemes to receive similar advice and creates “herding” patterns of investment behaviour, according to the commission’s report.A recent survey of 716 pension schemes by the National Association of Pension Funds showed that the big three investment consultancies advise approximately half of its members. The top six consultancies advise roughly 70 per cent of the schemes included in the survey.The NAPF said: “A great deal of influence sits in the hands of very few consultants.”Towers Watson, however, said that it would welcome new regulation, provided that it did not lead to unintended consequences such as increased costs for investors or reduced competition by raising the barriers to entry in the market.Current regulation of the industry “seems somewhat dated”, admitted Robin Penfold, senior investment consultant at Towers Watson. “To help all trust-based pension funds to get a minimum standard of advice in these matters, we would advocate that such advice be regulated,” he said.Mercer, by contrast, said that it opposed the regulation of investment consultants because they already owe a duty of care to their clients in all advice offered. The absence of regulation also enables pension funds to receive advice from a range of providers, including independent experts, actuaries and investment managers, according to Mercer.But greater oversight of the investment consulting industry is long overdue, said several market participants.Gary Mairs, a partner at UK investment house TCF, said: “Although it can be argued that the institutional clients should be big enough to stand up for themselves, often investment consultants act as the decision maker.“As investment consulting is often bundled up with other services, [such as] wider employee benefit work and HR consulting, there is also clearly scope for conflict of interests.“An appropriate regulatory structure would presumably ensure conflicts are properly managed, ensure the advice is backed up by appropriate resources and processes, drive transparency and, in turn, rout out the weaker players.”Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, an asset management consultancy, agreed, but he warned that it will be difficult to put new regulations in place.“In principle, there is a case for regulating consultants. In practice, however, this is easier said than done. Attempts to prescribe a code of conduct have the unintended effect of dumbing down what they do,” he said.Mr Rajan instead recommended that the UK look towards the Dutch system where pay for consultants is increasingly linked to the funding ratio of their clients. “Such developments are likely to be more effective than regulation, which can often be a blunt instrument,” he said.

62;AON;AON Plc;2014-03-19T17:28:30Z;Besso fined £315,00 by FCA for insufficient bribery controls;;Besso, the insurance broker, must pay a £315,000 fine after the UK financial watchdog found that it did not have tight enough controls against bribery.The weak controls “gave rise to an unacceptable risk that payments made by Besso to third parties could be used for corrupt practices, including paying bribes to persons connected with the insured or public officials”, the Financial Conduct Authority said in its published findings against the London-headquartered broker.Besso did not have strict enough controls between 2005 and 2009 despite an industry-wide warning from the regulator to companies, and a £5.25m fine in 2009 levied on Aon, another insurance broker, for similar failings, the FCA said.Besso only tightened up its controls in August 2011 and later instructed a law firm to undertake a review, which was then handed to the watchdog.Besso co-operated with the FCA and so qualified for a 30 per cent discount on its fine, which otherwise would have been £450,000. The FCA acknowledged that there was no evidence that the company behaved recklessly, and that the majority of payments to third parties were not made in countries with a high risk of bribery.“The FCA has not said that Besso permitted any illicit payment or inducement to any such third party,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. “Further, the FCA recognised that Besso made significant efforts to improve its systems and controls framework. The FCA acknowledged that Besso is a medium sized broker in the wholesale insurance market whose business does not, overall, pose a high bribery and corruption risk.”July 2011 saw the implementation of the UK Bribery Act, which overhauled the country’s anti-corruption legislation and made it easier to prosecute companies for bribery no matter where in the world it allegedly took place.One defence to allegations of Bribery Act breaches is for the company to prove that it has “adequate procedures” to guard against corruption.While the Serious Fraud Office, which is the main prosecutor of offences under the Bribery Act, has brought charges against individuals for breaching the legislation, it is yet to mount a corporate prosecution.“The FCA has shown, again, that it is no slouch when it comes to anti-bribery systems and controls enforcement. Meanwhile, the SFO has yet to show its hand. Authorised firms can be in no doubt. On the other hand, those adopting a wait-and-see approach to SFO enforcement are left wondering, will it ever happen?” said Barry Vitou, a lawyer at Pinsent Masons.
63;AON;AON Plc;2013-12-05T07:34:42Z;Fresh priorities prompt bosses to cut their hours;Four executives explain why they decided to work less;"Lily Lapenna
Social entrepreneur Lily Lapenna, 33, is an enthusiastic convert to flexible working and promotes it among her team and the young entrepreneurs she mentors.The founder and chief executive of MyBnk, which equips young people with the skills to manage money and become work-ready, is also an example of the compromises and collaboration needed to make flexibility work.When expecting her first child last year, she resolved not to let her maternity leave interrupt the charity’s growth. She hired Guy Rigden, a microfinance expert and former senior executive at Credit Suisse, as full-time expansion director.She assumed she would quickly return full-time, but her plan changed after her baby daughter was in hospital for two weeks with meningitis. She promoted Mr Rigden to be her deputy, and they now share the job of running the educational organisation, both working reduced weeks.With 25 staff and 17 freelancers, MyBnk is taking its model to countries such as Italy, Ireland and China. Ms Lapenna is an active speaker and lobbyist for youth empowerment and was involved in the successful campaign to include financial education in the national curriculum in England, starting from next year.Ten of her staff work part-time, including her executive assistant, who is developing her own online business, and the communications director, who is also a part-time DJ and journalist. “We like people to work in a way that energises them and keeps them driven,” she says.“When I set up MyBnk, I felt I was overwhelmed and working really hard,” says Ms Lapenna, named as a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader two years ago. “What I’m trying to impart to young entrepreneurs is that that isn’t the only way. You can have impact by working more effectively in less time.”

Patrick Foley
Patrick Foley, chief economist and one of the 50 most senior leaders at Lloyds Banking Group, has set himself an extreme sporting challenge: to win his age group in a qualifying race to compete in the Ironman world championship in Hawaii next year.This means he must nearly double his usual hours of training for the swim-cycle-run triathlon to between 15 and 20 a week – so this year he asked to move from working full-time to a three-day week.“Ironman is the equivalent of swimming across the Bristol Channel, cycling from Bristol to London and doing the London marathon,” says Mr Foley, 60. “It was increasingly difficult to fit the training in.”There were other reasons for reducing his hours: he and his wife want more time to visit their grown-up family; he plans to write a book; and he is looking for non-executive directorships in other sectors to help him understand the issues faced by the bank’s customers, he says.He and his team advise the board and top management on strategic economic issues, providing analysis and forecasting. Instead of having two set days off a week, he works as flexibly as possible – full-time when there are big projects to handle and taking time away when things are quieter. He believes his reduced work pattern has been beneficial all round.“I’m more productive if I’m working flexibly,” he says. “I think it’s been good for the rest of my team, too. Some are getting exposure at senior levels they wouldn’t have got, attending meetings and making presentations on my behalf. They often have to make decisions when I’m not there, but I’m always available if they’re really uncertain.”Sally Bridgeland
Falling off a cliff while skiing left Sally Bridgeland lying in a small patch of snow with several broken bones and a vertical drop beside her. She said to herself: “You were really lucky. What are you going to do with this second chance?”Assessing her successful career as an actuary and pensions consultant, she realised there was much more she wanted to do, including being a parent. After the birth of her child, she took extended leave and decided not to work full-time again. Her then employer, Aon Hewitt, was happy for her to move to three days a week.It was on that basis that she was recruited in 2007 to be chief executive of BP Pension Trustees, overseeing the running of one of the country’s leading pension funds with assets of nearly £19bn and 80,000 members. She now works a 60 per cent contract over five days, leaving at 3pm each day to help her nine-year-old son with his homework and dealing with emails later in the evening.She says it is important to be open about her working pattern and she encourages her executive team of 10 to fit their work around their other responsibilities. “You have to be seen to be doing it. The two men who have joined since I have been in charge are family men and having a boss who is heart-on-sleeve about that being a priority was attractive to them.”Ms Bridgeland, 49, says she is “hooked” on new work styles and advocates that managers take a mid-career gap year to reassess their priorities, especially given longer working lives. She has also just set up a charity, Executive Shift, to advise senior people on moving from full-time work into wider activities.She makes being a part-time chief executive work by being committed, highly organised, delegating to her team and being realistic about what she can do.

Richard Lanyon-Hogg
There will be a backlash against today’s always-on work mode, says Richard Lanyon-Hogg, a technical director and distinguished engineer for sustainability at IBM, the IT company. “This whole drive towards a mobile way of working is impinging so much on the wellness of people.”“Individuals will kick back against this ‘always-on’ culture. People need space to care for themselves. If you can’t care for yourself, how can you care for others?” he asks.A mobile worker himself, 54-year-old Mr Lanyon-Hogg moved to a four-day week for his own wellbeing six years ago. “I was reaching the point where I felt there is so much more to life than just work.”An expert in sustainable IT solutions to business challenges, he also cultivates woodland in Wales and has planted 21,000 trees. Having more time to use his hands and making things in his “eco-shed” opened his mind to new ideas, he says.“I found I was being much more creative in my thinking in my work at IBM and much more innovative in the ideas I was taking to clients.”He is technical director of a business portfolio worth several hundred million pounds and leader of a community of hundreds of IBM engineers who call on him for advice. Working four days a week means “you have to be ruthless about priorities”, he says.His advice on reduced hours? “Be true to your values and don’t feel guilty about switching appliances off. It’s your life. If you say yes to everything, you get nothing done.”"
64;AON;AON Plc;2013-11-15T18:26:42Z;Take care when choosing alternative route;Smart beta indices attract investors;Since the 1970s financial academics have pointed out the flaws in market capitalisation-weighted equity indices. There is plenty of compelling research illustrating a variety of different approaches to indexing that promise to give better returns with lower risk.Until recently, however, it has been difficult for investors to find a wide range of well-priced alternative market indices. Advances in technology have made it much easier for fund management companies to offer a wide array of different index products, often referred to as smart beta products.These can be viewed in two broad categories. There are those that aim to reformulate an index using a metric other than market capitalisation. One technique is to use another economic metric such as cash flow per share, dividend income or book value. These are known as fundamental indices.The second category aims to control some of the risks associated with equity investing, principally the volatility risk. These are known as low volatility indices and their proponents say that on a historical basis and in risk-adjusted terms, these strategies do better than the market over the long term.While there is a very broad range of indices available, it is easier to find products for some strategies than others. And investors need to find those strategies which suit them best while avoiding the pitfalls.Phil Tindall, senior investment consultant at Towers Watson, says: “The best types of strategies are those that are more transparent, straightforward and easy to understand – and which avoid proprietary processes such as optimisation.”The decision to buy an alternative index strategy means that the asset owner is taking much of the responsibility for performance on to their own shoulders rather than transferring that task to an active manager.“It’s really important for them to understand the characteristics: the simpler the product, the easier it is to know what you are buying,” says Mr Tindall.It is also important to have realistic performance expectations. “These strategies should be used over the long term and the investor must accept that there will be periods when market-cap indices will perform better,” adds Mr Tindall.While there is a broad range of alternative index products available, low volatility indices have been the most popular, garnering the greatest asset flow.The appeal of a low volatility index is straightforward: the returns on equities are appealing yet their volatility is off-putting. Low volatility indices allow investors to access those returns while keeping a lid on this particular risk.But there are a number of factors that investors should be aware of before taking the plunge into minimum volatility indices. The recent popularity of this alternative index makes it harder to find fair value.Tim Giles, partner at Aon Hewitt, says: “We have seen a lot of funds flowing into minimum volatility recently, which has pushed up the prices of this product – making it look less favourable over the medium-term.”Investors should also be aware that the stocks that are often included in low volatility indices tend to be concentrated in certain sectors such as consumer staples and utilities. These stocks appeal to other investors because of their defensive nature or high dividend income, which further increases demand and pushes up the price.Alan Miller, chief investment officer of SCM Private, says: “Many of the stocks that make up a minimum volatility index currently have the worst combination, namely low inherent growth with a very demanding valuation.”It is worth noting that, recently, low volatility indices have underperformed market-cap weighted indices. But that is to be expected: minimum volatility indices underperform during bull markets and outperform during bear markets. For example, during the tech bubble in the late 1990s traditional indices outperformed minimum volatility indices.Imke Hollander, head of investment strategy research at Blue Sky Group, says: “Minimum volatility should not perform well in this type of environment. But when there is stress in the market, such as during the financial crisis, they perform very well. It’s important to look at performance over the cycle.”While minimum volatility indices may not seem as good value at the moment, fundamental strategies have appealing characteristics. Mr Giles says: “The prices on these indices have not suffered in the same way because of their intrinsic focus on fundamental value.”Mr Tindall concurs: “A fundamentally-weighted index is attractive because it’s a relatively straightforward product and the design means they exploit well-known investment characteristics such as value.” This is because fundamental indices create a bias towards stocks trading at a low price relative to their fundamentals.Whichever alternative investment is chosen, it is vital that investors have their eyes wide open. Jeff Molitor, Vanguard’s chief investment officer Europe, says: “Investors must know what they are buying, and recognise they are taking a position that might not work in all market environments, even if the historic data are compelling. They should also take a look at the returns after cost.”
65;AON;AON Plc;2013-10-22T17:10:47Z;Willis to unveil Berkshire Hathaway tie-up;;While a flood of money pours into reinsurance as investors such as pension funds snap up catastrophe bonds, the way in which the primary insurance industry is funded is also changing.Willis, the broker, will on Wednesday unveil details of a new scheme under which it will allocate as much as a quarter of some of the business it places in London’s specialist corporate insurance market to preselected underwriters.Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which this year entered into a similar arrangement with Aon, Willis’s bigger rival, is, along with the People’s Insurance Company of China and Hiscox, the Lloyd’s of London insurer, preparing to sign up.Traditionally, the price and other terms of any complex corporate policy written in London are determined by a “lead” underwriter.A remaining share of the premium income – and the associated risk of any claims – are divided between several other insurers.However, normally each insurer takes an active decision on whether or not to follow the lead. This is not the case with Aon’s and Willis’s “follow-market” facilities.Critics complain such “blind” underwriting schemes lack checks and balances, exploit Lloyd’s underwriting expertise and risk squeezing out smaller syndicates.However, Alastair Swift, head of global placement at Willis, says the new arrangement will be an important source of additional funding to the sector.It will help keep prices down and allow companies to buy coverage for complex risks that they would otherwise struggle to secure, he says.Parties involved in the proposed Willis arrangement say there are important differences between it and Aon’s deal with Berkshire.Sasa Brcerevic, chief operating officer of Hiscox’s London market business, says that although Hiscox will be entitled to a share of the business Willis places, it will still be able to opt out of individual policies.
66;AON;AON Plc;2013-09-26T16:33:30Z;Lloyd’s chairman raises concerns over Aon deal with Buffett;;The Lloyd’s of London chairman has directed fresh criticism at a contentious scheme that Aon, one of the world’s biggest insurance brokers, has set up with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.Presenting interim results, John Nelson said the levels of additional premiums that Aon was directing to Lloyd’s as a direct result of the arrangement was “minute” in the context of the market’s overall size.Aon, responsible for broking almost a quarter of Lloyd’s business, has begun automatically allocating 7.5 per cent of all insurance premiums it places at the market to Berkshire.It has caused concern at Lloyd’s because Berkshire does not make an active decision to underwrite each individual risk. Critics complain the scheme exploits Lloyd’s underwriting expertise and risks squeezing smaller syndicates.However in recent weeks Aon provided Lloyd’s executives with figures showing the amount of business it places at Lloyd’s has risen since the arrangement, named Sidecar by the broker, took effect.In a letter to Lloyd’s, Aon’s chief executive Steve McGill said “the data so far indicates that Sidecar is indeed good for clients, good for London – and good for Lloyd’s”.Mr Nelson said Lloyd’s had a “strong” relationship with Aon and acknowledged it had brought more business to Lloyd’s during the period. But he added this was largely for reasons other than the Berkshire arrangement.The chairman reiterated on Thursday that he had problems with the way in which Sidecar had been structured.Asked if the amount of business Aon was bringing to Lloyd’s because of Sidecar was significant, he said: “In the scheme of things, because of the amounts involved, the short answer is no.”“The concern we had was that this would proliferate. They might do much more [than 7.5 per cent] – they would set a precedent…for underwriting blind, and that is not healthy.”But he added: “They’ve no present plans to increase it.”Aon says the arrangement is a welcome source of additional funding and helps insurance buyers secure affordable coverage. Clients can opt out.Lloyd’s said on Thursday that the 87 syndicates that comprise the market wrote £15.5bn worth of premiums in the first six months of the year. Assuming currencies had been constant this was up 3.3 per cent on a year earlier.The market paid £86m less in claims than a year ago. The total bill, including flooding in central Europe and Canada and the tornado in Oklahoma, came to £6.54bn.Even so, pre-tax profits fell 10 per cent to £1.38bn as Lloyd’s made £372m less from its investment portfolio, with a return of only 0.5 per cent.Richard Ward, chief executive of Lloyd’s and a former head of the International Petroleum Exchange, is leaving at the end of the year.Mr Nelson said he had a preference for a candidate who had a background in the insurance sector.Separately, the chairman said Lloyd’s had “no reason to believe” its members had violated new US sanctions against Iran. New York’s leading financial services regulator has been probing alleged links of non-US insurers with the country.
67;AON;AON Plc;2013-09-04T22:53:57Z;Lloyd’s chairman warns on ‘systemic risk’ of capital rush;Lloyd’s chairman fears consequences of capital rush;The chairman of Lloyd’s of London has warned of the danger that a rush of capital into the insurance industry will cause “systemic problems” akin to those of the banking sector during the financial crisis.John Nelson, head of the historic insurance market, spoke out about the risks of adverse consequences from non-traditional funding of insurance, which he said was occurring “on a scale not seen before”.“We all vividly remember the systemic problems which arose in the banking industry . . . where capital became detached from the underlying transaction of risk,” he said. “The insurance industry must avoid these traps.”His comments come as low interest rates encourage mainstream investors stung by weak returns from traditional assets to pour capital into the insurance industry in a hunt for yield.Tens of billions of pounds of fresh funding from investors such as pension funds – especially into reinsurance, or insurance for insurers– has helped keep premiums for consumers and businesses low.However, some insurers fear the industry may not be pricing risks appropriately which could leave inexperienced investors at risk of big losses. Insurance “can be a dangerous business for those who do not understand it”, said Mr Nelson on Wednesday.Meanwhile, some capital providers – notably US billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway – have begun passively following the decisions taken by other insurers– a contrast to the traditional model under which underwriting syndicates take an active decision on whether or not to take on a policy.Some underwriters at Lloyd’s, especially smaller insurers, are concerned that such passive schemes could put them under pressure.“Some of the structures being used could undermine some of the qualities of the insurance model,” said Mr Nelson in his speech to a City audience.“All of us in this industry . . . need to be extremely watchful on this. We have seen the consequences in other parts of the Financial Services industry [without adequate supervision] – and the pain that it caused to worldwide markets, to economies and to the underlying customers.”Mr Nelson said fresh sources of funding “properly deployed, provide opportunity as well as a threat” given the expected increase in demand for insurance as emerging economies grow.The non-traditional sources of capital are a source of competition for traditional underwriters at Lloyd’s and put pressure on the prices they can charge policyholders.Aon, which brokers the Berkshire Hathaway scheme, has said the arrangement provides a welcome source of additional capital and keeps its clients’ premiums low while insurance buyers can opt out of it.Lloyd’s came close to collapse in the 1990s but has since recovered and was lauded last night by Andrew Bailey, a leading regulator.The “successful market” was “based on sound prudential fundamentals”, said Mr Bailey, who heads the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority.
68;AON;AON Plc;2013-08-13T17:55:09Z;Small insurers warn of risks in Willis plan for passive scheme;Insurance broker Willis to sign up several insurers to scheme;Insurance broker Willis is set to sign up several leading London insurers to a Warren Buffett-style “passive” underwriting scheme that critics warn risks driving their smaller rivals out of business.In the latest sign of a shake-up to the industry, Dominic Casserley, Willis’s chief executive, said the broker was pressing ahead with the arrangement in response to demand from insurance buyers.It comes even though leading insurance executives have spoken out against a similar deal that Aon, a rival broker, struck earlier this year with US billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.Normally, each underwriting syndicate in the London insurance market takes an active decision on whether or not to take on a policy.But under the arrangement as launched by Aon and as proposed by Willis, however, the brokers automatically place a share of all risks with preselected underwriters.The insurers that participate blindly follow the decisions taken by rivals, allowing them to avoid costs of employing underwriters. However, corporate insurance buyers can opt out of such schemes.Such schemes potentially reduce premiums for insurance buyers, because they can increase the amount of capital supplied to the sector. They can mean each risk is scrutinised by fewer underwriters.But critics complain the benefits for buyers risk being short-term and could undermine underwriting expertise.The head of one of Willis’s and Aon’s biggest rivals, UK-listed Jardine Lloyd Thompson, said such across the board deals were against the interest of insurance buyers.“These are not sustainable models,” said Dominic Burke. “They’re usually crash and burn.”The Willis scheme may effect as much as a fifth of premiums it places in London, potentially bigger than Aon’s arrangement, which automatically allocates 7.5 per cent to Berkshire.However, Willis wants to involve not only one but several leading insurers and to be flexible about some of the terms.In his first comments about Willis’s plans, Mr Casserley said the broker was in “deep conversations” with several insurers who were “ready” to sign up to the scheme, which Willis is hoping to launch within weeks.Mr Casserley said he recognised such schemes could put smaller insurers under pressure. “I’m sure when we exercise what we’re going to do, some people will be disappointed. But they certainly will know we listened.”
69;AON;AON Plc;2013-07-25T17:34:38Z;Berkshire Hathaway derided for ‘foolish’ Aon deal;;Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has been branded “foolish” by a leading insurance executive for blindly following underwriting decisions taken by Lloyd’s of London rivals.An unusual deal that Berkshire has struck with the insurance broker Aon is likely to “end in tears”, warned Richard Brindle, founder and chief executive of FTSE 250-listed specialist insurer Lancashire.Lloyd’s officials have already complained that the arrangement – under which Aon has begun to automatically allocate a chunk of all business it places at the historic market to Berkshire – threatens to undermine underwriting expertise.Yet Mr Brindle’s criticism of the arrangement goes further, warning of risks to Berkshire itself.“They’re smart guys, Berkshire – a lot of us were scratching our heads asking why on earth they have done that.“You’ve got to be able to select risks in our business,” he said. “I’ve been in this business a long time and I’ve never known a full-follow facility like that to work.”The set-up is different to usual underwriting arrangements, where each Lloyd’s syndicate takes an active decision on whether or not to take on an insurance policy.Although other “passive” deals between brokers and insurers have been in place for years in niche areas, Aon’s set-up with Berkshire is much more wide ranging.“They’re always done in a softening market [when prices for insurance are low], because people get desperate for premium growth,” said Mr Brindle, who founded Lancashire in 2005 and transformed it from an Aim-quoted minnow into an underwriting powerhouse.“I’m not a Lloyd’s insider but I suspect there’s been a lot of talk behind scenes and the kibosh has been put on any further such deals.”Berkshire did not return calls seeking comment. Aon has defended the deal, saying it is acting in the interests of corporate insurance buyers – who are able to opt out – and that the Berkshire arrangement helps keep their premiums low.Mr Brindle was speaking as Lancashire disclosed that it lost $8m from its investment portfolio in the first half of the year as a result of lower bond prices, contributing to a year-on-year drop in pre-tax profits from $137.2m to $107.1m.The group wrote $423.9m worth of premiums, down from $514.8m in the same period a year earlier.Lancashire also increased its estimate of the loss it sustained from the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster by $37.7m.But in the absence of other large losses, the insurer paid out a lower-than-expected 58.8p in claims and expenses for every pound in premiums. The results were better than the market anticipated and the shares closed up 4 per cent to 816p.Mr Brindle said Lancashire was better placed than peers to deal with intensifying competition given its focus on specialist forms of insurance.He said investors could expect Lancashire to return its earnings to shareholders for the year, after an interim dividend of $0.05. Diluted earnings per share rose to $0.74 from $0.57 in the same period last year.
70;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Lloyd’s executive warns over dangers of Buffett’s Aon deal;;A top Lloyd’s of London executive has warned that Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle risks undermining the expertise of the historic British market by taking a passive approach to insurance risk.Normally each syndicate at Lloyd’s takes an active decision on whether or not to take on an insurance policy. But under the terms of an unusual deal that Berkshire Hathaway has struck with insurance broker Aon, it automatically follows the decisions taken by other Lloyd’s insurers. This allows it to avoid the costs associated with employing underwriting teams.Luke Savage, finance director at Lloyd’s, has warned that this arrangement exploits the London market and risks working against the long-term interests of policyholders.“All credit to Berkshire Hathaway – they are going to be getting the return of Lloyd’s without having to make the investment around underwriting expertise that the Lloyd’s market does make every day,” he said.Aon has begun to automatically allocate $7.50 in every $100 worth of premiums it places at Lloyd’s to Berkshire. In contrast to the traditional underwriting approach, Berkshire does not take an “active” view of each risk, or the level of premium that the insurance buyers should pay – even though it is liable to pay out a 7.5 per cent share of any claims.Speaking at an Insurance Insider conference, Mr Savage said: “It’s effectively a tracker fund on Lloyd’s …It is a potential threat.”“How sustainable is that in the long term?” he asked. “If it starts to undermine the expertise within the Lloyd’s market, is that actually in the long term interests of the client?”His comments come as regulators scrutinise insurance brokers’ business models. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority unveiled plans on Tuesday to launch a probe into possible “conflicts of interest” in the industry.Such deals between brokers and insurers already exist in niche areas. However, Aon’s set-up with Berkshire is much more wide ranging. Lloyd’s is concerned such arrangements could lead to a lack of risk oversight.Some smaller underwriters at the three centuries-old market are concerned that Aon, which is responsible for arranging almost a quarter of business done at Lloyd’s, will allocate business to Berkshire that would otherwise go to them.Aon is paid a commission by Berkshire. The broker would not say how much, but said the terms and conditions were the same as those for any Lloyd’s underwriter.Aon, which last year uprooted its headquarters from Chicago to London, said it was acting in the interests of its clients, saying Berkshire was providing a welcome source of additional capital and keeping their premiums low.Clients of the world’s second biggest insurance broker – which turn to Lloyd’s to underwrite complex risks, ranging from celebrities’ limbs to oil rigs – are able to opt out of the arrangement, the first of its kind in the insurance industry.Aon said: “It is a natural fit for Aon and Berkshire Hathaway to work together in London to deliver additional capacity to our clients around the world who may be subject to domestic capacity constraints.”The broker, which calls the Berkshire arrangement Sidecar, added: “Based on our experience to date and the reaction of clients, the Sidecar transaction has proven to be excellent for clients, a positive for Lloyd’s and good for the London market.”Mr Savage indicated some Lloyd’s underwriters would not be too upset by the 7.5 per cent share Aon had begun allocating to Berkshire but that they would grow more concerned if the proportion rose.Berkshire Hathaway did not respond to requests for comment.

74;AON;AON Plc;2013-04-07T23:01:22Z;Man Utd signs Aon deal kicks offdeal with Asian goal;US insurance broker signs eight-year deal to sponsor Premier League club’s training ground and training kit in move to target Asian fan base;Manchester United has signed an eight-year deal worth nearly $240m with Aon to sponsor the club’s training ground and training kit as the US insurance broker hopes to secure a place in the hearts of the football club’s huge Asian fan base.Man Utd’s training ground at Carrington will be renamed the Aon Training Complex and Aon replaces DHL as the club’s training kit sponsor.Aon will pay between $25m and $30m per year illustrating the continuing ability of Premier League teams to attract big investment, andMan Utd’s position as one of the world’s most commercially successful football clubs. It comes within months of the club securing a record $559m seven-season shirt sponsorship deal with General Motors, more than double its previous deal with Aon whose contract to brand Man Utd shirts ends next year.Man Utd, which floated in New York last year, became the first Premier League team to secure separate sponsorship for their training kit in 2010 after it reached a four-year contract with DHL worth £40m. The football club bought out the contract in October in an attempt to lure in a more lucrative offer.The new Aon deal, which also includes branding surrounding the club’s tours abroad, is worth almost double the $120m the group spent on the four-year deal to sponsor Man Utd’s shirts in 2009. “It’s a substantial commitment,” said one insider.Phil Clement, chief marketing officer at Aon, said: “We are continuing to invest very aggressively in the brand.” The insurance broker and human resources group is hoping to continue to deepen its exposure to Man Utd’s large following in Asia.“We’ve gone from no brand awareness in countries like Japan and South Korea to incredible brand awareness,” said Mr Clement. “It’s been an explosion. What we needed to do was translate that awareness into an understanding of what we do.”Greg Case, chief executive at Aon, said the two parties had discussed renewing Aon’s shirt deal, but opted instead for the training ground deal. As part of the agreement, the human resources group will provide Man Utd with advice on everything from player data analysis to risk management.While other clubs, such as Arsenal and Manchester City have sold sponsorship rights to their stadiums rather than training grounds, Man Utd has said it has no plans to rename Old Trafford. Ed Woodward, executive vice-chairman, said: “Old Trafford will not be sold.”With the club’s new kit contract with Nike up for renewal and expected to bring in anywhere between $90m and $120m annually, the Aon deal means that the football club could receive over $1.5bn in sponsorship alone over the next seven years.
75;AON;AON Plc;2013-02-21T14:56:50Z;India: wages growth forecast to slow to 10 per cent but is still Asia’s fastest;;"It is the second day of a bandh, a general strike in India triggered by rising prices and economic reforms that are seen as “anti-labour”.And in the middle of all this, new data has been released predicting that wage growth in 2013 will be the slowest India has seen in a decade – excluding 2009, the height of the sub-prime crisis.The average increase in wages will be 10.3 per cent this calendar year (click chart to enlarge), down from 10.7 per cent in 2012 and 12.7 per cent in 2011. This according to a survey of 518 organizations in India conducted between December 2012 and January 2013 by Aon Hewitt, the consultancy.This projection reflects the slowdown in the wider Indian economy, where the GDP forecast has been reduced, car sales are sliding and industrial output is shrinking.Sandeep Chaudhary, a partner in Aon Hewitt India’s talent and rewards team, commented: “Though business sentiment is strengthening on account of inflation reaching a three year low and stock markets rising upwards, the cautious streak is evident in the projected salary increase numbers.”Even so, the forecast leaves India with the highest rate of wage growth in the Asia Pacific (click chart to enlarge). China- where the government plans to raise the minimum wage to tackle inequality – is expected to see the region’s second fastest growth in wages in 2013, at 9.3 per cent.Within India itself, the growth in employees’ income is increasingly correlated with their capability. The differential between the average salary increase and the increase for those identified as “key talent” is expected to rise from 22 per cent in 2010 to 35 per cent in 2013. A statement from Aon Hewitt explains:With shrinking salary budgets, organisations are creating sharp differentiation in salary increases between their key talent and the rest of the population.Chaudhary told beyondbrics: “Today when organisations are looking at compensation, unlike yesteryear when they were looking at it in isolation, they now look at compensation with performance and productivity. It’s a general change in focus but it is coming under the microscope because the times are tough.”Splitting the 10.3 per cent figure by sector, wage growth accurately reflects the success of particular industries (click chart to enlarge). “While we’re looking at average salary increase it’s in sync with the economic outlook but when we try to peel the onion, the layers are distinctive”, says Chaudhary.It is the “life sciences” industry (including pharmaceuticals, medical tourism and medical technology) that is expected to provide its employees with the fastest increase in wages in 2013, at 13.1 per cent. The consumer and engineering design industries are also expected to pull up the average wage growth in 2013, with rates of 11.8 per cent and 11.5 per cent respectively.Conversely, wages in the infrastructure sector are expected to increase less than average, at 6.1 per cent in 2013. And workers in financial institutions and telecoms are expected to see their salaries increase just 8 per cent and 9.6 per cent each.What the data says is interesting. But what it doesn’t say is arguably more important. With over 90 per cent of India’s workforce in the informal economy, these numbers don’t tell us a lot anything about India’s masses. As disposable income shrinks, will more people choose the roadside dhobi over professional laundries? Or will men begin shaving themselves, putting the pavement salons out of business?Related reading:

76;AON;AON Plc;2013-02-18T00:06:58Z;Employment to grow despite economy woes;;Employment is likely to carry on growing in the first quarter despite the faltering economy, though much of it may be part-time or temporary, a survey of human resources managers has found.Private sector employers remain optimistic while those in the public sector expect job cuts to accelerate, according to the survey of 1,000 employers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.The findings come after poor retail sales figures for January brought a recent run of better economic news to an end.Jobs data have been more buoyant than those for output in recent months, with 500,000 more people employed than a year ago, which has made it difficult to read the true performance of the economy.Many analysts think jobs growth will eventually slow down. Economists expect the jobless rate to remain stable at 7.7 per cent of the workforce in official figures due on Wednesday, according to a Reuters poll.The CIPD survey found that net employment intentions, the difference between the proportion of employers planning to increase staff and the proportion expecting a decrease, remained positive at +5, compared with +7 in the last quarter.The figure for the private sector slipped to +16 from +18, while the public sector balance dropped sharply to -29 from -17. The research was conducted jointly with SuccessFactors, a business software company.The survey found that public sector employers are planning further substantial job losses in the second half of this parliament, underlining a forecast by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that 1.2m state sector jobs will have been lost between 2010 and 2017.The CIPD said a contributing factor has been the number of companies that have held on to more staff than they need in the expectation that growth will pick up.More than a third of employers said they had maintained staff levels higher than their output justified over the past year, but 66 per cent of these thought they would be forced to make job cuts if output does not pick up.“This is often described in terms of ‘labour hoarding’, which implies an irrational response by employers,” said Gerwyn Davies, the CIPD’s labour market adviser. “The truth is that employers have learnt lessons of the past, where overly quick steps to cut staff led to a loss of talent and damaged the capacity of organisations to recover.”The buoyancy of the jobs market comes at the cost of wage restraint and less secure employment. The survey forecasts that pay rises will average 1.8 per cent over the next year, below the current 2.7 per cent rate of inflation.Employers said 29 per cent of new recruits would be on temporary contracts. A third of employers said they had reduced hours for some staff during the past five years.The CIPD also surveyed 2,000 employees, among whom almost one in three part-time workers said they would like to work more hours. Almost half of temporary employees would like a permanent contract.“Some employers are clearly using flexible working and reduced hours to adapt to trading conditions. For many workers, this will mean they are offered less security, fewer hours and less money than they want,” Mr Davies said.“However, for others this provides greater opportunities to secure flexible working. This is especially the case for older workers, who have fared best since the recession, but still have the greatest difficulty re-entering the jobs market.”Separately, a survey of 255 employers to be published this week by Aon Hewitt, the consultancy, found that more than a third of UK companies across a wide range of sectors were planning or considering making redundancies this year, putting the UK second only to Greece in the Europe-wide study.Nearly two-thirds of the organisations considering making part of their workforce redundant were in the services industry.Additional reporting by Alice Ross
77;AON;AON Plc;2013-01-21T23:48:53Z;Aon rethinks plan to defer bonus payout;;Aon, the insurance broker, is considering following Goldman Sachs and backtracking on a plan to defer UK bonus payments to allow hundreds of highly paid employees to avoid the 50 per cent income tax rate.People familiar with the matter said that it was an option for Aon not to press ahead with the proposal to allow hundreds of brokers to benefit from a cut in the top rate of income tax.In a statement, Aon said that the offer still stands for some employees to postpone the bonus payments until after April 6, when the top rate of income tax falls to 45 per cent. However, the people familiar with the situation said that Aon managers are expected to monitor reaction to the move before reaching a final decision on whether to proceed.Willis and JLT, two other big insurance brokers, also acknowledged the possibility that they would run similar schemes.Marsh is alone among the big insurance brokers, which act as middlemen between underwriters and policyholders, in declining to comment on the issue.Aon said that about 250 employees had taken up its bonus deferral offer, although those familiar with the plan said that hundreds more individuals had been given the opportunity.“The offer stands and is in place with a deadline of end-January,” said the New York-listed, London-headquartered company.Unlike banks, insurance sector employees have largely avoided public opprobrium since the financial crisis began. Bonuses in the sector are typically much lower than those in investment banking.Most banks decided it would be damaging to their fragile reputations to press ahead with plans to delay paying bonuses given the hostile attitude towards tax avoidance.It emerged last week that Goldman was still considering it but the US investment bank rowed back after it endured fierce criticism.Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, denounced the idea and the Treasury also applied pressure on Goldman.Companies have drawn up various schemes in the past to allow their employees and shareholders avoid UK tax. Three years ago several brought forward their dividend payout schedules before the introduction of the higher top rate of income tax for wealthy investors.Aon recently shifted its headquarters from Chicago to London, after ministers announced a liberalisation of anti-avoidance measures that affect overseas profits.The insurance broker said that the main reason for the move was strategic – better access to emerging markets – but did not deny that the tax changes had been a factor.
78;AON;AON Plc;2012-12-11T20:03:00Z;WPP investors vote to move back to UK;;WPP shareholders have voted overwhelmingly in favour of moving the marketing services group’s headquarters back to the UK following recent changes to UK laws on how overseas profits are taxed.On Tuesday, more than 99 per cent of WPP’s shareholders approved the move to return to the UK after four years in Ireland.In 2008, the world’s largest advertising group by revenues, moved its tax domicile to Dublin in protest at new legislation that raised the prospect of “double taxation” of its overseas profits.Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, had criticised the new legislation and indicated that the company would only return to the UK once there were no tax costs in doing so.More than a dozen companies, including Wolseley and United Business Media, also shifted their tax domicile to Dublin or Switzerland.The UK coalition government has since enacted legislation that will ensure that UK domiciled companies will not be “double taxed” on foreign profits from next year. The new law has encouraged a number of companies with significant overseas earnings, such as UBM, the media and marketing services company, to return to the UK.Auditors said WPP’s return was symbolically important for the UK exchequer, which had feared an exodus of high earners.“If they had not changed the rules, the Treasury feared more companies would move overseas and that would have meant corporate services such as lawyers and bankers potentially going abroad as well as high-paid executives,” said one senior accountant.The changes in tax law coincide with a number of corporate tax reforms in the UK designed to encourage businesses to invest and expand in the UK. These include a “patent box” from April 2013, which will apply a reduced 10 per cent corporation tax rate on profits attributed to patents and other similar types of intellectual property.Several companies have already moved their global headquarters to Britain, including Aon, the insurer, and Ensco and Rowan, both drilling contractors.In a separate development, Group M, WPP’s media buying arm, is engaged in negotiations with Channel 4 over how much it pays for TV advertising. Group M wields considerable influence at the broadcaster, accounting for about 27 per cent of its advertising take. Insiders described negotiations over the two-year deal – worth about £200m a year to Channel 4 – as tough.
79;AON;AON Plc;2012-10-21T19:11:41Z;Downgrade shakes trade credit insurers;;Insurance brokers have warned that a decision by Standard & Poor’s to cut its rating for one of the world’s biggest trade credit insurers, Atradius, to near “junk” status threatens far-reaching consequences for a market that oils the wheels of the global economy.The rating agency lowered its rating on Atradius from A- to BBB, just two notches above junk and the lowest rating it has given to any the big three trade credit insurers. It cited the sovereign debt exposure of Spanish insurer Grupo Catalana Occidente, its main shareholder.S&P, which cut Spain’s debt rating earlier this month, warned it would cut Atradius’s rating further if it downgraded Spain’s again.The downgrade has caused a stir in the trade credit insurance industry, which covers the risk to companies that buyers of their goods collapse and are left unable to pay them. Credit ratings, a measure of perceived financial strength, play an important role in determining how much business the insurers secure.Atradius has a share of almost a third of the global credit insurance market, writing more than €1bn worth of premiums a year.Peter McClean, credit analyst at S&P, said: “Rightly or wrongly, the insurance market has drawn a line in the sand at the A range, below which many participants are not prepared to go. It’s something that we don’t agree with.”One insurance broker said that the company was a “victim of the sovereign ceiling rule”. Other brokers said clients would scrutinise the amount of business placed with Atradius. “I’ve never placed business with a non-A rated company,” said a leading trade credit broker. “Most large companies, in whatever sector, would expect to see an A-rated insurer as a starting point.”Another said: “The capacity they bring is one of the major issues. If they are downgraded further it’s difficult to see where the replacement capacity would come from.”Paul Cutler, trade credit director at insurance broker Aon, said: “Aon is supportive of all our insurers so long as they meet the requirements as Atradius does. We continue to monitor it.”Another big broker said that it would require written instruction from clients to place any business with a junk-rated insurer.Atradius has moved to reassure clients, compiling a fact sheet setting out its financial strength. The company pointed out that it was rated “A” by AM Best, an agency that specialises in the insurance sector.“S&P only allows a one notch positive differential between a company with the majority of its revenues generated in Spain and the sovereign rating on Spain,” said Atradius. “This means that the highest S&P rating that GCO (the majority of whose assets and revenues are in Spain) and its core operating entities can receive is BBB.”Atradius said that it and its main shareholder GCO were “both financially strong and well capitalised companies with regulatory solvency capital substantially in excess of the current regulatory requirements”.
80;AON;AON Plc;2012-09-30T15:52:11Z;Warning over US health insurance exchange;;Healthcare experts and watchdog groups are warning that a new plan by two US companies to create private health insurance exchanges, if adopted widely, could leave employees at risk as companies try to shift costs to their workers.Sears, a US retailer, and Darden Restaurants, which operates Olive Garden and Red Lobster, said last week they were unveiling a new “defined contribution” health insurance model. The scheme would give employees a lump sum of money and allow them to choose from a menu of insurance options with a wider variety of choices.The plans mimic the switch that many companies have made from traditional pension schemes to the 401(k) programmes that give employees greater choice while assuming more risk. Big companies cannot offload their employees into state-run insurance exchanges until 2017, and benefits consulting firms are developing private exchanges to fill the gap.“We’re trying to set up competition on the consumer level,” said Ken Sperling, health exchange strategy leader at Aon Hewitt, the benefits consulting firm that will run the exchange. “In every consumer marketplace, where you have competition, prices go down.”Aon says they will lower insurance costs for employees while giving insurers access to more potential customers. Mr Sperling said other large companies are considering the transition to private exchanges but that they want to see how Sears and Darden fare.But the possibility of private exchanges becoming mainstream has raised concerns among consumer advocates and some analysts that low-wage workers will be at risk if they choose their plans poorly and if the healthcare money given by their bosses does not keep pace with medical costs.“It’s basically a voucher leaving people to fend for themselves,” Carmen Balber, of the healthcare advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, said.According to Don McCanne, of Physicians for a National Health Programme, the impact of companies changing to private exchanges will not be immediately clear.“Only after many employees face bankrupting medical debt – a phenomenon that will increase as the employer contribution buys ever less insurance – will the implications be clear,” he said.Also unclear is if the switch to private exchanges will reduce medical costs overall.Les Funtleyder, healthcare analyst and fund manager at Polliwog, said that shifting responsibility on to low-wage workers as a way to cut costs was unlikely to work because doctors and hospitals have incentives to make them spend more.Darden argues that its workers will benefit from greater choice and the option of purchasing a less expensive health insurance plan.
81;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Pension trustees outsource investing;More DB schemes pass decisions to fiduciary managers;Trustees of UK corporate pension schemes are increasingly outsourcing investment decision-making to third parties, according to a survey* by Aon Hewitt.Some 27 per cent of the 329 defined benefit schemes surveyed now pass the task on to fiduciary managers or investment sub-committees, up from 17 per cent in 2011.This comes amid signs of a paucity of investment skills needed to improve governance and speed up decision-making, with nearly three-quarters of the trustees, pension managers and investment sub-committees chairs polled saying only one in four trustees were investment experts, no improvement on 2011’s findings.“Trustees recognise their limitations when it comes to making investment decisions, particularly in this challenging economic climate,” said Sion Cole, a partner at Aon Hewitt.Two-thirds of respondents said trustee boards spent five hours, or less, each quarter on investment matters with small schemes devoting the least time.“The majority are still operating in the way they did 15-20 years ago, just holding quarterly meetings to discuss investment matters. These are the ones we are really worried about,” added Mr Cole.Pension funds do not have the expertise to look wider so they stay with what they know,” he added.*Delegated Investment Survey 2012
82;AON;AON Plc;2012-08-03T23:44:06Z;GM in record Man Utd sponsorship deal;;Manchester United’s new sponsorship deal with General Motors’ Chevrolet brand will be worth almost $80m a year, more than double the £19.6m insurer Aon is now paying to have its brand on the team’s shirts.The exclusive rights deal, worth $559m over seven years from the 2014-15 season, sets a new record for a football club sponsorship contract.“The increase between Aon and Chevrolet I’d say is unprecedented,” said Jim Andrews of IEG, the sponsorship consultancy, noting that the deal smashed the previous record set by the Qatar Foundation’s sponsorship of Barcelona, worth $39.1m a year.As recently as 2006, Vodafone was paying only about £8m a year to sponsor the club’s kit. It was followed by AIG, which paid £14.1m a year between June 2007 and June 2010.Many European football clubs have seen shirt sponsorship revenues rise threefold in the past seven or eight years, said Mr Andrews, who predicted that US sports leagues such as the National Basketball Association will start to allow sponsorship of players’ jerseys in the coming decade.GM announced the Chevrolet sponsorship on Monday, hours after saying that Joel Ewanick, its chief marketing officer, had “failed to meet the expectations that a company has of an employee” and was leaving.The club revealed the figures on Friday in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing before the initial public offering it expects to price next week.After slack demand prompted it to abort a planned IPO in Hong Kong and Singapore, Manchester United now hopes to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange on August 10, people familiar with its plans said.The company said on Monday it expected to price its shares in a range of $16 to $20, which would raise $300m and value the club at just under $3bn at the midpoint. The IPO roadshow is expected to complete on Thursday, after events in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, London and New York.Manchester United said annual revenue from the Chevrolet shirt sponsorship agreement would be $70m in the first season, rising 2.1 per cent a year until it ends in the 2020-21 season. In addition, it will receive about $18.6m in fees from GM in each of the 2012-13 season and 2013-14 season under the terms of our new shirt sponsorship agreement.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi
83;AON;AON Plc;2012-07-30T20:31:52Z;Man Utd in deal with Chevrolet on shirts;;General Motors has signed a deal for its Chevrolet brand to appear on the shirts of Manchester United a day after the US carmaker’s marketing chief abruptly resigned.GM and the football club did not disclose the value of the seven-year sponsorship, but Reuters reported the deal would be worth nearly $600m.Chevrolet will replace Aon, the US insurer, on the team’s shirts starting in the 2014-2015 season. Aon has been on Manchester United shirts since the 2010-2011 season and its sponsorship is said to be worth £80m over four years.The agreement followed Sunday’s announcement that Joel Ewanick had resigned as GM’s chief marketing officer. The company would not say what precipitated Mr Ewanick’s departure, only that “he failed to meet the expectations that a company has of an employee”.But sources told the Wall Street Journal and Reuters that Mr Ewanick had not properly reported the financial details of a sponsorship deal with Manchester United. The Journal reported that GM had altered the terms of the deal originally struck by Mr Ewanick.In May, GM signed a five-year partnership with Manchester United that made it the football club’s official automotive sponsor. The company announced a similar partnership with Liverpool football club last week.GM would not give any details of the circumstances surrounding Mr Ewanick’s resignation.“Our commitments to our soccer partnerships remain firmly in place,” the company said on Monday.Mr Ewanick could not be reached for comment. On Sunday night he posted to his Twitter account: “It has been a privilege and honour to work with the GM team and to be a small part of Detroit’s turnround. I wish everyone at GM all the best.”
84;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
85;AON;AON Plc;2012-07-15T03:34:31Z;Investors query effect of Libor manipulation;Pension funds investigate possible impacts;Amid all the hullabaloo over Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate), investors are asking what it means to them, whether they were affected and if so, how?Interest rate swaps, Libor-referenced performance fees, even Libor-based mortgages – a huge range of products are affected by the benchmark interest rate, so naturally investors want to put figures on it.Unfortunately, as blogger Zero Hedge’s twitter feed put it, “the thing about attempts to quantify the damages from Libor manipulation is that nobody has the faintest clue”.David Paterson, head of corporate governance at the UK’s National Association of Pension Funds, is more measured: “The impact of Libor manipulation on pension funds is hard to pin down and could have happened through a range of financial instruments. Pension fund trustees should ask their fund managers to tell them if and how their assets have been affected.”Even unpicking whether and how rates might have been rigged is complicated, let alone trying to figure out the impact.Two kinds of rate fixing have been admitted by Barclays, which is the only bank so far to have been fined by regulators for such activities. Firstly, Barclays traders influenced the rate reported to the British Bankers’ Association in their own interest. Although this is reprehensible, if they were successful in rigging the rate set by the BBA based on its survey of banks, it would not have been by more than a basis point or so in either direction.This may have been enough to make a huge difference to traders, but is so small as to be insignificant to any asset owner worried because they were paying a hedge fund manager for outperforming Libor.This kind of action “would affect a wide range of instruments but in a very, very small, almost imperceptible amount”, says Charles MacKinnon, chief investment officer at Thurleigh Investment Managers. “The consequences are a big fat zero – less than statistical noise.”A bigger concern was Barclays’ admission it had understated its Libor submissions during the financial crisis, and the suspicion that other banks may likewise have been systematically reporting lower rates than was realistic at the time, when credit was both expensive and hard to find. A Morgan Stanley analysis reported in last week’s FT suggests 11 other banks may be fined for similar activities.If Libor was understated for a significant amount of time, it would have had a measurable impact on many financial instruments and investments, although whether that impact was positive or negative depends on the precise situation.Consultants are coming under more pressure from clients to explore how they could have been affected.Yves Josseaume, investment consultant at Aon Hewitt, says the consultancy is currently modelling the impact of an artificial Libor rate on the investments of its clients following a “handful” of requests.“They are looking to us to have a best guess as to their possible exposure,” he adds.But there is a strong feeling in the industry that it might be impossible to measure how much a particular investor has lost out or benefited.Pension schemes with interest rate swaps may have benefited from a lower Libor, if Libor was the “pay leg”, the payments the pension fund was making in exchange for fixed payments, says Richard Dowell of consultancy Cardano. “But you don’t quite know what the real rate should have been.”During the financial crisis, banks were reluctant to lend money to each other, so the number of transactions fell sharply and prices could vary significantly depending on both borrower and lender. Reporting a representative lending rate in this environment would have been challenging, and it would be difficult to look back and identify a correct rate.At the time, many market participants were aware of these problems and took Libor with a pinch of salt. “We all thought Libor was lower than reality – we thought it was a pretend number because nobody was really borrowing at those rates,” says Mr MacKinnon. “The real world had already abandoned Libor as a representative rate.”However, financial instruments referencing Libor could not dismiss the number, even if it was “pretend”.Pension schemes could have benefited from lowered rates if they had purchased loan agreements from a bank that had been linked to Libor, packaged up as an asset-backed security.“If Libor is artificially low, the pension scheme pays less interest than it should have done,” says Ian Mills, a partner in consultancy Lane Clark & Peacock’s investment practice.At the same time, these investors could have been gaining money through an interest rate swap where they were paying the Libor rate rather than receiving it. Mr Mills adds: “Where [the fund] might have lost out on the loan, it would gain on the interest rate swap.”Pension funds holding floating rate notes – which have a Libor-linked coupon – would have suffered if the offered rate was artificially lowered.Boris Mikhailov, a principal in Mercer’s financial strategy group, says: “[In this case] they would have received a lower Libor rate. You could be better off on one side of your portfolio and worse off on the other side.”Fund managers, particularly hedge fund managers, may have charged a performance-related fee with some kind of Libor benchmark built into it. This is another place the end investor could be exposed.Mr Mills adds: “Pension schemes may have ended up paying their hedge fund managers more or less than [they] would have been due as a result of that.”
86;AON;AON Plc;2012-07-11T22:30:28Z;US insurer to scale up European profile;;A large US insurer has struck a deal with the City of London to build its own skyscraper, underlining the rapidly growing presence of international insurers in the Square Mile.WR Berkley, which has a market value of $5.4bn, is understood to have agreed terms with the City’s planning authorities to construct a 40-storey tower next door to the offices of Lloyd’s of London.WR Berkley is among the largest providers of insurance to midsized companies in the US. The company is scaling up its operations in Europe, with offices in Germany, Ireland, Spain and Norway. The agreement to build its own skyscraper follows a flurry of deals by US insurers to expand their office space in the centre of London, taking advantage of the shrinking of banks, which have long dominated the City office market.In January, Aon signed a lease on 191,000 sq ft of office space in the nearby Leadenhall building, under construction and nicknamed the Cheese Grater. Meanwhile, Markel took up a 51,000 sq ft pre-let agreement last month on Land Securities’ 36-storey Walkie-Talkie building.The building would become one of five skyscrapers under construction in the Square Mile, which, in contrast to the low levels of development outside of the UK capital, has seen a spike in demand for new office space. The buildings are expected to capture some of the demand arising from lease expiries and breaks, expected to hit 3m sq ft a year in the City until 2017.However, the City is undergoing a transformation in terms of its occupiers. Many of the large investment banks have relocated to Canary Wharf, favouring the wide floor plates and ability to have all of their staff in one building. The cost of office space in the City is also a big driver. Prime office rents in Canary Wharf are at £36 per sq ft a year, compared with £55 per sq ft in the City.The departure of many traditional occupiers has opened the door for other industries, such as technology, media and professional services businesses.However, it is the rise of the insurance sector in the City market which has spurred on letting activity during the first half of this year. A recent report from CBRE, the estate agents, said that there are 13 insurers actively searching for a combined 1m sq ft of office space in central London.
87;AON;AON Plc;2012-07-08T23:17:31Z;Pensions’ equity holdings fall;Shift into less risky, more diversified investments;UK pension funds have less invested in equities than at any time since the 1974 stock market crash, according to an annual study.At the end of 2011, the average fund’s portfolio was 43 per cent invested in equities, down 7 percentage points on the previous year, according to the Pension Fund Indicators 2012 report from UBS Global Asset Management.This is the lowest slice of the average fund’s portfolio since 1974, when institutional investors had temporarily doubled their cash holdings to escape a volatile stock market, reducing equities to 38 per cent of their portfolios.Ian Barnes, head of UK and Ireland at UBS GAM, said the historic low did not simply reflect the fall in value of schemes’ equity holdings but was a result of their appetite for less risky, more diversified investments. “As schemes close and mature they have systematically moved out of equity into matching assets,” he said.“Even within growth assets, schemes are trying to access other sources of growth in order to be less reliant on equity market returns.”Only 19 per cent of private sector defined benefit schemes are still open to new members, down from 88 per cent in 2000, according to the National Association Pension Funds Annual Survey 2011. As a pension fund’s members grow older and retire, without new entrants to the schemes the money coming in starts to dry up, reducing their appetite for risky assets.Overseas equity holdings fell from 29 per cent in 2010 to 25 per cent in 2011. Meanwhile, UK equities continue to decline in fund holdings, down three percentage points to 18 per cent. This money was redirected to index-linked gilts, other fixed income instruments and alternative investments, as schemes sought safe assets alongside more diverse sources of growth.Colin Robertson, global head of asset allocation at consultancy Aon Hewitt, said: “People are seeking wider and wider – and more and more exotic – assets classes into which to diversify.”A number of the consultancy’s clients thought a combined 30 per cent across UK and global equities was a good ultimate balance, Mr Robertson added.
88;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:01:26+0000;New code to protect pension savers;Cash incentives banned under new Code of Practice;Employers will no longer be able to use cash “bungs” to tempt staff to give up their generous final-salary pension benefits, under a new initiative that aims to stop savers being pushed into riskier schemes.In recent years, tens of thousands of members of final-salary schemes have been offered cash incentives to transfer their savings out of a “defined-benefit” (DC) pension and into stock market based “defined-contribution” (DC) plans.This practice has become more common in recent years, as employers look to cut the rising cost of “gold-plated” pensions.But the government and regulators have expressed growing concern that too many savers are being persuaded to give up valuable pension benefits, such as inflation linking and spouse’s death benefits.Now, a new industry code of practice will aim to ensure cash incentives are no longer used. “For some time I have been concerned about incentive exercises that involve bad practices,” said Steve Webb, the pensions minister. “This new Code of Practice must be adopted as the standard for all transfer exercises in the future, without exception.”Under the code, there will be more protection for those taking part in “Pension Increase Exchanges”, whereby scheme members are typically asked to give up future inflation increases in exchange for a higher starting pension income.“Up until now, these have fallen into a regulatory black hole, often leaving members to make a difficult decision without any support or independent financial advice,” said Kevin Wesbroom, managing principal at Aon Hewitt. “In future, to comply with the code, an employer will be required to provide members with access to independent financial advice – paid for by the employer.”Other provisions in the code aim to prevent employers from using pressure tactics during transfer exercises, introducing a three month window for savers to consider an offer. Elderly members cannot to be targeted at all – only given the chance “to opt in” to a deal.Insurers will be expected to reject a pension transfer if it hasn’t complied with the code. “We don’t want to see bad practice where it impacts savers,” said Stephen Gay, director of life, savings and protection at the Association of British Insurers. If the code, which is currently voluntary, is ignored, the government has vowed to legislate.However, some argue that a voluntary code is not enough. “Not all employers will follow this, especially small firms and there are no sanctions as there would be if this was a statutory requirement,” argued Dr Ros Altmann, director-general of the Saga Group, the specialist advisers to the over-50s.“Secondly, with benefit changes such as Pension Increase Exercises members only need to have ‘guidance’. This is not really going to be good enough to help members understand what value they are giving up and what risks they are taking on by giving up inflation protection. This can result in a huge reduction in pension value and people need proper advice, not just guidance.”This week’s move comes as the Financial Services Authority continues to investigate poor practice in the pension transfer market. In April, it toughened its rules after seeing cases where advisers had touted for business on the basis of boosting the take up of transfers, rather than advising on suitability.
89;AON;AON Plc;2012-06-06T17:48:33Z;Prudential’s GM deal revives annuities;;At a stroke last week Prudential Financial resuscitated a slumbering but potentially lucrative corner of the US insurance industry.The company agreed to take on as much as $26bn of pension liabilities from General Motors, for the assets backing the plan and cash payments that could total $3.5bn. The deal reduces the US carmaker’s pension liabilities by about a fifth.If completed, the GM transaction would eclipse anything seen before in the market for corporate annuities. The US pension insurance, or buyout, market is less developed than the UK’s. The last such US deal to involve the transfer of more than $1bn in liabilities was in the 1980s, according to Aon Hewitt, a consultancy.But it could be the tip of the iceberg. With S&P 500 companies facing combined pension liabilities of $1.7tn, according to Credit Suisse, and US states and municipal governments also exposed to defined benefit schemes, some say the dam could be about to burst on such deals.“This is a watershed moment,” says Rick Jones in the retirement plan division at Aon Hewitt. “The market has been in the doldrums for years but, if others companies follow GM’s lead, it could be worth trillions.”For Prudential the deal represents the first fruits from setting up a pension risk transfer unit three years ago. The unit has grown to 100 employees, while people who worked on the GM deal say MetLife, American International Group and Principal Financial, among others, are also seeking such deals.But while the financial crisis left gaping holes in corporate pension plans as the prices of plan assets tumbled, the annuity business has struggled to gain traction.“Over the past few years especially, US corporations have been keen to transfer pension risk,” said David Zion, head of accounting research at Credit Suisse. “But the key question has been price: with interest rates low and markets volatile, it can cost a lot to offload these long-duration liabilities.”GM will make payments of up to $4.5bn to its pension plan to fund lump sum payments to retirees who exit the pension scheme, and premiums to Prudential to assume liability for those who stay in the scheme. That will be partly balanced by a narrowing of the funding gap in the company’s pension plan, but the net cost to GM will still be $3bn.The deal covers all 118,000 of GM’s “salaried”, or white collar, retirees. But GM has a further 400,000 “hourly”, or blue collar, retirees with defined benefits.Bob Shanks, chief financial officer of Ford Motor, said this week that it had decided not to offload some of its pension liabilities because it did not have sufficient cash once plans for dividends and investments were taken into account.Another obstacle to the deals is their complexity. Morgan Stanley, the lead adviser on the deal, had been working with GM on pension alternatives since 2010.Oliver Wyman has been advising the independent fiduciary, which represents members of the pension plan, for at least six months, during which time at least four insurers submitted bids.Prudential may have to set aside $2bn against the GM pension liabilities, according to Raymond James analysts. That would be equal to the excess capital of Prudential’s US insurance arm at the end of 2011. By comparison, MetLife ended 2011 with $3.5bn and Principal Financial held $1.6bn.According to a GM filing, both it and Prudential could pull out of the deal before it is set to close at the end of the year if markets deteriorate and increase the total cash required to close the transaction.Despite these hurdles, insurers are confident the symbolic value of the deal with GM, with total pension liabilities of more than $100bn, will lead others to follow suit.Dylan Tyson, head of pension risk transfer at Prudential, says his company is in talks with several other large US companies about annuity deals, and expects further agreements this year.According to Raymond James, even after capital allocations are taken into account, the GM deal could add as much as $200m a year to Prudential’s earnings.“This [the GM deal] is not something that is going to happen every week,” says Steven Schwartz at Raymond James. “But we will see more deals, and when we do they will be meaningful for insurers’ earnings.”
90;AON;AON Plc;2012-05-11T16:15:14Z;Landsecs in ‘Walkie Talkie’ letting talks;;Land Securities is closing in on signing up the first tenant for their flagship City of London skyscraper, the so-called Walkie Talkie building.The UK’s largest real estate investment trust by market value is in discussions with Kiln Group, the insurer, about its taking up a 60,000 sq ft pre-let agreement in the 37-storey tower, people close to the deal said. The company has only two years to run on the lease in the building in Leadenhall Street where it occupies about 47,000 sq ft.News of the negotiations comes just a month after Costar reported that Landsecs had opened negotiations with Markel, another insurer, about the possibility of its taking up space in the 690,000 sq ft Walkie Talkie.Although nothing has been agreed yet, the approaches from the two companies underlines the fast-growing presence of insurance groups in the City office market – traditionally the heartland of the UK’s banking industry – as they make the most of the supply of new buildings in Europe’s pre-eminent financial district.British Land, Landsecs main rival, also recently announced it had struck a deal with Aon, the US insurance group, to take up 191,000 sq ft of space in its forthcoming Leadenhall Building development, nicknamed the “Cheesegrater”.The two towers form part of a cluster of four skyscrapers under construction in the City. The buildings are expected to capture some of the demand arising from lease expires and breaks, which are expected to hit 3m sq ft a year in the City until 2017.The developments also come as the tenant base in the City is undergoing a transformation.Many of the large investment banks have relocated to Canary Wharf, favouring the large floor plates and ability to have all of their staff in one building. The cost of office space in the City is also a big driver. Prime office rents in Canary Wharf are at £36 per sq ft a year, compared with £55 per sq ft in the City.The departure of many traditional occupiers has opened the door for other industries, such as technology, media and professional services businesses.However, it is the rise of the insurance sector in the City market which has spurred on letting activity during the first half of this year. A recent report from CBRE, the estate agents, said that there are 13 insurers actively searching for a combined 1m sq ft of office space in central London.The Walkie Talkie, which is unusual for being wider at its top than base, has been under construction since January 2011 and is set to be completed in early 2014.Landsecs declined to comment.
91;AON;AON Plc;2012-05-08T22:02:13Z;Blackstone to buy sprawling London estate;;Blackstone, the US private equity group, has bolstered its position in the high-end commercial property market by agreeing to buy a sprawling estate of offices and shops in the City of London.Blackstone is understood to have signed a deal with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Rockpoint, the rival private equity company, to acquire Devonshire Square, a former silk warehouse that has been converted into a 12-building office and retail campus. The five-acre site is just a few hundred yards from the Broadgate development that Blackstone jointly owns with British Land and is home to Aon, the US insurance company.The deal, which was signed on Friday for slightly under £340m, marks a departure from Blackstone’s recent pattern of buying distressed property debt portfolios from European banks. The company is understood to be looking to generate returns by bringing in new tenants and rebranding the estate.The Devonshire Square complex has been on the market since January and has attracted interest from a wide range of private equity and property companies. The sale price crystallises a loss for ADIA and Rockpoint, who bought the portfolio at the top of the City office market boom in 2006 for £410m. The purchase was financed through a £340m loan.One of the issues for any owner of the site is that Aon, which accounts for 45 per cent of the £25m annual rent roll, has recently signed a lease to move to the Cheesegrater building, British Land’s new City skyscraper. The insurer is due to move into its new home in 2015, giving Blackstone three years to negotiate a new anchor tenant for the 626,135 sq ft estate.Blackstone has been one of the most active forces in the European property market in the past year. In December, Blackstone agreed a deal that saw it take control of £1.4bn worth of underperforming loans from Royal Bank of Scotland. The group it also understood to be close to completing a deal to buy a €100m pool of distressed property debt from Société Générale.Blackstone declined to comment. Neither Rockpoint, nor its agents, CBRE, were able to comment on the deal.
92;AON;AON Plc;2012-04-16T16:21:00Z;Catastrophe bonds reach highest level;;Catastrophe bond issuance in the first quarter of this year hit its highest level since the market first emerged in the 1990s, even as existing securities have performed worse than some debt and equity markets.Total issuance value jumped 47 per cent year on year to $1.49bn through nine transactions in the first three months of 2012, according to a report to be published on Tuesday by Aon Benfield Securities, the reinsurance broker’s investment banking arm.Insurers issue so-called cat bonds to tap the capital markets as an alternative to traditional reinsurance. Buyers, who cover insurers’ extreme losses from natural disasters such as wind storms, earthquakes and flooding, include institutional investors such as pension and hedge funds.Paul Schultz, chief executive of Aon Benfield Securities, said such investors were attracted to the securities as they were uncorrelated with other asset classes, given that their performance depended on non-financial risks.Annual issuance was on track for a total of between $5bn and $6bn compared with $4.6bn a year earlier, he forecast. There are $12.8bn of cat bonds outstanding.Overall, the Aon Benfield index of global catastrophe bonds returned 3.9 per cent in the year to the end of March 2012. This underperformed an index of three- to five-year US treasury notes, up 6.2 per cent over the same period, an index of US BB-rated corporate bonds, up 6.4 per cent, and the S&P 500, up 6.2 per cent.Last year turned out to be one of the costliest on record for natural catastrophes with global insured losses of $105bn, according to Munich Re. Noteholders in three bonds were wiped out entirely.In the first three months of 2012, the Aon Benfield insurance-linked securities all bond index returned minus 0.1 per cent. Although outperforming the US treasury index, which was down 0.4 per cent over the same period, it underperformed the corporate bond index, which was up 3.7 per cent, and the S&P 500, up 12 per cent.Still, Mr Schultz said the bonds had performed better over longer-term periods and particularly outperformed during the financial crisis.He added: “We believe that the market fundamentals are conducive to further growth in this sector and very pleased that issuance in the first quarter of 2012 came from both new and repeat sponsors.”Some analysts questioned the extent to which the first-quarter issuance rise reflected an underlying rise in the number of deals coming to the market, cautioning that month-by-month levels tended to be volatile.Issuance levels took a knock in the second and third quarters of 2011 as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan as well as the eurozone sovereign debt crisis reduced prospective investors’ risk appetite.“There was limited new issuance until the fourth quarter last year – much was postponed or cancelled,” said Serge Chiaramonte, head of insurance linked strategies distribution at Credit Suisse Asset Management.He added: “The main problem with the cat bond market is that a relatively small number of players control a very large part of the market. You probably have seven or eight investors that control the majority of the demand.”
93;AON;AON Plc;2012-04-01T04:25:53Z;US banks seek to benefit from retirement plans;401(k) assets offer reliable income and a way to achieve sustainable growth;"Three of the four largest US banks by market capitalisation are expanding their retirement divisions via acquisition and by hiring staff as part of their post financial crisis efforts to grow income from the sector.Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are bidding to administer corporate pension plans, known as 401(k) plans, through which 50m American employees invest for retirement.The expansion of their retirement divisions, which typically provide low growth but reliable income streams, is part of a shift in the banking industry landscape. Before 2008, large US banks showed little interest in the low margin activity of pension plan administration, including record keeping and legal compliance.“The retirement business is not as sexy as investment banking or derivatives but the paradigm has changed,” says Kevin Crain, head of institutional retirement at Bank of America. “The administration business offers consistent revenue, profitability and growth, which is the order of the day.”The targets of the banks are Fidelity, Vanguard and Aon Hewitt, which between them administer almost 50 per cent of assets held in 401(k) plans, according to Plan Sponsor, which gathers data from industry participants.Banks have been marketing services directly to companies with some success; JPMorgan, for example, has increased 401(k) assets that it administers by 40 per cent since 2008.However, opportunities for the banks to expand by winning new clients are limited. A Deloitte survey last year found that only 12 per cent of companies with 401(k) plans considered a change in their administrator.Wells Fargo, the only bank among the top five plan administrators by assets according to Plan Sponsor, has instead focused on acquisitions. Assets administered by Wells have risen more than 60 per cent since 2008, thanks largely to the purchase of Wachovia.“We are in a privileged position right now among US banks in terms of having the option to make acquisitions and we are actively looking at more targets,” says John Papadopulos, president of Wells’ retirement division.Hartford, the insurance group, recently put its plan administration business, the 19th largest by assets, up for sale and analysts have forecast further industry consolidation.Bank of America, however, is focused on organic growth, according to Mr Crain. It aims to double the $100bn in 401(k) assets it administers by persuading more of its commercial banking clients to give it their retirement plans.Banks also say that administering 401(k) plans increases opportunities to market other products to plan participants. Wells Fargo says more than a third of the money invested in the 401(k) plans it administers is transferred to the bank’s brokerage unit when account holders retire.Retirement savings, which the Investment Company Institute estimates total $17tn in the US, have become particularly attractive to asset managers since the financial crisis, because they tended to remain invested in the market.Investment banks are also looking to manage more retirement assets. Last month Goldman Sachs acquired Dwight Asset Management, a money manager that specialises in “stable value” strategies, popular with retirement savers."
94;AON;AON Plc;2012-03-29T20:01:31Z;FSA threatens action on investment banks;;The Financial Services Authority is threatening regulatory action against several investment banks after it discovered shortfalls in their anti-bribery controls.A review of the anti-bribery systems of 15 investment banks uncovered that most of them had not properly taken account of the rules covering bribery and corruption, said the FSA.“We are concerned that the investment banking sector has been too slow and reactive in managing bribery and corruption risk,” it said.Nearly half the banks visited by the FSA did not have adequate risk assessment and management information on anti-bribery and corruption was “poor”, the regulator added.The FSA said it was considering taking further action against some of the investment banks it had visited.Legal experts said it would be likely to single out one or two banks for fines in the same manner as it had done with insurance brokers after a similar review two years ago. The findings prompted the regulator to impose a £5.25m fine on insurance broker Aon and a £6.9m fine against rival Willis.Sam Carruthers, a director in the fraud investigation team at Ernst & Young said: “I would expect the FSA to come out with enforcement action later this year.”Raj Parker, partner at Freshfields, added: “To come out with enforcement against a few to encourage all the others to act is traditionally the way the FSA proceeds.”The FSA said its visits and the introduction of the UK Bribery Act two years ago had prompted banks to consider their anti-bribery systems.The findings come the same week as Coutts & Co, the private bank used by Queen Elizabeth II, was fined £8.8m by the FSA for not having enough controls to guard against money-laundering, another area where the regulator found that the majority of banks fell short in a thematic review and subsequently took enforcement action.The FSA announced its review into investment banks’ anti-bribery controls after the Arab spring last year, as the Bribery Act took effect – the largest overhaul of Britain’s graft laws in a century.The legislation gave the Serious Fraud Office, the lead prosecutor and enforcer of the act, powers to take action against an individual or company with a link to the UK, no matter where the alleged bribery took place or where the company is based. Companies face an unlimited fine and individuals may receive a prison sentence of up to 10 years for breaches of the law.This means that banks and other financial companies regulated by the FSA are facing scrutiny on two fronts, from both the FSA and the SFO. The SFO has said it will share information with the FSA on regulated companies.In practice, the FSA need only show that a company did not have tight enough controls against bribery to impose a fine, rather than prove any wrongdoing took place.

96;AON;AON Plc;2012-03-11T06:43:39Z;Low yields ‘hold back mid-sized schemes’;Mid-market UK schemes find low gilt yields mean they cannot offload liabilities;Mid-market UK pension schemes are queuing up to offload their liabilities via buyouts or buy-ins but are being held back by low gilt yields, according to a survey of the sector by Aon Hewitt, the consultancy.It found 24 per cent of schemes with assets between £10m and £500m (61 per cent of all UK funds) are targeting buyout, compared to just 9 per cent of schemes larger than £500m. A further 48 per cent are targeting “self-sufficiency”, where they are independent from their sponsor.The survey also found liability driven investment, until recently a preserve of the largest funds, is now “common” in the mid-market. Paul McGlone, principal and actuary at Aon Hewitt, said there were signs that longevity hedging could also soon be opened up to mid-sized funds.Some 22 per cent of the more than 200 funds surveyed said they were likely to implement enhanced transfer value programmes to attempt to reduce their liabilities by encouraging members to exit, despite the threat of a new voluntary code to guide this often controversial practice.However, Mr McGlone concluded that the principal challenges facing mid-sized schemes were the burden of external costs and the lack of time, money and expertise they have to explore a widening range of options.“The size of these schemes is a key influence on their ability to deal with the challenges they face.”

98;AON;AON Plc;2012-03-01T20:38:53Z;Retirement funds bolster US equities;;US stocks are being boosted by a retirement savings trend that has seen workers taking an increasingly passive approach to investing their contributions.Holders of 401(k) accounts, to which 50m American employees make regular retirement contributions, have become far less likely to adjust asset allocation over the last decade, according to data from the largest providers.The trend accelerated during the financial crisis, according to Pamela Hess, the director of retirement research at Aon Hewitt, a large retirement account manager. “401(k) investors were paralysed during the crisis.“The default setting for many investors during the crisis was to withdraw from the market or change allocation, but most 401(k) investors have done absolutely nothing.”Fidelity, Aon Hewitt and Vanguard, who between them manage almost 50 per cent of the almost $3tn in 401(k) assets, all report falls in “exchanges”, or adjustments to asset allocation by account holders, over the past decade.At Fidelity, by far the largest account manager, only 10.6 per cent of 401(k) investors made exchanges during 2011 – down from almost 15 per cent in 2006 – and the percentage has fallen in four of the last five years.The result has been continued and consistent inflows into US stocks.As much as 42 per cent of all 401(k) assets were allocated to equity-specific funds at the end of 2010, according to the most recent data covering all accounts from the Investment Company Institute. That was just 2 percentage points below the ten-year average.Allocations to bond funds were only just above the 10-year average and allocations to cash-like money market funds are below the 10-year average.“People have the impression that 401(k) investors have fled to fixed income or withdrawn money, but that is not the case,” says Jean Young, a research analyst in Vanguard’s Center for Retirement Research. “Contributions have continued to come in like clockwork every two weeks and more than 70 per cent of contributions to our accounts are invested in equities.”The increased passivity results in part from the growing use of target-date funds.Since 2006, many employers have automatically enrolled new employees in such funds, which rebalance asset allocation according to the age of the account holder and to adjust for fluctuations in asset values.Target-date funds reduce the need for self-management and maintain a high allocation to equities even when markets are falling, especially for younger account holders.Account managers also report increasing use of other professionally managed accounts, such as balanced funds, which rebalance daily to maintain a fixed equity and bond allocation.A third of Vanguard’s 401(k) account holders now invest exclusively through professionally managed accounts, up from just 7 per cent in 2004.That is a boost for the asset management industry, which has seen virtually no net inflows into investible fund products since the start of 2008, according to data from Lipper.“There has been a growing distrust of the asset management industry among most investors since 2008,” says Matthew Lemieux at Lipper. “But 401(k) investors appear to be an exception because they have little choice but to stay invested.”
99;AON;AON Plc;2012-02-27T20:19:05Z;Insurers weigh benefits of HQ switch;;The looming introduction of Europe’s biggest ever shake-up of insurance regulations has moved up the agenda the issue of where companies in the sector have their headquarters.Prudential, the UK’s biggest insurer with a market capitalisation of £18.4bn, said it might consider relocating in the event of an “adverse outcome” from the Solvency II regime. The statement follows a warning from Aegon’s chief executive, who has previously said the Netherlands-based insurer could re-domicile.Solvency II, which will establish more rigorous capital requirements and risk management standards for insurers, is due to take effect in 2014. For groups based outside the EU, only their operations inside the union would fall under the remit of the regulations. By contrast, the entire global operations of insurers that have their headquarters in the EU could be caught by Solvency II unless European regulators deem the overseas regulations “equivalent” to the new regime.Prudential’s US life arm Jackson is an example. Meanwhile, Aegon’s US-based Transamerica arm accounts for 60 per cent of the group’s capital. The worry is such insurers would have to hold extra capital for their international units. “This could leave them at a competitive disadvantage and could even threaten ongoing ownership by a European parent,” says Sonja Zinner, a director at Fitch’s insurance group.The risk is acute for US operations, as analysts believe European regulators are more likely to consider other important regulatory regimes are equivalent.By switching its HQ to another continent, an EU insurer’s international operations could in theory escape the rules. But there remains uncertainty about Solvency II. As the plans stand, European regulators will assume international operations are “equivalent” for several years.Moreover, Barrie Cornes, insurance analyst at Panmure Gordon, says: “It’s not just the Pru. The whole European insurance market would potentially find it uneconomic to write business in the US. And for that very reason, I don’t think it would get to that point. I genuinely think a solution will be found.”Prudential says it “regularly reviews its range of options” about “optimising” its domicile. “There continues to be uncertainty in relation to the implementation of Solvency II and implications for the group’s businesses. Clarity on this issue is not expected in the near term.”Any Pru move would contrast with the shift to the UK by Aon, the US broker with a market capitalisation of $15bn, which last month announced plans to shift its headquarters from Chicago to London. But Solvency II does not apply to Aon: it is a broker that does not carry insurance risks.Keith Pogson, Asia-Pacific managing partner at Ernst & Young, says a company moving to Hong Kong would possibly pay lower tax and there might be less tax on dividends to some investors. But “it would require a lot of work to get through these issues. Taxation for key management and management core team costs would probably be cheaper in Hong Kong due to lower tax rates, but the need for accommodation could outweigh these.”Several analysts have long expected the Pru to shift headquarters to Hong Kong. Such a move would be more likely if it were to sell its mature UK business, which exists mainly to sell annuities to existing pensions customers.The problem for the Pru is that the group is reliant on the capital and cash flows of its domestic arm to support its operations elsewhere. Its UK capital base is crucial to support its group-wide credit rating.The Pru in late 2010 set targets for its Asian business becoming entirely self-funding in terms of its cash flows by 2013, when it should also pay the group dividends of £300m annually to its parent.Tidjane Thiam, Pru chief executive, has often referred to 2013 as the point at which the group will have most “optionality” over what to do with its businesses, but he has admitted that the Asian arm would still not have enough capital on a standalone basis to support the kind of rating the group as a whole enjoys today.But 2013 is seen by bankers as the year when the Pru can look properly at a sale of its UK arm or a break-up of the group to allow it to become a pure Asian group, like rival AIA.
100;AON;AON Plc;2012-02-26T22:54:07Z;New rules force Pru to consider HK base;;Prudential, one of the UK’s oldest insurers, is considering plans to uproot its headquarters from London to Hong Kong amid concerns about the impact of new European capital adequacy regulations.People familiar with the situation say a possible shift out of London is being weighed up by the group, which has £349.5bn of assets under management.Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Prudential, has recently raised concerns about the “unintended consequences” of Solvency II regulations. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Mr Thiam warned that if “certain versions” of Solvency II insurance rules, due to come into force in 2013, were implemented, investing in corporate bonds, infrastructure and some bank assets would be “very difficult”.The Prudential chief said the industry was lobbying hard against the regulations as they could be a threat to recovery in Europe. Prudential has significant operations in Asia, the US as well as the UK.Experts say that by shifting its headquarters outside Europe, a company could no longer fall under the full scope of European regulations. Only the parts of a business that were within the region would be subject to EU rules.Any move by Prudential would contrast with the recent endorsement given to the UK by Aon, the US insurance broker with a market capitalisation of $15bn, which last month announced plans to shift its headquarters from Chicago to London.On Sunday night the Pru said in response to the press reports that it regularly reviewed its options and this included “optimising its domicile”.“There continues to be uncertainty in relation to the implementation of Solvency II and implications for the group’s businesses. Clarity on this issue is not expected in the near term.”

102;AON;AON Plc;2012-01-16T20:46:33Z;City’s thousand-mile journey begins with yuan step;The deal is underwhelming, but the UK has stolen a march on Singapore;It is reassuring to hear that George Osborne has agreed to work towards making the City a trading centre for the Chinese currency in partnership with Hong Kong. Economic diplomacy is one of the things chancellors are paid for. It would be a cause for public concern if, instead, it had emerged that Mr Osborne spent his days lounging around in silk pyjamas smoking cheroots.The deal itself is underwhelming. Good intentions are writ large in place of practical measures. This reflects the fact that the currency is not freely convertible. If it were, a big chunk of offshore activity would probably be transacted in London without Mr Osborne’s good offices, simply because the City has more capacity than any other European financial centre.Still, the UK has stolen a march on Singapore, which hopes to become an offshore renminbi centre itself. The Chinese government is inching towards giving the currency a role in international finance appropriate to the world’s second-largest economy. For example, Chinese manufacturers increasingly ask foreign customers to pay in renminbi rather than dollars. That implies some capacity to buy the currency overseas in the first place.Mr Osborne deserves credit for foresight, though he should beware the fondness of the Chinese for striking co-operation agreements with multiple foreign partners. City folk will know the panda has genuinely landed when Chinese banks plant flags across the Square Mile in the tradition of expansionary Japanese predecessors in the ’70s and ’80s. Meanwhile, the decision of US insurance broking group Aon to relocate its headquarters from Chicago to London is a far more immediate demonstration of the City’s attractions as a business hub.Flying the nestThere is some numeric voodoo to $7.3bn, the sum for which Royal Bank of Scotland is likely to sell its aircraft leasing arm. It lacks the power to inflame of 29m, the number of share options still owned by John Hourican, head of RBS’s investment bank, despite the unit’s imminent dismantlement. Instead, deduction of the $7.3bn agreed with purchaser Sumitomo Mitsui will help RBS shrink the assets it had originally counted as non-core to well below a milestone £100bn.That is decent going. The ragbag of businesses and loans had a book value of £258bn when incoming chief executive Stephen Hester deemed them superfluous in February 2009 and vowed to get shot of the bulk in five years. The division employs 5,300 people with the odd mission of making themselves unemployed, both through asset sales and the accelerated run-off of loans. That task will now become harder. All but one of 30 businesses have found buyers. Up to £40bn of loan assets are judged unworthy of sale or expedited run-off and will continue to need managing.Nice to know that despite the weak world economy – but also because of it – someone still has a safe job.Cash cowXenophobes will bridle at Müller of Germany buying Robert Wiseman, the UK’s largest fresh milk business. If dominance in dairy products makes you a strategic national asset in France (see Danone) why not in the UK too? But the three Wiseman brothers, whose 33.3 per cent combined stake is valued at £93m by the £279.5m agreed takeover, are right to sell out. With the UK’s merciless supermarkets intent on squeezing cuts from browbeaten suppliers and farmers passing on higher input costs, Wiseman is left a piggy – or perhaps a milch cow – in the middle.T’was not always thus. Dairy owner Robert Wiseman Senior started out delivering milk with a horse and cart in East Kilbride in 1947. Sons Alan, Robert and Gavin built up the business from 1967 by acquiring small private rivals and rationalising them.An aggressive company with a strong stock market following, Wiseman was found guilty of conspiring to fix milk prices in 2007.

103;AON;AON Plc;2012-01-16T20:07:07Z;Carnival losses for insurers could reach $750m;;Insurance losses arising from the stricken Costa Concordia cruise ship could come to as much as $750m, making it one of the costliest ever marine-related disasters, some analysts and underwriters have warned.The insurance coverage falls into two broad categories: so-called hull insurance, which covers physical damage to the vessel, and professional and liability insurance, which covers wider costs to third parties.The ship itself, which cost €450m to build, was insured by several companies including XL Group, Assicurazioni Generali and RSA Insurance Group, people close to the situation said. The lead P&I insurer is Standard Club, a mutual association.“This was an all-singing, all-dancing top of the range cruise ship,” said Joy Ferneyhough, insurance analyst at Espirito Santo. In absolute terms, she said, losses in excess of $500m would be “the largest ever” in the marine sector.Carnival, the cruise liner owner, used Aon as its insurance broker, the people added. The group said it would pay $40m deductibles on insurance to cover damage to the vessel and third-party personal injury cover.Neil Smith, head of underwriting at the Lloyd’s Market Association, which represents underwriters’ interests in the London insurance market, said that the total loss figure was difficult to estimate without establishing which parties were at fault.“You really need to understand exactly what’s happened and when,” he said. “There could be so many different factors that come into play.”The liner’s owners have accused Francesco Schettino, the ship’s captain, of taking a route outside the company’s guidance.In any event, the overall losses for most of the individual insurers are likely to be limited. “Large losses are spread so widely in the market,” said Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon.Generali, based in Italy, confirmed it was one of the insurers involved but said that due to its reinsurance policy any financial impact would be small. People familiar with the matter said RSA’s exposure amounted to mid single-digit millions of euros.Hannover Re, the reinsurer, warned it would take a “major loss” from the wreck, which it defines as at least €10m.XL, Aon and RSA declined to comment.
104;AON;AON Plc;2012-01-13T19:22:32Z;Aon to relocate headquarters to London;;Aon is to become the first ever US S&P 500 company to become domiciled in the UK after the insurance broker unveiled plans to shift its headquarters from Chicago to London.The move by Aon – which employs 59,000 people globally and has a market capitalisation of $15bn – gives a boost to London’s status as a global financial centre. HSBC is among the UK-based institutions to signal it might move its headquarters overseas given the costs of regulation.Aon, the world’s biggest insurance broker by sales and sponsor of Manchester United football club, said the shift to the UK would provide greater access to emerging markets and place it closer to the Lloyd’s of London insurance market.Greg Case, chief executive – who plans to move to London along with about half of the group’s executive committee – said the shift would “reinforce the global connectivity of the firm”.The relocation also comes after George Osborne announced a liberalisation of the “controlled foreign companies” taxation regime – anti-avoidance measures affecting foreign profits. The UK chancellor said the move was designed to reverse a trend of companies leaving the country.That prompted WPP, the global advertising group, to say that it would move its tax base back to the UK.Asked if the taxation rule changes were a factor in the planned move, Mr Case said: “There was a whole series of things that we looked at. But the fundamental driver behind this decision was strategic.”Chris Morgan, UK head of tax policy at KPMG, said: “If I was talking to clients two or three years ago about where to put a holding company, I’d say don’t come to the UK. Now I’d say the UK is almost at the top of the list.”Aon said it would remain regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that the move would not result in job losses in the US. The switch is subject to shareholder approval.John Nelson, chairman of the Lloyd’s market, said: “This is saying ‘we want our top management to be closer to the worldwide hub for insurance’. That does indicate that there is a real determination by the top management to internationalise themselves – and London is seen to be the best place to do it.”Aon employs 5,000 people in the UK and plans to lease several floors of the Leadenhall Building development, nicknamed the “Cheesegrater”, currently under construction in the City.Mark Hoban, financial secretary to the Treasury, said Aon’s decision was “a strong endorsement of London and the UK”.S&P Indices said: “As far as we can determine, there has never been another UK domiciled company in the S&P 500.”
105;AON;AON Plc;2011-11-28T17:31:14Z;Thai floods set to boost insurance claims;;The flooding in Thailand is expected to inflate insurance claims already made against the earthquake in Japan this year because of the disruption to carmakers and other producers that were taking the impact of lost Japanese production.There is growing concern about the extent of the extra claims on business interruption policies, which are incredibly difficult to forecast, according to experts. However, the lack of large losses from the US hurricane season, which ends this week, means that global insurers and reinsurers will still struggle to improve profitability by pushing through price rises.The flooding in Thailand, which has stopped production at many important car and electronics factories, is expected to add more than $10bn in insurance losses to the roughly $60bn already seen from the huge Japanese earthquake in March and other natural disasters, making 2011 among the most costly years on record.However, the loss estimates from Thailand mainly take account of property damage, which is expected to be significant because the waters have been both very deep and very slow to recede. But the losses from business interruption as factories have stopped producing goods for sale and components for other companies are extremely difficult to quantify. This is expected particularly to affect Japanese manufacturers and their insurers and reinsurers.Daniel Saville, a specialist lawyer at law firm RPC, said there was a lot of concern among insurers of Japanese earthquake losses that they faced unexpected increases in claims.“The problem for insurers who provide business interruption cover to Japanese manufacturers is that they have to cover the losses stemming from the Thai flooding because so many businesses moved some or all of their supply chain there.”However, global reinsurers remain well capitalised in spite of this year’s losses, which limit the industry’s ability to push rates higher and restrict profitability as returns on the safe assets where they invest premium income remain poor.Bryon Ehrhart, chairman of Aon Benfield Analytics, said that the international losses faced by global reinsurers have emboldened them to try to push through price increases, but he reckoned buyers’ response would be to buy less reinsurance.“There’s a real contest going on between insurers and reinsurers as to whether a rate increase is warranted,” he said. “In the face of a request for higher prices, they [insurers that buy reinsurance] may simply decide to retain more of their risk.”Bronek Masojada, chief executive of Hiscox, the London listed insurer and reinsurer, still forecasts an overall price rise across the reinsurance industry of between 5 and 10 per cent.However, he agrees that if reinsurers lift prices further, insurers in western markets “will take on more risk themselves”.The other big uncertainty comes from the US and to some degree Europe, according to Chris Klein, director of reinsurance markets at Guy Carpenter, where changes to loss forecasting models could lead rating agencies to demand reinsurers hold more capital.“There is a lot of uncertainty about this in the US, which makes it very difficult to call which way rates are going,” he said.“We are certainly not in a position where we will see industry capital grow this year, but it remains well capitalised,” he added.
106;AON;AON Plc;2011-11-15T10:22:56Z;British Land keeps positive on London;;British Land, the UK property developer, on Tuesday maintained its positive medium-term outlook for the central London office market in spite of economic uncertainty.Reporting a 2.2 per cent first-half increase in the value of its property portfolio, British Land said demand from occupiers had been “subdued” in the City of London, although the broader central London office market had performed well.However, Chris Grigg, chief executive, echoed other property companies in warning that the fallout from the eurozone crisis could have longer-term consequences for the UK property market.The total value of British Land’s property portfolio rose 2.2 per cent to £10.2bn in the six months to September 30, driven by a 5.3 per cent increase in the value of its offices, while its retail estate rose 0.7 per cent.Net asset value per share rose 4.2 per cent to 591p over the same period when calculated on an underlying basis consistent with European Public Real Estate Association guidelines.Pre-tax profit was £331m, up marginally from £328m for the first half of 2010. On an underlying basis, pre-tax profit was £132m, up 3.9 per cent.A second-quarter dividend of 6.5p per share has been declared, making a total of 13.5p for the first half, unchanged from the first half of 2010.The company confirmed on Tuesday that it had a binding agreement with Aon, the insurance broker and consultant, to lease 191,000 sq ft of space in its forthcoming Leadenhall Building development, nicknamed the “Cheesegrater”.Aon will take the lower 10 floors of the 47-floor building with an average lease term of 19 years. Mr Grigg said the headline rent figure was £56.50 per square foot, while the deal includes a 33 month rent-free period.FT CommentThose with fixed assets are usually first to suffer in a storm. Accordingly, property investors are in defensive mode. The sector has taken a pounding during the past six months, with most real estate investment trusts trading at hefty discounts to NAV. Among the companies, however, the risk profile varies greatly. British Land’s strong London exposure and well pre-let development pipeline puts it at the safer end of the spectrum. Its shares barely reflect this, trading at a prospective year-end price to NAV of 0.83 times, compared with the sector on 0.8 times. The company’s 5.1 per cent dividend yield is also 1 percentage point above that of its peers. While the sector remains risky, British Land offers a cheap opportunity to get protection against the worst, while providing a shot at cashing in on a recovery.
107;AON;AON Plc;2011-10-02T03:34:57Z;Rising demand for pension buy-outs;Demand for UK buy-outs is set to increase six-fold in the next 10-15 years;"Investment banks are eyeing up the possibilities of the UK pensions market as demand for buy-outs is set to increase six-fold in the next 10 to 15 years.The market for pension buy-outs (passing the entire scheme to a specialist insurer) and buy-ins (insuring the liabilities) in the UK is currently about £30bn ($47bn), estimates consultancy Aon Hewitt, which projects growth to £150bn over the next decade.Paul Belok, principal and actuary at Aon Hewitt, says at current levels the buy-out market would be overstretched but he expects more providers to enter the space, offering much-needed capacity.Until now insurers have been the most likely buy-out providers but investment banks are keen to introduce new faces to the market. “The banks will be trying to entice new investors in,” says Mr Belok. “They’re all looking at securitising risk and passing it on to investors.”Although investment banks will be able to mop up some pensions risk themselves, Mr Belok says, they will also play a wider role in acting as a “matchmaker” between pension funds and the wider capital markets.“The banks may take some risk on a proprietary basis but there will be a limit to how much they want to take.“Hedge funds and private equity funds will be looking to take on uncorrelated longevity risk to balance out their portfolios,” he says, adding that national investment funds with a “longer term game plan”, notably those based in developing economies, would also be interested in taking on pension risk.Martin Bird, managing principal at Aon Hewitt, says: “Pension risk is seen as attractive because of all the demographics embedded in it. If buy-out opens up to the capital markets it creates billions of pounds in capacity from new sources, which is positive [for pension funds] because it creates pressure on insurers to show good pricing.”Mr Belok says new market entrants will be enticed only if pension funds are willing to pay the requisite prices that would guarantee a return on capital. “That is where the tension lies; will the new entrants be satisfied that they can charge at a level that will give them the return they want.”While some pension scheme sponsors look to buy-out as a solution to their problems, other schemes will remain active but de-risk a large section of their assets. Aon Hewitt projects the coming 10 to 15 years will see a £600bn move to risk-free or low-risk vehicles.The traditional safe haven, UK index-linked gilts, may not be adequate, as the market is worth just £300bn, but commentators say there are ample prospects to reduce risk by investing in a wider range of instruments.European companies with strong fundamentals offer investors access to cheap high-yield corporate bonds, and non-UK sovereign debt can offer low-risk investments if carefully selected.The key here, says Bernard Abrahamsen, director of fixed income at M&G Investments, is timing.“The big story right now is getting hold of seniority, security and an income linked to inflation. What pension schemes and other institutions with liabilities to match should be considering is patient opportunism; allocating to senior and/or secured assets; and pouncing on attractive value when it appears,” he says.However, since so many institutions, including insurers and pension funds, are likely to be chasing these investments as soon as they appear, it may be necessary for investors to look outside traditional fixed-income asset classes.Fortunately for pension funds, the banks are under pressure to deleverage their balance sheets in the wake of the credit crisis and upcoming Basel III regulations, meaning they need to offload long-dated, illiquid assets that provide no match for their short-term, liquid liabilities.Consequently assets that are risky from a bank perspective are now appealing and available to pension funds.Chris Laxton, director of real estate investment at Aviva Investors, says: “We are already starting to see considerable interest from UK pension funds to invest in secondary market low-risk bank assets such as infrastructure and social housing debt. They are not only attractive from a returns perspective but also from a liability matching perspective.”Although social housing and infrastructure projects do not offer risk-free investment, they are certainly considered “low risk”, and are well regulated and offer long-term inflation-linked cash flows.Mr Abrahamsen describes social housing investment as “a lender’s market”, adding: “It is a similar tale in infrastructure. Pension schemes should look less at infrastructure development risk and more at core assets, such as airports, gas transmission networks and toll roads, that come with good regulation and strong management teams.“The legacy of the credit crunch is that governments and companies are already offloading such assets, so this also looks like an investor’s market for pension schemes.”With additional reporting by Sophia Grene"
108;AON;AON Plc;2011-09-30T21:42:51Z;Man United to ramp up fan base gains;;The money Manchester United can make from exploiting its fan base will “dwarf” the income it has been acquiring from sponsorship deals, Richard Arnold, the Premier League champions’ commercial director predicted.While the Glazer family, which bought the club in 2005, ponders when to advance their $1bn Singapore flotation plans, the club’s executives are working on the next phase of the owners’ long-term goal of maximising income from its fame.The economic climate is forcing the Glazers to delay a planned initial public offering of about a third of the club’s equity on the Singapore stock exchange. But, as and when it does go to market, United’s commercial potential is bound to be a key part of its sales pitch.Officials have in recent weeks closed the latest of several deals with credit card companies that will enable United to earn income directly from their fans around the world. The club makes money when the Manchester United branded cards are first activated, during their general use and whenever the user incurrs charges.Up until now, United has expanded its commercial income from high-profile deals such as the £80m shirt sponsorship with US insurance group Aon, and the £40m training kit deal with logistics company DHL. United last season earned £103.4m in commercial revenues, up 27 per cent on the previous season.But Mr Arnold said the club had not yet taken its fanbase “and put that into a money-making machine”.The club’s customer database stands at 11m, he revealed, giving it a quantity of data and knowledge “about the same as a Boots or Tesco’s loyalty card”.But United has “a very high level of confidence” that the database will continue to grow at an “exponential” rate, and the potential income from direct monetisation of the fan base, such as United-branded credit cards in the Far East, was huge.“Adding these pieces together, it makes what we do now look like small fry…Even on some of the sponsorship activities and merchandising activities and the licensing activity, our opportunity in the future dwarfs the work that we’re doing currently.”However, the Manchester United Supporters Trust, the Glazers’ most strident critics, questioned whether the owners really understood the club’s fans. “The problem with their ownership model is the fans don’t feel a sense of ownership,” says Duncan Drasdo of MUST. “They feel a sense of exploitation.”Trying to persuade the fan base to spend money has proved “an impossible nut to crack”, he added.Mr Arnold acknowledged that cracking the Chinese market – “a hugely important piece of the puzzle in our commercial success” – was complicated and time-consuming.The club’s commercial strategy was shifting away from doing global deals with single brands to the more exhaustive task of multiple deals in individual countries. “Have we got the strategies sorted? No, but we’re erecting some phenomenal building-blocks for each and every one of these markets,” he said.In contrast to United’s manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who earlier this week complained about the dominance of TV over football clubs, Mr Arnold had nothing but admiration for the way the Premier League and television had turned clubs such as United into “global property”.United’s matches were ubiquitious pieces of TV content, he said, speaking before Sir Alex’s comments were made public. “There’s nothing else in the world that is shown at least two hours a week on 80 per cent of the world’s televisions. There isn’t.”
109;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Suspect trades reinforce ringfencing argument;;Sir John Vickers, who just unveiled plans to protect UK retail deposits from investment banking losses, can permit himself a wry smile. Estimated losses of $2bn from alleged rogue trades at UBS are a timely reminder of the dangers of so-called “casino” banking. It is serendipitous for supporters of ringfencing, for the moment winning the political argument in the UK, that the trading blow-out occurred at a bank in receipt of a government bail-out – albeit a Swiss one – in 2008.UBS’s maverick transactions have caused too little damage to strain the bank’s stability, though a $2bn write-off could trigger a third-quarter group loss. But the ease with which deluded or dishonest traders can evidently still dodge internal risk limits will reinforce distrust of an investment banking sector where bad legitimate bets are a far greater systemic problem.The case gives a strong associative boost to ringfencing because it occurred within UBS’s City of London satellite. Kweku Adoboli, the trader implicated in the P&L implosion, specialised in synthetic exchange traded funds. These can mismatch liabilities and assets lucratively but dangerously. Taxpayers should not have to underwrite such innovations.The $2bn loss would place the culprit around third in the all-time league table of bank bad apples. Jérôme Kerviel remains the all-time champ, having run up losses of $6.8bn in European index futures at Société Générale between 2006 and 2008. The bar has risen since Nick Leeson, the loose canon immortalised in a bad film starring Ewan McGregor, dropped a paltry £830m on index futures in the 90s, though he did bring down Barings, an illustrious merchant bank.The term “rogue trader” is usually a misnomer. It implies swaggering recklessness. The reality is more often an eager-to-please young man who covers up maladroit trades to protect his workplace credibility. Mr Adoboli’s guilt should not be presumed. We do not know what his explanation of events will be. But missing out on a framed “employee of the month” certificate is now the least of his worries.Incidentally, no big investment bank has ever exposed a rogue trader who has boosted its profits with unauthorised trades. Funny, that.Spanish waiterThe wisdom of ringfencing may remain obscure to executives at Santander, which may postpone the flotation of a 20 per cent stake in its UK subsidiary until 2013. This is partly because the government needs to give banks better guidance on its preferred split between retail and investment banking. The Spanish group is best known in the UK for its branch network, but also has a City of London offshoot offering hedging and other balance sheet services.Unlikely that Santander could have gone ahead this year, anyway. Underwriters offering £3bn in fresh bank shares would hardly risk being knocked down by a rush of buyers. Santander’s Madrid-listed shares have fallen by about 50 per cent since the start of 2010. Some London-quoted rivals have done worse. Better wait for the upturn, of which Thursday’s central bank-induced rally could be a tentative harbinger. Syndicates officers have a reputation for milking market peaks to maintain.A hong goes longCognitive dissonance impedes an appreciation of Jardine Matheson’s £166m offer for 10 per cent of FTSE 250 insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson. Some high-profile dominant shareholders make life a misery for managements of investee companies. So it seems counter-intuitive that Jardines – one of the great trading houses, or “hongs”, that built Hong Kong – should wish JLT’s board well in its mission to lure market share away from international broking behemoths Aon, Marsh and Willis.The conglomerate controlled by the Keswick family plans to lift its stake to 40.35 per cent at a very acceptable 24 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price. Jardines, which part owns businesses such as Hongkong Land and Dairy Farm, can introduce JLT to some useful clients and reap the rewards in dividends. The broker’s Asian revenues are already growing at a fast lick – 33 per cent at the half year – albeit from a low base.The purchase, which should benefit all shareholders in the long term, will make it easier for JLT to lure staff from Big Three insurance brokers. New recruits will no longer fear a takeover by an erstwhile employer. Mendacious equity traders will meanwhile find it marginally harder to start rumours of a takeover by an insurance industry rival. A forward earnings multiple of 15.7 times makes the shares pricier than those of the Big Three and high enough for now.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
110;AON;AON Plc;2011-09-15T08:59:30Z;Chief JLT shareholder set to raise stake;;Jardine Lloyd Thompson, the insurance broker, has welcomed a plan by its biggest shareholder to pay £166m to increase its stake in the business, saying it would kill recurrent takeover speculation.Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, on Thursday announced that it wanted to increase its holding in JLT from 30.35 per cent to 40.35 per cent.It is proposing to buy almost 22m shares at 765p each in cash – a premium of 24 per cent to JLT’s closing price of 619p on Wednesday.Dominic Burke, JLT chief executive, said the move would help JLT in its bid to take on the three biggest operators in insurance broking – Aon, Marsh and Willis – by dispelling talk that it could be bought.Such speculation had the potential to deter potential recruits from joining the company, he said: “Rumours always circulate that we are about to be subject to a takeover offer. It creates fear in the marketplace.”“This will give confidence to new hires – the talent in their 30s and 40s who are at a promising point in their careers – that if they join JLT they are not going to end up quickly back where they came from on the wrong end of a merger.”Asked if the proposal by Jardine Matheson had been sparked by JLT finding out that one of its larger rivals was finally preparing a real takeover bid, Mr Burke said: “Not that I’ve heard about, or the board.”The move by Jardine Matheson was a “tremendous vote of confidence” in JLT’s strategy and its exposure to Asia and Latin America, he said.The partial offer will require majority support from the other shareholders in JLT in a vote separate to any individual decision to tender shares. It already has the support of JLT’s independent board of directors.Mr Burke denied that it would create a situation of creeping control, saying Jardine Matheson was not looking to increase its board representation from the two directors it currently nominates.Barrie Cornes, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, the broker, said: “We view it as a vote of confidence in the business but it will remove any bid speculation in the share price.”Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said he thought the offer would set a new floor at 765p for the stock price. “JLT is an undervalued company, with considerable opportunities for organic growth in its key markets…especially in Asia, from which it can profitably leverage the JM relationship,” he said.Jardine Matheson has been a significant investor in JLT since 1997, when it merged its JIB subsidiary with Lloyd Thompson to form JLT.Shares in JLT rose 6.95% to 662p in late afternoon trading on Thursday in London.
111;AON;AON Plc;2011-09-08T18:22:48Z;Loss and recovery: Great tragedy invoked great determination;;Warren Mula began the day of September 11 2001 on the 105th floor of 2 World Trade Center with a full diary of meetings. He came in early and then headed out just before 8am for a doctor’s appointment.Mr Mula, who is now global head of the broking business for Aon, a risk management and human resource consulting company, switched elevators on the 78th floor, the “Sky Lobby,” where he said hello to colleagues who were heading up to Aon’s offices.“I think everyone I saw that day perished,” Mr Mula says. Aon lost 176 staff.The 9/11 attacks caused devastating losses for companies whose offices were housed in the two towers that had come to symbolise US capitalism.“There was no playbook, no management course to prepare for this,” Mr Mula says.A decade later, there are common threads in how some companies dealt with the crushing loss of colleagues, friends and, in some cases, family members.There was support for the families of those who perished. Some companies set up education and other funds and paid initial money from salaries, bonuses and payments associated with partnerships.They also remember the victims with annual services, memorials and tribute websites.And, they rebuilt.“All we knew how to do was go back to work,” says John Duffy, chairman and chief executive of KBW, an investment bank that lost 67 of 171 employees in the south tower. Among them, on the trading desk, was Christopher, Mr Duffy’s 23-year-old son.Amid the anger, horror and heartbreak, working together with colleagues who survived was thera­peutic. “It was a place to channel your adrenalin in a positive manner,” says Thomas Michaud, KBW vice-chairman.Howard Lutnick, chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, the bond and equity broker where 658 of 960 New York-based employees died in the attacks, recalls a makeshift office with camp beds where colleagues worked around the clock sleeping in four-hour shifts.Mr Lutnick, whose brother, Gary, died, also weathered public rebuke for halting salary payments for those employees who were missing in the days after 9/11.He argued Cantor could not pay the salaries because those revenues were no longer coming in.In October 2001, the company instead paid bonuses to the families of those who perished – a larger amount.The criticism has eased over the years as it also paid 25 per cent of its profits to the families for five years, a total of more than $180m – thanks to the rebirth of the business – and healthcare expenses for 10 years.Businesses that were severely affected but had extensive global operations or were based outside New York still had basic infrastructure. But for others, trading books, computer systems, passwords, client lists and paper documents were destroyed.Some businesses that were unsure they could stay afloat in the days after 9/11 not only did so but have thrived.Cantor developed its debt capital markets business and expanded into areas such as commercial real estate. It spun off BGC Partners, an interdealer broker.Together they now trade more than $800bn of financial instruments daily.KBW more than doubled its staff and expanded into Europe and Asia.Sandler O’Neill, an investment bank that lost 66 of it 171 employees, is twice the size of what it was on September 10 2001, says Jon Doyle, managing principal.Executives credit their success in part to a determination that came from enduring such tragedy. Nobody wanted to fail because of September 11.Some had help in the immediate aftermath.Wall Street, the crucible of capitalism, softened as rivals offered business and clients were supportive.The day KBW opened for business one week after 9/11, it had three times its normal trading volume.Companies were also able to hire good staff quickly because many other organisations were laying people off as Wall Street came out of its late 1990s boom.Looking back, Mr Doyle says “there were moments when it felt like too much.”He happened to be in Boston and was on a call with his New York colleagues on the 104th floor of the south tower when the line went dead on September 11.The grieving and healing process continues.The office of chief medical examiner in New York City announced last month it had positively identified Ernest James, who worked in the IT department at Marsh & McLennan, as a victim of September 11.The insurance broker and consultancy lost 295 staff and 63 consultants that day.“It is not something you recover from,” says Dan Glaser, the company’s chief operating officer. “It is something you cope with.”Like other companies that lost people in the attacks, Cantor holds a memorial service every year with the families and friends of the Cantor victims. “Together, we keep them alive,“ says Mr Lutnick.
112;AON;AON Plc;2011-08-31T11:00:58Z;Pension falls lead people to work longer;Retirement income has decreased by 2 per cent;More people are planning to ask their employer if they can continue working past retirement, amid fears that they have not saved enough to stop working and live comfortably.One in four people aged over 60 still in employment has asked their employers if they can continue to work after the official retirement age of 65, while a further 26 per cent are intending to do so, according to research from MetLife, the pension provider.A third of those hoping to work beyond 65 said they needed to have more time to build up their retirement savings, with 45 per cent saying they could not afford to retire.From October this year, the default retirement age - a law that allowed employers to force people to retire at age 65 - is being phased out, meaning that people can continue working as long as they like.But fewer people in the MetLife survey wanted to work full-time into their late 60s. Just 28 per cent wanted to stay full-time in their current job, while 40 per cent wanted to stay in their job but work part-time. A further 11 per cent said they wanted to move employers.The survey, which questioned 1,000 non-retired UK adults over the age of 60, also found that women were less likely to be able to afford to retire than men.Women are more likely to have gaps in their retirement savings due to periods out of the workplace while having children. While 42 per cent of men said they could not afford to retire at 65, this rose to 50 per cent of women.A separate study this week warned that retirement prospects for UK workers had declined in the past three months due to a combination of falls in the stock market and lower annuity rates.Aon Hewitt found that expected retirement income had decreased by 2 per cent for those aged 60 and 65, and by 4 per cent for those aged 30 since May.But the consultants said that the figures should not deter people from savings towards their retirement.“While market fluctuations can affect the expected retirement income, they should not be considered as a major distraction, as pensions are a long-term investment vehicle,” said John Foster, benefits consultant.“There is always a degree of risk involved in seeking higher returns, and it is important not to over-react to these short-term fluctuations. This is particularly relevant for members who are 20, 30 or 40 years away from retirement.”
113;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Man United agrees sponsorship deal with DHL;;Manchester United has persuaded DHL, the logistics company, to pay £10m ($16.5m) a year to sponsor the club’s training kit, a deal that underlines the strength of the Premier League champions’ global profile.The deal, which will last four years, is a pioneering form of sponsorship for an English football club, borrowing from the US, where players wear sponsor-branded training apparel to maximise commercial opportunities for their teams.DHL, already the club’s official logistics partner, will have its name on the bibs, tracksuits and training shirts of first team, reserves and youth team players, and the name will figure prominently in press briefings by Sir Alex Ferguson, United’s manager.The TV exposure of players wearing training kit is limited to sports news bulletins and programmes compared with match coverage, and the players will only wear DHL-branded kit in the build-up to matches in domestic competitions.Yet, United, which is planning a flotation in Singapore in the fourth quarter of this year, has secured a deal with DHL that represents half the value of United’s high-profile shirt sponsorship contract with Aon, the insurance company.The DHL deal is worth more to United than the shirt sponsorship deal the club signed a decade ago with Vodafone.David Gill, United’s chief executive, said: “This deal breaks new ground in the English game.”The deal is the latest in a series of commercial contracts signed by a 70-strong sales team dedicated to exploiting the United brand globally.Another deal being lined up is with Mamee Double Decker, a Malaysian snack food manufacturer, in which the United name will be associated with the company’s Mister Potato brand of crisps and chips.The Singapore flotation fits into United’s attempt to exploit its name recognition internationally, particularly in Asia, where the club claims a fan base of 190m.Outside the Aon deal, commercial revenues were heading towards £40m a year, a substantial increase on the £24m made in 2009-10.Of the club’s income streams, commercial revenue represents United’s most obvious opportunity for growth.The Glazer family, the US-based owner of United since 2005, is said to be keen that the proceeds of the flotation are used to pay down the club’s gross debt of £515m, although some observers believe the family also needs to clear personal debts.
114;AON;AON Plc;2011-08-14T11:46:47Z;US struggles with pension reform;Lawmakers grapple with the same demographic issue facing all western societies;As the US Senate finally agreed its debt ceiling after weeks of political gridlock, the often tribal debate over how to tackle its long-term social security bill rumbles on.The US government is facing the same demographic issue as all western societies: how to fund a rising ratio of elderly citizens to working-age population.There are currently three workers to every retiree in the US, compared with 42 workers to every retiree in 1945. By 2035, there are expected to be just two workers to every pensioner.Equally, the US has another problem facing most developed nations, in that its citizens do not save enough independently of any state benefits. And so, when they reach retirement and discover they do not have enough to live on, they turn to the state for assistance.It is perhaps surprising the greatest proponent – if not practitioner – of free market economics should have a universal social security system, but it does. Everyone pays in, and everyone gets their cut. Means-testing is largely irrelevant to this equation.But the board of trustees that manages the social security trust fund recently estimated the fund would be depleted by 2036, meaning a cut in benefits of 23 per cent – or $270 (£167) a month on average for each retiree. As a universal system, it is ripe for reform, with politicians keen to point out that “we’re all in it together”.The latest bill proposing reform was sponsored by Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican senator from Texas, who in her final term of office before her own retirement would be immune to any chicanery and could walk away with her reputation intact.Her bill proposed reducing the burden on the social security fund through a series of measures, in particular by making adjustments to indexation and the normal retirement age.“My proposal defends retirees from core benefit cuts and saves social security for future generations without raising taxes,” says Senator Hutchison.The bill would reduce by 1 percentage point the cost of living adjustment, which is the annual increase in pension payments and tied to inflation. It would also raise the age retirees first receive the benefit from the current projected 67 to 69 by 2027.She claims the proposal would achieve $416bn in deficit reduction over 10 years, and $7,200bn over 75 years.Some of those on the political left see this as an attack on the lower paid, but the proposal is not particularly unusual and certainly not without precedent.The UK’s coalition government has introduced a similar reduction in pension increases for public sector workers, with the substitution of (generally lower) consumer price index inflation protection for the retail price index. It also plans to accelerate the equalisation of retirement ages between men and women, while planning to increase retirement ages for all.Andrew Biggs, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, and a former adviser to George W Bush on social security issues, is broadly sympathetic to Senator Hutchison’s proposal as it avoids raising taxes. Higher taxes result in people working less and retiring earlier, Mr Biggs says.“That is because their social security benefits will seem more generous relative to their after-tax earnings, because the taxes are pushing those earnings down,” he says. “Instead of encouraging people to retire later, you’re encouraging them to retire earlier.”Mr Biggs claims modelling he has done on the raising of the early retirement age to 65 (Senator Hutchison proposes an increase from 62 to 64) would raise the long-term economic output in terms of gross domestic product by about 3 percentage points. This would generate not only more tax revenue, but give people longer to contribute to other retirement saving, such as employer-sponsored 401(k) plans.That is all very well, says Michael Calabrese, senior research fellow at New America, President Barack Obama’s favourite think-tank, but more than half the US working population are not participating at all in qualified plans. A third are ineligible or would not benefit because they are part-time, temporary, seasonal, or transient workers.He is pessimistic about the chances of any new bill to reform retirement saving. “Most progressive pension advocates would view the automatic IRA [individual retirement account – similar to a personal pension in the UK] as a strong option,” he says. “That is because the infrastructure is ahead of these proposals in the queue. But we can’t even get political traction for that right now.”This is despite the fact President Obama has already embraced the concept of an automatic IRA, which would be similar to the UK’s auto-enrolment framework, to be introduced in October 2012.“The big hurdle is finding the different ways the government can encourage people to save,” says William Gale, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a centrist think-tank.He is looking at alternatives to legislative change that would place control in the hands of those who administer the employer-sponsored schemes, as mandatory legislation, incentives and education have not worked to create greater retirement saving among US citizens.“Administrative design became attractive as some models seem to have a big influence, such as auto- enrolment or auto-escalation,” says Mr Gale. “Inertia is good. It works.”The latest data from Aon Hewitt’s biannual survey of defined contribution provision in the US show 56 per cent of plans currently use auto-enrolment – up from 34 per cent in 2007 – and 51 per cent use automatic contribution escalation, up from 44 per cent in 2009.But there is still pessimism that the US is incapable of solving its demographic issues.“The amazing thing is, if you look around the world, countries all face the same kind of problems we have – ageing populations, rising healthcare costs,” says Mr Biggs.“But countries are able to solve these problems. We have something that is uniquely dysfunctional here in the US that we can’t get on top of this.”Pádraig Floyd is editor-in-chief, UK pensions and investment group at the FT.

116;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Indian employers still hiring even as GDP growth slows;;"India’s economic growth may be slowing but businesses are still looking to hire more staff, according to the latest Manpower global employment outlook survey, published by the global recruitment agency on Tuesday.Among emerging markets, Indian employers reported the strongest year-on-year increase in hiring intentions for the third quarter of 2011, although there was some contraction from the second quarter. But recruiters still struggle to find skilled workers, putting pressure on wage inflation and hurting margins as employers battle with competitors to retain the best staff.“Clients in emerging markets may have a surplus of candidates who often don’t possess the level of education, skills and experience required for the job,” said Jeff Joerres, Manpower’s chairman and CEO.India has the highest wage inflation in the Asian region, as the FT reported last month. Salaries will by rise almost 13 per cent this year from 11.7 per cent last year, according to research by Aon Hewitt, a global human resources company.Businesses in India’s wholesale and retail sectors reported particularly strong hiring intentions in the Manpower survey as signs emerge that FDI in multi-brand retail may finally be liberalised in the country.Manpower advised:… following the announcement by India’s junior trade minister this week that India will be revealing new rules for foreign retail investment by April 2012, the hiring intentions reveal that this sector is set to grow, and as one of the few untapped retail markets left, foreign retailers should watch this space and prepare for this opportunity.But there is a distinct talent shortage in the sector. As beyondbrics reported last month, the hospitality sector, which competes for staff with one with the wholesale and retail sectors, is experiencing sharp wage inflation. Hotel managers’ salaries, for example, are poised to rise by 50 per cent this year.Recruiters are also looking for researchers, sales managers, and IT staff in the services, finance, insurance and real estate sectors, the Manpower survey finds. This is a distinct change from the survey’s results last year when Indian businesses were struggling to fill low-skilled positions such as bricklayers and miners.While this suggests a growing sophistication of the Indian economy, it also indicates a slow-down in capital investment, precipitated by tighter monetary policies over the past year. Nevertheless, even a moderating Indian economy appears to offer plenty of opportunity for skilled workiers.Related reading:

117;AON;AON Plc;2011-05-27T22:36:55Z;Man Utd players shine as Glazers stay in shade;;How much is Manchester United worth? One year ago, England’s best-known club faced problems. The trophy cabinet displayed just the minor prize of the League Cup.Fans were in mutinous mood, disgruntled with the Glazer family, the secretive owners, and draping themselves defiantly in the club’s original colours of green and gold. Off the pitch, wealthy supporters were contemplating a takeover offer. Concluding that the club’s value was in decline, they thought an offer of more than £1bn ($1.65bn) was appropriate.Things look somewhat different now. The Premier League title is won and on Saturday United face Barcelona at Wembley in the Champions League final. Success on the pitch has stilled the protests. Rumours of a sale have died away, which is just as well. It is thought the Glazers now believe the club to be worth more than £2bn – not because United are playing well but because the club is starting to exploit its brand value. The club is not for sale anyway.The Florida-based Glazers, who will be at Wembley in force, will never be popular. Their ownership will for ever be associated with the £790m leveraged buy-out that six years after their takeover and a year after refinancing, still leaves the club with gross debt north of £500m.Andy Green, a United blogger and noted Glazer critic, says: “The club has been appalling, noticeably at trying to communicate any positive image. If people like me are wrong, why not engage with us?”Last year’s £500m bond issue was the most public unveiling of the family’s strategy but it also exposed them to charges that cash could be used to pay down their debts, among them the onerous high-interest payment-in-kind notes.These were repaid at the end of last year, though exactly by whom is not known. As far as the Glazers are concerned, it is no one else’s business. United declined to comment.The Glazers are not ones to change tack because of unpopularity. But the hiring of a PR agency suggests they are sensitive to criticism that they have failed to explain their vision.The owners may not find a more opportune time to creep out from behind their cloak of silence. They bought United because as owners of a sports franchise in the US, they believed they had the knowledge to tap its brand commercially. With a team of 70 sales and marketing staff in London, the United brand is on the move, scouring the globe, cutting deals with companies eager to piggyback on its global recognition.United have 14m subscribers to its Facebook page, a database of 10m and a fan base that at its core may number 140m. In addition to Aon, its shirt sponsor, and Nike, its technical partner, the club has 11 official sponsors in sectors such as tour operators, airlines, automotives and beer. Categories to fill include energy and handsets.It wants to exploit its MUTV broadcasting operation, which it brought back in-house last year, and push content such as highlights through digital media.Commercial deals other than Aon may hit £40m, compared with £24m last year. United is also about to recover the rights to financial services it gave to AIG, its former shirt sponsor.That means a revenue share for the club for every United credit and debit card sign-up fee and transaction. And it will see the upcoming renewal of the Nike contract as an opportunity to extract better terms.Other revenue streams are less flexible. United will make £60m from its cut of English and European TV rights deals but these are in the negotiating hands of others. Gate receipts are not immune from recession – the strategy is to hold what it has.Mr Green acknowledges that the commercial revenues are “very useful” – “but it doesn’t change the fact that you have £40m-odd walking out the door just to pay the interest”.United’s cash position is heading towards £150m, from which the club should have £60m to disperse as it sees fit.Sir Alex Ferguson, the manager, may like to get his hands on some of that. But the prospects of the Glazers taking dividend payments that the refinancing made possible are scarce, says Mr Green, given the adverse reaction it would generate. “The green and gold campaign had an effect,” he says.One area in which the Glazers will not mind spending some cash is the bonuses players will get if they win at Wembley. Might victory prompt some family members to stand in front of a TV microphone to thank the fans for their support? That would be a stretch.
118;AON;AON Plc;2011-05-24T03:18:17Z;British Land to tap into retailing trend;;British Land, the UK’s second-biggest property company, will increase its focus on developing shops around the UK regions in a sign of confidence that under-fire retailers will continue to consolidate in bigger and better stores.British Land reported a 12.5 per cent increase in full-year net asset value per share to 567p, driven by property value growth of 6.9 per cent on the back of a solid lettings performance.Estimated rental values rose 0.7 per cent in its retail portfolio, which comprises 33m sq ft of retail warehousing, supermarkets and shopping centres, and by a more marked 7.7 per cent in its London offices.Chris Grigg, chief executive, said that rising rents in its almost fully let £4.9bn ($7.9bn) portfolio justified the company’s bullish view that it had invested in the right areas that were underpinned by continuing occupier demand.“People want to shop in the right locations …and retailers are going to go to the right areas, which means those that are regionally dominant. As rents improve, we will do more developments in future.”British Land’s confidence comes in spite of gloomy consumer sentiment and a difficult time for retailers. The company, which has about two-thirds of its portfolio in the retail sector, has lined up a number of schemes for the next stage of development, including in Luton and Hampshire.It is also in talks to build an Ikea store next to Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield, which it owns with London & Stamford.The company has previously been focused more on its London development business, where it is rolling out a £1.1bn programme to build 2.2m sq ft of offices by 2014 that will increase the weighting of offices in its portfolio.Last week it signed a rental agreement with Aon to lease about a third of the Leadenhall Building, while it has also let a building to UBS at Broadgate that is at the centre of a row over a potential listing.Mr Grigg said there would be more opportunities to buy in future, having made about £511m of acquisitions last year. He said that the company would consider expanding its residential and overseas property exposure if it found the right deals.For the 12 months to March 31, pre-tax profit fell from £1.13bn to £830m, while underlying profit, which strips out the revaluation of its portfolio, rose from £249m to £256m.Diluted earnings per share fell from 132.6p to 95.2 and the total dividend is held at 26p.The shares, which have risen almost a third over the past year, fell 16½p to 576p.
119;AON;AON Plc;2011-05-17T14:40:25Z;Conde to step down as CEO of Sungard;;Sungard has announced chief executive Cristóbal Conde will step down at the end of the month, ending a 25-year career at the US financial technology supplier.He will be replaced by Russell Fradin, the chairman and chief executive of Aon Hewitt, the human resources group.Mr Conde has been president and chief executive at Sungard since 2002 and headed the move to take the Wayne, Pennsylvania-based group private in 2005 in one of the world’s largest-ever leveraged buy-outs.A consortium comprising Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Blackstone, Goldman Sachs, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Texas Pacific Group and Providence Equity Partners paid $11.5bn for Sungard, which provides trading technology, connectivity and data hosting to many of the world’s largest trading houses.Mr Conde has overseen an increase in Sungard’s revenues from $2.6bn to nearly $5bn although turnover in 2010 was hit by the financial crisis. Last year the net loss halved from $1.2bn to $570m and Mr Conde said the tone of business was improving, albeit at an uneven rate across its business.Speaking about his departure, Mr Conde said: “Taking the company private was the best strategic move in the company’s history. The timing for this leadership handover is right and I look forward to working with Russ and the Sungard team on a smooth transition.”Mr Fradin was previously chief executive of Bisys Group, the financial services outsourcing group and also worked at McKinsey, the consultancy. He has an MBA from Harvard Business School and a BSc in Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Glenn Hutchins, chairman of SunGard said: “The Board is impressed with Russ’s substantial leadership experience, demonstrated record of innovation and operational expertise, and customer-centric mindset that are strongly aligned with SunGard’s future needs and ambitions.”Mr Conde joined Sungard in 1987 when it bought Devon Systems International, the interest rate and currency derivatives platform, which Mr Conde co-founded.
120;AON;AON Plc;2011-05-16T19:17:08Z;Beware the reputation managers;Injuries to company image are often self-inflicted;The chief executive of the Public Relations Society of America has called the revelation that Facebook secretly hired Burson-Marsteller in the US to drum up stories and comment pieces criticising Google’s approach to privacy “a PR nightmare”.Apt. Not only was Burson-Marsteller’s client ill-served by the tactic, so was the entire PR industry – and at a moment when its corporate clients appear ripe for advice about how to avoid and recover from such nightmares.Were it not itself owned by WPP, Burson-Marsteller might benefit from the brand restoration insurance that Aon, the insurance broker, is now selling.It works like this: for an annual premium of $5m, you get advice on crisis preparedness and communications from companies in WPP’s marketing services empire. If one of a pre-agreed set of catastrophes occurs – from a product boycott to the kidnapping of a top executive – if the media alight on the disaster, and if you lose a fifth of your clients, share price or revenues as a result, you can claim up to $100m of advertising, lobbying and public relations assistance, paid by Zurich Financial Services, to restore your company’s reputation.Ah, reputation: key to the boardroom door. Of the many risks that companies must grapple with, reputational risk is the only one that gets advisers a slot in directors’ diaries and an opportunity to wave the shroud of BP’s Deepwater Horizon disaster, Toyota’s safety debacle or Tepco’s tsunami calamity at them until they get out their cheque books. The Aon product is only the latest proposed antidote to this reputation anxiety but it does shed interesting light on the effectiveness of suave reputation managers and their adrenalin-fuelled partners, the crisis managers.Business leaders should remember that, from BP to Burson-Marsteller (which admitted its campaign for Facebook was “against our policies”), recent events prove that the worst injuries to company reputation are frequently self-inflicted. Yet, other than in Enron-style cases of outright fraud, this insurance pays out even if the insured has messed up. That seems odd. I can’t claim on my motor insurance if I leave my valuables in view on the back seat, and self-harm will invalidate my health policy.The danger inherent in such insurance, and in reputational counselling more generally, is that buyers start to see it as a panacea for their management shortcomings. The product reminds me of pet insurance policies that pay for you to photocopy and distribute posters of Puss if she strays. Very helpful – except that in many cases, you don’t get your cat back. BP has spent a reported $300m on advertising, lobbying and PR in the year since the Deepwater Horizon explosion, yet its brand value still fell 27 per cent, according to the recent Brandz ranking, and its share price is off by 31 per cent.In distinguishing reputation management from crisis management, advisers call the first “the smoke detector” and the second “the fire department”. Naturally, this helps underline the indispensability of their services. But, up to a point, the parallel is accurate.An educated awareness of the reputational risks your business runs may help protect you from brand-damaging disasters. It may enhance your brand so that if a genuine accident happens, customers will start by giving your company the benefit of the doubt. It may also alert companies to the perils of success – the sort that exposed Tesco, the UK retailer, and Goldman Sachs to criticism as they expanded.Crisis management may, in its turn, mitigate the cost and impact of disasters, even those that are the product of mismanagement. Anterooms to the executive suite are suddenly crowded with advisers eager to point out that BP’s bill would have been lower if it had fostered better political connections before, and communicated and lobbied differently after, the Gulf of Mexico catastrophe.But beware of the comfort such hired hands offer. Brand and reputation are the sum of the investment of management time and energy in the invention, manufacture, marketing and distribution of successful products and services. Reputation management may sustain and promote your brand in good times and crisis management may help salvage some of it when they turn bad. But bosses who neglect the building blocks of their company’s success will find in a crisis that they have no reputation to defend, no matter how much insurance or advice they have bought.andrew.hill@ft.com
121;AON;AON Plc;2011-05-12T16:36:50Z;India struggles to cap wage inflation;;"India’s industrialists are fighting a sharp rise in salary demands as they strive to hold on to scarce talent in the world’s fastest growing large economy after China.India is battling the highest inflation of the big Asian economies. Last week the Reserve Bank of India raised its benchmark lending rates 50 basis points as it tried to bring inflation below 9 per cent.Rising energy and labour costs and higher food prices are big factors in the threat.Concern at the rising cost of living and the Congress party-led government’s inability to curb it are likely to be reflected in the results of five state elections, to be announced on Friday. These include populous states such as West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.Some political analysts say the prevailing national concern with inflation and corruption may influence voting outcomes in what are local, rather than federal, elections.India has the highest wage inflation of any Asian economy. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry estimates average salaries rose 15 per cent last year as employers tried to compensate for a double-digit rise in food and consumer prices to retain skilled labour.The majority of Indian companies identify rising manpower costs as hurting their business. Aon Hewitt, the global human resources company, estimates that wage pressure is climbing.Indian salaries will rise almost 13 per cent this year, from 11.7 per cent last year, according to its research.By comparison, China is forecast to have 9 per cent wage growth this year; the Philippines 7 per cent.“Traditionally, salary increases in India are directly linked with the level of economic activity and talent demand and supply, but this year rising inflation is also playing a role in determining salary increase budgets,” said Sandeep Chaudhary, Aon Hewitt’s regional practice leader for compensation consulting.“Double-digit increases will continue for the next several years, expected to be in the range of 12 to 15 per cent across industries.”Salary increases are highest in the engineering and automotive sectors, with hikes of above 14 per cent forecast this year. IT outsourcing trails at 11.9 per cent as pressures rise to stay cost-competitive with other outsourcing destinations, including the US, China and the Philippines.Jeff Immelt, the chairman of US engineering company General Electric, said earlier this year that the cost difference between running a call centre in the US and India had narrowed to as little as 10 per cent.Aon’s research showed some of the fastest growth in salaries was at the entry level of skilled jobs in a country that produces 3.3m graduates each year.Gaurav Dalmia, chief executive of Landmark Holdings, an investment group, said many companies were experiencing an acute “talent shortage” as human resources trailed the fast-growing economy. He said the notion that India enjoys a demographic dividend from its 1.2bn population was “a myth”.“There are many jobs available. However, talent is limited and trained people are few. This is how people are able to demand higher wages,” explains Poonam Muttreja, executive director of Delhi-based Population Foundation of India.The talent shortage is widespread but it affects some of India’s most promising sectors most. Worries are growing that India, famed for its labour cost advantages, is losing its global competitive edge.In the pharmaceutical industry, the paucity of senior research chemists and top-rank financial officers is pushing wages to levels comparable to the US.“There is a huge demand for high-end researchers, and the wage gap is closing between the west and India for those kinds of jobs,” said an India-based foreign equity investor in global pharmaceuticals. “If you are a mid-size company you are going to struggle to woo those executives.”India’s higher education system produces about 100,000 chemistry graduates every year. But drugs companies say that while these fresh graduates may be able to do entry-level jobs, after intensive training they are not prepared for more innovative, cutting-edge research.The RBI, so far, has showed little concern for wage inflation as a driver of wider pressure. For lower- income workers, it considers rising wages to be a corrective of historically exploitative levels of pay.T. Ram Mohan, professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, says inflation and lower growth conjure up the spectre of the “middle- income trap” for China and India, in which countries grow out of poverty but can no longer compete with low-cost producers. “There are indications of late that some of the euphoria about the emergence of an ‘Asian century’ is fading,” he said.Additional reporting by Amy Kazmin and Girija Shivakumar"
122;AON;AON Plc;2011-05-08T22:11:36Z;Insurance for groups to restore reputations;;The full costs of a tarnished reputation are impossible to calculate, but a clutch of the world’s largest companies are about to be offered insurance that will help pay for the advertising, lobbying and public relations that could help restore one.Aon, one of the world’s biggest insurance brokers, has teamed up with WPP, the world’s biggest marketing services group, and Zurich Financial Services, a leading insurer, to create a policy that will pay out up to $100m for an annual premium of about $5m.Global brands such as BP, Sony, Rolls-Royce, Qantas, Toyota and Accenture have all had high-profile reputational issues to deal with in the past couple of years, each with a different primary cause and wildly differing costs.Their travails underline why reputational risk scores so highly on surveys of board-level concerns.BP is thought to have spent in the region of $300m on advertising, lobbying and PR since the Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico, which sounds like a large sum until compared with the $20bn clean-up and compensation liabilities it faces.BP declined to comment on its ad spend. At the other end of the scale, Accenture had quickly to recreate all its advertising materials when it decided to drop Tiger Woods as a celebrity endorser in the wake of his personal fall from grace in late 2009.However, its full-year report for 2010 shows the company spent less on advertising overall that year than in the previous two. Aon, WPP and Zurich launched their $100m brand restoration cover last week and are initially focusing sales efforts on about 30 of the world’s biggest companies that are already clients of Aon and WPP.These include companies such as Dell, ExxonMobil, Ford, Bayer, Volkswagen, British Airways and Tesco, though the policy could subsequently be offered more widely.There have been a handful of past attempts to market reputation-related insurance, such as Chartis offering a small “spin-doctor cover” add-on to its directors’ and officers’ insurance.However, this is the first time an insurer has brought a media company into a policy and offered such a large policy limit. Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of WPP, who has been involved in the development of the product, said crisis communications were a key area for WPP clients. WPP will act as a kind of loss adjuster for the policy, advising on and directing spending for a crisis-hit company for the first few months up to a limit of about $25m.
123;AON;AON Plc;2011-05-05T17:41:16Z;Reinsurance: never since the bad year of 2005;Recent disasters might not see premiums rise;"For most reinsurers, their own finances are probably a bigger risk than catastrophes. The business, with worldwide capital of $470bn according to adviser Aon Benfield, had a rough first quarter. But for them the worst news may not be the New Zealand and Japan earthquakes ($35bn or so of insurance claims) but the possibility that they will not force up reinsurance rates. Swiss Re, which reported a $665m first-quarter loss and a 4 per cent reduction in book value, is only cautiously optimistic that premiums will rise.It is not too soon to declare 2011 an unusually bad year for the industry, the worst since 2005. Then hurricanes brought catastrophe losses to 0.33 per cent of global gross domestic product, well above the typical 0.05-0.15 per cent range of the last two decades, according to Swiss Re. Credit Suisse estimates that this year’s losses will come in around the top of that range, even without any additional big disasters.It could easily have been worse. Thanks to the government, insurers are expected to pick up only 10 per cent of the tab for the Japanese earthquake. In the US, that proportion would have been more like a third. If financial aggression gone wrong had not cost Swiss Re its double-A rating from S&P during the crisis (it needed an expensive rescue from Warren Buffett and is still waiting for an upgrade), the industry might have been tempted to thin its capital cushions.Financial strength comes with low profitability; the industry would be struggling to earn its cost of capital even without this year’s catastrophes. Such anaemic returns add to future financial risks – would new capital be available if needed? They are also a barrier to entry. Low expected returns help explain why catastrophe bonds, which allow financial investors to play in reinsurance, have failed to make significant inroads.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
124;AON;AON Plc;2011-04-25T18:57:20Z;Brokers at odds with insurers at Lloyd’s;;Fears that brokers to Lloyd’s of London are demanding extra commissions from its insurers have led to a tense exchange between Aon, the large broker, and Lloyd’s itself.The exchange has been carried out through chief executives of insurers at Lloyd’s, leaving companies unsure how to proceed and concerned about their own potential regulatory and legal exposure.Executives said Aon, Marsh and Willis, the big brokers, were putting pressure on insurers for greater commissions as lower insurance rates and lacklustre demand eat into revenues.Several feared the industry had forgotten about the fallout from the 2004 US inquiry into so-called contingent commissions, which led to large financial penalties for some brokers.The inquiry led by Eliot Spitzer as New York attorney-general was aimed as much at curbs on competition from the dominance of big brokers as at contingent commissions in particular.This month, Tom Bolt, performance director at Lloyd’s, told chief executives to be extremely careful of the status of their contracts with brokers if they agreed to pay additional carrier charges.“Lloyd’s believes that such insurer charges can carry significant regulatory risks for managing agents and for the reputation of the Lloyd’s market,” Mr Bolt wrote in a letter seen by the Financial Times. “Accordingly, it is essential that every managing agent deals with these charges with the utmost care and, in particular, in accordance to Financial Services Authority outsourcing rules and the Bribery Act 2010, which comes into force shortly.”While he did not name Aon in the letter, many in the market assumed Mr Bolt was concerned specifically about its proposed new Aon Carrier Charge.In April, Robert Brown, chief executive of Aon in the UK, wrote to chief executives to say the broker was simplifying its charges globally and replacing different types of commission with a single charge.“Having listened to concerns, we have changed our approach …and I can confirm that in the UK the ACC will be treated as a standard commission set at 3.5 per cent, payable in addition to the normal commission agreed with each carrier,” he wrote.
125;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;UK pension schemes prepare for inflation;;"There was much discussion of the inflation outlook at the recent conference held by the National Association of Pension Funds.The threat of high inflation concerns trustees of UK defined benefit pension funds for a cardinal reason. They are bound by law to increase pensions in payment, and deferred pensions, in line with inflation, although the liability is often capped. So, when inflation jumps, so do pension fund outgoings.Such fears may prove unfounded in some cases though, advisers say. This is because if rising inflation exceeds the cap that limits the inflation-matching liability of many pension funds, it can help funds reduce their liabilities.For example, if the inflation rate rose to 7 per cent bond yields would also be likely to rise. If the cap on a pension fund was set at 5 per cent, the current value of its liabilities would fall as they would be discounted at a higher rate.“The worst thing that could happen to a pension fund is deflation. If inflation is a bit ahead of the consumer price index or the retail price index rate, then pension funds with a cap wouldn't have to increase their pension payments by more than that,"" says Jeremy Tigue, manager of the Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust.Nick Sykes, partner with the pensions consultants Mercer, says the relationship between the rise in inflation and the size of liabilities is complicated as the methodology on inflation-capping varies so much from one pension scheme to the next.Generous schemes are most at risk, meanwhile, as some still offer pensioners protection against the full brunt of inflation rises. The effects of inflation on pension funds’ assets also have to be assessed, Mr Sykes notes. The array of asset classes in which schemes invest has widened since inflation was last a threat in the UK during the early 1990s, but that may not necessarily help.Commodities are generally viewed as providing inflation protection, for example, but Mr Sykes discourages pension funds from investing in the asset class. “Long term, we’re unconvinced commodities produce an attractive return. They don’t offer an income stream,” he says.Real estate, however, remains attractive. “We quite like it. Its returns are strong and it offers some inflation protection,” says Colin Robertson, global head of asset allocation at Aon Hewitt, who is just as negative as Mr Sykes on commodities.If inflation were to soar to stratospheric levels however, Mr Robertson argues that it would hit asset classes such as equities and be a “net negative” for pension funds. Funds with inflation-linked liabilities also face problems as they tend to underhedge exposure to inflation. Having said that, one must also consider the possibility that inflation may peter out.Neil Williams, chief economist for Hermes, which looks after BT’s pension scheme, thinks that unless demand returns, the pick-up in UK inflation – which is being driven by rising oil and food prices – may fizzle out in a few months. “For past inflation to guarantee future inflation you need to have strength in the labour market,” he says. “The tension in North Africa and the Middle East and the disaster in Japan have added more threats to the outlook for economic growth.”Regardless of the consequences, it stands to reason that the volatility whipping through markets in the wake of the situation in Japan and the political upheaval in North Africa, is only encouraging pension funds to rachet up their efforts to hedge portfolios against inflation risks. “There's been a surge in demand for inflation-linked bonds and this suggests to me that the world has in mind an inflationary future,” says Mr Williams of Hermes.Mr Robertson of Aon Hewitt, and Mike Smedley, a partner in KPMG’s pension practice, agree. “A large number of clients are in the process of putting on de-risking strategies or taking out the inflation or duration risks arising from their liabilities,” says Mr Robertson.Mr Smedley adds: “We’ve seen a steady growth in the number of clients who are interested in buying inflation protection. But a lot of clients don’t want to pay for it at current prices.”Historically, index-linked gilts and swaps are the conventional ways to hedge against inflation. Of the two, swaps, a type of derivative by which a scheme pays a fixed rate (over the length of the swap) and receives the retail price index yield from the counterparty bank, remain more popular as they allow managers to deploy, say, just 20 per cent of their capital to gain 100 per cent protection on their portfolios.However, Robert Gardner, founder of Redington, a UK pensions consultancy, says both investments are now a “quite expensive risk lever” for pension funds to pull.Desperate times require creative measures. In the past year, Mr Gardner notes that more pension funds have begun to invest in municipal libraries or supermarkets with long-dated leases that are linked to either the retail price index or the consumer price index. “The point to note is that people are looking at property investments via a fixed income lens,” he says.Mr Smedley says some clients have bought into RPI-linked bonds issued by National Rail. Yet he remains cautious on more unusual methods of inflation proofing. “Schemes out there are trying to do quirky things. But it can be hard to demonstrate that the quirky things are a good match to protect against inflation,” he says."
126;AON;AON Plc;2011-03-07T02:27:31Z;Brokers accused of seeking extra commission;;Insurers at Lloyd’s of London fear that the biggest brokers are returning to bad habits and demanding extra commission for business they bring to the market due to competitive pressures cutting their slim fees from corporate clients.Executives have complained that the big three global brokers, Aon, Marsh and Willis, are pressurising insurers to pay greater commissions as lower insurance rates and lacklustre demand caused by the economic slowdown eat into their revenues.They fear the industry has forgotten about the fallout from the 2004 US investigation into so-called contingent commissions, which led to large financial penalties for some brokers.Robert Hiscox, chairman of Hiscox, the London-listed insurer, said brokers were reluctant to charge corporate clients a proper fee for finding insurance cover and looked to insurers to make up the deficiency.“There is real pressure from brokers now to get their commissions up,” he said. “Insurance brokers don’t have the self-confidence to value their own advice and charge a proper fee [to their clients].”Mr Hiscox pointed to Aon’s attempts to add a 3.5 per cent brokerage charge across all contracts this year as one example.Aon denies this was an additional charge, arguing that it was an attempt to replace three separate elements that were not always transparent, with a single, standard charge.“We were just trying to increase transparency, to simplify and standardise our carrier charge,” the company said. “It was never to be put on top of other charges.”But others have expressed fears that the biggest brokers are again using their dominance of the world’s insurance markets to threaten insurers’ access to business.“Some brokers provide very good management information that can help underwriters, others ask for money just for turning up,” said one senior executive.The 2004 investigation, led by Eliot Spitzer as New York attorney-general, was aimed as much at the potential restrictions on competition from the dominance of the largest brokers as at contingent commissions in particular.“I worry that people have short memories of the reputational damage the industry suffered as a consequence of the Spitzer investigation,” said Sean McGovern, general counsel at Lloyd’s. “At Lloyd’s we have made it clear that no matter what remuneration arrangements exist they must all be transparent to clients.”Charles Philipps, chief executive of Amlin, another UK-listed insurer, expressed confidence that his underwriters could resist pressure from brokers: “We are only interested in our net premium price …what brokers charge gross to their clients is not our concern,” he said.
127;AON;AON Plc;2011-02-25T22:18:44Z;Man Utd not for sale, insist Florida owners;;Manchester United’s reclusive owners have denied rumours of an imminent takeover deal.The Florida-based Glazer family said “no discussions” with buyers had taken place and affirmed that the football club, top of the English Premier League, “is not for sale and …will not entertain any offers”.The statement came amid speculation about a possible offer from the Qatar royal family. Last week the related Qatar Holding investment vehicle reportedly denied it had plans to launch a buy-out, which observers speculated could attract a bid of up to £1.5bn ($2.4bn).Increased commercial sales saw overall club revenue in the six months to December 31 increase from £144.7m to £156.5m. The rise was largely down to a new sponsorship deal with Aon, the US insurance broker, which helped lift commercial revenue 30 per cent from £38.7m to £50.4m. Pre-tax profits remained stable at £21.8m.Gross debt declined from £512.5m to £489.4m, largely thanks to a decision by the Glazers to buy back £24m in company bonds. Jonathan Moore, an analyst at Evolution Securities, said the high debt was still a concern for investors.“[The buy-back] was the surprise …That saved [the Glazers] something like £2m in annual interest expenses. The payment-in-kind loans remain a mystery but people are now more relaxed.”Interest paid on loans rose from £18.8m to £23.6m in the six-month period.In November the Glazers paid down £220m of punitive high-interest payment-in-kind loans taken out in 2006, a year after they bought the club in a leveraged £790m deal. The club has remained silent on how they were repaid.This year the Glazers transferred the parent company shareholding to a new company registered in Delaware, which requires disclosure of a bare minimum of corporate information. The club said it had £134.5m in cash on its books, part of which is expected to be used in the transfer market after the retirements of defender Gary Neville and goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar.“[The cash] gives us flexibility. It could include transfers or investments in facilities,” said the club.
128;AON;AON Plc;2011-02-13T10:02:37Z;Pensions plan to de-risk funds;;UK pension funds plan to reduce risk-taking on assets and liabilities in the next decade.Nearly three-quarters of defined benefit pension schemes aim to de-risk their funds, according to a survey of 200 schemes, carried out by Aon Hewitt. Bigger schemes plan to do this by becoming self-sufficient without relying on sponsors for payment of benefits, while smaller ones want to buy out the benefits from an insurance company.“Nobody wants pension risk any more. Trustees and sponsors do not want pension funds to turn around and bite them, they want out,” said Kevin Wesbroom, at Aon Hewitt’s global risk services.On the asset side, funds plan to move away from equities, especially UK companies, favouring property, hedge funds, commodities, currency and infrastructure. They will increase their exposure to bonds and use other liability-driven investment strategies.However, in spite of intentions to de-risk, trustees need to reduce deficits. Although aggregate deficits among FTSE 350 companies fell over 2010 from £80bn ($128bn) at the start of the year to £40bn at year end, further reduction is needed.“Balancing risk and reward has never been easy. Pension funds face the dilemma of having to continue to run risk in the short term in order to get risk off the table in the long term,” said Mr Wesbroom.The research shows 43 per cent of pension schemes realise they will have to extend their time-scale to reduce deficits. In the past few years this has increased from five years to eight years and this year is expected to rise to 13 years.There has also been a steady rise in the number of plans closed to both new and existing members, from 12 per cent in 2008 to 29 per cent last year while over half of respondents expect to close schemes to existing members this year.
129;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Pensions favour emerging debt over developed;;Emerging market debt remains an attractive investment opportunity for pension funds in comparison with developed market debt, according to most investment consultants.Seven of nine consultants offered this assessment in a survey by Pensions Week when asked: “Is it a good time to buy EM debt or do you feel it has been over-hyped?”Respondents, including Towers Watson, Mercer, JLT, and Aon Hewitt agree that the best gains on EM debt have already been won. But most say the strong fundamentals of the asset class mean lower returns on developed world debt are not worth the associated risk.Consultants say the weakening of US and European government covenants is in marked contrast to the lower indebtedness, appreciating currencies, expanding economies and improved ratings of emerging market governments.A linked survey of 13 leading fund managers found the expected rate of return for EM debt to be around 8 per cent for 2011, while long-term returns on developed world debt are expected to be 4.5-5.5 per cent.David Clare, head of manager research at JLT, says: “A country with a positive trade surplus, high levels of natural resources and favourable demographics should be better placed to service this debt than the heavily indebted OECD economies, although the yield differential implies otherwise.”In total, eight out of 13 leading EM debt fund managers say they expect 7-9 per cent returns across the asset class this year.The most bullish predict returns of 13-15 per cent, while no asset manager saw returns falling lower than the 4-6 per cent range.Russia is the biggest country allocation in four of the funds surveyed, while three others favour South Africa and Mexico, and two more go for Brazil.This concentration reflects the balance of the market. In the new set of benchmark and tradeable indices for dollar-denominated EM debt – created by financial information company Markit – Brazil, Mexico and Russia are three of the four highest weight-ings, alongside Turkey.Damien Buchet, head of emerging market fixed income at Axa Investment Managers, says: “We have a large weighting in Russia 2030 bonds, which tend to be a highly liquid proxy for the overall market.”He says Argentina and Venezuela are his fund’s biggest active bets against the benchmark. These were chosen for their high yield, but also for their lower correlation to global markets and US interest rates.
130;AON;AON Plc;2011-01-18T22:16:22Z;Political risk for trade and investment mapped;;Sub-Saharan Africa is becoming a safer place for investment and trade as political risk around the world falls in spite of the economic turmoil unleashed by the financial crisis, according to an insurance industry analysis.Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia counted for five of 11 countries where the risks associated with doing business have fallen this year, according to the annual study by Aon, one of the world’s biggest insurance brokers, and Oxford Analytica, an academic consultancy.FT.com is publishing an interactive version of the annual political risk map in partnership with Aon for the first time.The map shows how the overall risk of investment loss and non-payment of bills or debts due to political or civil disruption in individual countries has changed over the past seven years.It also highlights how each country fares for particular risks such as sovereign default, exchange transfer – or getting payments out of a country – war, civil unrest, legal risk and political interference.While the environment for international commerce has improved in Georgia, Uzbekistan, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, it has got worse in 19 other countries, more than in any other year.However, Matthew Shires, head of political risk at Aon, said that 13 of these countries were small Caribbean islands. “These are smaller, often one-focus economies that have suffered from a fall-off in tourism as a direct result of the financial crisis,” Mr Shires said. The resulting reduction in national income could spur local political difficulties and increase risks for international investors or companies that trade there.Overall, however, the world continues to become a safer and more stable place, according to Sam Wilkin, the associate director at Oxford Analytica.“The main trend we see is continued globalisation with more countries participating in international commerce and moving towards the middle [of the risk range],” he said. “Globalisation is reversible, we have seen that happen in history, but nowadays it is more flexible and robust than it was in the past.”The number of countries in the middle of the risk rankings was 15 per cent higher this year than last year, Mr Shires said. This reflected the fact that these countries had become more integrated in the world economy and had become more prosperous.
131;AON;AON Plc;2011-01-16T17:12:58Z;Andy Cox: ambition to be the best, most innovative consultant;;"Hewitt last year overtook Towers Watson to become the world’s second biggest investment consultant by tying up with Aon, the US insurance broker, and
EnnisKnupp, a US consultant. The deals were driven as much by client demand as by business logic, according to Andy Cox, who heads Aon Hewitt’s UK and Ireland operations.“Clients are demanding cost-effectiveness,” he says. They do not typically buy the cheapest, but they do want cost efficiency. Bigger organisations can meet that demand by realising economies of scale and by running various parts of the business in cheaper locations. For example, much of the administration work is done in India or Poland, while many actuarial valuations are carried out in India or Hungary.The combined businesses also bring together services that will be increasingly important in providing solutions, particularly for pension fund clients. The group wants to be the biggest and best in its core markets: risk services, reinsurance, and benefits consulting.“The knowledge that we bring on the investment and liability side and the knowledge Aon brings on insurance in the defined benefit world is a basis for real innovation.” For example, he says, a lot of organisations are starting to look at the potential of running DB pension plans through captive insurance arrangements.Possible advantages include a different regulatory regime and the ability of a company to pool pension assets and liabilities. In addition, says Mr Cox, “it is a form of self insurance for the corporate”.Asked who would be looking out for members’ interests in this scenario, Mr Cox says the regulations governing captive insurance companies would require “different levels of security and funding”. The idea may not fly, he says, but if it does “it would be on the basis of trustees deciding that the way the captive is being run is in members’ interests”.He is not aware of any captive arrangements set up for DB pensions so far, but says discussions with a couple of clients are “reasonably advanced”.Looking more broadly at workplace pension provision, Mr Cox suggests the future may bring a much more flexible approach. DB provision is increasingly giving way to defined contribution schemes, but the latter may prove “a stepping stone to something else, because it is not clear that pensions will make sense for a lot of people”.Flexible benefit arrangements offering a range of savings options are the way forward, he maintains. This is not just a way for companies to avoid paying pension contributions: “It’s about managing your [the employee’s] finances. The question of whether the employer is avoiding anything really gets down to what it is prepared to put in and make available to spend on the flexible benefits arrangement.”Speaking as someone who runs a business with its own pension arrangements, “I don’t regard it as looking to move away from providing benefits so much as wanting to provide something that is attractive to people in a way that recognises they all have different personal circumstances”.It may be more appropriate for someone to invest in a savings vehicle that gives access to the cash whenever required than in a pension plan, says Mr Cox. Asked who will advise employees on such decisions, he says this is a question employers must consider. They are wary of giving advice, but there is value in providing reliable information.People need to think more holistically about their lifetime savings needs, he says. Some employers have put corporate Isas (individual savings accounts) in place as an option; others provide more flexibility, allowing people to have extra cash rather than an employer contribution to a pension.UK employers will in future be obliged to automatically enrol employees into a pension plan, but they will still be able to provide flexible benefits, says Mr Cox. They will have to consider whether they want to require people to have a minimum in the pension arrangement, outside of the auto enrolment environment, or whether they are “prepared to let them flex away all of their pension savings and just take cash”.There is a philosophical debate to be had “as to does the employer regard it as its own responsibility to force people to look after themselves”, he adds.Looking at the broader context, Mr Cox says there are barriers to holistic planning because products are treated differently for tax purposes.It is pointless having money tied up in a pension plan if you are about to lose your house because you cannot afford the mortgage payments, he maintains. “A part of me says a brave government would sweep that aside and say what are we actually trying to achieve?”The problem is, “you’ve got to balance [what is really needed] with the political motivations and tax requirements”, he says.Turning to the business of looking after DB pension clients, Mr Cox is keen to address the terminology applied to the various levels of service on offer. There are four distinct options: traditional consulting, where the consultant presents options and the client makes the decisions; directive, where the consultant will “get off the fence and tell you what we would do”; implemented, where the consultant has a strong view and “it would be very rare” if the client did not follow the advice, but retains right of veto; and delegated, “where we make the decision for you and tell you afterwards”.These distinctions are important, says Mr Cox, “because a number of people would say they are in the delegated end when actually they are in implemented or directive”. Judging by the money that has flowed into such arrangements in the past year, there is a substantial appetite to move at least some way along the spectrum, he adds.Aon Hewitt has 25-30 clients with a delegated arrangement, but well over 100 with something stronger than a traditional one.This is a cultural shift, he says, in recognition of the much greater sophistication of pension funds compared with just five years ago. That change is due to the financial innovations of the past few years, and because “pension schemes have become more risky”, due to changes in the regulatory environment and accounting approach.Mr Cox looks forward to the opportunities the changing world of defined benefit pensions will bring to sell the combined skills of Aon and Hewitt."
132;AON;AON Plc;2010-12-10T21:22:18Z;Barcelona agrees €170m sponsorship contract;;League-topping Barcelona Football Club has agreed a €170m ($225m) sponsorship contract with the Qatari government in a lucrative deal aimed at cutting its debt, while also cementing the relationship between Spanish football and the Gulf state.The club is to sign a five-year contract with the not-for-profit Qatar Foundation on Monday, which will pay it an annual €30m to have its logo on the club strip.It is the biggest shirt sponsorship deal in football, beating the €24m-a-year deals struck by Manchester United with insurance company Aon and Liverpool with Standard Chartered Bank.An initial €15m would allow the Qatar investment group to use the century-old Barcelona logo between now and the beginning of next season.The deal marks a departure from the Catalan club’s current sponsorship arrangement, under which it donates €1.5m a year to Unicef to carry its logo.Although seemingly unbeatable at the moment – Barcelona gave arch-rivals Real Madrid a 5-0 drubbing two weeks ago – the club’s finances are in poor shape after years of alleged profligacy and ill-fated player and property deals.The 2009 Champions League winner closed last season in the red and is saddled with net debt of about €400m.Sandro Rosell, club president, has vowed to double cash flow and retire about €30m in debt by the end of the season, without selling players.Javier Faus, the finance director, said on Friday that the Qatari sponsorship would provide a much-needed boost to cash flow. Although it will have to make space for the Qatar Foundation logo, Unicef’s insignia would remain on team shirts, he said.The deal is further proof of Qatar’s growing influence on the game, following Fifa’s decision to award the Gulf state the 2022 World Cup, and its connections with the game in Spain.Pep Guardiola, Barcelona’s coach, was an ambassador for Qatar’s 2022 bid, and Mr Rosell was in Doha in November to also lend his backing.But there have been suspicions in football circles about the relationship between Spain and Qatar.In the weeks leading up to its decision on host nations for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, Fifa was obliged to investigate claims that members of its executive committee championing two bidders were in collusion over votes.There was speculation that the bidders were Qatar and the joint Spain-Portugal bid for 2018. Fifa found that there was insufficient evidence to pursue the matter. Qatar went on to win the 2022 race, but Spain-Portugal lost out to Russia for 2018.

In addition, 37 per cent said they would sacrifice pay for more protection if they became ill, while 37 per cent would also take a pay cut in exchange for the right to take three to six months of unpaid or partly paid leave.“The increase of the state retirement age in the UK to 66 for both men and women by 2020, and the financial crisis impacting many pension funds, has focused people’s minds on their own long-term financial security,” said John Puddephatt, principal at Aon Hewitt.
134;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Nest starts hunt for investment managers;;A new national pension scheme given the go-ahead last week by the UK government is expected to begin its search for investment managers this week.The scheme, known as Nest, the National Employee Savings Trust, will come into operation in 2012 when employees will begin to be auto enrolled into workplace pension schemes.It is understood the scheme will be seeking managers for five mandates that will serve as the building blocks for the default fund, taking advice from Aon Hewitt. Three – global equity, gilt, and index-linked gilt – will be passive mandates. The others are cash and diversified growth.It is likely to look for diversified growth funds that allocate between asset classes strategically, where managers make changes to control risk rather than to add value from a tactical standpoint.Initially, Nest will use pooled funds, but this is not expected to limit its manager choice to UK-based groups.Nest will also be searching for a global equity ethical fund manager, with advice from Mercer.Mark Fawcett, chief investment officer at Nest, has said in the past that using passive managers helps minimise costs and align interests, as passive managers need to keep costs down to achieve a low tracking error.
135;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
136;AON;AON Plc;2010-10-19T06:01:33Z;Deal to develop Walkie Talkie skyscraper;;Land Securities and Canary Wharf Group have confirmed a £500m ($795m) joint venture backed by sovereign wealth from China and Qatar that will see the development of London’s next large skyscraper, the Walkie Talkie.Canary Wharf, the owner of the Docklands estate, on Monday night finalised a deal to buy a half stake and help build the 690,000 sq ft tower development for a total of £250m.The developer will syndicate 35 per cent of its stake in the development to China Investment Corporation (CIC), Qatar Holdings and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing’s special situations fund, three of the main shareholders of Songbird, its parent company. Land Securities will own half and Canary Wharf will hold the remainder.The group confirm that it intends to begin development of the scheme early in the new year to meet demand for new office space in the City.The existing cleared site with some neighbouring holdings has been sold by Land Securities to a newly structured partnership for £90.2m, in line with the March 2010 valuation. Development is expected to take overall costs to about £500m.The 150m-high skyscraper at 20 Fenchurch Street is known as the Walkie Talkie owing to its concave shape, designed by architect Rafael Vinoly.Although there is set to be a shortage of quality office space by the time the tower is finished in 2014, because of a wave of lease expiries, any such large development work without a guaranteed occupier at the start comes with risk. For Land Securities, the deal removes some of the risk.Robert Noel, managing director of Land Securities’ London portfolio, said: “The joint venture brings together two substantial companies with complementary skills in the conception and delivery of large schemes in London.“The transaction allows us to take forward other projects within our substantial development pipeline in London so that we offer a range of building types and sizes in a range of locations across the capital.”It also links with Canary Wharf’s stated intention to diversify its holdings outside the east London estate, while CIC and Qatar are said to want to increase their exposure to a City of London office market enjoying a recovery. Rents in the Square Mile are already rising strongly owing to a lack of new office space.Going ahead with the tower will give the group a competitive advantage over rival skyscrapers, most obviously the Cheesegrater, on nearby Leadenhall Street, planned by British Land.British Land has also been looking for a partner, with a Canadian pension fund among parties to have held talks with the developer.The two towers are seen as rivals to secure Aon, the insurer, as a prelet tenant. It is thought that Aon, which could occupy up to 200,000 sq ft of office space, could favour the first of the pair to start building.Other corporate occupiers that have been looking for office space include Schroders and Bloomberg, with both linked to Legal & General’s redevelopment of Bucklersbury House next to Bank station.

Total net finance charges disclosed on Friday were £64.7m.The club’s cash position is £163.8m, up from £150.5m at the start of the financial year. Gross debt has risen from £514.5m to £521.7m. There was no mention in the accounts of any money taken out of the club by the Glazer family to pay down £220m worth of payment-in-kind notes, which are being serviced at 16.25 per cent a year.The Glazer family, in their sixth year of ownership, are driving commercial revenues, which now make up 28.4 per cent of income.New commercial deals, including shirt sponsor Aon and an uplift in media receipts, helped swell revenues in the year to June 30 by 2.9 per cent to £286.4m.The club made a pre-tax profit of £48.2m the previous year on the back of the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80m, which also accounts for United’s healthy cash position.Match day revenues were down 7.9 per cent to £108.8m and now represent 35 per cent of turnover.Staff costs rose 7 per cent to £131.7m, due to player wage demands and the hiring of new sales staff. Wages are 46 per cent of turnover, slightly higher than the previous season but still at a ratio that compares favourably with other Premier League clubs.
138;AON;AON Plc;2010-09-24T18:31:16Z;Serious Money: How to sell pension reform... make it cheap;Fixing Britain’s pensions system needn’t cost much;"Okay, so here’s the deal. You can’t pay in more than £2,500 of monthly earnings, you can’t transfer money in from elsewhere, you can’t withdraw a penny for at least 25 years and I’m afraid we can’t tell you how much you’ll get in the end. On average, the money will grow by a little over 4 per cent a year, but frequently it will fall, and charges can reduce the total value by up to 40 per cent. Oh, and you’ll have to live off it for 30 years. Just sign here . . .Trying to sell pensions in their current form would challenge the most silver-tongued of financial advisers. So you would think that selling radical pension reform would be easy for politicians. After a summer of enlightened government consultation documents, I thought so too, but now I’m not so sure. At last week’s Liberal Democrat party conference, pensions minister Steve Webb offered the prospect of a higher state pension that would stop means-tested retirement benefits acting as a disincentive to save, and said he was “all in favour” of letting savers withdraw sums from pension schemes before retirement. So where do we sign? Nowhere yet, admitted the minister, because the reforms now depend on the upcoming spending review.But if ever money were to be well spent, it would be on fixing Britain’s pensions crisis. So at fringe events at the next two party conferences, I’m going to try to sell the following low-cost/no-cost reforms.● Make saving worth more than spending. This week, Skandia warned that current proposals to limit pension contributions with tax relief to between £30,000 and £45,000 a year – while maintaining a separate lifetime limit – will be “a barrier to saving”. It pointed out that, usually, savers can only make significant pension contributions in later life when they have more excess income. But if they then can’t pay in enough to make up shortfalls in earlier years, they won’t bother. Allowing people to carry forward unused annual allowances could solve this problem – at little extra cost.● Make the outcome more certain. Last week’s figures from Aon Consulting showed the fluctuating value of defined-contribution pensions: in August, the “typical” 30-year old’s pension fund fell by £544. Aon warned: “Projected pensions for 30- year-olds continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing volatile equity markets.” Even over the long term, performance has been less than inspiring. Insurer MetLife published data this week showing that investors in stakeholder pensions have seen annualised growth of just 4.38 per cent since the low-cost schemes launched in April 2001 – and got negative returns in four of those nine years. It suggests offering guarantees on capital and income. This can be done. New, transparent, liquid structured products already offer double digit annual returns with capital protection provided by government-backed counterparty banks. It’s like using gilts, but with downside protection – at no extra cost to government.● Make it flexible. Fidelity this week urged more “creative thinking” to get money into pensions. It suggests permitting transfers in from tax-efficient individual savings accounts. But the flexibility should go the other way, too – and Webb seems to agree. A paper by the Society of Pension Consultants a few months ago proposed giving “limited access” to pension money already paid in, while still working – as an alternative to the tax-free cash available at retirement. This doesn’t increase the tax break – it just moves it to a more convenient time in people’s lives: when moving house or paying education fees.● Make it cheap. Research to be published in the October issue of the FT’s Money Management magazine will reveal that “charges on the most expensive personal pensions can lop off up to 40 per cent of the projected pension fund” after 25 years. Research in October’s Money Observer magazine, by Lipper, identifies an even worse “lost decade” for private investors, in which the total return from the average equity fund after expenses was only 31 per cent – because nearly half the gains were swallowed up by hidden charges. Legislation to cap fees would be too simplistic and restrictive – but legislation to force pension providers to show the impact of their charges on page one of all letters and brochures, in 24-point bold type, would ensure investors get a better deal.● Make it easy. Earlier this year, Aegon suggested harnessing the techniques of behavioural finance to give all savers a “nudge” in the right direction: allowing very small pension contributions at first, with automatic increases after pay rises; allowing employer contributions to help clear debts first, then start a pension; rounding down pay and diverting “the change” to savings.If more can be paid now, it will mean less tax in future. This week, a survey by MGM Advantage found that one in four people aged 60-plus “feels at least 20 years younger”. At his conference, Steve Webb noted that one in every three daughters born today will live to be 100. That’s a lot of future to pay for.matthew.vincent@ft.com"

140;AON;AON Plc;2010-09-20T01:43:14Z;Eurohypo takes over City office project;;Eurohypo, the German real estate bank, has taken control of an office development site in the City in the latest sign of a workout of the mountain of distressed debt in the UK commercial property market.The bank is in talks to agree a joint venture to build an office tower on the site that would be part-funded by the institutional property funds of Axa, the French insurer. The development of the scheme would be overseen by Core, the development manager.Eurohypo took control of the site at 6 Bevis Marks, EC3, from Monteverde, a Spanish developer. It is one of a number of such deals being lined up by banks that are reluctant to crystallise loan losses by conducting an outright sale. Such joint ventures mean that the bank retains an interest in a scheme’s future profit.Eurohypo has already created a similar profit-sharing structure with Great Portland Estates to complete the development of Marcol House in the West End and share the proceeds, while Hammerson is helping Lloyds Banking Group on a series of developments.There are plans for a Fletcher Priest-designed office and retail building of 170,000 sq ft on the site.The partners hope to start on the site as soon as possible in order to meet the expected rise in demand for new office space over the next few years as the market recovers from a dearth of new development undertaken during the recession.The scheme is thought to have been shortlisted by Aon, the insurer, as a potential new headquarters, alongside Land Securities’ Walkie-Talkie tower at 20 Fenchurch Street and British Land’s Cheesegrater building on Leadenhall Street.There are a number of other more straightforward sales coming to the market this autumn as the large lending banks step up efforts to dispose of problem loans and distressed property assets, including the sale of a £50m ($78m) portfolio of West End properties backed by Lloyds that is expected to be launched next week.
141;AON;AON Plc;2010-08-22T15:40:38Z;Football season kicks off battle for revenue;;The UK football season has begun and in the hotbed of the north-west there have already been shocks on and off the pitch. Blackpool, newly promoted to the Premiership after almost 40 years outside the top flight, beat Wigan Athletic 4-0 in their first fixture – although on Saturday they came back down to earth, thumped 6-0 at Arsenal.Blackburn Rovers, up for sale for three years, appears to have found an Indian buyer from Bahrain prepared to invest £100m in the club and wipe out its £20m debt.Contrast that with Liverpool, the most successful English club in history, which has spent several months on the block. The club has attracted several bids but says no decision is imminent as it sorts the “wheat from the chaff”.One of the bidders, a Chinese sports entrepreneur, pulled out on Friday.Meanwhile Manchester City keeps spending, racking up almost half of the transfer fees paid by premiership clubs during the August transfer window. Sheikh Mansour, ruler of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, has spent about £1bn on players, wages and improving the stadium and playing facilities since buying the club two years ago.However, overhauling rivals Manchester United will require him to delve deeper into his pockets. City’s turnover in his first year of ownership, the 12 months to May 31 2009, was £87m, up from £82.3m the year before. The operating loss ballooned from £1.6m to £34m and the net loss after financing charges was £92.6m.United, though saddled with £717m debt, some at interest rates of 16.25 per cent, makes a profit and turns over about £300m a season.It does have season tickets available for the first time in years – though it has sold 52,000 of its 54,000 target. It has a 76,000 capacity stadium to fill.Phil Townsend, club spokesman, admitted: “The waiting list has not been as fruitful as it might have been.” He said many of those approached only wanted the cheaper seats or could not commit the £680-plus for a season ticket in tough economic times.However, annual sponsorship revenues have grown from £45m to £70m in the past five years, with US insurer Aon’s £20m-a-year deal a new record.“We believe that if you put a successful and attractive team on the pitch people will come to watch,” he said. The unpopular Glazer family have no intention of selling in spite of approaches from the Red Knights, a group of businessmen led by Jim O’Neill, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and a fan.Liverpool also claims that unpopular owners – Tom Hicks and George Gillett – and recessionary effects have not deterred fans.In spite of fan protests it has matched its 24,000 season ticket sales of the year before and benefits from a large national and global fan base, with at least of third of the crowd travelling more than 50 miles for games.“The fact is there are only two English clubs that have pulling power around the globe: Liverpool and Man Utd,” said a club spokesman. Ian Ayre, commercial director, said that over the past three years it had brought its marketing operations in-house to increase margins. It sold 35,000 of its new shirts on their first day of release.Of the north-west’s other Premier League clubs, Everton are looking to push into the top four, while the others – Wigan, Blackpool, Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers – are simply looking to stay up and retain the £40m-plus annual income from TV rights.The region is also home to Preston North End and Burnley, in the second-tier Championship, and a host of minnows such as Accrington Stanley, Rochdale, Bury, Oldham, Stockport, Tranmere Rovers, Crewe Alexandra, Carlisle United, Altrincham, Morecambe and Macclesfield. Some 21 of the 92 professional clubs are squeezed into a region of 7m people.Smaller clubs have struggled most. Last season saw Chester City and Stockport County enter administration. Preston has £29.9m debts and was on the brink of insolvency before a takeover by Trevor Hemmings, the leisure entrepreneur.At Blackpool, the Oyston family are also examples of rich benefactors supporting the local club. Karl Oyston, son of owners Owen and Vicki, who have media and property businesses, stepped down as chairman last week without explanation, though he will continue as chief executive, his priority to make the books balance.New owners are likely to hail from further afield. Blackburn has entered a memorandum of understanding with Aysan Ali Syed, chief executive of Bahrain-based Western Gulf Advisory, an investment fund. He admits he has never been to the town and likens his purchase to that of a Ferrari.It is an expensive one: player wages remain the cost driver for every club. Deloitte’s annual football review found that 80 per cent of revenue growth between 2006-08 went on wages, with Premier League operating margins reduced to 4 per cent in 2008-09.In the Championship, wages on average take up 90 per cent of revenue, compared with 67 per cent in the Premier League.A recent survey of club finance directors by PKF, the accountants, found rose-tinted spectacles in place. Half of Premier League respondents rated their finances as healthy, against none in 2009. About a quarter of all clubs nationwide expected revenue increases.However, banks are lending less and Revenue & Customs is chasing up bills: almost a quarter of clubs routinely pay tax late to help cash flow.

Even those who plan to move to cheaper countries in their retirement, such as Spain, would struggle to achieve a decent standard of living.“Though was have seen some improvement to economic circumstances in the past six months, pension pots are in only marginally better shape than this time last year and due to the volatility in stock market activity, pension pots shrank once again during the last month,” said Richard Strachan, senior consultant at Aon Consulting.“Employers should ensure their pension schemes, and their default funds, in particular, are invested wisely to maximise the green shoots of recovery.”
143;AON;AON Plc;2010-08-08T22:04:50Z;Somali crackdown threatens City ransom role;;International plans for a legal crackdown on the funding of piracy could scupper a burgeoning City industry.The United Nations plans for sanctions on two suspected pirates would hit the often lucrative work of the law firms, insurers and private security companies in London that quietly arrange ransoms to free kidnapped ships and crews.They would also raise “a question mark” over the fate of all those being held by pirates, according to Neil Roberts, senior technical executive of the Lloyd’s Market Association, which provides support to insurance underwriters.The government has decided to block the UN plans amid worries they could force shipowners and their advisers to stop paying ransoms or else risk prosecution.London’s piracy negotiation business brings together an unusual cast of characters, from hard-bitten security operatives to dapper lawyers making telephone calls to hijacked ships from offices close to the banks of the Thames.NYA International, a kidnap response specialist based off Bishopsgate and now part of Aon, the US insurance broker, has advised on more than 20 piracy incidents during the past 18 months or so.The leading ship hijack case law firm in terms of numbers of clients is said to be Holman Fenwick Willan, which has offices north-west of the Tower of London.James Gosling, partner at HFW, said: “Nobody wants to pay ransoms. But when it’s the only option, what the hell else do you do?”The lawyers and other intermediaries are the main reason London has such a big role in a piracy crisis that is global in its reach, although it has so far affected relatively few British nationals and ships.Two UK-flagged vessels – the Asian Glory and the St James Park – were released this year, while pirates are still holding the British couple Paul and Rachel Chandler after kidnapping them from their yacht near the Seychelles in October.A big problem for those in favour of continuing to use ransoms is that – as some admit – the often multi-million dollar payments are widely seen as encouraging further piracy and possibly also activity by Somali Islamist militant groups.While the number of ship hijackings in the Gulf of Aden has fallen since nations began to deploy their navies there, there have been more attacks in the Red Sea and far offshore.Some analysts see this as a new pirate strategy, with others viewing it as evidence of desperation.The concern about sanctions is that, while they do not explicitly outlaw the payment of ransoms, they make it impossible in practice because of the uncertainty about where money given to pirates will end up.“The problem is the due diligence,” Mr Roberts said. “How can you possibly know if the money is going to that [sanctioned] person or not?”Maritime lawyers in London say they were encouraged by a High Court ruling this year that paying ransoms wasn’t contrary to British public policy, although they admit the argument over the subject is increasingly becoming political rather than legal.That is why the capital’s community of piracy-related businesses is appealing to the government to hold firm in stopping the UN proposal and the sanctions it would introduce.As one London-based insurer, who asked not to be named, put it: “We would be very concerned if shipowners were denied a means to free pirated ships.“There are no navies prepared to go all guns blazing to rescue people – and it wouldn’t work, either.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was slightly lower, closing at 10,465.94, but up 0.4 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,254.70, but lower by 0.4 per cent for the five days. The S&P gained 6.9 per cent in July, its best monthly gain in a year.The market dropped 2.3 per cent at the open after GDP data was released but later trimmed losses.US economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2.4 per cent, coming in just below consensus forecasts of about 2.5 per cent. A larger trade deficit and slower growth in consumer spending meant that the economy expanded less than in the first quarter. The first-quarter figure was revised up to 3.7 per cent from 2.7 per cent.“The picture is of an economy that continues to shuffle along rather than sprint, which is probably not surprising after the leading economic indicators that we’ve seen out since May,” said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer for JPMorgan’s private wealth management business.But both the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index and the Chicago PMI gauge of business activity were slightly better than expected, going some way to soothing investors’ worries.The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector led the late day rally, up 0.7 per cent, on news that consumers were feeling less negative than predicted.In earnings news, Chevron reported a threefold rise in quarterly profit as increased output, higher energy prices and wider margins at its refineries helped it top analysts’ profit forecasts. Shares rose 0.3 per cent to $74.89.Insurers Metlife and Aon both rose after reporting better-than-expected second quarter results.Metlife was up 4.6 per cent to $42.06 after it moved back into the black, making second-quarter net income of $1.84 per share after a loss of $1.74 for the same period last year.Recent acquisitions helped offset a fall in commissions at Aon Corporation, the world’s largest insurance brokerage. Earnings per share were 63 cents compared with 50 cents for the same period last year. The shares rose 2.8 per cent to $37.67.But Genworth Financial, the mortgage guarantor and life insurer, slumped 14 per cent to $13.58 after posting a weak second-quarter profit and issuing a cautious outlook.There was positive news from several pharmaceuticals. Merck & Co reported better-than-expected earnings on the back of strong sales of its treatments for diabetes, arthritis and HIV. But the shares fell 1.7 per cent to $34.46 because revenue missed estimates.Drugmaker Warner Chilcott rose 5 per cent to $25.60 after the company raised its full-year outlook.Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, rose 2.2 per cent to $54.53 after reporting a better-than-expected second quarter profit.

British workers pull some 35m “sickies” per year, with one in five UK workers admitting that the last time they took a day off from work they were feigning an illness.The survey, which polled more than 7,500 European workers, reveals that the UK accounts for over a quarter of the 122m ‘sickies’ pulled across Europe in the last year.It turns out that Brits are more than four-times as likely to fake an illness to get time off compared to the Danes, who are alleged to be the most honest workers in Europe. Just four per cent of Danes took their last sick day for a fabricated illness compared to 21 per cent of Brits.Peter Abelskamp, director of health and benefits for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Aon Consulting said: “Over thirty-five million days taken as fictitious sick leave is costing the UK economy millions and these are probably conservative figures, considering the number of people who don’t admit to faking sickness. Employers would be well advised to tackle the issues of sickness and workplace absence head on, as these seriously impact efficiency and hit their balance sheets.”Workers from the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the UK participated in the study.Incentives that might encourage Brits to improve their office attendance range from flexible-working provisions and additional cash to interesting work, according to Aon’s research.

We’re probably going to have a pretty decent earnings season, but earnings are going to be driven by cost reductions, rather than top-line growth.”Until there is an improvement in the labour market, corporate revenues will struggle to grow, he added.At the close on Monday, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,078.75.

147;AON;AON Plc;2010-07-12T20:04:26Z;Aon / Hewitt;Hewitt shareholders should take the money and run;“Synergies” are all too often treated like corporate fairy dust that can transform an underperforming business into a world-beater. The word was used liberally by the management of insurance broker and consultant Aon in justifying the 40 per cent premium it is paying to acquire human resources specialist Hewitt Associates in a deal with an equity value of $4.9bn. While Aon’s three main competitors – Marsh & McLennan, Willis Group and Arthur J Gallagher – have generated average total returns for shareholders of 30 per cent over the past year, Aon’s modest gain over the same period was erased on Monday morning after announcing the Hewitt deal. Analysts questioning lofty operating margin goals and cross-selling opportunities received only nebulous answers.Luckily, there are more mundane and tangible benefits to the transaction. Much of the gains will come from redundancies, with overall “synergies” generating $355m a year by 2012. Hewitt will triple Aon’s consulting revenue to about $4.3bn, making it a far more significant player. Aon’s dependence on volatile (and lately moribund) insurance revenue will drop from about four-fifths to three-fifths.Which highlights another bit of corporate-speak – “diversification”. Normally a weak excuse for bolt-on acquisitions, it probably makes sense in Aon’s case. Once debt from the deal is paid down, Aon should be more financially stable than pure insurance brokers, which are alternately exposed to natural disasters or soft markets. Even if Aon shareholders feel that actual synergies will be less than promised and that management’s projection of the deal’s net present value of $1.5bn is too optimistic, they have little reason to sell into the current weakness. Hewitt shareholders should take the money and run.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
148;AON;AON Plc;2010-07-12T19:47:29Z;Aon to buy Hewitt in $4.9bn deal;;"Aon, the US insurance broker, on Monday said it would acquire Hewitt Associates, ­bolstering its human resources consulting arm in a cash and stock deal worth $4.9bn, excluding debt.Aon makes most of its revenues in insurance brokerage and combining its HR consulting business with Hewitt’s will create the world’s largest HR
services provider with $4.3bn in revenues, overtaking Mercer.“As we continue to grow our business, this merger will give us a broader portfolio of innovative products and services focused on what we believe are two of the most important topics in the global economy today – risk and people,” said Greg Case, Aon chief executive.Shares in Aon fell 7 per cent to $35.67 after the deal’s announcement, which valued Hewitt at $50 a share, based on Aon’s close last week – a 41 per cent premium to Hewitt’s stock price on Friday. Hewitt investors will receive $25.61 in cash and 0.6362 Aon common stock shares for each Hewitt share they own.Shares in Hewitt, which has a small net cash position, surged by more than 32 per cent to $46.79 by the close in New York.Aon is paying 7.5 times Hewitt’s 2010 forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, in line, or slightly ahead, of where recent
professional services deals have been struck.Shareholders’ unease reflected the amount of Aon stock being used as payment, rather than the price, argued people close to the deal, adding that Aon had been focused on preserving its balance sheet strength and rating as part of the transaction.The market for providing advice to companies on their HR needs has consolidated in recent years. Towers Perrin last year agreed to merge with Watson Wyatt in a $3.5bn deal, while Xerox, through its Affiliated Computer Services unit, in May agreed to buy an employee ­benefits company from Hewlett-Packard.Russ Fradin, Hewitt’s chief executive, who will lead Aon Hewitt, said in a call with analysts that Hewitt had not been seeking a buyer. Mr Case approached his counterpart with a preliminary offer in early June, according to people familiar with the deal.The companies said the deal would generate $355m in annual cost savings by 2013 from reduced back-office operations, public company costs and management duties.Aon’s acquisition of Hewitt marks its second big expansion in the past two years. In 2008, Aon acquired Benfield, a UK reinsurance company that specialised in quantitative risk modelling, for £844m.Credit Suisse advised Aon on the deal, while Citigroup advised Hewitt. The companies expect the deal to close by mid-November."
149;AON;AON Plc;2010-07-04T22:31:35Z;England seek a substitute sponsor;;Marketing departments will have to weigh the benefits of being associated with the England football team now that Nationwide is set to end its sponsorship deal after 11 years.The country’s largest building society is unlikely to renew its £20m, four-year contract with the Football Association after the two parties were unable to agree a price.Nationwide said its decision had been taken before the World Cup started but its expected withdrawal will leave the national team looking for a new sponsor before the qualification rounds for Euro 2012 begin in September.The exclusive deal is regarded as one of the more high profile in British sport but not the most lucrative. By contrast Aon, the US insurance company, has just begun sponsorship of Manchester United that could be worth £100m over four years.While potential England sponsors would not be able to advertise on the national team shirt, they would get branding rights on all training kit, the team bus, media interview backdrop boards and ticket and broadcast sponsorship rights.However, analysts have suggested England’s poor performances and humiliating 4-1 defeat to Germany have shifted the market against the seller and in favour of the buyer.Nationwide had made a similar financial offer for the next four years before the World Cup. The FA has hired external consultants to find new backers, with reports suggesting it wanted £30m for the right to be official team sponsor, £10m more than Nationwide was prepared to offer.Sponsors always face a risk that goes with backing sports teams and individuals. Nike’s high-profile campaign for the World Cup suffered something of an own goal with its six most-marketed stars either failing to make the trip to South Africa or badly underperforming, while the French team’s implosion led to a backlash by sponsors.Other brands rumoured to be interested in sponsoring England include BlackBerry and Orange.Still it is not all doom and gloom for the FA. McDonald’s will sponsor the association until 2013, while Carlsberg and Nivea have also signed four-year deals this year.Nationwide, which has sponsored the Football League in the past, is expected to retain its deals with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football teams.
150;AON;AON Plc;2010-06-17T21:39:22Z;Solid foundations for City resurgence;;The clusters of cranes hanging over the City of London are set to multiply as developers restart office building projects to meet what some predict will be an unprecedented surge in demand for space.Many of the projects have yet to attract tenants, and this kind of speculative office development always represents a risk. The threat of offices gathering dust and taxes became all too real in the 1990s, when developers who had started building during the boom found during the crash that there were no tenants.However, developers now point to a swell of so-called “structural demand” for office space. This is driven by a wave of lease expiries and breaks that will allow corporates to leave existing offices for newer, cheaper and greener alternatives.There will be more than 20m sq ft of office lease expiries and breaks in the City before the end of 2015, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, the property agency.Neil Prime, head of markets at the agency, said this was a result of 25-year leases that had been agreed during the 1980s boom coming to an end and breaks at 15 years in agreements struck from the end of the 1990s.Rob Noel, head of Land Securities’ London business, said: “The growth is not predicated on the numbers of bums on seats going up. The buildings from the 1980s boom are not fit for purpose and there are a lot of expiries, while there is not much difference in price in moving.”He added that an environmental agenda was also pushing tenants to move into newer and greener buildings.Those with office leases that have expiries or breaks in the next six years include Deutsche Bank, CMS Cameron McKenna, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Schroders, Société Générale, Aon, Santander, Thomson Reuters, RSA Insurance, Bloomberg and PwC. UBS is already involved in talks to be rehoused in Broadgate.Another source of demand is the Asian banks, particularly those from China, which are expanding rapidly, said James Beckham, head of London investment at King Sturge, the property agency.The optimism is such that the Qatari-backed developer behind the Shard this week took the unusual step of buying out a major lease agreement with Transport for London in the hope that the space will be relet at a better rate.However, a lease expiry does not mean that an occupier will leave. James Crawford, head of City investment at Savills, said there can be inertia among tenants, given the cost and the effort of moving.Even with predictions of future occupier demand, most developers would prefer to secure at least a partial letting ahead of construction in order to reduce risk. However, the market is moving in the developers’ favour. The majority of speculative buildings from the last boom, such as Watermark Place and Ropemaker Place, have been taken by occupiers eager to agree attractive rental packages. In fact, the turning point in the rental market came last year when Nomura elected to stay in the City at Watermark.This has meant that the supply of new large offices has dropped substantially, and there are only a handful of schemes to be finished in the next two years.Gerald Ronson’s Heron will complete its tower on Bishopsgate next year. Minerva has two schemes, near Bank and Aldgate, while Hines is under way with a large development above Cannon Street station.Other developers are hoping to start work on projects soon, to be among the first of the next wave of buildings to let. Land Securities is finishing a deal with Canary Wharf to build its “Walkie-Talkie” tower at Fenchurch Street, while British Land is talking to tenants about its Leadenhall Street scheme, the “Cheesegrater”.Of course, a tenant moving out normally leaves empty buildings behind so vacancy rates might not decline. In fact, owners of the older buildings stand to lose, with those from the 1980s likely to need extensive refurbishment.But what all seem to be agreed on is that the demand for new space is genuine, at least until oversupply once again becomes a problem.
151;AON;AON Plc;2010-06-06T08:30:12Z;Pensions go cool on equities;;A resurgence in appetite for equities among pension schemes appears to be petering out as the stock market rally that started in March 2009 dissipates.A survey of global pension funds conducted by bfinance, a consultancy, in December 2009 found significantly more funds were planning to increase their allocation to equities in the next six months than were planning to reduce it.But a fresh survey has found only 9 per cent of schemes intend to up their equity allocation in the coming half-year, while 26 per cent plan to cut it.A separate survey of UK pension funds by Aon Consulting found 16 per cent of schemes had switched from bonds to equities in the past year, compared to just 3 per cent in 2008, as they sought to exploit attractive valuations.However, the big picture trend of “de-risking” by cutting exposure to equities remains in place.According to the bfinance survey, 54 per cent of global schemes intend to cut their equity allocation over the next three years, with just 17 per cent planning to raise it.David Vafai, chief executive of bfinance, said the figures were indicative of a heightened wariness of equities, rather than simply a resurgence of the long-term shift away from the asset class.“The difference from six months ago is huge, sentiment seems to have swung massively,” he said. “This seems to imply more than just a gradual shift away.”Schemes instead plan to increase their exposure to fixed income, suggesting few concerns over incipient inflation, and a range of alternative asset classes such as private equity, commodities, absolute return strategies and currencies.Most favoured of all is infrastructure, where the majority of schemes are eyeing annualised net returns of 10-15 per cent over the next three to five years.However, despite a pick up in interest in hedge funds, there is no glimmer of light for funds of hedge funds, with pension schemes likely to continue to exit this arena amid the continuing fallout from the Madoff scandal.The Aon survey also indicated increased take-up of alternative assets, with the most rapid growth posted by diversified growth funds, now used by 40 per cent of UK schemes, twice the level of a year earlier.
152;AON;AON Plc;2010-05-26T00:54:41Z;UK employers fear pensions risk;;Final salary pension schemes are now viewed by employers as one of the biggest threats to their business, as many companies struggle to meet their pension commitments in the wake of stock market falls.Finance directors across some of the UK’s largest companies said that concerns over their pension schemes were second only to market conditions in the list of risks facing their businesses, according to a survey by Aon Consulting.Fears over pension funding have shot up the ranks since Aon’s last survey in 2008, when pensions came 8th on the list of concerns.Since then, final salary schemes have become a blot on accounting sheets, moving from a £20.8bn surplus in February 2008 to a £94bn ($135bn) deficit in February this year.Stock market falls over the period are partly responsible for the deficits, but corporate bonds are posing a bigger problem. Accounting rules require final salary schemes to match their liabilities to the assumed investment return on corporate bond yields – which are now relatively low, making deficits larger.Sarah Abraham, a consultant at Aon Consulting, said some finance directors found the rules around liabilities and deficits of their final salary pension scheme too complicated to understand.“People have tended to just put their head in the sand and hope it works out alright,” she said.But others have been taking action to rid their balance sheets of final salary pension liabilities. A number of companies including Barclays, Vodafone and Fujitsu have announced plans to close their schemes in the past year.A study by Pension Capital Strategies and JPMorgan Cazenove earlier this month said the rapid pace of final salary pension scheme closures was likely to lead to the “end of the road” for the schemes.Aon’s survey of 82 mid to large employers, including finance directors at FTSE 100 companies, found more than four out of 10 employers said pensions were a “very high” or “high” risk to their business.Other concerns included the market environment, which just over half the respondents said posed a high risk to their business. Changes in legislation, along with failure to attract or retain staff, were also seen as posing a greater threat to the business than in 2008.
153;AON;AON Plc;2010-05-12T19:59:54Z;Rolls-Royce up on prospect of share buy-backs;;Share buy-back hopes helped lift Rolls-Royce on Wednesday as the London market continued its see-saw performance.The jet engine maker closed up 5.4 per cent to 611p, taking its gain since the start of the week to 11.5 per cent. The move reflected expectations that military spending budgets in the UK and US would be protected, dealers said, as well as hopes of the cash return to shareholders.“We estimate Rolls has scope to spend £2.2bn of cash before it runs the risk of a credit downgrade,” JPMorgan Cazenove said in a recent note.Analyst John Middleton forecast the engine maker to spend £500m a year on share repurchases from 2012 onwards. This would boost peak-cycle earnings from 65p per share to 76p, he said.A rally on Wall Street helped lift the wider market, with the FTSE 100 closing up 49.24 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 5,383.45. In spite of the domestic political dramas over the previous 48 hours, the index was barely changed on a two-day view.Tour operators led the blue-chip risers, with Tui Travel up 6.5 per cent to 265p as brokers including Merrill Lynch kept “buy” advice following its results on Tuesday, while Thomas Cook ran 6 per cent higher at 232p.Prudential led the financial stocks, up 4.5 per cent to 565½p, amid rumours it was nearing an agreement with the Financial Services Authority over its proposed bid for AIG’s Asian arm. The insurer was said to be aiming to publish its rights issue prospectus by Friday.Old Mutual climbed 4 per cent to 119p following reports that Standard Chartered was in the early stages of examining a potential offer for Nedbank, its South African arm. Chartered closed flat at £17.03.Other lenders weakened to profit-taking after the formation of a Con-Lib coalition government moved unilateral bank taxation up the political agenda.Royal Bank of Scotland slipped 3.2 per cent to 48½p, leading the blue-chip fallers, while Lloyds Banking Group was down 1.3 per cent to 59½p.Publisher Reed Elsevier added 4 per cent to 508½p after Dutch peer Wolters Kluwer said its US market was improving. Meanwhile, Citigroup raised its earnings forecasts for Reed and repeated “buy” advice.Tullow Oil rose 5 per cent to £11.42 and Soco International gained 8.8 per cent at £17.61 after Goldman Sachs added the stocks to its “buy” list. “Tullow’s recent underperformance has left an attractive buying opportunity in a stock with world-class assets and oil-price leverage,” said Goldman. On Soco, it said the shares “could almost double this year” if its exploration portfolio delivers.Compass Group was 5.3 per cent higher at 557½p after a trading update from the caterer showed it had returned to growth in the first half.Inmarsat rose 3.9 per cent to 789p as its results on Tuesday helped encourage theorising about a possible bid from Harbinger Capital, its biggest shareholder.In the mid-caps, ITV rose 6.9 per cent to 61½p on news it had been included in MSCI’s indices as part of its bi-annual review.Insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson gained 5.5 per cent to 585½p amid renewed speculation about a break-up bid. Aon, the Chicago-based insurer that last year bought Benfield, was once again rumoured to be interested.An upgrade to “buy” from Numis also aided JLT shares. “With the full benefits of recent investment in staff still to emerge and stronger global collaboration across the group driving further contract wins, we believe that mid-single digit organic revenue growth is sustainable without a return to more favourable trading conditions,” Numis said.Kesa Electricals gained 4.1 per cent to 119¼p after the retailer reassured on full-year targets.Tullett Prebon edged up 1.7 per cent to 362p ahead of its annual shareholder meeting and trading update due on Thursday. The interdealer broker said two months ago it was in sale talks, triggering speculation of interest from private equity and the Middle East. However, dealers played down talk that CVC might make an offer.Xcite Energy, which is looking to exploit reserves of heavy oil in the North Sea, added 18 per cent to 78½p on the back of a “strong buy” recommendation from house broker Arbuthnot Securities, write Neil Hume and Bryce Elder.“If, as expected, the Bentley field is 200m barrels in size, then Xcite will be on par with Premier Oil and Dana Petroleum [in the North Sea],” said Arbuthnot.The house broker set a new target price of 123p.It also said Bentley would benefit from a new annual tax field allowance of £160m.Emis Group, a supplier of patient record software systems to general practitioners, added a further 10.1 per cent to 377½p following a key contract win in Scotland.Emis will replace the current clinical software system used by GPs in the greater Glasgow area.ZincOx firmed 1.1 per cent to 47¾p after non-executive director Rod Beddows declared the purchase of 30,000 shares at 51.5p each.D1 Oils dipped 2.5 per cent to 5¼p after activist investor Brian Myerson called a shareholder meeting aimed at replacing the current management team.Last week, the biofuels company said two bidders were working on possible offers.Chime Communications climbed 12.7 per cent to 204p after the marketing services group said it was trading ahead of expectations.“We are particularly encouraged that first-quarter new business is up over 30 per cent year-on-year and 77 per cent of 2010 forecast operating income is now committed,” said Numis Securities.Zamano, the text message marketing group, dropped 13.7 per cent to 11p following a profit warning.The company blamed tighter regulations, particularly in Ireland, as well as weaker-than-expected demand both in the UK and Australia.
154;AON;AON Plc;2010-05-10T19:42:41Z;Red Knights’ Man Utd offer to reflect decline;;Red Knights, the band of wealthy Manchester United fans preparing a bid for the deposed Premier League champions, will offer the owners in excess of £1bn having concluded that the value of the club is in decline, according to people familiar with the group.However, the Glazer family, who on Wednesday mark their fifth anniversary as club owners, have begun a media offensive to underline their determination not to sell, saying the pipeline of commercial deals point to sustained growth enabling the club to manage its debt burden.After United relinquished the Premier League title to Chelsea, the Red Knights, led by Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O’Neill, on Monday issued a statement saying it was making progress in assembling its consortium, although the process was “complex and is taking time”.The offer, being put together by Nomura, involves anything between 15 and 45 investors. Ordinary fans would eventually be offered a stake in the club, although not as part of the initial offer.However, the Red Knights added they believed it was “wrong to offer above fair value” given the size of the club’s debt and that “headwinds” in football were likely to see that value fall.People familiar with Red Knights said it had revised downwards the club’s worth to about £1bn, citing credit market uncertainty, concerns about the football industry’s stability and that of broadcasters, competition from rivals Manchester City, the club’s Champions League quarter-final exit and the future of 68-year-old manager Sir Alex Ferguson.The offer can be expected within four weeks and would be above £1bn to reflect a premium on the club’s valuation, the people said. They also said they had in their ranks investors who claimed they had approached the Glazers with a £1bn offer at the beginning of the year.Advisers to the Glazers, whose ownership has triggered repeated protests from supporters, are doing their utmost to convey that the family was uninterested in any offer and that they are “in it for the long term”.Last week they revealed that the family had turned down a £1.5bn offer from the Middle East last year – a claim met with scorn by the Red Knights – and added that “there could well have been a £1bn offer” more recently.Despite the Glazers nursing debts of £717m, advisers talk up the financial health of the club. Since the £790m takeover in 2005, the club has secured more than £200m in commercial deals, not including its 13-year £303m deal with Nike, a family spokesman said. Commercial deals make up a quarter of club revenue.Advisers say the club has signed three new, but as yet unannounced, deals, among them one with a travel company that in value will be second only to its £90m four-year shirt sponsorship deal with Aon, the insurance company.United is also rolling out regional deals with mobile phone companies and hopes to negotiate a new deal with Nike on improved terms. “Commercial revenues will overtake matchday income in a very short period of time,” one adviser said.The Glazers completed a £500m bond issue in January aimed at lifting covenants and releasing money to help the family pay down high-risk payment-in-kind notes, which allow borrowers to roll over cash interest payments but which have risen to more than £200m.Advisers say the interest on these notes will rise 2 percentage points to 16.25 per cent in August because the club’s net debt has exceeded thresholds, but believe it will return to the current level in February.The Glazers are plainly aware of their unpopularity, but are not oblivious to fans’ concerns, advisers add, pointing to a turnround in the club’s customers relations service.They acknowledge that the downturn has hurt corporate hospitality sales at Old Trafford, but also argue that by removing restrictions, the new financial structure releases more money into the club for player transfers.“The Glazers’ one strategic aim is to put the best footballers on the pitch,” says one adviser. “Everything is impossible without Manchester United winning things. Nothing has changed.”
155;AON;AON Plc;2010-04-04T09:26:56Z;Huge rise in UK defined benefit pension deficits;;More than half of the largest UK companies will report “huge” increases in their final salary pension scheme deficits in their end-March accounts, according to Aon Consulting, in spite of a rebound in asset prices.The aggregate deficit of the 200 largest DB schemes will have risen to £94bn ($144bn, €106bn), from £36bn a year earlier, Aon calculated, even though the value of their assets has risen by £118bn to £498bn.The shortfalls have been driven by rising liabilities, which Aon said had “ballooned” by £175bn to £591bn, due to a decline in double A-rated corporate bond yields from 6.9 per cent to 5.6 per cent, leading to lower discount rates, and rising expectations of future long-term inflation, from 3 per cent to 3.9 per cent.Pension funds need to make clear plans to reduce deficits, “moving away from equities into liability driven investment and swaps when they can afford it”, said Marcus Hurd, head of corporate solutions at Aon.“The financial sophistication is there for companies to hedge a significant proportion of pension scheme risk, so it is surprising that many are still so exposed.”The figures mirror those of Pension Capital Strategies, which estimated the deficits of FTSE 100 DB schemes had risen to £92bn from £66bn a year ago.
156;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Pensions opt for strategy experts over big banks;;Last week the UK’s National Association of Pension Funds convened in Edinburgh for its annual investment conference.By far the most popular individuals, tempted by ex-conference treats of golf, rugby and whisky tasting in Leith, were investment consultants.One might think the pension fund managers would have been the stars of the show. Or even the NAPF’s guest speakers such as David Willetts MP.But with an estimated 91 per cent of pension fund searches in the UK conducted via consultants, they are the perennial target recipients of asset managers’ largesse. One key consultant could be worth 50 schemes.Mercer, Towers Watson and Hewitt may be the big three investment consultancies in the UK, but £250bn (€276bn, $374bn) of pension fund assets rely on the advice of other names.Glasgow-based Hymans Robertson is the premier consultancy to public sector schemes, with £80bn under advice.Both Lane Clark & Peacock and JLT, which recently acquired HSBC Actuaries & Consultants, have £40bn each.Other leading names include Aon Consulting, Barnett Waddingham, Buck Consultants, Deloitte, KPMG and PwC.An established brand is not essential: search specialist, bfinance, has come from nowhere to advise on up to 100 searches per year globally. Cardano has £10bn in assets under advice or management while Redington, whose founders were in the pensions advisory team at Merrill Lynch, is retained either by schemes with £60bn or the sponsors thereof.The longstanding concern regarding traditional consultancies, large or small, is their competence in investment matters. Almost all began life as firms of actuaries. Few great investors carry this qualification. Conversely, the number of investment consultants – whether actuaries or not – with any professional experience of managing securities, let alone venture capital or commodities, is low.“I’m not sure that being a chartered financial analyst is especially relevant to researching asset managers,” says Simon Hill, head of investment research at Buck Consultants. “What I’m really looking for from prospective analysts is aptitude.”This is the aptitude to evaluate risks and ask the right questions. “We know the limitations of the data we are using: it is historic and in some asset classes, such as ex-US corporate bonds, that history only goes back 10 years.”Mr Hill reckons only one-third of consultants’ time is spent on modelling. The rest is explaining the risks to trustees and what scenarios they might encounter.But some pension schemes, such as the Royal County of Berkshire plan, have hired investment banks on the grounds that they are better at modelling alternative asset classes than consultancies.Mr Hill draws the argument back to scenario-planning. He suggests investment banks over-engineer their models with information. His peer at Hymans Robertson, John Dickson, agrees: “I don’t think the banks have better high-level data. If you overuse manager-specific information, then you can get into problems.”The superior personnel count of asset managers and investment banks is not disputed by consultants. But they are comfortable that this difference in size does not affect their own service, even in alternative investments. Few research direct hedge funds, for example.“Hedge funds are never going to be 50 per cent of total investments,” says Gavin Orpin, head of trustee investment consulting at Lane Clark & Peacock. “We make sure clients avoid the Amaranths and Madoffs, but that is also why we only propose funds of hedge funds.”Mr Hill puts it more provocatively: “If you’re into hedge funds, you should go off and start one.”Herein lies the crux of consulting: it exists to help trustees get their big decisions right and manager selection is rarely a big decision. Redington has earned a reputation for risk management: it employs just six people in manager selection.“We would say trustees should be spending eight out of every 10 units of their time on overall strategy,” says Robert Gardner, co-founder of Redington.One complaint about consultants is that their competence is not measured. Assisting on overall strategy is sensible, but how would the added value be recognised? The one attempt in the UK to evaluate consultancies, by Blacket Research five years ago, quickly collapsed.“We think performance-related fees are the fairest way of getting paid,” says Jayne McDermott, head of research in investment consulting at KPMG. “Why not let the client decide how much value we add?”Fixed fees, often on an hourly rate, remain nevertheless the commonest form of recompense. The model appears to change when consultancies move closer to managing money. The jargon for this is implemented or delegated consulting. PSolve was the first to tread this route but Towers Watson, Mercer, Hewitt and Cardano all offer varieties. In most such cases of implemented consulting, however, another adviser gets appointed and so the question of evaluation just transfers to a new name.This scenario proves that pension funds require objective advice. Forget qualifications or evaluation: trustees themselves need to trust a third party who is not, at the end of a presentation, going to turn round and sell a product.Regardless of their gripes about advisers’ competence, asset managers understand their benefit. “If you get selected by one of the big consultancies, your business is sorted for the next five to 10 years,” says the head of consultant relations at one big house. “They are a cheap channel for us. The spend is far less than retail, where portfolio managers have to make webcasts and we produce glossy brochures.”That is an unequivocally reassuring message for the top restaurants and wine vaults of Edinburgh.
157;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:01:26+0000;Rise in people retiring early;;The number of people retiring has risen by more than 20 per cent ahead of the forthcoming increase in the minimum age at which workers can start drawing their pension, according to a new study by Aon Consulting.In January this year, the number of people retiring increased by 22 per cent compared with September last year, the study showed.The group said that the movement was likely to be a result of government plans to increase the minimum retirement age from 50 to 55 on April 6. At present anyone with a personal pension is able to retire at 50 and take their tax-free cash. After April.6, people between 50 and 55 will need to wait for up to five years before they can do the same.“As predicted by our last Admin Tracker, the announced rise in the minimum retirement age from 50 to 55 in April 2010 has led to an increase in retirement activity with continued high volumes of retirement quotations and a surge in retirement settlements – a trend that we expect to continue in the lead up to April 6,” said Colin Hamilton, commercial director at Aon Consulting.The change will also affect anyone who wants to move into “income drawdown” before age 55 as well as anyone receiving pension benefits in the form of “phased retirement” – where you can take a percentage of your pension plan each year to provide you with a level of income through a combination of tax-free cash and annuity income.Moreover, for people in this age group who expect to be made redundant and have low prospects of finding work again, Aon said it could be better for these individuals to retire now than to be denied access to their pension for a few more years if they risk retiring later.However, the group said that for some people it could be better to retire later because increasing life expectancy means that people may need to fund a longer life in retirement.“While people will be affected by different circumstances and have their own individual retirement requirements and objectives, there can be a number of potential benefits to retiring later aside from simply a bigger pot,” said Mr Hamilton. “For example, most DB schemes will apply an early retirement reduction which will be avoided if waiting until Normal Retirement Date.“Members of DC schemes may wish to defer retirement in order to look to get a better annuity rate if they believe the current market will improve. Also, members taking their pension while continuing to work will probably be taxed twice.”The group analysed a sample of nearly 350,000 scheme members from 35 typical UK defined contribution(DC) and defined benefit (DB) schemes.
158;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:01:26+0000;Companies slash pension funding;;Nearly one in ten companies cut contributions into employee pension plans last year, with some stopping payments altogether as a result of the economic downturn.A survey of 340 companies to be published next month by Punter Southall, the adviser, has found that 16 per cent of companies cut or ceased pension payments to their defined contribution pension schemes, or stopped promoting the schemes to prevent take-up.Pension benefits have come under pressure during the economic downturn as companies have sought to cut costs. Employees are often offered the choice between a pay cut or a reduction in pension benefits, with most opting for the latter.The average paid by employers into a defined contribution scheme is currently 6 per cent, according to Aon. But contributions are likely to fall from 2012 when the government introduces lower minimum funding levels, and its new “Nest” scheme. Employers will only be required to contribute 3 per cent of pay into employees’ pensions – which could lead to a “levelling down” by some companies.However, some larger employers are making more generous pension contributions. A report this week from Towers Watson, the consultant, said that the average maximum contribution among FTSE 100 companies is now 16.5 per cent of salary, up from 15.3 per cent last year, with companies rewarding those who pay more into their pensions with higher employer contributions.Meanwhile, high earners are about to lose valuable tax benefits on their pensions, with higher-rate tax relief to be restricted to 20 per cent for those earning more than £150,000 from April 2011, making pension saving tax inefficient for many high earners.But those earning below £130,000 have been paying bonuses into their pension to avoid the highest rate of income tax. Ian Price at St James’s Place said that many people were paying cash bonuses into their pension to avoid falling into the higher income tax bracket for those earning over £150,000. Employers who pay bonuses directly into pensions are also adding the National Insurance savings into emloyees’ schemes.
159;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
160;AON;AON Plc;2010-02-18T00:37:55Z;Willis attacks watchdogs for lifting ban;;Willis, the world’s third-largest insurance broker, has attacked a decision by regulators to lift a ban on controversial commissions in place since 2005, saying that such kickbacks represent a conflict of interest.The attorneys-general of New York, Illinois and Connecticut and the Insurance Departments of Illinois and New York have agreed to change the terms of an industry settlement that banned such payments.The ban had been in place since the conclusion of an inquiry by the then New York attorney-general, Eliot Spitzer.Marsh & McLennan, Aon and Willis, the big-three insurance brokers, will move to a less onerous compliance regime, although the entire broking industry will operate under new transparency rules. However, they will all be allowed to again take “contingent commissions.”Contingent commissions were paid to brokers once business they had passed to insurers reached a certain volume or produced a certain profit.Marsh ended up paying an $850m settlement after the inquiry though it neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.Grahame Millwater, the group president of Willis, said he was pleased at the end of the costly administration and compliance regime, but disappointed that contingent commissions would be allowed.“We are inherently against the conflicts of interest that contingent commissions entail …we would have hoped the playing field would have been levelled by people coming to the conclusion that contingent commissions should not be allowed,” he said.Greg Case, chief executive of Aon, welcomed the move to consistent business practices for all brokers. “We strongly believe that it is in the best interests of clients that state regulators use their authority to require clear and consistent disclosure of the compensation of brokers and agents,” he said. The company said it had no current plans to begin taking contingent commissions.Marsh did not comment on the kickbacks, but said the actions by the New York State Insurance Department and the New York attorney-general helped restore a level playing field. “We commend the [regulators] for applying consistent, mandatory compensation disclosure standards across our industry.”Arthur J. Gallagher & Co, the fourth biggest broker, had a similar ban overturned by regulators in its home state of Illinois last July and has since said it would take such commissions once more.Insurance regulators in New York said the agreement came after a thorough review of the companies’ compliance with the obligations contained in their current settlement agreements.“It reflects the desire by the five regulatory and legal authorities involved to help consumers by providing a level playing field for insurance intermediaries on which they can easily be compared,” they said.
161;AON;AON Plc;2010-02-12T18:55:29Z;‘Balanced’ may tip the scales towards risk;;"Private investors have put billions of pounds into so-called “balanced managed” funds without realising how volatile, or poorly performing, these investments can be, a new report suggests.Research by Skandia, the investments group, has found that, of 489 balanced managed life funds, just 5 per cent had a medium risk level of five out of ten.Advisers have suggested that investors in balanced managed funds – which include open-ended investment companies and pension funds – review their holdings and consider switching.Balanced managed funds, as classified by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), are supposed to be diversified across a range of asset classes. They can hold no more than 85 per cent in equities and can also hold property, fixed-interest bonds and alternative assets.As a result, they are one of the most popular types of fund for company pension schemes – often selected as the “default” fund, into which investors are put if they make no other choice.But the way the funds invest differs hugely. Skandia analysed balanced managed funds by comparing three-year performance with three-year volatility and found large variations in both measures (see chart).One of the more volatile funds, Scottish Equitable UBS Balanced Managed, has 75 per cent in equities and nearly a quarter in fixed interest (see box). By contrast, another fund, Axa CF Miton Special Situations, has less than 25 per cent in equities.Skandia says the findings point to an “urgent need” to review existing investments.“The definition of managed fund sectors is extremely broad and this means that a huge number of funds that are categorised as having a similar investment profile actually deliver a very wide range of different outcomes,” says Peter Jordan at Skandia.“If people have just picked funds on the basis of whether ‘balanced’ is in the name, the outcomes may not be consistent with what their attitudes are,” he adds.The ABI says its sectors are not supposed to suggest anything about the relative risk of funds.“The ABI does not classify funds according to the riskiness or the specific investment strategies of each life and pensions fund,” says Maggie Craig, the ABI’s acting director-general. “It is for providers and advisers to ensure that the relative risks of each investment fund they offer and the fund’s investment strategy are made clear to investors at point of sale.”But the ABI says it is reviewing some of its sector classifications later this year – including balanced managed – to look at changes that “could or should be made”.Many investors put money into balanced managed funds during the 1990s, before investment funds had diversified into the multi-
asset strategies that are common today. As a result, there is now £196bn in these funds.Hargreaves Lansdown, a financial adviser, has pointed out that many of the pension funds are now closed to new investment, so there is little commercial incentive for the managers to improve performance.“I suspect there are a lot of managed funds run by insurance companies using very tight benchmarks with restrictions on what managers can and can’t invest in,” says Laith Khalaf, pensions adviser at Hargreaves Lansdown.Jesal Mistry, a pensions consultant at Aon, says that some balanced managed funds rely too much on equities for their performance, rather than diversifying into other assets, as they are supposed to do.He says investors who want to diversify should consider absolute return or multi-asset funds – while those who are investing for growth should just pick a fund that has 100 per cent
in equities."
162;AON;AON Plc;2010-01-29T19:18:48Z;Invesco victory in Omega battle;;Neil Woodford, the Invesco fund manager, has won his battle to force wholesale change to the board of Omega Insurance after the Bermuda-based, Lloyd’s of London insurer said it would convene a meeting to vote on the proposals.Mr Woodford, whose fund owns 29 per cent of the company, has the backing of a majority of other shareholders behind his call to replace the chairman and other directors.John Coldman, the former chairman of Benfield, the reinsurance broker sold to Aon in 2008, is set to be installed as chairman after the vote, which will take place in March.The dispute between the company and a group of investors led by Mr Woodford was sparked by the sudden departure last October of John Robinson, one of the company founders and its head underwriter.Omega had raised £130m through a placing at the start of the year and investors said they had put in cash mainly on the back of Mr Robinson’s reputation.“The board has been in dialogue with major shareholders . . . in an effort to achieve a consensual outcome and acknowledges the strength of feeling of major shareholders in favour of the Invesco proposals,” Omega said after a two-day board meeting in Bermuda.“The board recognises that it is the wish of those shareholders to make significant changes to the board, including the appointment of John Coldman as chairman.”In addition to Mr Coldman, the Invesco proposals – which were first put to the company in December – include the appointments of James Bryce, Robin Spencer-Arscott, Jonathan Betts, Ernest Morrison and David Cooper as additional directors.The company said that Walter Fiederowicz, the current chairman, Christopher Clarke and the three other non-executive directors had all said they would step down from the board if the resolutions were passed.Mr Woodford sent two requisitions for a special meeting in December, but the company said they were invalid due to technical errors in the documents. A third requisition was expected, but the board has decided to go ahead and convene the meeting without waiting for a corrected requisition.The company said an SGM was “the appropriate forum to effect this change of control of the board of the company and at which all shareholders will be entitled to vote”.The shares closed down 2p at 114p, their lowest level since moving from Aim to the main board last summer.
163;AON;AON Plc;2009-12-18T18:08:01Z;Young adults delay saving for a pension;;"UK company pension funds have seen billions wiped off their value in the past decade, according to the latest figures from Aon Consulting – turning a surplus of £25bn in 1999 into a deficit of £96bn today. And most of this value destruction can be attributed to equity market falls during the global financial crisis.Research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows the average UK pension fund lost 17.8 per cent in 2008 – due to its 46 per cent exposure to equities. In total, the market crash destroyed £3,290bn of pension value in the industrialised world. But, even faced with this pension funding problem, young adults still do not see the merits of retirement planning.Less than a quarter of independent financial advisers (IFAs) say they have noticed younger clients – under the age of 29 – taking more interest in saving for retirement in the past year, according to a survey commissioned by the Financial Times.More worryingly, only 4 per cent of 20-somethings have actually started saving for retirement via pensions and individual savings accounts (Isas). Most individuals still start their planning between the ages of 40 and 49.These findings are in line with three other studies that have shown young adults are becoming less inclined to save for retirement – even though the cost of any delay continues to rise.Experts say the root of the problem goes beyond obvious reasons, such as a lack of income among university graduates already saddled with student debt. They believe the credit crisis has put people off investments in risky assets.“Intuitively, it’s wise to save, but with all the doom and gloom in the media and people hearing that the market has lost 40 per cent of its value, young adults think that’s the reality of pensions – so they don’t bother,” says Barry Horner, an adviser at Paradigm Norton Financial Planning.A study by Aviva shows that only 3 per cent of individuals now plan their savings 10 years into the future. A third plan their budgets on a month-to-month basis. If younger people could be persuaded to invest over the long term, the benefits are clear. A separate study by Hargreaves Lansdown shows that an 18-year-old who puts £300 a month into a self-invested pension plan (Sipp) for the next 47 years would end up with £920,000 by the time he turns 65, assuming a 6 per cent annual return after charges.But experts say short-termism is only part of the problem. They also blame the way in which pensions are explained, which they say for years has proven too complex for a younger audience.“It’s not a sexy topic,” says Chris Noon, partner at Hymans Robertson. “People who run pension schemes are technical experts who don’t necessarily know how to communicate its relevance.”He says young adults are quickly turned off by 30-page booklets filled with complicated statistics and technical jargon. Eighty per cent of individuals under the age of 35 say pension information is confusing and “full of gobbledygook,” Hymans Robertson has found.“If you are marketing an iPod, I don’t care if it has an XYZ drive. All I care is that it plays music. If your material is confusing, you’d be fired,” Mr Noon argues.Aviva’s research reveals that the majority of young adults know that pensions offer tax incentives, but the majority cannot explain how those benefits worked.The UK insurer has recently tried to tackle this problem by introducing a new software that tracks the point at which young adults become switched off by confusing information. Paul Goodwin, head of pensions at Aviva, says effective changes are often subtle, such as avoiding the use of percentages and pie charts.However, Iain Tait at London & Capital says young adults who come out of university go into the property market instead.“The changes in pension rules have caused people to become more reluctant in trying to understand how pensions work, even if a Sipp is just as flexible as a regular Isa.”Mr Tait has tried to encourage younger clients to view Sipps in the same way as Isas or sharedealing accounts, but with even greater tax incentives.Beyond these efforts, though, the lack of enthusiasm for pensions remains. AXA recently launched a campaign to change the name of pensions, which it believes further alienates young adults. But Laith Khalaf, pension analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says this move would fail to address the underlying reality that young people face.He says children who watched their parents reap the benefits of both state and employer pension will no longer enjoy the same luxury.“Tomorrow’s pensioners will not be so lucky, which makes you wonder how many of them will end up living in poverty; the term ‘pension crisis’ is not hyperbolic. The best and only way to avoid being caught up in the crisis is to build your own nest.”There are some signs that attitudes may change, however. In a new study by Friends Provident, over half of young adults agreed that state pension will not provide enough for retirement. One third said they intended to start contributing into a pension before 30 – although paying off debt remains their first priority.It’s a sign that wealth managers and advisers are beginning to get their messages across. However, they conceded that the solution will ultimately depend as much on changing the way pensions are explained as it does on parents regularly communicating with their children."
164;AON;AON Plc;2009-12-18T12:36:14Z;Pension contributions top employee wishlist;;Over a half of UK employees want higher pension contributions from their employers, according to a study by Aon Consulting.Another 42 per cent of employees want financial protection in the event of an injury or illness and annual leave.UK employees are demanding better investment in social and personal development plans as well, with a third seeking funding for educational courses. But higher pension contributions remain the biggest incentive in an employee benefits package.Although the value of pension funds have fallen dramatically over the past year - as much as £18bn in October alone- the survey shows that employees continue to view corporate pensions as an integral part of their retirement planning.However, Aon Consulting added that as the job market recovers, employees will opt for opportunities that offer more than pure financial compensation.Gareth Ashley-Jones, head of flexible benefits at Aon Consulting said: “It is good to see that employees consider their pension, finances and free time as top priorities.“However, to remain competitive employers must take note of the non-traditional perks that are not so commonly included in benefits packages, such as education courses and social activities.”Over a third of those surveyed requested funding for an educational course of their choice, such as foreign languages, dancing and wine tasting. One in three workers also want their employers to provide financial planning advice to help them learn how to save towards a home deposit, a car or school fees.However, whether companies actually follow through on these investments remains to be seen, especially at a time when employers are cutting back on spending.
165;AON;AON Plc;2009-11-19T17:55:12Z;Members stay with their pension schemes;;The number of people leaving their pension schemes fell to its lowest level this year, while enquiries about the current value of the pensions rose to its highest level, according to Aon Consulting.The research included 350,000 scheme members from 35 UK defined contribution (DC) and defined benefit (DB) schemes. The fall appears to indicate increased confidence in private sector pension schemes and a growing interest in planning for retirement.Members of pension schemes showed more interest in the current value of their fund, with enquiries up 26 per cent from June. The number of members leaving their pension scheme also fell by 34 per cent during the third quarter.“As with predictions for the economic recovery, the shape of member confidence levels in pensions is hard to call but, certainly compared to a year ago or even last quarter, people seem to be much more engaged about their pensions than they were,” said Colin Hamilton, commercial director at Aon Consulting.“Greater awareness may well be due to the economic environment, but it may also come down to the fact that messages about the importance of saving for retirement are getting through to members more effectively.”In another study released by Aon Consulting earlier this week, pension funds had fallen by £18bn in October. Although increased enquiries in pensions could be the result of the recent rally in the stock markets, many pensioners still remain worried.Mushtaq Jaigirdar of Yellowtail Financial Planning says the statistics should be taken with a grain of salt, citing the underlying investment of the pension arrangement as the main reason members left in the first place.“We should concentrate on the underlying investment rather than the pensions per se. The pension is more of a wrapper, as it provides the investment to grow in a tax-efficient environment. When people began seeing a huge fall in their statements in comparison with previous years, it prompted them to leave their schemes.”Mr Jaigirdar said members labelled the pension rather than the investments as the reason behind the drop in value.But by leaving the arrangement, they also end up losing out on the benefits a superior investment vehicle, he added.“Pensioners have a choice of what they can do with their investment scheme. For instance, if the stock market becomes more volatile, they can select investments that are less risky, or move into more defensive investing.”Mr Jaigirdar said those who are informed properly and provided with the relevant information are less likely to leave a pension arrangement.The research also revealed that the announced rise in the minimum retirement age from 50 to 55 has not led to a subsequent rise in retirement activity, which Mr Hamilton attributes to “time it has taken for schemes to fully communicate this change to members.”“We expect to see an increase in early retirement projections, followed by an increase in settlements, in the first half of 2010,” he said.
166;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Pension funds fall by £18bn in one month;;The total value of defined contribution pension value fell by £18bn in one month, according to Aon Consulting.The pension consultant said the total figure stood at £489bn at the end of October, compared to £507bn at the end of September. The fall reflects a bad month for stock markets around the world as they fell back following a period of strong gains.Aon said this is the biggest fall since February, but also noted earlier in the month combined DC pension assets reached a 16-month high of £520bn - a level not seen since June 2008.Highlighting the current uncertainty being faced by UK workers as a result of equity market volatility, Aon said a 65-year-old retiring on October 31 would have received an annual retirement income of £8593. If the same worker had retired six months earlier on April 30 they would have only received £7133. This is the equivalent of over £120 every month, or £29,200 over the course of 20 years.Richard Strachen, senior consultant at Aon Consulting, said: ”While October finished slightly down compared to September, the general trend for the UK’s DC pension savings is on the up.“There is still significant volatility, though, and it is vital for workers to take an active interest in their retirement savings, evaluating whether they are invested in the right funds for them, and to have some very clear goals and a strategy to achieve them.”According to separate research from Aon, British workers are increasingly investing their DC pensions in their scheme’s default fund, potentially as a result of the continued uncertainty in investment markets. The 2009 Aon Benefits and Trends Survey revealed that majority of employers are seeing more than 80 per cent of their employees invested in the default fund.“There is a trend towards increasing the number of investment options,” said Strachen. “However, too much choice will often lead employees to select the default option through fear or inertia. It’s understandable that members are seeing the default fund as a safe haven. However the security of the default fund is down to those managing the scheme.”
167;AON;AON Plc;2009-10-09T18:13:58Z;Workers warned off ‘safe’ pensions;;"by Alice RossPension consultants have warned that employees may be choosing the wrong funds in their companies’ pension schemes, putting their retirement income at risk.Four in five workers at most UK defined contribution pension schemes now pay into their company’s “default” pension fund, according to research by Aon Consulting. Inflows into default funds have been rising, which Aon says is likely to be due
to workers seeking the “safe” option, after many pension funds lost up to a third of their value last year.But these funds may not be as safe as employees believe.“Employees think that because the employer has selected the default fund it’s a safe option and not subject to capital risk – the reality is very different,” warns Helen Dowsey, a pensions consultant at Aon.“For an investor who is particularly cautious, it can be a shock to find the value of their fund has fallen by a third.”Companies’ defined contribution pension schemes usually offer a range of funds. These can include funds in cash, fixed interest, property or equities.Employees who fail to select a fund are automatically put into the scheme’s default fund. This is often a global equity index tracker fund, which could carry more risk than many employees want to take.Under a defined contribution arrangement, employers and employees both contribute to a pension fund, but the employee bears the risk of the fund falling in value. These schemes have been replacing final-salary schemes, where the employer bears the risk.But there is a lack of awareness of the different forms of risk in a workplace pension scheme, consultants say. A cash fund may pose little or no capital risk, but it will not protect a pension fund against inflation over the longer term.“Members think of risk in terms of capital risk but not in terms of inflation risk or opportunity cost risk – which is the risk of going for the safe option and missing out on the long- term gains,” said Dowsey.People about to retire are also faced with a difficult balancing act when deciding when to purchase an annuity with their pension.The value of pension funds has been falling, but annuity rates are also moving down as people live longer – so people who delay buying an annuity might not receive a higher income if the value of their pension goes up."
168;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;StanChart hangs its shirt on Liverpool in £80m deal;;Standard Chartered Bank on Monday joined the roll call of companies paying large sums to put their names on the shirts of leading European football clubs by agreeing a four-year sponsorship deal with Liverpool Football Club worth up to £80m (€91m).The London and Hong Kong-listed bank made up for its failure to become Manchester United’s shirt sponsor earlier this year, paying broadly the same to Liverpool as the Premier League champions are receiving from Aon, the insurance company.The £20m-a-year deal, though bigger than those secured recently by Juventus, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, demonstrates the gulf in the commercial clout between Europe’s elite clubs and the others.Sports sponsorship experts doubted that the Liverpool deal pointed the way to a rise in deals across football. “This deal sets the bar for other elite clubs but will not affect the general market or second-tier properties,” said Phil Carling of Octagon, the sports marketing agency.Premier League clubs believe the recession is doing nothing to diminish the appetite for their product. Their shirt deals had prompted club chairmen to reject Barclays’ £70m offer to renew their title sponsorship of the league for the next three seasons, even though the bank was proposing an increase of about 7 per cent on its existing deal, a person familiar with the situation said.StanChart replaces Carlsberg, which had the option of renewing its Liverpool sponsorship that had reached £10m a year, but appears to have been unable to compete with the bank’s deal. The brewer is putting its money into the Football Association, which gives it sponsorship access to the England national team, Wembley stadium and the FA Cup.Other bidders for the Liverpool sponsorship included Bwin, the Austrian online gaming group that ended up signing a deal with Real Madrid, one person close to the situation said.StanChart expects the deal to increase brand awareness in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.“Liverpool will do that in a cost-effective way,” StanChart said.
169;AON;AON Plc;2009-08-26T12:06:00Z;Pension contributions start to rise again;;Almost one in five workers has increased the amount they pay into their pension compared to last year.In spite of people’s rising concerns about finance during the recession, new research from Aon Consulting has found that people are nearly four times as likely to have increased their contributions to their defined contribution (DC) pension than to have decreased them.The results are the latest from Aon’s Employee Omnibus Survey and the findings suggest that at a time when some employers are cutting back their pension provision, a significant slice of the workforce is picking up this shortfall by increasing personal payments. The research indicates that many regard sufficient saving for their pension as a necessity despite the recession.Of the 18 per cent who have increased payments, only 2 per cent have done so by under £10 per month and this may be due to automatic links to salary increases. However, 9 per cent have boosted payments by more than £50 per month in the last year and this includes 2 per cent of workers who have increased contributions by more than £200 per month despite the current economic conditions.Meanwhile, 42 per cent stated that they had made no alterations to the amount of money they have paid into their pension over the past year. Only 5 per cent said they have decreased contributions in the last year.Helen Dowsey, at Aon Consulting said: “These findings are encouraging news as they show that for a significant number of people, saving for a pension is sacrosanct despite the recession.“With some employers less able to contribute as generously as in the past, many individuals have taken it upon themselves to make up the shortfall. Aon would encourage all employees to carefully consider the amount they pay into their pensions and review this on a regular basis.”
170;AON;AON Plc;2009-08-21T18:47:54Z;Eight out of ten pension funds miss targets;;More than eight out of ten pension funds have delivered poor and inconsistent returns over five and 10 years, underscoring the difficulties faced by private investors saving for retirement.A study by Howmuchdoineedtoretire.co.uk, the pensions advisory group, found that 86 per cent of 778 retail pension funds offered by banks, insurers and other firms failed to meet basic performance targets. These included whether funds achieved first or second quartile rankings in at least three of the past five years and had above average returns. The study included funds with more than £10m in assets and a history longer than five years.Zurich Equity’s Managed 2 EP and Axa Lifestyle Retire 2015 were in the minority of funds, with strong returns, while Skandia’s balanced pension and Scottish Provident’s Managed growth pension performed particularly poorly.“Investors would be better following a strategy of not using funds,” said Matt Morris, investment adviser at Howmuchdoineedtoretire.co.uk. “Investors are being charged for consistent and in many cases very real failure by fund managers who are getting away with appalling performance by any measurement.”Private pension funds are not the only funds to take a hit. Slumping markets and a rise in the number of pensioners, have also hit companies’ pension funding levels. Northern Foods, British Airways, National Express and Thomas Cook are among the prominent companies with the largest pension deficits, according to Barclays Capital.Meanwhile, the value of assets in defined contribution occupational pension schemes has returned to September 2008 levels, after a rise of £31bn to £451bn over the last month, according to analysis from human resources consultancy Aon Consulting. This compares with a record low in March this year, when assets totalled £344bn, but is still far off the highs of September 2007 when assets were £550bn. Aon said the gains were mainly due to rallies in the equity markets since March. The average 30-year old can now expect an income of £21,410 per year when they retire, compared with last month’s projection of £20,659. A 60-year-old can expect £11,384 compared with £10,373..
171;AON;AON Plc;2009-08-18T14:14:24Z;Pension funds rebound in value;;The value of assets in employees’ defined contribution pension funds have returned to levels last seen nearly a year ago driven by rising share prices in July, according to Aon Consulting.The research put the collective value of DC pension funds at £451bn, up by £31bn, or nearly 7 per cent, from June. This left the combined pension funds worth just £1bn more than they were in September 2008.The group said the value of these pension schemes had risen by £31 billion or 6.8 per cent during July, largely due to improvements in world equity markets.But the schemes have endured a turbulent 12 months, with their value dipping to just £344bn in March.Workers are increasingly having to save for their retirement through defined contribution schemes after the majority of companies closed their more generous final salary pensions to new members. A number of companies, including Fujitsu, IBM and Interserve, have recently announced consultations about or plans to close their UK final salary schemes to existing members.Under final salary schemes employers state how much a pension will be worth on retirement, based on the number of years a worker has belonged to the scheme and their pay immediately before they retire.But people with defined contribution schemes have to shoulder the risk of investment volatility and increased life expectancy themselves.Aon said the fluctuation in the value of defined contribution pensions seen during the past year showed how volatile the value of these schemes could be.”These figures look promising as we return to asset figures roughly at the same value as they were a year ago,” said Helen Dowsey, head of defined contribution at Aon Consulting.”However, this month’s figures serve to underline the volatile nature of defined contribution investment. Someone retiring at the end of July may have a significantly higher projected retirement income than someone retiring a month before.“These volatile conditions highlight the need for workers to pre-plan for their pension, and understand and regularly review their investments, whose value can change dramatically in a short space of time.”The findings follow a recent report from KPMG that the pension industry will reach ‘tipping point’ this year as the cost of trying to close the funding shortfalls of their defined benefit schemes would be equal to the money they set aside to cover new pension benefits earned by workers.
172;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Football clubs losing battle with shirt sponsors;;The battle to secure a renewed shirt sponsorship deal at Liverpool FC looks set to establish the latest benchmark in promotional revenues being fought over by the Premier League’s top teams.Carlsberg has so far declined to extend its £7.5m- a-year deal with Liverpool, which concludes at the end of this season.The Danish brewer has indicated that it remains in talks with Liverpool, although there is speculation that the Danes might walk.For several years leading clubs have held the upper hand in negotiating deals. But with the recession putting a brake on this once-buoyant market, the boot is now on the other foot as many deals are being struck on keener terms.The corporate failure of several sponsors has also helped deflate the market. Last season saw AIG, the bailed-out US insurer, abandon any extension of its shirt sponsorship of champions Manchester United.Meanwhile, West Ham was forced to patch over the logo of its sponsor XL when the travel company fell into administration last September. Failed mortgage lender Northern Rock limped on as sponsor of relegated Newcastle United, while West Bromwich Albion – also doomed to the drop – began the season without any deal at all.Sport+Markt, the sports consultancy, estimates that the value of shirt sponsorship deals in the Premier League fell from £69.2m during the 2007-08 season to £68.2m last season, after years of continuous growth.“It has become a bit more of a buyer’s market in the UK as we can see from the new deals that some teams have struck with online betting companies,” said Andreas Ullmann, head of market intelligence at Sport+Markt.188BET, an Asia-focused online gambling company, underscored the extent to which the tide has turned when it pulled off a deal to sponsor both Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic for the next two seasons.A year ago, both clubs could have expected deals in the region of £1m a year, according to sports industry experts. Instead, 188Bet is understood to be paying Bolton about £750,000 a year while Wigan is getting about £650,000 a year.Mr Ullmann is predicting the value of shirt deals to inch back up slightly to £70m this year, thanks to the emergence of new sponsors from the betting industry. “Without them many clubs would have serious problems,” he says.The global branding clout of the biggest clubs may protect them from the downturn, but Julie Clark, head of sports and leisure at PwC, says smaller football clubs may struggle to maintain sponsorship deals at previous levels.“What we are seeing is a polarisation between the top-tier teams and the bottom tiers,” she says.Indeed some top-tier teams have managed not just to maintain but to increase the value of their shirt-sponsorship deals.Aon, which replaced AIG as sponsors of Manchester United, is believed to have struck a £25m-a-year deal.Phil Clement, chief marketing officer of Aon, declined to comment, but said the sponsorship would be worth “considerably more” than the £19m-a-year deal with AIG struck over four years ago.“In five years, the club has developed a huge fan base in Asia, which is attractive for a company like us that is looking for a global reach,” he says, adding opportunities to be associated with a team that has 330m fans worldwide does not come up often.Joel Seymour Hyde, of sports consultancy Octagon, says fragmentation of traditional media is making sports sponsorship a more attractive platform than conventional advertising.That view was echoed by Gyehyun Kwon, head of worldwide sports marketing at Samsung Electronics, which recently renewed its sponsorship of Chelsea for a reported £10m-a-year.“The [Chelsea] sponsorship is much more effective than any other traditional marketing tool,” he says.Fans’ loyalty and devotion to their teams attracts big corporations. But there are pitfalls, with the danger of a brand backlash from rival club supporters one area of potential concern.“In Scotland, Carling sponsors Rangers and Celtic precisely to avoid alienating fans of either side,” says Ms Clark of PwC.
173;AON;AON Plc;2009-07-31T18:38:17Z;Market rally fails to lift worst-hit pension funds;;"The recent rise in share prices has failed to shrink the deficit of private companies’ defined benefit pension schemes. The combined pension deficit of the 200 largest schemes offered by unlisted employers remained at £73bn this month, according to Aon Consulting – about equal to June’s figure, but more than nine times the £8bn shortfall reported in April.Actuaries attribute the deficit to lower corporate bond yields. If the yields on these bonds fall further, deficits could grow by another £40bn, according to Aon.“Equity market gains have not been substantial enough to offset the falls in corporate bond yields, meaning that liabilities have been growing faster than assets can recover, therefore pushing up deficits,” warned Sarah Abraham, an Aon actuary.“As the economy recovers, employers will have to hope that equity values rise faster than corporate bond yields fall or they may need to prepare themselves for some of the worst year-end accounting results on record.”Concerns over deficits are likely to encourage those enrolled in defined-benefit schemes to consider transferring their funds into a self-invested personal pension (Sipp) as the maximum payout awarded under the government’s pension protection fund to those 65 or over is less than £30,000.News of the setbacks for company pensions followed a report by the retirement planning website howmuchdoineedtoretire.co.uk showing that a number of large pension funds marketed by prominent banks and life insurers offer minimal long-term returns.Three of the 10 worst performers are balanced funds, which have seen a surge in interest from cautious investors looking for stable returns.The Abbey Equity fund lost 6.6 per cent of its value in the last decade; the Friends Provident UK equity fund is down 5.28 per cent; and Lloyds TSB’s balanced managed fund returned only 10.24 per cent over the period, according to Morningstar. In contrast, the FTSE 250 gained 74.7 per cent in the last 10 years."
174;AON;AON Plc;2009-07-08T21:49:11Z;IBM UK pension under review;;IBM’s UK subsidiary became the latest employer to announce that it is considering closing its final salary pension scheme to existing workers, a step it would take in April 2010 after a period of legally-mandated consultation.IBM follows in the footsteps of several other high profile employers, notably the UK subsidiaries of overseas companies, looking to cut the risks and costs of retirement provision.In recent weeks, Fujitsu UK said it is consulting on a similar move, while US-based Aon said it would cut payments into its defined contribution scheme. Barclays has also said it will close its final salary scheme to existing employees.IBM said that the move would affect about a quarter of its 20,000 UK employees but declined to give any details about the size of the scheme’s membership, liabilities or finances. IBM’s annual report gives no details on its UK pension obligations which are aggregated with those of other non-US domiciled businesses that it operates.But IBM has sought for years to reduce its exposure to pensions risk in the US and abroad. It closed its UK scheme to new employees in 1997. Also, it fought legal battles for years in the US after moves in the 1990s to convert its defined benefit plans to what is known as a cash equity plan, and ultimately to a hybrid form of plan known as a cash balance scheme. The latter is a form of defined contribution plan in which a percentage of each worker’s pay is set aside each year and earns a predetermined rate of interest, providing a minimum underpin against investment losses.However, employees challenged IBM’s process of converting from one form of pension to another, arguing that it constituted a form of age discrimination. In 2003, the Federal District Court in the Southern District of Illinois agreed, and that decision was not overturned until mid-2006. At the end of 2007, IBM ceased most of its US defined benefit schemes as well as closing its schemes in Japan.The company said that if it proceeds with the closure, employees in the UK scheme will be offered the opportunity to join an enhanced version of its existing defined contribution scheme. Currently, employees contribute 3 per cent of pay and IBM 8 per cent. From next April, IBM will match employee contributions above 3 per cent up to a maximum of 5 per cent.
175;AON;AON Plc;2009-06-21T09:11:40Z;Time to re-examine target date funds;;The question of how money saved for retirement should be invested at retirement is up for debate. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor held hearings last week on target date funds, widely used as default funds in US retirement savings plans.In the UK, the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority is consulting on the investment approach it should adopt for the default fund under the scheme, due to be rolled out from 2012, and on how retirement income should be delivered. This feeds into a wider debate about constructing default funds for DC plans that are “fit for purpose”.The latest figures from Aon Consulting on the value of assets in UK defined contribution pensions are a cogent reminder of why this debate matters. They show combined assets have recovered to £430bn (€507bn, $708bn), having fallen below £350bn in the third quarter, before the market recovery. But it would take a 28 per cent increase to bring them back to the £550bn they were worth in September 2007.When it comes to the income that a pension pot can buy, Aon says a 60-year-old (contributing 10 per cent of a £25,000 salary a year with a pot worth £150,000 at September 2007) fully invested in equities can expect a pension nearly 30 per cent lower than in September 2007, despite a 9 per cent rise since March.Richard Strachan, senior consultant at Aon, cautions against relying on continuing stock market recovery to repair the damage. Such a strategy is “far too risky for those within 10 years of retirement”, he says.Mary Schapiro, chairman of the SEC, said last week that target date funds were widely regarded as “set it and forget” investments. They adjust asset allocation over the life of the fund, and are expected to move to lower risk assets as the target date approaches. But the stock market events of last year revealed wide variation in the approach taken by target date managers, particularly with regard to the equity allocation close to the target date, and widely varying performance as a result.“Returns of 2010 target date funds in 2008 ranged from minus 3.6 per cent to minus 41 per cent,” said Ms Schapiro. This raised the question of whether “regulatory changes, industry reforms or other revisions are needed with respect to target date funds”.She was particularly interested in whether SEC regulations “foster investor understanding of target date funds, their risk characteristics, their fees and the meaning of a particular ‘target date’ in a fund’s name”.The last point is one taken up by Fund Democracy and the Consumer Federation of America. In a letter to Ms Schapiro and Hilda Soldis, secretary at the Department of Labor, the two organisations say naming a fund “Target Date 2010” implies an equity/fixed income allocation within a generally accepted range. In many cases, “this message was a lie” they assert as fund managers have used allocations that “radically and dangerously” depart from that range, investing aggressively in equities or other volatile asset classes.They cite the example of a 2010 fund with 65 per cent in equities in mid-2008 with an additional 5 per cent in commodities, against an average 45 per cent equity allocation across all 2010 funds. The underlying funds in this target date fund were in-house actively managed funds, they note, and “equity funds generally are more profitable than bond funds”. The manager “may have a financial incentive” for the high equity allocation.This is an important point where fund managers have discretion to allocate assets on behalf of savers, particularly at a time when revenues are under pressure. Regulators probably do not want to start laying down rules around target date fund allocations, but should at least be more demanding about how expectations are managed and whether managers are delivering what they appear to be selling.The Investment Company Institute has come up with a set of principles for target date funds, most of which you would hope would be standard practice already. These are self regulatory measures, though, so managers are not obliged to adopt them. And they do not address the question of whether there is a correct asset allocation approach as target date funds near their end dates.Imposing standardisation in investment approach is rarely sensible – the fund industry has enough of a herd instinct as it is. But with target date funds becoming the norm for managing DC pension assets it is vital to consider the consequences of leaving allocation decisions that affect the welfare of savers entirely in the hands of fund managers.pauline.skypala@ft.com
176;AON;AON Plc;2009-06-17T15:15:17Z;Risk management: Blue-sky approach sought for improving early warning;;"Sending non-executive directors “back to the classroom” to relearn risk management and other skills may sound far-fetched.But in the wake of the financial crisis, no proposal seems unworthy of consideration if it means boards get a better handle on the art of risk management.That is the view of Lord Myners, the UK’s minister for the City of London, who has urged two independent reviews into board practices to “go outside the conventional framework” and test unorthodox management models.The aim is to ensure that company boards – especially those of banks and other financial services companies – have in place robust enough risk management systems that will help them get ahead of potential problems – such as the ones that brought down AIG, the US insurer, and countless other banks that invested in overly-risky subprime-related assets.The issue is likely to get on the agenda of non-financial companies as well. Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, last month said it would incorporate an assessment of a company’s “enterprise risk management” in its analysis of non-financial companies.It said the assessment aimed to “improve the breadth and consistency of our review of management capabilities”, and would “identify differentiated capabilities of companies to respond to adversity”.At first blush, risk management seems well-embedded at the board level. In an annual risk management survey conducted by Aon, the world’s largest insurance broker, three-quarters of companies polled had “established or partially established policies on risk oversight and management”.Almost nine out of 10 companies had “board-level involvement in their current approach to risk management”.Aon said: “Boards are clearly aware of the importance of risk management and the dangers of not addressing it effectively. Risk is now a top priority for board-level agendas, although the approaches vary considerably.”Yet there is much work to be done to figure out what kinds of risk management systems boards should have in the wake of the financial crisis. That exposed how information flowed far too slowly up to the board level to allow early diagnosis of problems.Jonathan Lewis, chief executive of Governance Integrity Solutions, a consultancy, says: “Part of the problem is that, from a board perspective, the issue seems to be not so much that the systems were themselves at fault.“It is that, as a director – especially a non-exec – you can’t be expected to know the intimate details of a risk management system and that the critical information wasn’t getting to the board in time.”Indeed, James Catmur, a director in the risk practice of management consultancy Arthur D Little, argues that in many instances organisations with seemingly “better” risk management procedures have a worse track record than those with seemingly “weaker” systems.“We found that only relying on standards and compliance is not sufficient to achieve good risk management,” Mr Catmur says. “Other factors contribute significantly to the good (or bad) management of risk and therefore need to be considered in a successful risk management approach.“These factors include managing the complexity of one’s operations; dealing with changes to operations; organisation and business environment; and managing culture.”One purely organisational issue getting in the way of better risk management is that oversight of risk management often has been lumped in with the job of the audit committee.Some argue that risk management is now too big for an audit committee and should be handled by a separate risk committee – and that this be mandatory for financial services companies. For non-financial services companies, says Mr Lewis, it would be a “recommendation”.There is certainly no lack of initiatives suggesting that changes be made, or bodies coming up with recommendations for better risk management. But the big question is how that translates into action.Grant Foster, associate director of global risk consulting at Aon, remains unconvinced that the inclusion of risk management in S&P’s analysis will spur much change at company board levels.“It won’t necessarily tip you up to a higher rating, neither will it have you drop down. It’s the sort of thing that gives people a nice warm feeling that things are under control. Whether these kind of things motivate boards to take risk management more seriously, I’m not sure.”He says boards need to be clear on strategy and the risks associated with it, and how that is communicated down through the organisation. At the same time managers need to be sure that there are adequate risk controls in place and “the right things are reported and escalated up”.“Once you have got that right, the company will have a pretty good risk management scheme,” says Mr Foster. “It has to support a decision at the end of the day. A lot of companies are data-rich and information-poor. You get overwhelmed by numbers and graphs and never crystallise this to make a decision.”For boards looking to recruit the right people, all this does not necessarily mean they will have to find specialists in risk management, however.Krystyna Nowak, director of Hanson Green, a non-executive search firm, says she has not seen a rise in demand for people qualified in risk management per se.But a better awareness of risk management in general is likely to become one of a handful of “key items” boards will look for in candidates.“Risk management is going to become part of what is required, I’m not sure you’ll see a specific phenomenon of companies racing out to find risk experts,” Ms Novak says."
177;AON;AON Plc;2009-06-12T03:45:28Z;Uefa warns over Ronaldo £80m signing;;Real Madrid’s world record £80m deal for Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United’s Portuguese winger, will destabilise European football, Michel Platini, Uefa’s president, has warned.The Spanish club’s offer, accepted by United on Thursday, comes days after they signed Kaka from AC Milan for €68m ($96m, £58m) and provides further evidence of the financial muscle that separates Europe’s elite teams from the rest.“The almost daily series of fabulous transfers at a time when European football faces dangerous financial challenges says something to me,” Mr Platini, who has repeatedly warned about the amount of debt in European clubs, said.“This chain of events underlines the question of fair play and of the balance in competitive football. Uefa works steadily with the clubs to put in place a system and rules that will allow the stabilisation of the financial foundations of football.”But the two clubs, who issued statements saying they expected the deal to be concluded in the next few days, were keen to emphasise sound business reasons for the deal.People inside United, which is paying £69m ($113m, €80m) a year in interest to service a £699m debt mountain, played down the idea that most of the money would be put towards buying new players. They suggested instead that part of the proceeds would go towards interest payments. “We want to suppress the expectation that we are in the [transfer] market and will be willing to spend big money,” said one insider.United have just negotiated a shirt sponsorship deal with Aon, the US insurance group, thought to total £100m.Real Madrid has a €300m, four-year bank facility, and is likely to spend a large part in the first year on high-profile signings such as that of Ronaldo, according to one insider.Real Madrid’s outlay is being masterminded by Florentino Pérez, who was restored to the presidency of the club on June 1, promising to spend heavily to restore Real to the summit of Spanish and European football.Despite criticism of the astronomical sum being paid for the Portuguese star, Mr Pérez will argue that the deal is a sound investment. With 50 per cent of the commercial rights, and the chance that Ronaldo, and future star signings, will boost merchandising revenues, the deal made business sense, said the club insider, as long as the club did well over the next few seasons. “It is better to buy Ronaldo for €92m than pay €20m for a player of slightly less calibre and profile,” he said.Mr Pérez, who brought Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham and other so-called “galacticos” to the club during his first presidential term of 2000-2006, is chairman and main shareholder in ACS, the construction group, which has been hit hard by global recession and an over-stretched balance sheet.Though this week’s Madrid deals mark a spectacular opening to the summer transfer window, most experts expect clubs to be under pressure from their owners to spend cautiously.“The market is going to be very iffy,” said one football agent. “So much of the available money is at the top echelon. It is for United to splash the cash.”Simon Chadwick, director of Coventry University’s Centre for the International Business of Sport, said the Kaka and Ronaldo deals ­signalled both the “polarisation” of the transfer market and transfer fee inflation.“For the big clubs, like Manchester City and Chelsea, they can handle this, but I am fearful what this inflation will do for clubs further down,” he said.By moving from England to Spain, Ronaldo will escape the 50 per cent top rate tax coming into the UK next year and enter a tax regime where the so-called Beckham law enables foreign earners working in Spain to pay only 25 per cent in tax. Ronaldo could earn about €210,000 (£180,000, $300,000) a week at Real Madrid, according to some reports.
178;AON;AON Plc;2009-06-03T18:25:32Z;Man Utd agree new shirt deal with Aon;;Manchester United Football Club dismissed the problems afflicting the US insurance industry after announcing that Aon will replace bailed-out AIG as its shirt sponsor next year in a deal that could be worth £100m.The club have been searching for a new shirt sponsor since the start of the year after AIG said it was not in a position to renew its £20m-a-year contract after next season.No details of the terms were revealed but people close to the situation said Man Utd received a strong bid from a betting company, which enabled them to pitch three to four suitors against each other, said to include Standard Chartered.They added that the deal with Aon involves a basic £20m-a-year rights fee. With Aon expected to pay commissions to the club from the sale of insurance policies to the club’s fan base as well as match-related bonuses, Man Utd stand to make at least an extra £5m a year from the deal.David Gill, the club’s chief executive, said the deal “clearly strengthens our position as one of the biggest clubs in world football”.The four-year deal was sealed by Richard Arnold, commercial director, in the basement of the team’s Rome hotel on the eve of the Champions League final last week.AIG’s logo will continue to be on the club’s shirts for the 2009-10 season.Greg Case, president and chief executive of Aon, said: “We are delighted to keep this sponsorship within the industry. It sends a strong message around the world about the insurance industry.”He also said United’s presence in Asia was important, just as it was for AIG. “That was absolutely central to what led us to partner with Manchester United.”Several Premier League clubs are seeking new shirt sponsors, amid lowered expectations about the revenues these will generate.But most marketing experts expected Man Utd’s brand power, global fan base and trophy success to protect the club from a decline in shirt sponsorship valuations.
179;AON;AON Plc;2009-05-31T14:41:57Z;Fund closures fears increase;;Almost a third of trustees of UK occupational defined benefit pension schemes believe their fund will be wound up in the next ten years, a sharp rise from the 17 per cent who feared this outcome a year earlier, according to an annual survey by Aon Consulting.Amid an environment of tumbling asset values, rising longevity and widening deficits, 65 per cent of trustees predict wind-up in 20 years, as opposed to 48 per cent last year. More than a third say their scheme sponsor was considering closing its fund to further accrual.Two-thirds of the 117 trustees surveyed said they were considering a partial buy-out to reduce risk, for example by securing the liabilities of existing pensioners, while a fifth said they were considering a full buy-out.However, with the buy-out market stalling amid a dearth of capital, Yusuf Samad, investment principal at Aon, believed many trustees would be forced to look for an alternative.“We might be reaching a situation where demand for buy-out is strong but the supply is not there,” he said. “There will be other solutions, like the Babcock International solution, where people use longevity swaps [to hedge out risk].”Some two-thirds of trustees said they were reviewing their scheme’s investment strategy in the wake of the market turmoil, 45 per cent said they had increased their allocation to gilts as a result of the turbulence, while 60 per cent had tactically invested in UK corporate bonds to take advantage of extreme credit spreads.Around a quarter of trustees said they had taken advantage of depressed equity prices to increase their allocation, in spite of heightened stock market volatility. Mr Samad lauded these “brave” and “nimble” trustees, saying the move into equities was symptomatic of a changing governance regime in which more schemes are establishing investment committees to allow asset allocations to be altered more rapidly.The trend towards contingent assets – where ownership is assigned to trustees but the asset remains outside the pension fund – has expanded to a fifth of funds. This is up from one in ten in 2008, with a further 20 per cent considering the option.However, a third of trustees that had gone down this route reported problems, with the pledged assets failing to maintain sufficient value to cover the scheme’s liabilities.
180;AON;AON Plc;2009-05-29T15:56:55Z;Market rally shores up retirement income;;Rising stock markets are giving some investors near retirement age the chance to lock into recent gains – and avoid having to delay their pensions – say advisers.Many retirees have been opting to live on cash held in bank accounts, rather than using their pension funds to buy an annuity, in order to give their depleted funds time to recover. Others have been phasing the withdrawal of funds from their pensions, only moving a small amount at a time into drawdown and leaving the rest invested in the stock market.Now, this wait-and-see approach may finally be paying off. Assets in defined contribution company pension schemes have risen in value by 10 per cent over the past month, said Aon Consulting this week, driven by rallying equity markets.So financial advisers suggest that, with further stock market rises looking uncertain in the short term, this may be a good time for people to buy an annuity with their pension.“As we see markets recover somewhat, I think we’ll see people use that as an opportunity to lock into the higher value [of their pension],” says Lee Smythe at Killik Chartered Financial Planners.Investors who do not want to hand over their funds to an insurance company yet – preferring to keep them invested – can move some or all of their pension into income drawdown. This allows them to take out a 25 per cent tax- free lump sum to supplement income or pay off a mortgage. Or, investors can buy an annuity with the higher value of their fund, which could ensure them a higher income for life.However, the calculation is not so simple. Aon points out that defined contribution pension funds would still have to rise in value by a further 32 per cent to return to their September 2007 levels. And investors also have to contend with falling annuity rates, as the government’s policy of quantitative easing has reduced gilt yields, which are used to determine annuity payouts.Experts admit that anyone retiring right now is taking a bit of a gamble. “Members have got difficult decisions to make if they’re approaching retirement now,” says Helen Dowsey of Aon Consulting. “We don’t know how long the markets will take to recover and what will happen with annuity rates.”Rather than risk keeping a pension fund heavily exposed to share prices, Dowsey suggests that investors close to retirement should be protecting their pensions by moving from riskier assets, such as global equities, into fixed interest and cash.Often, a company scheme will carry out this asset re-allocation automatically for its members – a feature known as “lifestyling”.The benefits of this approach are clear. Aon calculates that a 65-year-old man, with a fund of £100,000 in September 2007 fully invested in equities, has seen his total pension rise by 3.7 per cent over the last month. He can now expect to receive £4,755 a year compared with £4,586 in March 2009. This is still 40 per cent less than in September 2007 when he could have received an annual pension of £7,536. A 65-year-old invested in cash and gilts would have experienced less volatility over the past 19 months, but would have still benefited, with a total annual pension now paying £7,377 compared with £7,536 in September 2007.This means, says Dowsey, that for the majority of people near retirement, equity market performance is largely irrelevant. If annuity rates worsen, the value of their fixed-interest investments should rise to compensate for that.But for those invested more heavily in equities, it may be better to buy an annuity sooner rather than later. “For a lot of people, it’s better to take the pension sooner rather than delay, unless you’re invested in a way that could benefit from a significant market rally and you’re happy taking that risk so close to your retirement date,” notes Smythe.
181;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:01:26+0000;Inflation-proofing;;"Pension advisers are warning that, with inflation likely to return in the next couple of years, investors should protect their pension income.This week, Aon Consulting warned that “looming” inflation was the main reason final salary pension schemes are increasing their deficits in spite of the stock market rises.“It’s hugely important to stress the relevance of inflation-proofing,” says Tom McPhail at Hargreaves Lansdown.But inflation-proofing can often reduce the initial income from an annuity by a third, although this rises over time.Aon calculates that a 65-year-old with a pension pot of £150,000 would receive a fixed annuity income of £10,776 a year. With inflation-proofing, this would fall to £6,814.McPhail believes that if inflation remains at 2 to 3 per cent, this drop in income could mean it is not worth buying inflation-
proofing. But inflation of 5-6 per cent could do heavy damage to a fixed income.He suggests that investors hedge their bets and buy both an inflation-linked and a level annuity.Lee Smythe at Killik suggests investment-linked annuities as another way
of protecting against inflation as they tend to pay a higher starting income than an inflation-linked annuity."

This was the Nasdaq’s eighth straight week of gains.But banking stocks finished on a low note after reports said the results of the government’s stress tests would be delayed from Monday until Thursday May 7 as banks debated the results and the government considered the best way to release the information.But Bill Webb, deputy chief investment officer of Gluskin Sheff, said: “I think investors are taking some comfort from the fact that the government has come up with a pragmatic process for the stress tests.”The general uncertainty weighed on confidence, which was also hit
by JPMorgan lowering its earnings forecasts for several institutions. Analysts warned: “We expect credit deterioration to persist, led by rising unemployment and continued sharp declines in home prices.”Bank of America closed down 2.6 per cent at $8.70 while Wells Fargo fell 2 per cent to $19.61.Morgan Stanley jumped, however, after John Mack, the chief executive, denied reports the company was looking to buy a regional bank. Its shares rose 9.2 per cent to $25.82.The markets took extra confidence from figures showing that the decline in manufacturing had slowed during April.The S&P 500 and the Dow both rose 0.5 per cent to 877.52 and 8,212.41, respectively. The Nasdaq gained 0.1 per cent to 1,719.20.Equities were also feeling the fall-out from several disappointing earnings announcements, especially in the financial sector.Mastercard became the second leading credit card company in two days to beat analysts’ estimates with its results. It saw some gains on Thursday after better-than- expected results at Visa lifted the sector as a whole but fell back on Friday as investors worried about falling revenues. Its shares lost 5.8 per cent to $172.90.MetLife, the biggest US life insurer, felt the effect of the recent market falls as performance in its investments dragged it to its first quarterly loss since 2001.Even excluding the investment performance, the company made a smaller profit than Wall Street had expected and its shares fell 7.7 per cent to $27.45.Hartford the insurer and financial services company, also suffered from the stock market crash as it was forced to pay out more on policies protecting customers from losses on investment accounts. This took the company to its third straight quarterly loss and its shares fell 7.9 per cent to $10.56.Aon, the insurance broker, was the third company in the sector to report falling revenues from investments. The company increased profits but fell short of analysts’ predictions and the shares lost 13.8 per cent to $36.38.Mr Webb said: “We have seen a lot of volatility this week but stocks have not moved outside of their recent range. It wouldn’t surprise me if the next few years are like this.”"
183;AON;AON Plc;2009-04-27T03:06:06Z;Crisis multiplies strains on company treasurers;;“How long do you think you will live compared to the average treasurer?” ran one of the questions in an online survey by Aon Consulting as company treasurers gathered last week for their annual conference in Manchester.Only half of respondents were confident enough to predict they would live longer than the average.It may have been a tongue-in-cheek exercise, but the response was a sign of how the economic crisis has turned the hitherto low-profile role of corporate treasurer into one of the most prominent – and stressful – in a company’s executive suite.It also highlights how important treasurers will be in determining which companies are most likely to survive the worst recession in living memory.Paul Ward, head of corporate coverage and advisory in the global banking and markets division of Royal Bank of Scotland, said treasurers were now “getting top billing in the decision hierarchy”.Treasurers are responsible for managing a company’s financial risk. That involves arranging loans from banks, raising money in the bond markets, managing a company’s cash and hedging a range of financial exposures in the derivatives markets.In good times, that job was relatively simple: funding was abundant and markets were stable.But in an environment of unprecedented market volatility, all-time low nominal interest rates, scarce bank funding and slumping demand for goods, the treasurer’s world has been turned upside down.Gerry Bacon, until recently group treasurer at Vodafone, says this is “a change forever”.“For the expert corporate financiers there really is a fantastic opportunity out there. For those who are not willing to evolve, survival could be quite difficult,” he told the conference, convened by the Association of Corporate Treasurers.Treasurers not only face higher borrowing costs and scarcity of funds but must now deal for the first time with the so-called counterparty risks associated with dealing with banks amid questions over the banks’ survival.Dev Sanyal, group treasurer at BP, the energy group, said: “Markets are moving faster and more unpredictably than before, which means treasurers have to look at wider sources of funding. They must be nimbler.”Volatility is also forcing them to consider greater use of derivatives products to help hedge risks, from foreign exchange exposure to the performance and funding needs of a company’s pension funds.That explains why many exhibitors at the ACT conference were companies specialising in offering treasurers online-based treasury management systems, such as Mytreasury.com, a recently formed company owned by Icap, the inter-dealer broker, specialising in giving treasurers web-based access to money market funds.Yet treasurers will be required to be conservative in other areas.Managing cash, for example, has shot to prominence as companies scramble to maximise the cash within their businesses as access to external sources of financing are either scarce or expensive – or both.A recent ACT survey showed that companies’ borrowing costs were three to five times higher than they were before the financial crisis.Jon Wood, head of balance sheet management for Europe at HSBC, said: “In the past, managing cash around the world was a ‘nice to have’. Now it is a ‘must have’. These techniques used to be specialist, now they are the ‘new normal’.”Mr Ward said the continued retrenchment of foreign banks from the UK meant that treasurers would have to be “conservative in refinancing assumptions”.He also warned treasurers against a “false sense of security” generated by relying on historical statistics and trends to chart a financing course for the future.Further uncertainty in the treasurer’s world was injected by last week’s Budget, which laid bare a dramatic expansion of public sector debt that could crimp the ability of treasurers to access the private capital markets, the ACT says.John Grout, policy and technical director, said the ACT would probably produce recommendations this summer on how to prepare for an economic upturn.He said one of the main uncertainties was how companies can adapt to an eventual economic recovery “that will take place against a background of shortage of capital”.Stuart Siddall, ACT chief executive, told the Financial Times in a video interview that the prospect of further uncertainties meant that treasurers probably needed to be “somewhat pessimistic” as they assessed the risks surrounding their companies.“Survival comes before prosperity,” he said.
184;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
185;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Pensions move seen as ‘attempted ransack’;;The move to cut the tax relief offered to those on top incomes was greeted with a blend of public indignation and relief that the moves were not as sweeping as many had feared.From April 2011, those on incomes of £150,000 ($216,907) to £180,000 will see their tax relief tapered from the current highest rate – now 50 per cent – down to the current basic tax rate of 20 per cent. That means that a contribution of £100 that would have yielded a tax rebate of £50 will now see that tax break cut to as low as £20.Marcus Hurd, head of corporate solutions at Aon, the benefits consultancy, described the move as an “attempted ransack” of pensions. “Today’s Budget announcement that the government is scrapping higher-rate income tax relief on pension contributions is likely to backfire and be ineffectual,” he said.Chancellor Alistair Darling framed the move in the context of fairness. “It is difficult to justify how a quarter of all the money the country spends on pensions tax relief goes, as now, to the top 1½ per cent of pension savers.”Indeed, the Pensions Policy Institute, using data from the 2004-05 tax year, calculated that in that period, roughly £5bn went on tax relief for higher earners, equal to about 60 per cent of all tax incentives to individuals to encourage pension savings.On Wednesday, pensions specialists at Standard Life estimated that about 8 per cent of those paying higher tax rates were affected, a total of about 291,000 people.The government promised a consultation on the measure before it was implemented, although it also put in place rules aimed at discouraging people from stuffing large contributions into their pension scheme to benefit from tax breaks now.Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, an employers’ group, on Wednesday expressed relief that the changes were not more sweeping.“We are pleased that rumours the government would abolish higher-rate tax relief – which is an important incentive to save for millions of people – were unfounded,” she said.Matt Wakefield, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that the measures may erode general confidence that the government intended to encourage savings for retirement because the tax treatment had been changed several times in recent years.Still, Raj Mody, pensions partner at PwC, said the measures may not be quite as sweeping as they appear, even for the well paid. For one thing, those on very high pay often receive a large percentage of it in the form of a bonus which is typically not pensionable in most employers’ schemes.However, it will force employers to consider very carefully the way they remunerate their highest-paid staff and encourage some to restructure their benefits offering, he said.
186;AON;AON Plc;2009-04-12T10:38:29Z;Trustees want more cash from employers;;More than three quarters of UK pension fund trustees are pushing for higher cash contributions from employers to meet funding levels as companies grapple with ballooning deficits, according to a survey of defined benefit schemes by Aon Consulting.“The problem is affordability. Higher cash contributions are not feasible for the majority of companies. Employers need cash to pay off their deficit,” said Anthony Light, head of covenant assessment at Aon.Aon’s UK arm said last week it would cut contributions to its workers’ defined contribution schemes by as much as 50 per cent.“A number of difficult negotiations are going on and employers say they cannot even afford contributions agreed last year for the schemes’ recovery plans. Trustees are in a dilemma because if they put too much pressure on the employer there is a risk of insolvency,” Mr Light added.Trustees were pessimistic about the future of their schemes with nearly a third believing they would be wound up in the next decade, compared to less than 20 per cent last year.
187;AON;AON Plc;2009-04-08T19:19:44Z;Aon’s pension decision will impact across corporate Britain;;"The congregation is bound to gossip about what the preacher gets up to at home. Aon Limited, UK arm of the big US insurance broker, employs the actuaries who advise companies how to reward staff.Its decision to cut payments to its own employees’ defined contribution retirement plans will thus have a disproportionately high impact.It is, however, far from heresy. It is consistent with Aon’s gradual pullback from more lavish pension benefits since 1999 and fits a wider trend. Final salary plans appear doomed; companies are cutting costs; DC plans could be next for the chop.Peter Harmer, Aon Limited’s chief executive, is right to say “not everyone values benefits in the way they value salaries”.But paying higher wages instead will not help people fund ever-longer retirements. Many would choose more take-home jam today over a long-range corporate promise of pension jam tomorrow. It may even be rational to do so and there are good free-market reasons for giving employees the right to deploy their income how they wish.But if defined benefit plans were wildly over-generous, defined contribution plans are too skimpy.John Ralfe, the pensions consultant, says such plans create the illusion a “magic money tree” will fund retirement. In fact, we all have to work longer and save more to get near that goal.The state looks ill-equipped to get that reality across to people. A national pension saving scheme could just create a series of underfunded, poorly invested personal pension plans.Mr Harmer has to give incentives to his workers sufficient to keep income up and costs down. He may achieve that even if he offers a less generous pension.But when even actuaries got their forecasts of the corporate cost of retirement wrong, why should we expect mere mortals to get the personal cost right and save enough to cover it?Aon has made its point: what was our employer’s problem is now ours.How to set the PaceDoesn’t Pace know there’s a recession on? The set-top box maker has just upgraded its forecasts for a second time.The exuberant stock market response looked insensitive given the economic gloom. If there is a sunny side to rising job insecurity and consumer penny-pinching, Pace is basking in it.It turns out consumers, having sworn off foreign holidays and fancy dinners, are refusing to skimp on home entertainment, even the high-end, high-definition services.But Pace isn’t just coasting on the back of a new technology that is taking off. It has earned its good fortune. At the start of the decade, it had a couple of big customers and more than 90 per cent of its business in the UK, which left it vulnerable when a debt crisis struck cable companies such as NTL.It now has some 100 customers all over the world, has made a major acquisition and is shipping far more boxes than it did just a couple of years ago.Getting from there (three warnings on sales in less than six months back in 2002) to here has meant pushing through changes. Some of these were strategic, like breaking into new markets.Others involved operational nitty-gritty, such as splitting up an engineering group into smaller units. The end result is a technology company that sounds startlingly confident.Pace has its challenges. It has to make sure it can provide novel solutions to pay-TV operators’ questions, such as how to get whizzy new services to consumers without having to rip up all the old wiring in apartment blocks. It has to make sure its supply chain is not knocked about, which could disrupt its production schedule.But what wouldn’t a housebuilder or a carmaker give to have only these worries?All present and incorrectHarriet Harman launched a probe into sex discrimination in financial services with a tabloid-titillating attack on male bosses’ use of lap-dancing clubs to entertain clients.But the populist broadside has yielded a more subtle first analysis of pay gaps. It poses some key questions, such as why does the pay gap get wider as men and women climb the career ladder.One possible answer is that men are doing more unpaid overtime than women. That gives them a chance to show off their skills (or just their “commitment”) to fellow, usually male, managers and win promotion.The good news is that where companies offer flexible working, both men and women are accepting it. But the difficult economy is bound to put staff on their guard about applying for such schemes. If there was already a culture of “presenteeism” in financial services, it must be rampant now.That makes it even more likely staff will be judged not on what they produce, but rather on how many hours they put in. And it’s obvious from this report who comes out worse if that flawed criterion is used to assess performance."
188;AON;AON Plc;2009-04-08T17:13:49Z;China Eastern seeks lift by dropping middle managers;;"Of all China’s struggling airlines, China Eastern is in the worst shape. It is widely expected to report multibillion-renminbi losses when it releases its annual report next week and without a Rmb7bn ($1.02bn) government bail-out it would probably have been forced to declare bankruptcy.The huge losses cannot be blamed on falling passenger numbers because, according to China’s leading aviation regulator, the amount of seats sold actually grew last year, albeit at a far slower pace than a year earlier.The main reason for such a dismal performance was China Eastern’s large poorly timed bets on oil derivatives at a time when oil prices were at record highs. The subsequent collapse in fuel costs has left China Eastern with a huge hole that only the government has been able to fill.Behind the scenes, a possible shake-up is in the works. In a new government regulation released last week that appears to apply only to China Eastern, female middle or senior managers must be younger than 52 years old and male managers must be under 57. The new rule means 160 of the airline’s 2,000 mid-level managers will be required to make way for younger staff, according to state media reports. Another staff review next year is expected to lead to the dismissal or transfer of many more current employees.Defining the problemThere’s a reason the congregation gossips about what the preacher gets up to at home. Aon Limited, the UK arm of the big US insurance broker, employs actuaries and consultants who advise companies how to reward their staff. So its decision to cut payments into its own employees’ defined contribution retirement plans will have a disproportionately high impact across corporate Britain.What Aon Limited is doing now is, however, far from heresy. It is entirely predictable – and consistent. Aon started pulling back from its defined benefit plan in 1999, earlier than most. Partly for that reason, its defined contribution plan – which plants the investment risk squarely on the employee – was relatively generous. The move also fits a wider trend. Defined benefit plans appear to be doomed and every employer is looking to cut costs, so payments into defined contribution plans could be next for the chop.You don’t need to be a behavioural economist to know many staff would choose more take-home pay now over a corporate promise (which may be unsustainable) of a pension much later. It may even be rational to do so, and there are good free-market reasons for giving employees the right to deploy their income how they wish. But if defined benefit plans were wildly over-generous, defined contribution plans will prove far too skimpy.The job of Peter Harmer – Aon Limited’s chief executive – is simple: provide rewards and incentives to his mobile, educated workforce sufficient to keep Aon’s income up and costs down. He and those who follow his lead may well be able to achieve that balance by offering less generous pension schemes. But given that actuaries like those at Aon got long-term forecasts of the corporate cost of retirement planning wrong, there is little hope of persuading ordinary staff to estimate the personal cost and save their salary increases for retirement rather than spend them. What was once Aon’s and other companies’ pension problem is increasingly ours.On the rocksPernod Ricard investors probably needed a shot of pastis Wednesday to digest the company’s unexpected decision to launch a €1bn ($1.33bn) rights issue to cut its debt.Over the past three decades, the family-controlled group has transformed itself into the world’s second-largest drinks conglomerate by a string of successive acquisition sprees – first with Irish Distillers; then part of Seagram; and later Allied Domecq in partnership with Fortune Brands. Last year, the company synonymous with France best-selling aniseed spirit capped its shopping binge by acquiring for €5.6bn Sweden’s Absolut Vodka. Its rivals all claimed it had overpaid. At the time, the criticism seemed as much as anything an expression of sour grapes. Unfortunately for Pernod Ricard, the world subsequently changed and in retrospect the Swedish acquisition clearly became harder to swallow.The French group originally planned to reduce its debt by offloading some assets such as two cognac brands, a vodka brand and now its Wild Turkey bourbon business to Italy’s Campari, as well as through earnings growth. That was obviously no longer sufficient, so it has decided to launch a rights issue that will be partially taken up by the family and fully by the company’s second-largest shareholder, Albert Frère’s Groupe Bruxelles Lambert.world.view@ft.com"
189;AON;AON Plc;2009-04-07T22:33:01Z;Aon seen as heralding pension plans future;;A decade ago, when employers began struggling with the costs of their old-fashioned final salary schemes, pension advisers offered a simple alternative – the defined contribution (DC) pension.Defined benefit (DB), or final salary, schemes promise workers a percentage of pay for as long as they live in retirement, with the investment risk resting with the company. DC schemes, though typically part-funded by companies, shift investment risk to workers.But Tuesday’s pension revamp by Aon – an insurance broker that ironically also owns a consultancy advising on pension matters – may well signal a new move for employers to ease themselves out of the retirement business much more fully. Aon plans to cut its payments to its DC scheme by up to half.When employers were generous in their DC schemes, their motives were not entirely selfless, actuaries note. Indeed, pension benefits have long been used for “workforce management”, a euphemism for encouraging those near retirement to go.DC pensions that are insufficiently generous are problematic, says David Robins, a consultant at actuaries Watson Wyatt. “You don’t want an unhappy workforce of people at or near retirement who are grumpy because they can’t afford to retire.”The history of Aon’s approach to pensions illustrates the evolution of company retirement provision more broadly.The company’s DC scheme was opened in 1999 when Aon first closed its final salary scheme to new members, a trend that snowballed in later years. It closed that DB scheme to future accruals of benefits by existing workers in 2007 and moved all staff to its DC provision.One element of that provision was a structure of age-related company contribution rates designed to help those close to retirement to earn a larger pension pot. While those in their 20s only received a 6 per cent contribution rate from the company, those in their 30s could expect a contribution of 8 per cent of pay and those in their 40s and 50s attracted rates of 10 and 12 per cent respectively.Now, older workers wanting higher contributions will have to dig much more deeply into their own pockets to attract it, a measure which actuaries note, amounts to a cut in take-home pay.“The original DC plans were set up to mirror the benefits of the old defined benefit plans,” says Alex Waite, partner at actuarial consultants Lane Clark & Peacock. To earn enough for a pension pot equal to, say, two-thirds of pay at retirement, contributions had to be much higher than the standard 3 per cent of pay that characterised many extant DC schemes.Paul Macro, a partner specialising in DC schemes at consultants Watson Wyatt, says age-related contributions can make such plans nearly as expensive, although not as risky, as DB schemes. “If company contributions are 10 per cent, that’s about two-thirds the DB cost,” he says.Mr Macro says that although he does not expect to see it on a mass scale, employers faced with having to contribute to pensions for nearly all their workers when automatic enrolment in schemes becomes mandatory in 2012 may well shift to the minimum required contribution rate of 3 per cent.Such a rate is likely to produce a pension pot at retirement of only about 16 per cent of the salary it is replacing.
190;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Aon UK cuts pension payments;;The British arm of one of the world’s biggest insurance brokers is cutting its contributions to its workers’ pensions by up to half in a move likely to be followed by other companies seeking to control costs.Aon said it believed it was the first large company in the UK to cut payments to its workers’ defined contribution schemes as it was determined to remain “ahead of the curve” in remaining competitive.Peter Harmer, chief executive, acknowledged that some employees would see the change as a salary cut but said it was preferable to other cost-reduction measures, such as shorter work weeks or unpaid sabbaticals.Employees will have to pay up to three times current contributions to keep Aon’s matching payments at existing levels.“For some staff, there will be less take-home pay,” Mr Harmer said.“But this gives us more compensation to pay for performance. It is clear that not everyone values benefits in the way they value salaries,” he said.Pensions experts said the move by Aon, which employs 5,000 people in the UK, could encourage other employers to follow suit. Spiralling pension costs are rising to the top of corporate agendas as employers struggle to cope with the deepening recession.David Yeandle, head of employment policy at the Engineering Employers Federation, whose members are struggling with the legacy of older final-salary pension schemes, said: “There is a herd instinct as far as pensions occurs. If one or two big companies do it, then others will do it too.”Aon’s move comes as employers around the country struggle to contain the costs of their final-salary pension schemes, which have been savaged by plunging stock markets, falling interest rates, and increasing life expectancy for older workers.Defined contribution pensions, in which the employee bears all the investment risk, have been seen by companies as a less-risky, lower-cost alternative. The pension pot at retirement depends on the size of contributions and investment returnsSo far, companies have been reluctant to cut pension benefits in a way that clearly translates into a pay cut.Alex Waite, partner at actuarial consultants Lane Clark & Peacock, said cutting defined contribution pensions was hard to sell to workers because employees could easily track payments into their schemes. “It is clearly a reduction of pay,” he said.However, such moves may become easier after 2012 when new rules requiring employers to contribute at least 3 per cent of pay to pensions for all workers who do not opt out of them take effect, Mr Waite said. Aon’s scheme required employees of all ages to contribute 2 per cent of pay. In return, the company would contribute between 6 per cent and 12 per cent of pay, rising in line with age.Its new arrangements will cap the company contribution at 6 per cent of pay for workers who want to go on saving at the current rate.However, workers who are aged 50 and older who are willing to put up to 8 per cent of their pay into their pension can still attract a company contribution of 12 per cent.Mr Harmer said that with its previous structure, Aon did not believe it was getting the best value for money out of its scheme.Aon Limited is a subsidiary of the US-based Aon.

And Royal Liver Group, founded in 1850, still occupies the renowned Royal Liver Building on the Mersey waterfront.But most big companies have shut their Liverpool operations to concentrate regional activity in Manchester, its bigger rival just 30 miles away.Mark Chadwick worked for Aon Insurance in the City of London before returning home to become chief executive of Professional Liverpool, the lobby group for local white-collar companies. He recalls Aon closing its office in Liverpool to consolidate its regional presence in Manchester, but now detects a Merseyside resurgence.“What is driving the market are boutiques providing insurance solutions in innovative and creative ways. Liverpool’s resurgence as a city is based on its creative edge and insurance reflects that,” he said.Some local asset managers are also looking at providing insurance solutions.O’Connor’s, a law firm set up five years ago, offers international expertise to the sector.

clients.Mr O’Connor said: “It became clear to me that there was an opportunity to help companies get more from their insurance.” Typically, they would regard it as a necessary cost, he said, but it could be looked at as an opportunity.“We do not think companies are getting a fair share or a reward. If you sell cars you are introducing business to an insurer. You should . . . take a share in the profits of underwriting.”O’Connor’s knows the market well enough to know how much brokers and insurers are making, or to go direct to reinsurers. “It is linked to how insurance works and insurance regulation works,” said Mr O’Connor.Much of it is also about tax. Mr O’Connor said it could make sense to set up captive insurers to hold the risk in offshore structures, typically in the Channel Islands or Isle of Man, to reduce tax burdens on policies.Mr Wallis said the recession was helping. “Revenues have grown strongly, particularly in the last 12-18 months because people are looking for cost savings. We have seen our revenue grow by around 20-25 per cent a year,” he said.The firm also advises on corporate finance, where business has dropped.Manchester is not only home to regional headquarters but also to the Co-operative Group, which has about 3 per cent of the UK market, and Swinton, the largest chain of brokers.The Co-op, the world’s largest mutual, offers most household insurance, from motors to pets. James Hillon, head of home insurance at the Co-op, said the group had been slow to react to the rise of direct insurers such as Direct Line and the use of the internet to compare or buy policies.“Four years ago we were 100 per cent reliant on field agents doing home sales,” he said. “Customer habits changed and we did not change fast enough. Now we have field agents, call centres, brokers, bank branches and online sales.”Independent consumer surveys indicated that the modernisation had not come at the expense of customer service, he said.The Co-operative Insurance Society has £400m gross written premium, 900,000 home and 700,000 motor policy holders. It has just launched policies for small and medium-sized businesses, seeking to increase its commercial activity. However, group profits fell last year because of investment losses.Back in Liverpool, Royal Liver has also gone through traumatic times but its business is stabilising. In December 2007, the latest period for which figures are available, it had 1.7m members with 3.2m policies covering life and critical illness, and £3.5bn of assets under management. The first half of 2008 saw it produce its first profit, £2.4m, in five years. The group has cut its annual cost base by a third in that time, from £127m to £81m, and launched new investment products. The company now has 800 employees in the UK, many in Liverpool.Steve Burnett, chief executive, said the recession had affected its operations in the UK and Ireland: “What was a tough job to manage our legacy cost base whilst growing our new businesses, has got a whole lot tougher.”"
192;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Final salary pensions in £219bn deficit;;Savers should consider taking advice on transferring out of their final salary pension schemes, say experts, as concerns over the solvency of employers rise.Final salary schemes now have record levels of underfunding following heavy stock market falls, new research revealed this week. The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) said final salary schemes in the private sector had a deficit of £219bn at the end of February, up from £191bn the previous month.But in spite of advice from financial advisers that people should consider leaving a final salary scheme if they are worried about the solvency of their employer, fewer people are requesting transfer values.Aon Consulting said there had been a 7 per cent fall over the past year in people requesting a transfer value – the lump sum offered in return for leaving the scheme and giving up pension benefits.Colin Hamilton, a commercial director at Aon, said this was probably because fewer people were moving jobs at present. He also said there had been a one-third increase in people asking for retirement quotes in the past year, reflecting rising uncertainty about retirement plans.The PPF only pays a maximum of £27,771 a year in pension income to people whose employer goes bust.John Ball, head of UK pensions at Watson Wyatt, advised that those considering transferring out of a final salary scheme should act soon, as pension scheme trustees might start reducing transfer values to protect those remaining in the fund.
193;AON;AON Plc;2009-03-01T09:33:50Z;UK need for pension buy-out still strong;;As the gap between pension fund assets and liabilities increases, a growing number of sponsors are looking to reduce their exposure to expensive defined benefit schemes and hand over management to an insurer through a buy-out.The UK buy-out market hit a record £8bn (€9bn, $11bn) last year compared to less than £3bn in 2007, according to a recent report by Aon, risk management consultants. Among the transactions last year was the first £1bn deal – struck by Prudential to insure pensioner liabilities for Cable & Wireless, followed by a similar size buy-out of Thorn’s pension scheme by Pension Insurance Corporation.Interest has in part been driven by growing trustee awareness of risk management and also by new providers entering the market in the past few years to swell the ranks of earlier players such as Legal & General and Prudential.“In the past few years it has been a good time for a company to do a buy-out as the market is more competitive,” says John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant. In the past 12 months, the number of providers securing business has almost doubled to 11, according to Aon.However, last year’s rapid growth is not forecast to continue. “We expect growth to slow in 2009 but the longer term outlook remains positive, provided pricing remains attractive, as defined benefit pension schemes are increasingly seen as a legacy issue by sponsors who will want to remove them from the balance sheet once it becomes affordable [to do so],” says Paul Belok, principal and actuary at Aon.But Mark Wood, chief executive of Paternoster, a buy-out specialist, is not expecting deals to slow. “We expect to see a number of large transactions from big pension funds taking place in 2009, from about £50m to £500m.”He believes there will be a mix of buy-outs and buy-ins with a shift “to more buy-ins by the end of the year as they are more affordable”.Trustees choosing a buy-in strategy invest in an annuity to cover a proportion of liabilities, typically for pensions in payment, with the aim of better matching assets and liabilities. The costs involved are less than those for a buy-out but the scheme and the trustees remain responsible for paying benefits.On the buy-in front, Chris Ford, head of investment strategy at consultants Watson Wyatt, agrees with Mr Wood. “Some pension funds that had been mulling a buy-out last year now find they can no longer afford it as their asset value has fallen. Larger pension funds were more likely last year to have been considering a partial buy-in as part of a wider risk management strategy. And I expect this to continue,” he says.In a full buy-out, a pension scheme transfers its assets and liabilities to an insurer, which means the trustees and sponsor no longer have responsibility for providing benefits to scheme members.While sponsors and trustees see the appeal of transferring the scheme’s risk and management the costs of the annuity are high and an employer must first ensure the scheme is well funded or make a one-off contribution – or premium – to the scheme.When opting for a buy-in, trustees need to look at how much risk is reduced by buying an annuity, and compare this against alternative risk management strategies, such as holding more matching bonds, diversifying asset portfolios, purchasing equity options or using mortality swaps, says Mr Ford.Among the attractions of buy-outs and buy-ins is the perception of greater security and simplicity although trustees are beginning to understand annuities can also carry risk, particularly as the value of bonds has fallen. Once an annuity is in place trustees can give their attention to managing other parts of the scheme.Some pension funds see the lack of flexibility of a buy-out as a disadvantage as once assets are transferred it is difficult to reverse an annuity contract.But Mr Ralfe believes taking a buy-out or buy-in route can only be advantageous to the employer, trustees and scheme members. “They allow a pension scheme to get rid of longevity and investment risk that trustees have little or no expertise in managing,” he says.Pension experts maintain the buy-in approach can also be a first step to a full buy-out. Once the purchase of an annuity has been taken for part of the pension plan, trustees may decide the whole scheme should be protected.At Legal & General, Hugo James, sales development director for bulk purchase annuities, says, “Buy-in with a view to buy-out is the best strategy. But different funds have different needs and there is not a right or wrong answer.”Trustees considering a buy-out should look at several insurers, assess them carefully and work at getting a good price without jeopardising financial security, say consultants. They also recommend thorough due diligence before choosing an insurer.So just how safe are buy-outs for scheme members? “There is no such thing as absolute safety. For many members a buy-out is likely to be more secure than relying on the company sponsoring the scheme, but not entirely risk free,” says Mr Ford.The government is concerned about the scope for abuse if a company is separated from its pension fund and the insurer is unable to cover the value of the assets. But some reassurance is provided because FSA-regulated insurers have to hold capital reserves to cover the value of the pension scheme assets.Another cause for concern is the possibility of an insurer going bust. But if the annuity is appropriately structured then it should be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, says Watson Wyatt. Trustees should also be vigilant in protecting members’ interests in the event of an insurer selling the buy-out business.“All annuity negotiations are unique and one of the main drivers of price is the security provided to support the annuity. It is easy to buy an annuity at a cheap price without realising it is because it is not secure,” says Mr Ford.
194;AON;AON Plc;2009-02-27T18:57:41Z;Companies mull benefits of offering Sipps to their employees;;An increasing number of companies are considering offering their employees self- invested personal pensions (Sipps), which provide savers with a wide range of investment choices.But not all advisers are convinced that Sipps are better for workers than ordinary money purchase pension schemes.At present, only around 7 per cent of businesses offer a group Sipp to their employees, but many more are now consulting accountancy firms to assess the costs of offering this benefit.One in four businesses in the UK is already considering offering its employees a Sipp as their main pension, according to a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accountants.As well as allowing employees to use their pension to invest in their employer’s shares, group corporate Sipps can offer savers more flexibility than traditional defined contribution (DC) schemes.PwC says it is advising a number of FTSE 100 companies and other accountancy groups agree that Sipps could provide a better incentive for employees to save more towards retirement than DC schemes.DC pensions have taken over from final salary schemes as the retirement benefit offered to most employees in the UK. In these, companies make a contribution towards their workers’ retirement savings. These schemes are less expensive to run as they do not guarantee a set income for retirees. Instead, the money is invested and used to provide a retirement income.But massive falls in global stock markets have hit pension values and dented confidence in the merits of saving for retirement.On average, workers have lost more than a third of the value of their DC pensions in the last year, according to Aon Consulting.Since the credit crunch took hold in September 2007, £140bn has been wiped from DC pension schemes.People with decades to go before retirement have time to recoup these losses, but those who are close to retirement may struggle to rebuild their funds.Typically, a 60-year-old paying 10 per cent of his £25,000 annual salary has seen his total projected pension fall by 36 per cent, according to Aon, meaning he can now expect to receive £10,900 annually for the rest of his life, compared with the £17,100 that was forecast in September 2007. Marc Hommel, UK pensions leader at PwC, says the crisis has led employees to accept the need to take responsibility for their retirement savings. He believes scheme holders want their employers to give them access to more flexible savings opportunities.“There is no point in a business spending large amounts on generous pension arrangements that are undervalued by employees,” he says. “We are seeing more imagination in the type of pension arrangements being offered and the vehicles being used to deliver these.”However, Jason Butler at Bloomsbury Financial Planning says that dividing DC schemes and Sipps on the grounds of choice is not entirely fair.Some DC schemes have a wide choice of investment funds, including low-cost index funds and specially negotiated terms with external managers, he argues. In many cases, there is a choice of a “lifestyle” fund selection, which starts off with a higher allocation to risky assets, gradually moving to lower-risk funds as members near retirement.By contrast, some group Sipps have a limited core range of funds, with the option to invest in more only provided for an additional cost. Sipps that offer investors the widest possible range of asset classes tend to be limited to savers with large funds.“Full Sipps are rarely good news for those with funds below £150,000,” says Butler. “The reality is that most employees don’t need a Sipp if the pension provided by the employer has a wide range of low-cost index funds.”In its annual survey, Watson Wyatt, the investment consultant, found that the average contributions made to DC schemes by both employer and employee had risen in the last year to 15.3 per cent of salary, from 14.7 per cent. This is higher than the 8 per cent contribution that will be required for all workers from 2012, when they will be automatically enrolled in a scheme.Although huge falls in fund values over the past year will knock employees’ confidence in DC pensions, Watson Wyatt believes the crisis will lead to stronger and more focused saving options.Savers interested in calculating the value of their pensions can use www.comparemypension.com, set up by Douglas Baillie, the financial adviser.

195;AON;AON Plc;2009-02-19T12:23:55Z;Pension values fall by a quarter;;People saving into a workplace pension have seen the value of their assets fall by a quarter since the start of the credit crunch.Defined contribution schemes have fallen by £140bn since September 2007, new figures from Aon Consulting show. They now have a value of just £410bn, as of the end of January.Older workers have been hit harder by the falls, as their pensions have less time to recover before they start drawing an income from them.Those approaching retirement and aged 55-65 will see a 30 to 36 per cent drop in their pension.Younger workers between 40-55 will see slightly less of an impact, with a drop of between 20 and 30 per cent, while workers under 40 will see a drop of 0 to 20 per cent.Aon calculates that a 60 year old paying 10 per cent of a £25,000 salary into a defined contribution scheme planning to retire at 65 will only get an annual salary for life of £10,900, compared to £17,100 forecast in September 2007.Defined contribution pension schemes have gradually been replacing defined benefit – also known as final salary – pension schemes in recent years.Defined contribution schemes often use what is known as ‘lifestyling’, whereby members are switched out of equities and into supposedly safer bonds and cash as they approach retirement.Over 3.7m UK workers pay into a defined contribution pension scheme each month, according to Aon.Where final salary schemes pay a fixed amount to people when they retire, defined contribution schemes offer no guarantees and are more at the mercy of stockmarket falls.But the cost of providing a guaranteed pension has taken a heavy toll on final salary schemes and most are now in deficit.Although 2.7m people still save into a final salary pension, the National Association of Pension Funds has warned that a quarter of these schemes are likely to close to existing members over the next five years.
196;AON;AON Plc;2009-02-09T00:02:37Z;Travel ban warning for businesses;;Companies are cutting back sharply on the amount they spend on travel, according to three new surveys – in spite of warnings that travel bans in the manufacturing industry may be hampering British exports.One in five businesses plans to implement an outright ban on their employees travelling abroad, according to research carried out by the Institute of Travel Management (ITM).Meanwhile, 47 per cent of executives will be taking fewer trips in the next 12 months, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, while 38 per cent of business travel buyers told the Business Travel Show that they would have less to spend this year.The findings come as professionals in the export industry warn that travel bans could be stopping British manufacturers from setting up contracts to sell their goods overseas.“Combined with other problems facing exporters, I hear that senior exporters have got a travel freeze on and this is one of the reasons exports are not picking up as the pound falls in value,” said Susan Ross, director of Aon Trade Credit.“Businesses are suffering a lack of sales, a lack of credit, increased bad debts, etc., domestically and are needing to concentrate on managing those businesses. Since winning export sales requires more investment, this is likely to be under pressure,” she said.Hugh Bailey, director of the British Exporters Association, also said travel bans appeared to be reducing companies’ exports, although a global decline in demand was a more serious issue.The surveys’ figures are the latest sign of businesses aggressively cutting costs to cope with the recession and they are bad news for the business travel sector.Forty seven per cent of those surveyed by the ITM said they were negative about the future of the global business travel sector in the next one to two years.“Our clients are still travelling but nearly all of them are looking to save money,” said David Radcliffe, chief executive of business travel company Hogg Robinson.“There are some who are going to the extreme and saying that any travel has to be signed off by a board director, others who are saying that for travel above a certain cost,” he said.Several “business-class only” airlines have gone bust in the last couple of years, including Silverjet and Eos, the US carrier.But the problems facing the executive travel industry have provided a fillip for other industries.Regus, which rents out office space, said last week that video conference bookings have risen from 1,300 to 2,500 a month since last summer, as high oil prices and the subsequent economic downturn have forced businesses to tighten their belts.
197;AON;AON Plc;2009-02-08T17:16:58Z;Pension buy-outs slip back on volumes;;"The UK pensions buy-out industry posted record figures in 2008 but a drop in volumes in the last three months of the year suggests slower growth in 2009.“What we won’t see is a nice smooth trend upwards,” said Paul Belok, principal and actuary at Aon Consulting, which has compiled a report on the bulk annuity market.The market expanded almost threefold last year, growing to £8.2bn (€9.4bn, $12bn) from £2.8bn in 2007.“The big driver for growth was pensioner buy-ins, whereby a bulk annuity policy is secured for current pensioners and then held by the scheme as an investment – about two-thirds of the cases over £100m were on this basis,” said Mr Belok.September’s default by Lehman Brothers, however, dampened the exuberance of the market because of the impact on the corporate bond market.Lack of liquidity and pricing difficulties made life hard for pension insurers that rely on
this asset class to back annuities.Business in the fourth quarter dropped in value to £1.8bn from £2.1bn the previous quarter, with the number of cases falling to 43 from 59.“You can see this feast/famine cycle emerging,” said Mr Belok.He added that changing numbers of providers also had an impact on the market: last year, the number of providers almost doubled to 11, despite the disappearance of Synesis Life, which ceased to operate.“You do get these variations in competitiveness, which is what makes it such an interesting and unpredictable market,” he said.Legal & General jumped to top spot in 2008, while erstwhile market leader Paternoster slipped to fourth.Newcomer Pension Insurance Corporation came straight in at second place in its first year in the market."
198;AON;AON Plc;2009-01-15T01:37:03Z;Supply lines pose risks for some UK companies;;Businesses are putting their own survival at risk by not understanding their supply lines properly, experts warn.Professionals in risk management have said that unless businesses take time to understand which parts of their supply chains are at risk of collapsing, they might find themselves struggling to cope with unforeseen and uninsured losses.Supply chain problems have exacerbated the downfall of several UK companies recently including Zavvi, which went into administration soon after the collapse of its main supplier, EUK, which was part of the Woolworths group.John Merkovsky, managing director at Marsh Risk consulting said: “With an increasing number of insolvencies, the greatest risk facing many companies is a lack of understanding of the critical weaknesses of their supply chain.”Mr Merkovsky warned that companies fail to understand how problems further up supply chains might affect their own businesses. “Companies don’t factor the creditworthiness of their trading partners and those trading partners’ partners. These things could be four or five steps removed from what they know.”Alex Hindson, Head of Enterprise Risk Management at Aon Global Risk Consulting, said that even if a supplier was relatively minor, its collapse could pose major problems for purchasers.“One company we saw recently was purchasing a small number of oil drums from one firm and storing them in one place. Although they weren’t spending much on those drums, they didn’t realise that supplier’s failure would have caused them real survival problems.”Mr Hindson said companies should keep a better watch on the health of both suppliers and purchasers.The warnings come as details emerge about the government’s plan to protect supply lines by bolstering the credit insurance market. Under the plan, the government will provide “top-up” insurance to suppliers against the risk of their purchasers failing to supplement the cover provided by commercial credit insurers.But Daniel Hoffman, chief economist at Zurich Financial Services, said government should have no role in offering a service that is already provided by private enterprises. “There are still circuit breakers in the system to prevent problems with supply chains affecting the whole economy,” he said. “So there’s absolutely no reason for government to step in.”The government also faces renewed calls to reform the laws surrounding “pre-pack” administrations.These involve a buyer being lined up for a company before it is taken into administration. The company then passes straight from the administrator to the buyer, minimising loss of money and jobs, but leaving unsecured creditors with no way to reclaim their debts.

200;AON;AON Plc;2009-01-08T20:45:31Z;Insurers face bribery crackdown after £5.25m Aon fine;;The UK insurance industry faces a crackdown on bribery overseas after the financial watchdog imposed a £5.25m fine on the UK broking arm of Aon, the US insurance broker, over suspected corruption in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.The Financial Services Authority said its first completed bribery case was part of a wider inquiry into whether companies in the sector had tough enough controls to prevent corruption.Lawyers said the fine showed how British authorities under heavy international pressure to tackle corporate corruption were using US-style settlements to punish companies without launching expensive and time-consuming prosecutions.Ben Summers, partner at Peters & Peters, said: “It’s proof that bribery is near the top of the agenda and there is a concerted effort to follow the US lead.”The FSA urged companies to look at the lessons of the action against Aon. The watchdog said: “We expect people to sit up and take notice of this. It sends out the message to the commercial insurance industry, as well as the finance industry in general.”The FSA said Aon’s “weak control environment” resulted in it making suspect payments of $7m to businesses and individuals in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Burma, Indonesia and Vietnam. The fine would have been £7.5m but was cut by 30 per cent because the company co-operated with the investigation and agreed to settle early.Aon said it had overhauled its systems, introducing measures such as refusing to do business with parties other than its clients in countries where there are big corruption problems.Peter Harmer, chief executive of Aon’s UK insurance broking arm, said the company regretted the shortcomings but was pleased its efforts to remedy them were described by the FSA as “a model of best practice”.The FSA’s action comes after the Serious Fraud Office announced a landmark deal in October, under which Balfour Beatty, the construction company, agreed to pay £2.25m over suspected bribery in its work on a $130m (£85m) project in Egypt.
201;AON;AON Plc;2008-12-30T23:41:11Z;Auditors urge rethink on pension calculations;;"Auditors are pressing companies to reconsider how they calculate their pension liabilities and urging them to use formulas that could give rise to much larger reported deficits than would be the case if they stayed with the current approach.Market volatility has raised questions over the so-called “discount rate” used to calculate the present-day value of a fund’s future liabilities.The lower the rate used, the higher the present liabilities will be. The rates currently used by companies to calculate those liabilities are roughly equivalent to those on less risky high-grade corporate bonds.However, these have soared amid the market turmoil, sharply shrinking reported fund deficits. Some schemes have actually reported a surplus even as the values of the stocks they hold have plunged.Two recent reports illustrate the effect that changing the discount rate can have on scheme finances. Aon, an actuarial consultant, calculated this week that the 200 largest private employers’ schemes had actually seen funding improve over 2008, ending the year with an aggregate surplus of £3bn due to rising bond yields.But Deloitte, using discount rates about one-half to one full percentage point above gilt yields, calculates FTSE 100 companies ended the year with a £130bn deficit.Clive Fortes, head of corporate consulting at Hymans Robertson, an actuarial practice, said there were particular questions over the Iboxx AA 15-year-plus bond index, a traditional benchmark used by pension funds. Until recently, financial services companies constituted nearly two-thirds of it.“You will see a lot more dispersion [among discount rates] this year,” Mr Fortes said.“This is not going to help people compare companies against each other,” said Alex Burton, an actuary at KPMG. “Where Iboxx was appropriate in the past, it isn’t necessarily so in current market conditions.”International accounting standards stipulate the discount rate must be equivalent to corporate bonds assumed to be rated AA or better. In theory that could include bonds whose yields have shot up.“The one thing we know from talking to our big corporate clients is that the majority of them will not use the approach to valuing pensions that they did last year,” said David Robbins, pensions partner at Deloitte. “And it’s not just the UK; this is a global accounting standard.”"
202;AON;AON Plc;2008-12-08T15:50:16Z;Insead establishes chair in risk;;In the light of the current financial crisis business schools around the world are showing a renewed interest in the management of risk. Insead, for example, has teamed up with the Aon Corporation, the world’s leading provider of risk management and consulting services, to create the Aon Dirk Verbeek Chair in International Risk and Strategic Management, which will focus on the importance of risk in strategic decision making.Javier Gimeno, professor of strategy at Insead, will be the first professor to hold the chair. His research interests centre on competitive strategy and entrepreneurship. “There is today a unique opportunity to integrate the insights of strategic management and risk management,” says Prof Gimeno. “Strategy involves making decisions under uncertainty and competitive pressures, and risk management techniques can help us to develop more robust and flexible strategies and to avoid failures.”The Insead chair is endowed in honour of Dick Verbeek, head of Aon’s European operations in Europe for almost 20 years and an Insead MBA (1976). He said he was honoured by the endowment: “The current turmoil in financial markets demonstrates the pressing need to incorporate leading edge risk thinking into strategic decision-making. As a former student I am delighted and honoured that Aon has chosen to fund research at Insead in this vital area.”www.insead.edu
203;AON;AON Plc;2008-12-05T18:49:10Z;No credit insurance support;;The government has rejected calls to help the beleaguered trade credit insurance industry, according to a leaked letter from Lord Myners, financial services secretary.The letter comes as suppliers to Taylor Wimpey are unable to find credit cover because insurers regard the housebuilder as a bad risk.People familiar with the industry say credit insurers are not writing any new policies for suppliers against the risk of one of the UK’s largest housebuilders going bust and not paying its bills. This means Taylor Wimpey will have to pay for supplies up front unless suppliers are willing to take the risk of trading uninsured.A similar situation was one of the elements in the demise of the retailer Woolworths. Taylor Wimpey refused to confirm or deny whether their suppliers were able to find cover.The company’s woes are symptomatic of problems being suffered across the construction sector. One broker said: “It’s virtually impossible to get new cover on any company in the construction sector at the moment.”Despite similar problems being suffered across many sectors, the government appears to have ruled out taking out action to bolster the industry and keep trade moving.Lord Myners has written to Austin Mitchell, a Labour MP, ruling out such action, despite being in the middle of talks with the leading credit insurers and the Association of British Insurers.Lord Myners writes that with the measures announced in this month’s pre-Budget report, the government is already “taking all necessary action in this regard”.He writes: “The penetration rate is only about 20 per cent and even for those who do buy the product, only part of the risk is covered.”The ABI has welcomed the government’s refusal. Mr Mitchell, Lord Myners and the Treasury all failed to return messages left for them to comment.
204;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;UK: Floods, fire and theft rank with ill-advised cost-cutting;;As the economic outlook for the UK becomes more gloomy, so the risks that businesses face multiply.Peter Jackson, sales and marketing director for Aon Risk Services in the UK, says that when times are tougher, the worst is more likely to happen.He urges companies to think about the “what if, nightmare sceniaros” because in an economic downturn “there is more likelihood of these things happening”.According to Lis Gibson, insurance partner at Deloitte, when economic hardship increases, so the risk of theft rises. This is exacerbated by the fact that in a harsher economic climate, businesses can find it difficult to shift stock, and therefore may have bigger quantities of goods in their warehouses. Similarly, if there is a fire, more stock may be destroyed.Ms Gibson says companies should check on security arrangements for protecting valuable stock. “You may not want to cut back on that at the moment,” she says.Businesses should also ensure they have adequate insurance protection against fire and theft.Andrew Torrance, chief executive of Allianz UK, says companies should not be cutting back on insurance spend in the current climate.“It is at just this time in the market that you really need the cushion that insurance can provide if some unexpected event happens,” he says.Insurers also need to be vigilant. Ms Gibson says the risk of fraud increases when economic conditions become more difficult, and companies should also beware of this.“A lot of businesses are trading in some way electronically, so there is just going to be more fraud,” she says.Another risk in a more difficult climate is that spending on maintaining plant and equipment is cut back. Companies may carry out maintenance less frequently, equipment may be replaced less regularly, or plant may be repaired rather than replaced.Ms Gibson says this pattern is particularly worrying given the Corporate Manslaughter Act, which became law in April.“[Directors] need to be much more careful about that in this economic downturn. If someone were to die as a result of cost-cutting [leading to] an avoidable accident, then they have a very great personal risk, as directors now, which they did not have before,” she says.She urges companies to address this risk by having a clear idea of the minimum level of maintenance spend they can live with rather than “just incrementally cutting and seeing what goes wrong”.John Scott, head of risk insight at Zurich Financial Services UK, says that when companies cut costs “management often take their eye off the ball on the simple, really key stuff around health and safety. We often see an increased trend of workplace injuries. That is something that is a consequence of tightening belts. Well-managed companies try to do both. They try to cut back but without jeopardising staff safety.”Mr Torrance also points out that in tougher times, companies face an increased risk of not being paid by the customers with whom they trade.“That needs to be kept under very careful review,” he says. Companies need to monitor the creditworthiness of parties with whom they trade and keep a close eye on payments. Companies could also buy insurance that protects against default, he adds.Companies could also be tempted to cut back on their risk management spending to save costs.Research commissioned by FM Global, an insurer of commercial and industrial property, suggests that risk management is not an area where costs should be cut.Some 71 per cent of UK investment analysts it polled believed that companies should pay more attention to their risk management activities during the next five years.While the state of the economy is at the forefront of many risk managers’ minds, memories are still fresh of the floods that devastated parts of England in summer 2007 – inflicting £3bn ($4.4bn) of claims on insurers.Claire Souch, senior director of model management, at Risk Management Solutions, says last summer’s flooding raised awareness not only of the risk from main rivers, but also the risks from minor rivers and from intense rainfall that can overwhelm drainage systems.But Ms Souch points out that flooding is not the only natural peril facing UK businesses.The UK is also at risk from windstorms and even earthquakes, although there is a lower probability of a quake hitting the UK than a storm.“The UK is quite at risk from a number of different catastrophes,” she says. “Flooding is high in peoples’ minds [but] the UK does have quite a high windstorm risk.“We have not really had a major windstorm for a few years, and it has probably slipped down peoples’ agendas.”
205;AON;AON Plc;2008-11-03T17:44:52Z;Pension valuation requests rise 63%;;Fears about plummeting pension values has lead the number of people requesting retirement and transfer value quotes to rise by 63 per cent in September year-on-year.Pensions company Aon Consulting put the rise in enquires in the last year down to panic resulting from turmoil in world financial markets.Over the past year, pension funds have found themselves under attack, racking up big losses across a range of investments. Figures out last week from Aon calculate that the value of employees’ defined contribution pensions has dropped by nearly a third from £552bn to £395bn. Of the UK’s 200 biggest final-salary schemes, some 64 per cent, or nearly 130, are in deficit.The figures can be broken down to those seeking retirement quotations, which increased by 60 per cent in September compared to the year before, and those seeking transfer value quotations, which rose by 74 per cent over the same period.”The financial crisis, understandably, has made people extremely concerned about the state of their pensions, and rightly, they are making enquiries about where they stand and what their options are,” said Colin Hamilton, commercial director of Aon Consulting’s pensions administration team.For employers the outlook is just as bleak. Marcus Hurd, head of corporate solutions at Aon Consulting. “Just as employers thought the economic news couldn’t get any worse, they are likely to be hit by more big bills to pay for their pension schemes when they can least afford it. If all final salary pension schemes were assessed for financial adequacy right now, then it is likely that contributions would soar by an additional £45bn a year for the next five years.“The triple whammy of falls in global equity markets, the worsening economic outlook and reduced free cash means that companies are facing the toughest environment ever for final salary pensions.”Small fluctuations in investment performance, particularly in shares, have always been par for the course and pension funds often recover from these dips relatively quickly. But for those nearing retirement, even for those with 10 years still to work , this extreme downturn – across all the major asset classes at the same time – may prove too extreme for them to be able to repair their pension pots.This could lead to more people deciding to delay retirement for some years until markets recover.
206;AON;AON Plc;2008-10-27T16:43:02Z;Grim future for builders without credit insurance;;"Credit insurers are looking at withdrawing policies from companies in the construction market, leading figures within the insurance industry have warned.Industry observers believe the construction sector could be the next to be hit by insurers refusing to provide cover for suppliers, a move that hastened the recent failure of retailers such as Fopp, the music chain, and ScS Upholstery.Shaun Purrington, a director at Atradius, one of the big three credit insurers, said: “Construction is one of the sectors we feel very uncomfortable with. We could see good companies failing because they run out of money and liquidity.” He refused to say which companies were most at risk.His words were echoed by Stuart Lawson, director in the trade credit department of Aon, the insurance brokers. He said: “Even household names have had their limits and capacity with insurers reviewed, and we have seen some policy cancellations. We expect insolvencies in the sector to increase exponentially in the next few months.”The housebuilding sector is dominated by Taylor Wimpey and Barratt, which have seen their shares fall dramatically in the past year. However, there is more nervousness about the cover for suppliers of building materials groups, of which the two largest operators are Travis Perkins and Wolseley.Neither would comment on whether insurers had withdrawn cover from their suppliers or refused to cover suppliers in future. The warnings follow a report
earlier this summer from Aon that the cost of insuring supply chains could rise by 10 per cent by the end of the year, a move that would effectively price some suppliers out of the market.One industry observer estimated construction made up roughly a quarter of the policies issued by leading groups, of which the market could expect a fall of 5-10 per cent. In an industry in which about 80 per cent of suppliers use credit insurance, this could have a dramatic knock-on effect.Fabrice Desnos, chief executive of Euler Hermes UK, the credit insurance market leader for the construction sector, said last month that the company had started to reduce its coverage for the construction buyers it considers the riskiest, but insisted the company remained heavily involved.Credit insurance is especially important for construction market because of the risky nature of the industry. Materials are needed sometimes long before profits are made, and to mitigate against the possibility that buyers will not be able to pay for items already delivered, suppliers take out insurance policies against defaults or slow payment.Steve Turner, of the Housebuilders Federation, pointed out that with fewer houses being built, suppliers were likely to be scrambling to win contracts, rather than pulling out of them. But he did admit that small suppliers could refuse to take on the risk of supplying without insurance, and that this could hasten the demise for some at the lower end of the construction market."
207;AON;AON Plc;2008-10-11T02:55:48Z;Pension funds urged to restructure portfolios;;Pension funds are facing calls to restructure their portfolios and improve oversight after suffering tens of billions of pounds in losses over the past few weeks.The 200 largest privately-sponsored UK final salary pension schemes, which account for half of all UK pension funds, have lost £45bn ($76bn) since the close of August, according to data from Aon Consulting. And it is widely expected that some employers are likely to be forced to invest more in such “defined benefit” occupational schemes to restore funding levels and meet redemptions if equity markets fall further.While the deficit is likely to improve in the long-term, advisers are questioning whether in future investors would be better served if occupational pension funds invested more in the fixed income sector and alternative assets such as infrastructure than in FTSE 250 companies.“There’s going to need to be some rethink on asset allocation for pension funds,” said Mike Morrison, Winterthur Life’s pension strategy manager.“Equity income shares have been one of the favoured investments of pension funds. There’s going to have to be a massive restructuring. Funds are going to have to look at their liabilities and assets more closely.”If, as expected, more UK banks move to scrap or reduce their dividends, it is likely to pose a challenge for pension fund managers who tend to rely on the equity income sector for returns.But bank shares generally make up only a small portion of pension funds’ holdings and advisers say strong yields can still be found in the oil, telecom, tobacco and pharmaceutical sectors and the performance of schemes will improve when markets rebound.“With the exception of those sponsoring companies facing insolvency, the companies concerned will be able to form long-term financial plans to remedy the problem,” said Marcus Hurd, head of corporate solutions at Aon Consulting. “That said, in light of the new financial environment, many companies will wish to review their approach to pension scheme financing and risk mitigation. In particular, contingency plans should be high on the agenda so that companies can move quickly to deal with any new developments in the financial crisis.”Pensioners who are drawing down funds from personal schemes are watching the value of their pension pots erode. But with equity markets so low, advisers warn that it is a poor time to be cashing in their shares.
208;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
209;AON;AON Plc;2008-10-08T15:12:16Z;Insurance: Premium on education for customers;;From providing cover to properties endangered by hurricanes, to protecting homes at risk of flooding, insurers are exposed to the perils of climate change.“Climate change is a major risk to the insurance industry, and we have to manage that risk appropriately,” says James Wallace, corporate responsibility manager at RSA Insurance.The industry has responded by creating ClimateWise, and 40 of the world’s biggest insurers, reinsurers and insurance brokers have signed up to its series of principles for managing and reducing the risk of climate change.One of the principles is to encourage individual and business customers to manage and reduce the risks from climate change. Insurers have developed a range of initiatives to help customers cut emissions and operate more sustainably.Some of the measures are aimed at retail customers. These include offering discounts to drivers of hybrid cars, or those with low annual mileage.“If people care about the environment, they are more likely to be safe and concerned citizens in terms of driving, although the claims data are still being built,” says Mr Wallace.Other measures in the personal insurance sphere include offering policyholders the option of buying carbon offsets to neutralise carbon emissions from their vehicles.Insurers are also huge buyers of goods and services to make good claims, and a number are introducing green principles into their procurement practices. Andrew Torrance, chief executive of Allianz UK and chairman of ClimateWise, says Allianz offers policyholders the option to use recycled parts on vehicle repairs.When it comes to household cover, insurers hold huge amounts of data on which homes are at risk of flooding.But insurers also have a role in helping their big corporate and industrial customers reduce the risks from climate change.In the corporate arena, insurers have introduced initiatives to help their customers be more energy efficient.A number of insurers provide services to help their customers certify or assess their energy efficiency. They then make recommendations as to how they can become more energy efficient.Similarly, insurers help their customers with risk management, and a number extend this to sustainability.Norwich Union, the UK’s biggest insurer, offers a six-stage carbon neutral programme as part of the risk management proposition offered to commercial customers with annual premiums of more than £50,000 ($87,233).“We believe there is a growing appetite among commercial customers to look at this,” says Tom Oxley, corporate responsibility manager for NU across the UK.A number of insurers have more specialist ways to help their customers operate more sustainably.Zurich Financial Services plans to offer cover to utilities using new technology to capture and store carbon emissions and, potentially, manufacturers of the relevant components.“Utilities that deploy carbon capture and storage technologies are going to need insurance otherwise they are not going to be able to take all these risks on their balance sheets,” says Mike Kerner, global chief underwriting officer at Zurich.RSA covers the infrastructure used to produce energy from water, solar power and biological materials. The insurer covers onshore and offshore technologies, and is involved in all the stages of the infrastructure’s lifecycle, from planning and construction through to operation and end-of-life disposal.“We have very close links with the manufacturers. Because of the great claims data we have built up, we can help inform design,” says Mr Wallace.Elsewhere, in the commercial arena, insurers can help companies physically protect their businesses from the risk of flooding.Many of the initiatives introduced by insurers offer incentives to customers to be more sustainable.“The whole purpose of ClimateWise is to encourage improved environmental behaviour and to provide customers with the information and the incentives to allow them to deliver [that].“It is absolutely about carrots,” says Mr Torrance.But, as well as carrots, is there a role for sticks, such as withdrawing cover, of making terms of policies more onerous for businesses that refrain from reducing the risks from climate change?“It is not really feasible for insurers to use a stick,” says Mr Wallace. “It is more about incentives and working out the smart way to provide an environmentally sustainable option at the same cost.”Mr Kerner says insurers have a role to play where customer behaviour impacts the risks they are covering.“As an industry, we are not in a position of being the police or an alternative tax,” he says.“The stick is being the police, or being the alternative tax. If there is coverage that we are providing that is adversely impacted by behaviours that are not green behaviours, these are things we are going to take into account in the selection process.“But if there is no impact at all on the risk we are taking, firstly, it would be bad business and secondly, many regulators around the world would frown on that as well.”But Aon, the insurance broker, suggests the insurance industry is not yet doing enough to combat climate change.According to Peter Breitstone, chief executive of Aon Environmental Services: “If you look at the size of the insurance industry and you look at the magnitude of the problem, you really don’t see the industry throwing a lot of capital at the problem relative to other industries.“I think the reason for that is that other industries see opportunities to make money. “The insurance industry has not yet figured out how to commercialise it.”
210;AON;AON Plc;2008-09-07T17:49:52Z;Plumeri started career with Hollywood stars;;In the 1970s, Joe Plumeri helped set up and float a film production company owned by Hollywood actors.Its stars included Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Barbra Streisand, Sidney Poitier and Dustin Hoffman.“It was a lot of fun. I was young, very young in those days. It was great to be a part of it. I was starry eyed,” says chairman and chief executive of Willis, the third-largest insurance broker in the world.Few people would find the world of insurance as much fun as the film business. But to Mr Plumeri, who joined broker Willis, which has headquarters in London but is listed in New York, in 2000 after 32 years at Citigroup, it is equally alluring.Gesturing to the view of the City and east London beneath his office on the 16th floor of Willis’s new building opposite Lloyd’s, he says: “Pick out one thing that you see that is not insurable. What a business, where everything that moves, that is built, everybody that works, all of that happens because of me, because of us, because of the insurance industry.”There is certainly plenty to enliven things. Willis has agreed to acquire smaller rival Hilb Rogal & Hobbs for $2.1bn in cash and shares, significantly expanding its operations in North America, primarily in the market for securing cover for mid-sized companies. “It has really gone beyond my expectations,” says Mr Plumeri of the deal so far.Willis’s purchase was followed swiftly by rival Aon’s £844m ($1.49bn) acquisition of reinsurance broker Benfield.Mr Plumeri plays down the impact of Aon’s deal. .“We have a very good reinsurance business,” he says. “What Aon and Benfield do really does not affect me.” However, Willis plans to seize any opportunities that might arise from the combination.Two years ago, Willis and private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had bigger rival Marsh & McLennan in their sights.But the window of opportunity may have closed, with Brian Duperreault, who ran insurer Ace, appointed as chief executive of MMC, and Dan Glaser, former head of AIG Europe, installed as chief executive of the Marsh insurance broking business.Mr Plumeri declines to comment on any interest, or whether it is now over. “I don’t know if it ever began,” is all he will say.Willis’s acquisition of Hilb Rogal & Hobbs has revived the debate about brokers accepting special bonuses from insurers for bringing them a large amount of business or particularly profitable accounts, known as contingent commissions.The big brokers, including Willis, are not allowed to accept contingent commissions after investigations by Eliot Spitzer, former New York attorney-general, in 2004.But a regulatory change means the brokers can now accept contingent commissions for up to three years in cases where they acquire a broker that does accept them. This makes it economically viable for the three big brokers to buy businesses that still accept the payments.Mr Plumeri says Willis will continue its policy of not accepting contingent commissions, and HRH will not accept them after three years. “We are taking them for three years, only because it is the only way we can make an acquisition,” he says.He will also continue to campaign to abolish contingent commissions, as he believes it is unfair that the big three brokers cannot accept them, but other brokers can.“Governor Spitzer at the time left an awfully unlevel playing field, and left it in worse shape than …t was when he began the whole process.”
211;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:01:26+0000;Finality looms for final-salary schemes;;"A report into public sector pensions has provided further proof that final-salary schemes – also known as defined-benefit schemes – are unsustainable.For years, the private sector has been turning its back on final-salary schemes, but now a report from advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown’s has provoked debate about whether the public sector’s defined-benefit schemes should also be reformed.The research suggests that the public-sector schemes, in spite of being partially paid for by taxpayers, have made promises to members that they cannot easily keep.The spiralling cost of public sector defined- benefit pensions has become, says Laith Khalaf, pensions analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, “the elephant in the room”. A government estimate of liabilities stood at £650bn in 2006. But independent estimates put the total at closer to £1,000bn. Under current arrangements, for example, nurses who have worked in the NHS for 40 years can expect to receive two thirds of their final salary in retirement.The largest schemes – for teachers, doctors and nurses, civil servants, the police and the army – are unfunded. This means that no pool of money has been set aside to meet the payments of benefits to these retirees. The cost of providing the benefits will be met by future employees in the sectors, and by the taxpayer. If contributions are not being set aside for future retirees, this prompts the question: how will they receive their pensions?Hargreaves Lansdown has calculated that a defined-contribution scheme, where members contribute money that is then invested, could accrue the same nurse around 43 per cent of his or her salary, based on the scheme earning 6 per cent net growth each year. Although less than the previous state-funded scheme, this is still a comparatively generous pension.There are, it seems, no easy answers. Changing the public-sector pension scheme would mean a period of pain where payments to current final-salary pension recipients would have to made by taxpayers alone, while the scheme members yet to retire put their contributions into the new scheme.But traditional final-salary schemes are simply too expensive, say experts. The way to cut costs is to reduce what is on offer. This means either raising the retirement age, reducing the rate of benefit accrual or increasing member contributions.Recent research from Aon Consulting, the pension consultant, revealed that two thirds of companies expected to reduce their contributions to final-salary schemes next year.This is as a result of many succeeding in reducing their deficits, which currently stand at £25bn, and hoping to reduce their spending in light of economic uncertainties.But Aon said employers would be in for a shock if they believed they had done everything necessary to reduce deficits. Difficult market conditions mean deficits are likely to increase over the next year.Final-salary schemes give their members a guaranteed percentage of the salary they receive in their last year of work when they retire.The proportion depends on how long the employee has worked with the organisation. An employee who has worked for 40 years and has a typical accrual rate of 1/60th will be entitled to 40/60ths, or 2/3rds, of final salary as an annual pension at retirement.Ten years ago, just over one third of employees were members of final-salary schemes; last year only 15 per cent were.In the private sector, the number of final-salary schemes has fallen sharply. Hit by tougher regulation, greater longevity and market volatility, employers have become less willing to sponsor the schemes.Of the final-salary schemes that remain, only a fifth are open to new members, meaning that most employees joining a company with a pension will be offered a defined-contribution scheme.Alterations to pension rights remain an emotive issue. Plans to close a final-salary scheme for new employees at Grangemouth, one of Britain’s largest oil refineries, resulted in a two-day strike by workers.But for those employers still shouldering the burden of a final-salary scheme, there is some comfort. As they are now comparatively rare, employee groups say a final-salary pension has become a powerful tool for attracting the best staff."
212;AON;AON Plc;2008-08-22T11:40:26Z;Aon agrees £844m offer for Benfield;;Benfield on Friday agreed to an offer from Aon, the US insurance group, that values the reinsurance broker 350p a share or £844m and represents a 29 per cent premium to the previous close.Shortly after the deal was announced, Benfield shares were up almost 30 per cent at 351¾p, having closed Thursday at 271p. It was the biggest gainer in the FTSE 250. The offer also represented an almost 40 per cent premium to Benfield’s average share price over the last 30 days, the company said.Aon has long been rumoured to be interested in its UK rival. It said on Thursday that the tie-up would help it develop further in US property catastrophe markets in Florida and the south east in the hurricane-afflicted regions through Benfield’s ReMetrics unit, which specialises in quantitative risk modelling.The deal will also give it greater presence in Asia - Benfield has long-standing client relationships in Japan - and Latin America, both of which are quick-growing markets.The two said the merger would “create a truly global, diverse reinsurance franchise”. Benfield would be merged into Aon’s reinsurance business, to be renamed Aon Benfield Re.Aon will fund the deal from its own cash reserves. Greg Case, president and chief executive of Aon, said there were strong cultural similarities between the two companies which would speed their integration.The deal is expected to close by the end of the year. Aon said it had already received commitments from Benfield shareholders representing approximately 25.4 percent of the outstanding shares to support the transaction.
213;AON;AON Plc;2008-08-08T17:29:34Z;Credit crunch persuades trustees to take a more sophisticated approach;;"As the UK reaches the first anniversary of the credit crunch, pension funds are making a strategic shift in their approach to risk, according to Aon Consulting.Many have been moving assets from ultra-safe gilts to corporate bonds, to benefit from historically high yields.In a survey of the UK’s 200 largest privately sponsored pension schemes, Aon found that fund managers have been engaging in significantly greater levels of investment activity to combat the effects of wider market turbulence. In fact, it calculates that there has been a fourfold increase in fund transactions [CHECK] in the past three months, compared with the start of the year.Marcus Hurd, senior consultant at Aon, says the effects of the credit crunch had prompted companies and pension scheme trustees to take a more sophisticated approach.So, as pension funds have sought out growth investments that can reduce volatility, John Ball of consulting group Watson Wyatt has seen many move away from gilts and into riskier corporate bonds.In addition to the higher yields that corporate bonds can offer, pension funds are also anticipating that, when the spread between yields from gilts and corporate bonds narrows again, the market for corporate bonds will become more liquid and they will benefit from higher sale prices.Pensions funds generally favour government-backed gilts over corporate investments because they represent the ultimately safe investment option.Corporate bonds carry a much greater risk of default and they are also more exposed to inflation than gilts, which can offer index-linking.However, the National Association of Pension Funds points out that pension schemes still differ in their mandates – which will impose restrictions on what they can invest in and how much risk they can take on.For example, the Universities Superannuation Scheme, the UK’s second largest pension fund, increased its weighting to corporate bonds at the end of 2007 to 10 per cent of its fixed-income portfolio – but was restricted to the highest quality investment-grade holdings.So far, this shift into bonds seems to be working. Although the 200 largest pension schemes have
far higher deficit levels compared with last year, they did manage to reduce their combined deficits from £30bn to £21bn between June and July.But some say these figures may not accurately reflect funding levels. Liabilities are discounted using corporate bond yields, meaning that, as the yields go up, liability levels come down. So it seems that corporate bonds are not only aiding funds with higher yields, but are also helping to cushion the balance sheets."

Fresh from having wowed audiences in his recent international tour, Chicago is hoping that if the Democratic presidential candidate can win the White House in November, the resulting improvement in the US’s image around the world will increase the city’s chances of securing the 2016 summer games.Mr Ryan, who stepped down on Thursday as executive chairman of Aon, the insurer he established through a 1982 merger, says the election often comes up in the conversations he has as he travels internationally to promote Chicago’s bid.“It’s clear that people outside the US are very interested in the campaign …and have significant interest in the Obama campaign,” he says. “It’s captured the interest of the world.”He cannot endorse a candidate, but it is clear that Mr Obama’s ties to Chicago would be a boost for the bid should he win the election.“Senator Obama, coming from Chicago, will be putting more of a spotlight on Chicago on a global basis,” says Mr Ryan. “The more well-known Chicago becomes internationally, the better that is for our bid.”Mr Obama has also been active in helping the bid. Mr Ryan notes that the candidate’s involvement goes back to 2006, when he appeared in a video in support of the city’s attempt to secure the official US bid – which it did by beating Houston, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Los Angeles.By contrast, John McCain, the Republican candidate, is a well-known opponent of subsidies paid to candidate cities. In 2000, he waged an unsuccessful campaign in the Senate against more than $1bn in federal grants to help Salt Lake City stage the 2002 Winter Olympics, vowing to end “fiscal abuse” relating to the games.Mr McCain has also said that, were he in the White House, he would boycott the Beijing games because of China’s human rights.Chicago was ranked third in the technical evaluation that accompanied the four-city shortlist, behind Tokyo and Madrid but ahead of Rio. Mr Ryan admits the other candidates are formidable competition, but says the experience of London’s bid for the 2012 games shows that “third place is not a bad place to be”. In the final vote, the British capital beat Paris, the favourite, and Madrid, ranked first in the technical assessment.Much of that was said to be down to the lobbying efforts of Tony Blair, the UK prime minister at the time.
215;AON;AON Plc;2008-06-01T21:01:41Z;Potter offers Windy City an English education;;"After a seven-year stint in London, Steve Potter, the newly inaugurated president of Northern Trust Global Investments, has a host of insights to offer on his return to his employer’s home city of Chicago.Having witnessed the preparations for London 2012 first hand, Mr Potter has already been approached by Pat Ryan, the founder of Aon and chairman of Chicago’s bid to host the Olympics in 2016.But his day job will involve incorporating the knowledge he has built up in Europe into Northern Trust’s US operations.Since 2001 Mr Potter has headed up Northern Trust’s non-US operations, both in asset management and asset servicing. In his new role he assumes global supremacy for the bank’s $778bn (£393bn, €499bn) asset management operation, succeeding Frederick Waddell, the new chief executive of the wider company.And although the asset management arm is dwarfed by Northern Trust’s $3,980bn global custody business, Mr Potter seems quite pleased by the move. “I love the asset management business, markets are much more interesting than asset servicing,” he says.“Asset management is still only 15 per cent of our global revenues so that is a huge opportunity and my education in the City will help me hugely with my new job. I have picked up a much bigger appreciation for emerging markets and alternatives. Emerging markets really start and end here in London.”The links forged in London will grow in importance as open architecture models assume ever greater importance across the industry. “A good number of the people I have been working with will be on our platforms and hopefully we will be on their platforms as well.”The bad news is that Mr Potter returns to a pure asset management beat at a difficult juncture, with markets still reverberating from the repercussions of the credit crunch.Even Northern Trust, an institution so conservative it is known in Chicago as the “Grey Lady of LaSalle Street”, has set aside $229m to cover potential losses in two of its structured investment vehicles. And like its more risk-hungry rivals it will have to adjust to a much changed landscape when the dust settles.“Mortgage companies became aggressive sales companies and there is this period of cleansing and fortification,” says Mr Potter. “But markets do correct. Business models will evolve towards more transparency and regulation and capital will flow again. I’m optimistic that it will flow in a more normalised way, but ‘normal’ was five years ago, not one year ago.”He believes the expected stricter regulation of US
broker-dealers, such as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, will have knock-on effects across the industry. “The whole way broker-dealers are regulated will change. The unintended consequence is that there will be less leverage and therefore less innovation.”Northern Trust has fared better than most of its rivals amid the credit squeeze, extending its record of posting positive earnings in every quarter since 1987 when it reported a 3 per cent rise in assets under management in the first three months of this year from the prior quarter, although assets under custody dipped 3.7 per cent.Mr Potter says inflows were particularly strong from the Middle East, where the bank recently opened an office in Abu Dhabi, its first in the region. He also reports “huge flows to cash”, with holdings of cash or near cash instruments having risen 10 per cent to $380bn since December. “People are being more cautious in the current environment,” he explains. Yet, at the other extreme, Mr Potter sees continuing robust demand for alternatives and other less liquid assets. He says demand for Northern Trust’s multi-manager hedge fund platform has “stood up well” in spite of the operation suffering an unusually bad two down months in 2007.Similarly the long-term nature of private equity investing means customers should stay on board, in spite of a dearth of deals that means “there are firms that are basically letting their staff have an extended summer holiday”.In spite of rising borrowing costs, he backs private equity managers to survive in the current economic downturn, arguing they will be willing to make “tough”, rather than “emotional”, decisions about the companies they own.Like many of its peers, Northern Trust has also expanded into the world of 130/30 funds, primarily as a means of leveraging its expertise in quantitative investing, where just $15bn of its $281bn book of assets is invested in “enhanced” strategies. And, like many of its peers, it has thus far failed to shoot the lights out with this constrained long/short approach.Mr Potter accepts 130/30 is still a work in progress, saying of his own funds: “they have had positive returns but they have probably not done what we hoped they would do. In this market Northern Trust is selling safety and security, so it is taking a backseat.“I still think 130/30 is a good product but we have been operating in an absolutely unbelievable market. We are not marketing it but we will stick with it and I would expect that in the next several years performance will improve.” One thing the bank is marketing is its Investment Program Solutions product, similar to the Dutch concept
of fiduciary management, which entails asset allocation, manager selection and corporate governance all being outsourced to Northern Trust.Pension funds and endowments with assets of up to $1bn are the primary target for this fast-growing service – its IPS division has doubled in size to $20bn this year – in which the bank is competing with the likes of Frank Russell and SEI.IPS sits inside Northern Trust’s multi-manager platform, which has $41bn of assets. But Mr Potter sees this figure growing rapidly, particularly as just $7bn of the $140bn held by its wealth management operation is invested in an open architecture, multi-manager manner.“We are the market leader for the super rich and family offices. About 20-25 per cent of the Forbes 400 [list of wealthiest Americans] uses Northern Trust,” he says. “We would expect [multi-manager assets] to grow at double-digit rates. I can see us with $50bn in assets in the wealth management space in that multi-manager format in the next five years.”Mr Potter thanks his “lucky stars” he had the opportunity to spend seven years living and working in London. He is buying an apartment in the city for family trips back from Chicago. All he asks is that we judge his investment skills on the Olympian strides he hopes to make in the Windy City, and not his timing in the property market."
216;AON;AON Plc;2008-06-01T20:55:15Z;Pension funds slow to diversify;;Investment consultants have been telling pension funds for some years they should look beyond traditional asset classes, mainly equity and fixed income, to create a more efficient investment portfolio.Diversification lowers risk without lowering return, they maintain, and should be part and parcel of an investment approach that looks to cover liabilities and hedge out unrewarded risks.Some pension funds are well down that road, but most UK funds have put little more than a toe in the water. And according to a survey of 100 pension schemes by Barclays Global Investors, they have little interest in going much further.They recognise the benefits of a diversified asset allocation but have not adopted such an approach. Just over one in 10 schemes dismiss the idea of increasing diversification as “not important”, and only 7 per cent regard it as “essential”.Instead, their priorities are meeting increases in liabilities, which is seen as essential by nearly a third of schemes, maximising returns (16 per cent), and minimising risk (11 per cent).However, there is a difference of opinion among funds depending on their size. Nearly 60 per cent of larger funds rate increasing diversification as very important or essential, against 35 per cent of smaller funds.“Despite saying diversification is good there is still much misconception on the perceived costs and complexity involved,” says Hugh Cutler, managing director of the strategic solutions group at BGI.“Pension funds need to move to the next level and implement decisions aimed at meeting liabilities and delivering on the promise to pension fund members,” he adds.Those polled are unlikely to change their strategy either as almost half of larger funds and two-thirds of smaller funds have no plans to diversify further to cut risk and meet liabilities.Investment consultants expressed surprise at the findings. “We’re seeing a lot of diversification [among pension schemes] as this makes a lot of sense,” says Daniel Peters, investment consultant and actuary at Aon Consulting. A recent survey by Aon of 234 trustees indicated half had done something about diversification to spread risk.Nick Sykes, European director of consulting at Mercer Consulting, also identified “a trend [among pension schemes] for a gentle increase in diversification”.BGI’s survey shows a majority of schemes have diversified into property and emerging market equities, but fewer have ventured into emerging market bonds, infrastructure and commodities. The only asset class in which smaller funds were more likely to invest than their bigger counterparts was commodities. On average, larger funds use five to six (5.6 per cent) of 10 specified asset classes, while smaller funds use just under five (4.8 per cent).“Large schemes tend to lead and smaller ones follow,” says Mr Sykes. “Large schemes have a bigger budget and their learning ability is greater than smaller ones, which may not have an investment committee to chivvy them.”For those larger funds planning to diversify into other asset classes in the future, hedge funds are the most popular choice followed by infrastructure, private equity and high-yield bonds. Liability hedging through the use of swaps is low on the list as many trustees consider such a strategy too complex.In general, trustees still have reservations about adopting a liability driven investment approach. The survey lists twice as many perceived disadvantages as advantages. Their main concerns are lower returns, high costs, lack of flexibility and complexity.Trustees have a poor understanding of swaps, says Mr Cutler, and more work is needed to explain the products clearly.Most trustees have at least heard of liability driven investment, but there are still more than one in 10 (13 per cent) who claim ignorance of the term and its meaning.“A lot of trustees have thought about LDI but decided it is not a solution for their schemes. It is an excellent solution but not right for everyone, especially at this time [in the current financial climate],” says Mr Peters.On a global basis, the take up of LDI as a way of managing risk has also been low. A poll carried out last year by SEI, the multi-manager, showed only 20 per cent of pension funds were implementing an LDI approach, with the Dutch showing the most advanced understanding of how to adopt it.Another surprise in the findings is the widespread failure, especially by smaller schemes, to set a target return for their portfolios. Setting such a target is usually one of the first steps in planning to meet liabilities. But two out of five smaller schemes and nearly a quarter of larger ones do not have targets.“Trustees should have an idea of the target. But often only when schemes are in trouble do pension fund managers begin to look closely at targets,” says Mr Peters of Aon Consulting.Schemes also have a higher than expected proportion of assets invested in passive strategies says Mr Cutler, with 41 per cent of larger plans taking a passive approach to managing assets.Defined benefit pension schemes are beginning to crawl back from uncomfortable levels of deficit seen in 2006, with last year ending in surplus. But experts say pension fund trustees cannot afford to be complacent and still need to explore a wider range of strategies to meet liabilities, or at least to set some misconceptions straight.
217;AON;AON Plc;2008-05-31T02:03:20Z;Consultants blast pension levy;;A bitter row broke out between the Pension Protection Fund, the pensions lifeboat, and some of Britain’s leading consultancies on Friday over a revised formula governing the amount employers pay into risk-based levy schemes.A change to the so-called “scaling factor” means many pension schemes will be paying 2½ times as much as they originally anticipated, Aon Consulting claimed.The move “adds further misery to pension scheme finances”, the consultancy said as fellow consulting group Watson Wyatt said the change meant that employers who had put more money into their pension scheme in the belief that would lower the amount of levy they pay are “running to stand still”.Jeremy Dell, a partner at pension lawyers Lane, Clark and Peacock, accused the fund of “sheer incompetence” in failing to forecast the way the formula would change “with any degree of accuracy”.The PPF raises a levy on pension schemes as a form of insurance, so that if schemes go under members will have the bulk of their pension rights protected.Partha Dasgupta, its chief executive, said the lawyers and consultancies were being “highly misleading” and “scaremongering” in predicting huge levy increases.The change, he said, would ensure merely that the PPF brought in the £675m it said it needed for this year and the two next.Scheme funding had improved recently, Mr Dasgupta said. “But it is the long-term risk that we have to protect ourselves against, particularly as we are in the middle of a credit crunch, which can only mean a lot more uncertainty”.The change brought in no more money than originally planned, he said. What it did do, is alter who pays what so that the schemes with riskiest long-term profiles pay more.“It is not good news for all schemes, and some where the risk is larger will pay significantly more,” Mr Dasgupta said. “But that has to be right, because the burden should shift from those schemes that are doing a good job in sorting out their finances to those that have not. I take great offence at the way people are trying to portray this [change].”Under the formula, he said, 42 per cent of schemes would pay a lower cash sum this year than last while 57 per cent would pay a higher cash sum. But as a percentage of assets, 58 per cent of schemes would be paying a lower percentage.Mr Dasgupta said 9 per cent would pay no risk-based levy at all this year, because they had taken steps to fully fund their pension scheme. “That is fair. It redistributes the risk fairly within the population of schemes.”He also added that the consultancies “need to keep a sense of proportion”. Almost half of the 14 per cent of schemes whose levy will more than double, paid only £5,000 or less to the PPF last year.But John Ball of Watson Wyatt said that those who had taken steps to improve their solvency with the aim of reducing their levy would still now find that the PPF had moved the goalposts and they would have to pay more than they thought.“Pension schemes have become the latest victim of the credit crunch, with the PPF suggesting it needs to build up a war chest before things get worse,” he said.
218;AON;AON Plc;2008-04-28T01:02:33Z;Product risk: When it pays not to cut corners in the supply chain;;It is every consumer products company’s worst nightmare. A product is faulty, tampered with or there is a problem with an ingredient, forcing the manufacturer to recall it at potentially great cost to its profits and reputation. This nightmare recently became a reality for Mattel when the world’s biggest toymaker ordered 18m toys made in China to be recalled because of hazards such as the use of lead paint.Experts say Mattel’s woes have raised awareness of managing the risks that could bring about a recall.Managing risks in the supply chain and manufacturing process has already been forced up the agenda by a number of regulatory changes.Four years ago, the European Union Directive on General Product Safety was introduced. This increased the obligation on companies to assess risks and report potential problems with products to the relevant trading standards authorities. If companies do not take the appropriate action when faced with a potential problem, under the directive, authorities have the power to force companies to recall products at their own expense.Jeremy Moore, head of product risk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Marsh, says there were more than 1,000 recalls in the European Union last year, compared with 200 to 300 four years ago.Rules on food safety, effective from January 2005, also require companies to establish systems to trace food throughout the chain, withdraw or remove it from the market where it does not comply with safety requirements and notify authorities of any action to withdraw food.Given these developments, Phil Bell, group casualty director at insurer Royal & Sun Alliance, says it is essential that companies have a plan for dealing with a recall.“One of the crucial things if you do need to recall your products is you need to do it quickly, and therefore you need to have a recall plan,” he says.An important element of this is the ability to work out quickly both where ingredients or raw materials have come from, and where finished products have been shipped to.Mr Moore says the food safety rules established the concept of “traceability”. This means every member of the supply chain must be able to “demonstrably show or know where every single ingredient or component or raw material has come from and where every single product that has been produced has gone to.”This is known as “one step up, one step down traceability”. But, he adds: “There is a common misconception out there that if you have a great recall plan, you are going to have a fantastically managed recall. But what you are not doing is avoiding the recall in the first place,” he says.Mr Bell says that for manufacturers, adhering to the procedures that must be followed to achieve accreditation to the ISO9001 risk management standard should reduce the likelihood of a recall.The requirements include checking the source of raw materials, and that they conform to what was ordered. Companies must also comply with appropriate standards through the manufacturing process, and through to quality control, packing, distributing and record-keeping.For importers, it is imperative that companies know where products have come from, and that they comply with all the relevant safety standards. Mattel’s experience has highlighted the risks associated with products manufactured in China.David Palmer, a director in Aon’s crisis management team, says that when manufacturing is transferred to lower-cost locations, it is imperative to ensure that all product specifications and quality control requirements are carefully managed.“Even having done that, companies must be very thorough in testing materials and parts that are received from suppliers,” he says.According to Mr Moore: “There are massive cost savings to be had. But if you cut those cost savings a little bit, and apply your own quality mantra elements, you will still save money, but you are coming closer to ensuring that high quality products are being produced.”One way to manage the financial risk of a recall is to buy specialist insurance. According to Mr Palmer, product recall insurance covers the costs of the recall itself, loss of sales as a result of any adverse publicity, steps taken to revive sales, known as “rehabilitating the brand”, as well as any interruption to trading due to the recall.But there can also be conditions attached to policies, which can limit the cover available. One typical exclusion is that policies will not cover the cost of recalling products where the consequences of consumption would not manifest themselves quickly, generally up to 120 days. Other common exclusions are policies that would not cover the costs of recalling products because they could contain carcinogenic ingredients or banned substances.Nevertheless, says Mr Palmer: “We have seen many, many new buyers of this cover. While the major brand owners have bought this coverage for years, we are now seeing many smaller manufacturers recognising their exposure, plus others within the chain, such as growers, packaging companies, storage companies and delivery firms. “I would say it is now becoming a normal part of coverage for a manufacturer.”But this type of cover is not cheap, and only a limited number of companies are prepared to offer it because claims can potentially be very large.
219;AON;AON Plc;2008-04-28T01:02:33Z;Directors and officers: Braced for avalanche of claims;;Insurers are braced for an avalanche of claims against directors of companies from the collapse of the US subprime mortgage market and the wider credit crunch that has followed. The consensus of estimates for the level of claims is between $3bn and $4bn, although some commentators believe the final total could be in excess of $10bn.Claims are expected to arise under so-called directors and officers policies, which protect a director or officer of a company from paying out of their own pocket in a case arising from their duties.Companies also buy professional indemnity insurance, which protects an organisation if it does not do right by its clients. So-called financial institutions cover includes D&O, professional indemnity, and a financial crime policy, which covers a company for example if an employee steals money.Insurers writing this type of business will also buy reinsurance to protect themselves from claims under these policies, so there could also be a hit to the reinsurance market from a flurry of claims.Already claims and notifications of potential claims related to the subprime debacle are coming in. Lloyd’s, the world’s oldest insurance market, said this month it had received between 90 and 100 since problems with the financial system emerged last summer. However, it played down its exposure, saying that if the financial turmoil were a natural catastrophe, such as an earthquake, it would “just be feeling distant tremors”.Thomas Sheffield, technical director at Aon, says that at the beginning of the subprime crisis, actions were being brought against those originating and writing subprime mortgages under professional indemnity policies. However, more recently, subprime-related class action lawsuits have been filed, which could spark claims under D&O policies.According to Stanford Law School and Cornerstone Research, 74 subprime related class action lawsuits have been filed. “These are the bigger problem,” says Mr SheffieldAnother worrying trend, says Nick Foord-Kelcey, managing director in Marsh’s financial and professional practice, is the filing of so-called “auction rate securities” claims. These relate to securities that were being traded in an auction market, mainly between professional banks. With that market evaporating, banks withdrew, and previously liquid markets became very illiquid. Consequently the value of such securities fell.A couple of US law firms are suing the banks that were running the auctions. At least 10 of the class action lawsuits that have been filed are auction rate securities claims. However, Mr Foord-Kelcey points out that the claims are not so far expected to give rise to insurance claims under traditional D&O policies because they do not name any directors.One hundred companies were sued in the second half of 2007 as the subprime mortgage crisis unfolded, and stock market volatility increased, reversing the trend of eight consecutive quarters with below average litigation activity, Stanford and Cornerstone says.While there is concern about the potential D&O claims arising from the subprime crisis and wider credit crunch, Mr Foord-Kelcey believes that providing proof could be difficult. At the moment, none has yet made any progress towards trial.Members of bank boardrooms were not experts in complex financial instruments such as collateralised debt obligations, he says, “so proving they had knowledge, or should have had knowledge, is going to be quite challenging for the plaintiffs. This is a completely new area. So how successful they are going to be in these claims we are yet to see.”But the possibility of an increase in claims comes at a delicate time for the insurance market. Despite the increasing risks to directors, the price of D&O cover has remained generally stable.“You would expect that financial institutions’ rates would go up, just because they are the ones that are being hit by claims. Insurers are super-nervous about financial institutions. They are going to want to ask a lot more questions [to] nail down what the exposure is,” says Mr Sheffield.Matthew Rolph, managing director at Marsh’s financial and professional practice, agrees. “If there is a lack of certainty, if you can’t paint a picture [as to why] you are not exposed, the likelihood is you will pay more,” he says.David Ritchie, director of financial and professional risks at Heath Lambert, points out that while the cost of cover can vary significantly between companies with good claims histories and those with poor ones, a good indication of market conditions is the minimum price charged for cover.For D&O cover for financial institutions, he estimates the minimum at £2,000 ($3,951) per £1m of cover. For professional indemnity and financial crime policies, the minimum is £5,000 per £1m, although this could be higher if a company has significant US exposure. He believes these levels are already being reviewed.
220;AON;AON Plc;2008-04-27T20:53:48Z;Differing views over life left in DB plans;;"Employers and trustees of pension fund schemes have conflicting expectations on how long their defined benefit plans will last.According to a survey of 250 trustees of DB schemes, carried out by Aon Consulting, 80 per cent predicted the schemes would still exist
in 10 years, while 50 per cent of employers forecast a scheme wind up in the next decade.More than half of the trustees thought their scheme would last longer than 20 years. The differing views show significant lack of communication between trustee boards and employers.“Without a common view, there is unlikely to be agreement over actions and there is a danger that one party takes decisions that are a hindrance to the other,” said Paul McGlone, principal and senior actuary at Aon
Consulting.Some companies want to make a settlement, possibly through the buy-out route, in the next five years but have not yet worked out how to do it and so have not signalled their intentions to trustees, said Mr McGlone."
221;AON;AON Plc;2008-03-25T19:09:00Z;Chicago’s star on the rise;;Older members of Chicago’s financial exchange community recall when their peers in New York looked down on them as unsophisticated traders in agricultural products such as pork bellies, cattle, corn and wheat.If any such sentiment still lingered in Wall Street, it will have evaporated last week after the CME Group struck a deal to buy Nymex, the New York energy exchange, for $9.4bn.The deal will make the CME – formed last year from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s $11bn purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade – the largest financial exchange in the world, controlling 98 per cent of US listed futures.Although the CME/CBoT deal was seen as a defensive move to ward off potential predators, it also bolstered the city’s standing, turning Chicago into a serious global player. The Nymex move has underlined that and cemented Chicago’s position as a global centre of risk-taking and risk-management.This reputation rests on its range of derivatives exchanges, with CME at the top of a scale that also includes the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options exchange, and smaller but more unique entities such as the Chicago Climate Exchange, the US’s first greenhouse-gas emissions exchange.The city also hosts the headquarters of large insurance companies such as Aon State Farm and Allstate.In recent months, while Wall Street has writhed in the agony of turbulent equity markets and an ongoing credit crunch, Chicago’s exchanges have been booming, as investors look to hedge their investments or bet on further volatility. That has augmented a trend of fast growth in options and futures trading, whose volumes are expanding by about 25 per cent a year.While the city’s financial star is on the rise, some locals say the traditional caricature was somewhat valid. “Historically, Chicago has not been very plugged into the economy of the wider world,” says Donald Jacobs, dean emeritus of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, Chicago. “New York looked to Europe, San Francisco looked to Asia, while here in Chicago – being in the middle of the country – we were mainly looking at cornfields.”But that very perspective gave the city its focus. Richard Sandor, chairman and chief executive of the Chicago Climate Exchange, says Chicago’s success at establishing itself as the centre of risk management grew from the inherently risky grain-trading business, with its dependence on Midwest weather conditions.With the invention in the 1970s of financial futures – of which Mr Sandor was one of the principal architects – Chicago grew beyond its agricultural roots. Trading in products such as interest-rate futures and volatility options now dwarfs the volumes in agricultural derivatives.“New York became the home of investment capital, San Francisco the home of venture capital, and Chicago the home of speculative capital,” Mr Sandor says.While Chicago remains very much America’s second financial city, the CME-Nymex deal has reinvigorated a rivalry with New York. “It drove [former NYSE chief executive] Dick Grasso up the wall that Chicago was so successful in derivatives and he was never able to move into that world,” says a former CME board member. “As for Nymex, whatever pride those guys in New York have, they’re going to have to swallow. They’re becoming part of something else that they’re really tangential to.”Chicago’s ascent has also sparked a battle among media outlets to increase their business coverage from the city. CNBC, Bloomberg, CNN, Fox Business Network and other broadcasters are setting up operations in a new media centre on the CME’s trading floor. Business Week recently launched BW Chicago, its first monthly magazine aimed at a specific city.“Because of its markets, Chicago has some of the leading indicators that we want to focus on,” says Brian Jones, Fox Business’s senior vice-president for news.The fact that the CME secured the CBOT in the face of a rival bid from the Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange helped retain the city’s role as an international centre for derivatives trading. “Had we not come together, there was no guarantee that either one of these institutions would have remained in Chicago,” says Terry Duffy, CME chairman.Many in the industry say the CME’s ability to gain a foothold in the backyard of exchange groups such as NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX resulted from its early embrace of trading technology and the development of new financial products.“We’re not just this little Chicago exchange any more,” Mr Duffy says. “We’ve done a lot of work as far as innovation goes, otherwise we’d still be trading butter and eggs.”
222;AON;AON Plc;2008-03-14T03:54:16Z;Weak dollar hurts Benfield profits;;Shares in Benfield suffered their biggest one-day fall after the reinsurance broker reported a 4 per cent drop in annual pre-tax profits and warned that trading in 2008 would be no better.Pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 fell from £53m ($108m) to £50.9m, while turnover slipped from £355m to £339m.Benfield blamed the sliding dollar – the currency in which it earns three-quarters of its trading commissions – for the poor results. The company said adverse currency movements resulted in a £10.3m hit to its trading profit.In addition to its exposure to the dollar, Benfield, which earns commissions from helping insurers find reinsurance coverage, had also been hurt by falling prices in the reinsurance market.Reinsurance premiums spiked after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, but the absence of notable catastrophes last year, combined with new entrants to the reinsurance market, have led to a resoftening of prices.While cheaper prices could sometimes prompt clients to buy more reinsurance and help reinsurers offset falling revenues, analysts said there had been no signs of that happening yet. Grahame Chilton, chief executive, said Benfield was “swimming against the tide in heavy weather” and added that the outlook was equally as grim.“The difficult trading conditions of 2007 are likely to continue in the short term and consequently, absent significant improvement in market conditions, we anticipate the 2008 trading result will be marginally below that for 2007,” he said.Benfield, which is rumoured to have attracted bid interest from rival Aon as well as from the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, said it was not in takeover talks with anyone at the moment.Earnings per share were 17p (17.18p). The proposed dividend is 9p, taking the total payout to 13p, compared with 12p the year before.Shares in Benfield, down more than a quarter last year, fell 29p, or 11 per cent, to 230¾p.FT Comment● Benfield is currently trading at about 17 times 2008 earnings, well ahead of the 14 times on which many of its US and European peers trade. Given the near-term uncertainties, this premium is very generous, especially if bid rumours turn out to be untrue.
223;AON;AON Plc;2008-02-19T02:32:10Z;Proposals to add pressure on pension funding;;"Pensions industry consultants recoiled on Monday at proposed new regulatory guidance under which schemes would have to make assumptions about liabilities using mortality data that reflect rapidly improving life expectancy.“If companies were to also adopt the pension regulator’s proposed assumptions, then 99 per cent of companies would need to strengthen their assumption,” said Marcus Hurd, a senior consultant at actuarial practice Aon.“The effect would be to increase the UK’s reported pension liabilities by at least £75bn ($146bn) immediately.”The proposals, combined with new accounting rules, place pressure on companies to substantially increase funding for schemes, according to John Davies, head of business law at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.Actuaries at Watson Wyatt said that the new proposals could mean some schemes salt away too much cash, which cannot be returned to employers, and that schemes would have adopted tougher mortality assumptions without prodding from the regulator. “Mortality risks remain very unpredictable and nothing in the regulator’s guidance can change that,” said James Wintle, a senior consultant at Watson Wyatt.On Monday, the regulator formally announced the proposals, revealed last week in the Financial Times.These call for special scrutiny to be applied to schemes that do not assume members will live at least as long as the age in a key actuarial table, known in industry shorthand as PA92 long corhort, in which the average life expectancy is 89 years. The proposals do not themselves increase costs for schemes; they merely require that hidden costs be recognised.The Board for Actuarial Standards, which regulates the profession, has been pressing it to adopt mortality guidelines on its own.Fewer than 0.5 per cent of schemes take the conservative approach of using the PA92 long corhort table, while only 55 per cent use a less rigorous table known as PA92 medium cohort, which assumes average life of about 87 years. The remainder use tables that assume members will live between 82 and 87 years.Company pension schemes will now have to use assumptions about life expectancy that reflect what is actually happening to older people in the UK when setting funding arrangements, according to the proposed new rules.The proposals come as evidence mounts that, contrary to expectations at the start of this century, the trend towards strong improvements in life expectancy at older ages is rising.According to projections from Mercer Human Resource Consulting, the use of the regulator’s guideline projections means the number of retirees living to be 100 will be as high as 17 per cent of the total for some schemes.Because life expectancy is closely linked to social class, firms hiring mostly professionals and based in the south-east of England can expect more than half of workers to live until age 90 and 81 per cent will live to age 80. For national schemes with a diverse membership, only 3 per cent are likely to live past 100 and only a third will hit 90-years-old.The regulator’s move reflects rising concern that actuarial advisers to pension schemes are failing to reveal to customers how much final salary pension schemes really cost, and that this is even more than is already widely believed.Insurance companies are using tables that are more conservative than those used by pension schemes, and the Financial Services Authority is pressing insurers to make assumptions that are even more conservative.That is because all of the tables in use currently assume improvements in life expectancy to stop suddenly at some future date.Current scientific evidence shows that is a fallacy."
224;AON;AON Plc;2007-11-13T06:21:04Z;Financial services: Steady deliverers of growth;;Banking and life insurance set the Isle of Man on the path to its current prosperity and they are still the bedrocks of its economy, with their value to the island shown in the crowds of young office workers who pour into the streets of Douglas each lunchtime.About 3,200 work in banking and a further 2,400 in the life and pensions sector – important numbers on an island of 80,000 people.Barclays alone – the biggest private sector employer – employs about 1,200 in various businesses, according to Chris Connor, managing director of Barclays Wealth on the island.A variety of potential threats to the financial sector – including more offshore competition, a tougher stance by authorities in key markets such as Britain and Ireland, and an EU withholding tax on bank deposits – have not stopped the sector’s recent growth spurt, at least in terms of deposits.The banking sector held £48.9bn ($100.7bn) in deposits by the end of June, up from £40.5bn a year previously. About one-third of the deposits are in non-sterling denominations, according to the Financial Supervision Commission, the regulator.Meanwhile, the life insurance sector, one of the largest in the offshore world, had what the Insurance and Pensions Authority, its regulator, described as “exceptional” results in 2006 amid ideal conditions for growth.Gross premium income grew 40 per cent to £9.4bn and funds under management rose 27 per cent to £32.3bn.Annual average growth in funds managed has been 16.5 per cent over the past five years.The life sector has 17 companies authorised, while there are 43 banking licences and three building society licenses.Banking is heavily skewed towards UK and Irish institutions, with a host of familiar high street names. However, representatives of banks with UK parents nevertheless say they are doing more business from around the world.Given banking’s importance, there is an understandable desire on the island to make sure everything possible is being done to keep it growing.Scorpio Partnership, a consultancy, is soon to deliver a review of the sector it has been carrying out for the banking association and the government. (Jersey, a rival jurisdiction to the Isle of Man, has commissioned a similar review).John Spellman, director of Isle of Man Finance, the government’s financial services promotion agency, says that banking is going through significant changes because of factors such as the EU savings directive.“There is a number of challenges to the core business, which we and Jersey and Guernsey share, but there are also significant opportunities.”Mr Spellman says that India, China and Hong Kong are all areas where the Isle of Man can gain business.Andrew Ashworth, the managing director of Abacus Financial Services, says that one way to attract more business could be to bring in more “managed” banking – that is, operations that are run and staffed by one bank on behalf of another.But the banking sector is seen as having a tougher job to make improvements in its competitive position.Its performance inevitably depends heavily on business being generated by other sectors, while many of the island’s banks are in effect small branches of big UK and global institutions, with little autonomy to develop specific strategies.Bankers on the island appear relaxed about threats from things such as the EU savings directive, under which withholding tax is applied to savings interest, unless account holders choose to allow details of their accounts to be disclosed.Withholding tax is due to rise from 15 per cent to 20 per cent next year and reach 35 per cent in 2011.Simon Hull, managing director of Alliance & Leicester International on the island, says that most customers have opted to allow disclosure and says the EU’s efforts have helped “legitimise the jurisdiction”.Mr Connor of Barclays Wealth says that customers “want to be on the right side of regulation”.Greg Horton, managing director of Fairbairn Private Bank, says that the best banks are focusing on client services and product innovation.He explains: “There are still people who will do business here even if they are UK-resident and domiciled. They come because they get something that they cannot get locally.“You have got an environment here that breeds innovation. There is continual recalibration of products.”Mr Horton says the FSC – which, like other institutions on the island, is preparing for a visit from the International Monetary Fund in 2008 – has achieved its aspiration to reach international standards. “It is just as detailed the UK,” he says.With years of virtually full employment on the island, finding staff is sometimes a concern.Many banks are working hard to foster links with local schools, to try to generate interest in gaining more skills and a more high-flying career path.Mr Connor says: “There are not enough quality resources for everyone – but there are enough for the best employers.”Mr Horton says that the island is 20-25 per cent cheaper for staff than Jersey, where Fairbairn also has offices.………………………………………………………………….Captive insurance can be a way to land big fishCaptive insurance provision is the third part of the Isle of Man’s financial services sector to have been subjected to a lengthy review over the past year. The review came after this area failed to see hoped-for growth.There were 133 captive insurance companies as of March 31, a decline of two within 12 months. The Insurance and Pensions Authority, the regulator, acknowledges that the non-life insurance sector – made up mostly of captives – has had a difficult operating environment. Applications to operate are below the levels of the height of the market. Premium income from the non-life sector was £1.14bn during 2006, down from £1.35bn in 2005.“The maturity of the ‘traditional’ captive market means that maintaining growth in this area is likely to be a continuing challenge for the foreseeable future,” the IPA pointed out in its most recent annual report. “The question of market access remains a significant issue for the non-life insurance sector, with jurisdictions within the EU remaining a significant threat to the Isle of Man’s competitive position.”The review was conducted by Norman Bennet, a former chairman of the London-based Association of Insurance and Risk Managers. Derek Patience, chairman of the Manx Insurance Managers’ Association and head of Marsh’s office on the island, says the review recognised the product offering was fairly competitive. But in common with the review of the funds industry, it identified shortcomings in marketing and promotion. Guernsey is seen as being much more visible as a jurisidiction for captives.Representatives within the sector have also tried to strengthen MIMA to articulate their interests more successfully to the government. “Things have changed a lot in the past 12 to 18 months,” says Mike Henthorn, Aon’s managing director and the association’s deputy chairman.The government welcomes attempts to strengthen the sector. Captive insurance tends to bring bigger global companies into contact with the island, often through high-level trips by executives for captive companies’ meetings. “Captive insurance is not a high volume business but can be tremendously complex,” says Mr Patience.Historic links have been with the UK and some 60 per cent of captive companies have UK parents. A cluster of power, utility and consumer electronics and telecommunications companies have established Manx captives, including Kelda (owners of Yorkshire Water), Dixons, Carphone Warehouse, BT and Centrica.
225;AON;AON Plc;2007-11-01T03:29:40Z;Aon to axe more than 6% of global workforce;;Aon, one of the world’s largest insurance brokers, is cutting 2,700 jobs worldwide – more than 6 per cent of its global workforce – the company announced on Wednesday.“The job cuts will be primarily in the Americas and Europe,” David Prosperi, the company’s chief spokesman, told the Financial Times. Aon stressed that the cuts would primarily affect workers who do not deal directly with clients.The insurance broker said the restructuring was the second phase of a strategy it began in 2005. “This restructuring plan has a similar approach to that of our 2005 restructuring plan, which has had very positive results,” said Greg Case, Aon’s president and chief executive. “We are continuing efforts to simplify our complex organisation.”Mr Prosperi dismissed the suggestion that the losses were connected with anything external to the business. “The idea is to simplify our organisation, make ourselves more efficient and grow,” he said.The company said the latest cuts would incur about $360m in charges but would deliver up to $70m of savings next year, up to $200m in 2009 and $240m in 2010.The restructuring plan at Aon, which employs 43,000 people, calls for the elimination of 1,600 jobs and outsourcing of a further 1,100 positions. The group said it would merge some finance, human resources and information technology operations and “evaluate options to consolidate and simplify” European operations.The cuts came as Aon announced third-quarter results ahead of many analysts’ expectations.Profits rose by 92 per cent to $204m, or 64 cents per share, from $106m, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier on an 11 per cent rise in revenues to $2.41bn.The company cited growth in brokerage and insurance underwriting premiums and higher consulting fees.Aon shares rose 0.2 per cent to $45.32. They have risen 28 per cent this year.
226;AON;AON Plc;2007-09-13T03:16:46Z;Clouds on the horizon at Monte Carlo gathering;;At insurance broker Aon’s lavish party at the reinsurance industry’s annual get-together in Monte Carlo, the cabaret consisted of a musical group, including several slinkily clad singers who snaked through the crowds of reinsurers and brokers.Their choice of opening numbers, as they sang beneath the sparkling lights of a sumptuous ballroom whose roof peeled away to expose the night sky, could not have been more appropriate: “Diamonds are a Girl’s Best Friend”, “Material Girl” and “Big Spender”.Two years of rocketing prices for many types of reinsurance, together with a startling absence of big hurricanes hitting US shores, mean reinsurers are awash with cash.But many at the annual Rendez-Vous, which according to insurance folklore rivals the Grand Prix for the income it brings to Monte Carlo, fear the good times may be coming to an end. The talk in the ornate salons, where insurers and reinsurers kick off price negotiations on policies set to be renewed in January, was of weakening prices across most sectors of the market.According to James Veghte, head of Bermuda-based XL Capital’s reinsurance operations: “There is no question that there is competition and pressure across virtually all lines of business.”One reinsurance executive put it more bluntly. Without a big catastrophe, the price reductions at January renewal will be “pretty brutal”.But the pressure follows two years when the cost of cover for portfolios at risk from catastrophes spiralled in the wake of 2005’s hurricane season, which inflicted up to $80bn of claims on insurers and reinsurers.So far, this year has not seen a big hurricane hitting the US. But unlike 2006, when the claims environment was extraordinarily benign, 2007 has seen a number of claims, dubbed as “frequency” events by Munich Re.These include the floods in the UK, which are expected to have inflicted claims of about £3bn ($6bn), most of which will be absorbed by insurers, and windstorm Kyrill in Europe, which is estimated to have cost about €5bn ($6.9bn).Wilhelm Zeller, chief executive of Hannover Re, expects reinsurance price “reactions” to these weather events.Torsten Jeworrek, a member of Munich Re’s management board and chairman of its reinsurance committee, says in areas hit by Kyrill and the UK floods, “we see absolutely no room for decreases, but …the need for increases”.But several other concerns threatened to cloud the Mediterranean skies. One talking point was the impact of the crisis in the subprime mortgage market on the reinsurance sector.One fear is that lawsuits could be brought against executives running companies caught up in the maelstrom. This could lead to claims under directors’ and officers’ policies, which are purchased to protect executives from paying out of their pockets in cases arising from their duties as a director.Jacques Aigrain, chief executive of Swiss Re, the world’s biggest reinsurer, was more optimistic. He suggested that the crisis in the credit markets, precipitated by events in the US subprime mortgage sector, could be good for reinsurers.Mr Aigrain said the credit crunch had forced a reassessment of the prices demanded for bearing risk across the board.As reinsurance involved the bearing of risk, then “the pricing of reinsurance could be perceived as being sustainable”, he said.While it did not appear that insurance companies were facing a “material subprime problem”, the recent market turmoil would increase volatility within their balance sheets.With insurance executives facing this uncertainty, they may try to control risk in other areas. One way to do this is to buy more reinsurance, or at least not retain as much risk on their own balance sheets – a trend reinsurers have grappled with over the past few years.Another trend that traditional reinsurers have had to contend with has been the arrival of hedge funds, which have either backed new reinsurance companies or provided cover themselves, through special instruments collateralised with cash.One question now is what effect the credit crisis will have on hedge funds’ appetite for reinsurance.According to Mr Aigrain, without access to cheap borrowing, hedge funds might not be able to provide as much reinsurance.Events in the credit markets, talks between insurers and reinsurers in the run-up to the renewal and the remainder of the hurricane season will all play their part in determining whether the good times continue to roll for reinsurers, or whether the champagne will flow slightly less freely at next year’s Rendez-Vous.
227;AON;AON Plc;2007-09-10T08:21:02Z;Getting a grip on a new reality;;The past few years should have been a wake-up call for US companies wanting to manage their risk.Everything from the string of damaging hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico to the recalls of Chinese-made products has demonstrated the need to protect against outside risk.Yet those in the industry say many US companies still think of risk as internal, and something that can be protected with insurance.They do not recognise that in the past 10 years the business model for many has changed because of “a relentless drive for efficiency and productivity,” says John Merkovsky, global leader of the Risk Consulting practice for Marsh, a leading international insurance broker and strategic risk adviser.This has led to an increase in outsourcing and globalisation.“It has greatly changed the risk profile of many companies in ways they have yet to come to grips with,” says Mr Merkovsky.Take the hurricanes of the past few years. While many companies felt they had prepared for the worst, by insuring their own facilities against damage, even the bigger, more sophisticated companies did not take into account the risk to their businesses from exposure to delays caused by lack of capacity at shipyards.The unforeseen hit to their revenue came from an inability to increase production after the storm because they could not obtain replacement parts or manpower to make repairs, says Jim Pierce of Marsh’s Global Marine & Energy practice.Now, the more pragmatic and innovative of those companies have contracts to put them at the top of the list for repairs should their facilities face another such damaging blow.Nonetheless, Mr Pierce remains frustrated with just how many companies still look at managing risk as buying insurance.“The rise in energy prices has given many energy companies a false sense of security,” he says.“Their strong balance sheets disguise the fact that they still haven’t adequately planned for the consequences of a catastrophic uncontrollable event. It’s probably going to take such an uncontrollable event to wake them up.”That is what has happened in recent months to companies that outsourced to suppliers in China. They thought they were reducing costs by making products in a cheaper market, but they failed to price in the possibility of poor quality controls that have led to the recent wave of recalls on items ranging from Chinese-made toys to toothpaste and pyjamas.“An effective policy for companies would be to price those in at the onset,” says Mr Merkovsky.Mark Quinn, associate director at Aon, a leading provider of risk management services, said in a recent statement that Chinese manufacturers were beginning to realise that, to trade on a worldwide basis, many customers will make it a contractual requirement for their suppliers to buy product recall protection.But this will only be available after comprehensive assessment of the individual risk by insurers.“Insurers will demand evidence of testing and controls throughout the supply chain,” he said. “This appears to have been lacking in some cases and contributed to the high level of recalls emanating from the region.”But Mr Quinn also insisted companies across the supply chain should be conducting due diligence on suppliers’ quality control processes.“Businesses trading with China need to consider the knock-on effect to their business”This comprehensive evaluation of risk is what those in the industry say has been lacking in recent years.Marcela Donadio, Americas oil and gas practice leader for Ernst & Young, says many companies have managed their risk from a “silo perspective,” compartmentalising it into legal risk, insurance risk and regulatory risk, for instance. In doing so, she says, companies have failed to obtain an accurate picture of risk facing them.“They need to think more about how decisions affect company risk company-wide,’’ says Ms Donadio. Mark Crosno, a vice-president of SolArc, software provider for global energy companies, says sales of its products to manage risk have been picking up in recent years as companies seek to assess their exposure at any given time.The increased pressure to report risk, following the collapse of Enron, the world’s biggest energy trader, in 2001, and new regulations to protect against another financial crisis, have been the main drivers.Nonetheless, Mr Merkovsky says the biggest threat to most companies continues to be that they do not understand what creates value. Only once that is understood can they begin to protect that value.By way of example, he cites a recent client that ran all its goods out through one port in China, exposing its bottom line to a big hit in the event of a typhoon or a terrorist attack in the area. The challenge is getting companies to see risk in this way.The single worst managed issue by companies, he says, is reputational risk, because reputation is a huge asset, even though it does not show up on a balance sheet.He noted that, if you ask a company who runs its securities risk, or compliance risk, management will always have an answer. But there will be nobody managing risks to reputation.To do so effectively, he says, companies must go beyond insurance and run through scenarios of their entire business to assess effectively risks that cannot be protected with insurance.“It’s about having an effective response to those events,’’ Mr Merkovsky says.
228;AON;AON Plc;2007-09-02T21:12:20Z;Mover becomes shaker at Aon UK;;Australian-born Peter Harmer may have arrived in London only at the beginning of the year to wield his broom through Aon UK but he does not regard himself as the new kid on the block.Mr Harmer had 20 years with the US-headquartered insurance broking group before becoming chief executive of Aon UK in January, succeeding Dennis Mahoney, who became chairman of Aon Global, a new unit focusing on big corporates.“Once you do six months you are no longer new,” says Mr Harmer, “What that means is you cease becoming part of the solution and you are now part of the problem.”Several traumatic years for British insurance brokers have forced them revamp their businesses, including Aon, which is the number one by brokerage in the UK.Mr Harmer has set out a strategy for taking Aon forward after the “life changing event” of no longer accepting contingent commissions – special bonuses paid by insurers to brokers for bringing in large amounts of business – which forced it to overturn its business model and cut 1,200 jobs in the past three years.His plan to streamline Aon UK’s operations further are designed to provide more growth opportunities and move it away from the broking world’s tendency for “pushing products”, towards a more advice-driven model.He has already shaken up the UK management team, appointing John Cullen as chief financial officer, and David Mead as chief operating officer. Previously, Mr Cullen was finance director for one of Aon’s UK subsidiaries, while Mr Mead was group operations director.Mr Harmer acknowledges that the decision to cease accepting contingent commissions – a step that has not been universally followed across the insurance broking industry – has had far-reaching consequences for the UK business.Aon UK was forced to concentrate on its core broking and advisory activities, hiring about 3,800 people in the past three years, mostly in roles dealing directly with clients.“Aon’s decision to cease accepting contingent commissions has changed our economic model here in the UK. But the work of the preceding two years has largely addressed that,” he says.The group has also decided to reject a new form of incentive payment – known as supplemental commissions – that some US insurers have proposed paying to brokers, because it is not satisfied they are sufficiently different from contingent commissions.“That is the nub of the issue. I think perhaps there is not as much as difference as some would have you believe,” says Mr Harmer.He does not rule out further job cuts as part of the broker’s latest repositioning, but he says that where possible, Aon will try to avoid compulsory redundancies.The new strategy comes as UK insurance prices remain intensely competitive. Pricing is important to brokers because they typically earn a percentage of the premium. So when prices are higher, they earn more.The prices charged to big UK companies for their insurance are continuing to fall, although there are signs of stability in some areas. Some insurers and brokers expect the £3bn of insurance claims from this summer’s flooding to increase UK insurance prices. Mr Harmer, however, is not convinced.“I think in the scheme of things, the losses are not significant enough to have a tipping effect on prices,” he says.Aon’s new strategy is aimed at delivering organic growth. But it is also open to making acquisitions.“I think there is still quite a lot left to play out in the consolidation game here in the UK. There are still a number of firms who I think are perhaps open to being acquired,” he says.Aon has this year acquired two insurance brokers specialising in classic cars – Footman James in January and most recently Firebond. Mr Harmer is particularly keen on brokers arranging cover for high net worth individuals.“People are acquiring more expensive toys: classic vehicles, pleasure craft, private planes,” he says. “As more and more of our clients develop exposures in these areas, we want to be in a position to help them.”Aon is also a leading participant in the burgeoning market for insurance-linked securities – where insurance risks are transferred to capital market investors – becoming involved in the issuance of catastrophe bonds.One of the uncertainties now facing the insurance and reinsurance industries is whether the crisis in the credit markets will have a knock-on effect on insurance linked securities, although at the moment, the signs are that they are insulated from the turmoil.“The view from our experts here is that the markets are uncorrelated, so we are not expecting to see an impact on our capital markets activity as a result of the credit crunch,” says Mr Harmer.
229;AON;AON Plc;2007-05-31T17:23:18Z;Ministers warned over pension cuts;;Two-thirds of companies expect to reduce their pension contributions when the new system of personal accounts arrives in 2012, and three-quarters of employers expect a rise in closures of good workplace schemes.The findings by the Association of Consulting Actuaries, from a survey of 330 employers with schemes covering 2.1m members, will make gloomy reading for the government as the new scheme is intended to boost private pension saving.Employers will be required to put in 3 per cent of pay when people are automatically enrolled into personal accounts. Employees will have the option to opt out.The government is keen to discourage those employers who now put more into employees’ pensions from cutting contributions. It is backing ideas from the National Association of Pension Funds for a “quality mark” to encourage employers to retain the better schemes.But Ian Farr, the ACA chairman, said its survey sent a warning to ministers.“All too often over the past 20 years, well-intended legislation has led on to damaging consequences for good existing pension provision,” he said. “Whilst the idea behind personal accounts is laudable – extending pension coverage to more employees – it is clear from these findings that many may lose out unless great care is taken.”Existing schemes would need positive encouragement and less regulatory burden if the law of unintended consequences was not to apply.Employers will have to contribute to the pensions of a greater number of employees because they will be automatically enrolled into the scheme. As a result, 31 per cent of employers in the ACA survey said they were likely to restrict entry into occupational schemes, with the figure rising to 42 per cent for smaller firms.More than a third of smaller companies – employing up to 250 – said they would consider scrapping existing scheme in favour of personal accounts, reducing their contributions in the process. A similar proportion said they were likely to reduce existing benefits to help meet the extra cost of paying for more people. The ACA said a “pension apartheid” looked likely to develop in the private sector between those still in good schemes and those offered lower benefits.Concerns over the effects of personal accounts come despite continuing improvements in pension fund deficits. Almost a half of the 200 largest pension funds are now in surplus, Aon Consulting calculates, thanks chiefly to rising equity markets and bond yields.But Aon says it does not expect this to stop the growing trend for schemes that have closed to new entrants taking the next step of halting further contributions from existing members.
230;AON;AON Plc;2007-05-18T20:42:18Z;Major UK pension schemes in the black;;Britain’s largest pension schemes have moved into the black for the first time in more than five years, suggesting that many of the nation’s employers have turned a corner in their battle to avert a future pensions crisis.Aon Consulting, which tracks the 200 largest pension schemes, says it is the first time companies have been able to show a surplus since the vexatious pension accounting standard, FRS17, was introduced in June 2001.“I think it is a symbolic day and it is a great step forward,” said Marcus Hurd, senior consultant and actuary at Aon. But he said it remained to be seen whether the aggregate surplus would persist.“The extent to which schemes are in accounting surplus is not enough to buy out all benefits,” Mr Hurd warned. “Surplus can be here today and gone tomorrow.” A drop in equity markets or a fall in interest rates could erase scheme gains overnight.He warned that even an accounting surplus may not be enough to meet all pension promises.The move into surplus – which came at 3.25pm on Friday – reflects a steep rise in yields on AA-rate corporate bonds, the rate at which liabilities are discounted for accounting rules.The IBoxx 15-year AA corporate bond yield closed at 5.51 per cent on Friday. At the end of 2005, just before their trough, the yield was 4.6 per cent. That move will have cut liabilities by at least 20 per cent.The strong rise in equities has also helped. However, volatility in February produced an aggregate deficit of £50bn for these same schemes.Narrowing pension deficits have prompted employers’ groups to urge the government to permit them to take cash out of their schemes. The Department for Work and Pensions has said it will consider the issue.When it was introduced, FRS17 offered the most realistic picture of pension finances at any particular point in time.However, insurers use more conservative assumptions when they agree to take liabilities off corporate balance sheets.Mr Hurd said Aon was urging clients to be careful about how much cash they add to schemes showing an accounting surplus.While companies whose schemes remain open to existing employees can show that surplus on their balance sheet, those who have cut off staff to further accruals cannot.
231;AON;AON Plc;2007-05-08T14:01:47Z;Insurance rates: ‘Florida remains a big question mark’;;After the sharp increase in the cost of some types of insurance and reinsurance in the wake of 2005’s record hurricane season, indications are that prices have peaked.Recent evidence from brokers Aon and Willis suggests that even in areas of the market exposed to US hurricanes, prices are coming under pressure.Expectations of a softer reinsurance market have been reinforced by recent changes in Florida.In January, the state of Florida passed legislation that in effect doubled the size of its hurricane catastrophe fund, which offers reinsurance to companies writing homeowners’ insurance.Chris Hitchings, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, estimates that this could remove between $1.5bn and $2bn from the reinsurance market in Florida.The move could put further downward pressure on rates, as reinsurers seek to redirect the capital that would have backed Florida reinsurance business, to other areas of the market.But the move will have implications not just for the traditional reinsurance markets, but for the capital markets, which filled a shortfall of capacity in the wake of 2005’s hurricanes.Demand for alternatives such as catastrophe bonds, so-called side-cars, which provide additional capacity for a limited period, and instruments provided by hedge funds, soared in 2006.Insurers and reinsurers turned to the capital markets as they faced a shortage of reinsurance and so-called retrocession cover – effectively the reinsurance of reinsurance – to cover US windstorm risks and the prospect of paying high prices where such cover was available.According to reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter, part of Marsh & McLennan, total catastrophe bond issuance was $4.69bn in 2006, a 136 per cent rise on the previous record of $1.99bn in 2005. More than $8.48bn of bond principal was outstanding at the end of 2006, a 74 per cent increase on the $4.9bn outstanding at the end of 2005.Paul Schultz, president of Aon Capital Markets, estimates that about $3.3bn of capital was committed to side-cars last year, a similar level to that seen in 2005.Swiss Re, meanwhile, suggests the market for Industry Loss Warrants (ILW), whereby recovery under the contract is based on how large the industry loss is as measured by an external reporting service, could be as much as $4bn.Another significant development is the involvement of hedge funds in the reinsurance market, either by backing start-up reinsurers, or providing direct cover, through special instruments, usually backed with cash, such as ILWs.The hedge funds that piled into the reinsurance market in the wake of 2005’s ferocious hurricane season will have made healthy returns, because of the high price of reinsurance for areas exposed to hurricanes and an absence of significant US windstorm losses.One executive suggests the amount of capital committed by hedge funds through side-cars, ILWs and investments in catastrophe bonds, could be as much as $10bn.In a further sign of convergence between insurance and the capital markets, there have been a number of initiatives to trade insurance and reinsurance risks as derivative contracts.The New York Mercantile Exchange, in conjunction with reinsurance broker Gallagher Re, has begun trading catastrophe risks as derivative contracts.Icap, the interdealer broker, and insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson have teamed up to develop derivatives that insurers can use to protect themselves from unpredictable risks such as catastrophes.Meanwhile, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has begun trading hurricane futures and options in conjunction with reinsurance broker RK Carvill.But with expectations of downward pressure on the price of reinsurance, there is uncertainty as to whether the interest in capital market alternatives will match that seen in 2006.“Florida is a big question mark for 2007. It may delay transactions, as opposed to cancelling them. People may say we are not going to make a decision until we have more certainty about Florida,” says Mr Schultz.Aon Capital Markets is forecasting catastrophe bond issuance of closer to $2bn-$2.5bn this year, significantly lower than in 2006.Prior to the changes in Florida, Aon was expecting a level of issuance similar to that seen in 2006. Demand for ILWs and side-car structures is also expected to be lower this year than last.But, according to Mark Hvidsten, chief executive of Willis Capital Markets: “It is now more or less a standard part of the analysis that companies undertake when looking at their capital structure, to examine both traditional reinsurance and capital market alternatives. That is a sea-change”Christopher McGhee, head of Guy Carpenter’s investment banking specialty practice and managing director of MMC Securities, says that although demand for side-cars and catastrophe bond issuance are both expected to be lower this year than they were in 2006, clients are “still interested in obtaining risk transfer capacity from the capital markets, so we do not expect that source to dry up”.And of course, predictions for both reinsurance pricing and the impact of this on the capital markets could change rapidly if 2007 brought a high level of catastrophe losses, cutting capacity and forcing up prices.“It could be blown apart by a repeat of 2004 or 2005 in terms of hurricanes in the US,” warns Mr Hvidsten.
232;AON;AON Plc;2007-04-12T18:53:50Z;Chicago, LA race for 2016 Olympics;;Pat Ryan, chairman of insurance group Aon, took a long hard look at the T-shirt handed to him amid a crush of reporters in a cramped corner of the Macy’s department store in downtown Chicago.Wisely, Mr Ryan did not attempt to pull the limited edition “Chicago 2016” shirt over his neat suit, but there are few things the city’s business community will not do to help bring the summer Olympics to the Midwest for the first time.Chicago will square off against Los Angeles on Friday at a meeting of the US Olympic Committee in Washington DC to decide which – if any – US city will front a bid for the 2016 games.The two cities have taken markedly different approaches in the run-up to this weekend’s decision, with Chicago boasting experience of hard work and LA – a two-time Olympic host – focusing on glitz and its past experience.Chicago has been unashamed in promoting the potential economic benefits of hosting the games, using it as a springboard to revitalise parts of its lakefront and south side.The focus of a Los Angeles bid will be to reignite interest in sport, rather than the economic regeneration which has fired Chicago’s mayor, Richard M Daley, to galvanise the local business community. “We want to bring audiences back to the Olympics,” says Barry Sanders, executive counsel at law firm Latham & Watkins and chairman of the Southern California Committee for the Olympic Games.“I think that Chicago, being a city of celebration and celebrating sport, there will never be an Olympics with so many people involved,” countered Mr Ryan this week, as both teams put the finishing touches to their presentations.The Californian committee was formed in 1939 – seven years after LA hosted its first games – and its 60-member board cuts across business, politics, sports and the arts.The bid has secured support from prominent companies based in the city, such as Walt Disney and Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns London’s Millennium Dome and the Staples Center, home of the Los Angeles Lakers.Chicago responded last June by naming its own bid panel, headed by Mr Ryan and including the sort of heavyweight business and civic leaders who have been instrumental in previous public-private partnerships, such as the modernisation of O’Hare airport and the building of Millennium Park.Mr Ryan leads a panel that includes Boeing chief executive Jim McNerney and John Madigan, the former Tribune Company chief now running the Madison Dearborn private equity group. It has established a $30m war chest to fight the international round of the battle if it wins approval from the US Olympic Committee.“In my experience living in several cities in the US and overseas, I have never seen a business community as united as that in Chicago,” says Mark Angelson, chief executive of RR Donnelly, the world’s largest printing group, and a member of the organising committee.The USOC is headed by Peter Ueberroth, who is credited with reinventing Olympics economics by successfully turning a profit from the Los Angeles games in 1984.The US is likely to face opposition from Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and at least five other cities for the 2016 games, with a final decision not due until 2009.

234;AON;AON Plc;2007-03-09T15:13:21Z;Dream homes can turn into worst nightmares;;Owning a Grade II listed Georgian manor house, with exposed beams and flagstone floor sounds like the epitome of aspirational living.But the costs of partially rebuilding such a property if it is damaged can be astronomical, and many owners of listed properties may only find out that they have not taken out adequate insurance after it is too late. In the event of a catastrophe, such as that of the thatched listed property in Sussex which caught fire (pictured right), rebuild costs can spiral into hundreds of thousands of pounds.According to NFU Mutual, an insurer of rural properties, three quarters of all listed properties in the UK may be underinsured.The reason for this is that rebuild costs can exceed the value of the property. This contrasts with the rebuild costs on many conventional properties which can be far lower than the property’s market value.For would-be buyers of listed properties, it is important to take into account annual premiums for buildings insurance which can be significantly higher.This is because any repairs done to a listed property must be conducted in the same material, often using traditional methods. If a wall has been constructed of wattle and daub, it is not acceptable to repair it with plaster. The older the building, the more specialised the repair work, which makes it likely the owner will need to hire a skilled (and therefore pricey) craftsman to carry it out.If you do own a listed property, try to get an insurance policy with an unlimited sum insured so that if rebuilding costs go above the original estimate you will still be covered. Specialist insurers in this area include Gauntlet, Chubb, Aon and Hiscox.Local councils and English Heritage take this matter very seriously. Carrying out unauthorised work to a listed building is a criminal offence punishable by a fine or a prison sentence.There are around 370,000 properties protected by listing by English Heritage, and of these the vast majority are Grade II. It is unlikely you will be able to get an unlimited sum insured on a Grade I listed building because of the complexities involved in assessing rebuild costs.If you own a listed property, or other building with non-standard construction such as a thatched roof, the Association of British Insurers recommends you contact an insurance broker for details of specialist providers. Alternatively you could contact the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (www.rics.org) and arrange for your property to be independently surveyed by a specialist surveyor.NFU insurers offer a service that allows customers a valuation with Cunningham Lindsay. Customers can reclaim the cost of the valuation if they hold their insurance policy for five years.

They are based on public nominations and the decision of judgesStuart Rose, Marks and Spencer chief executive, won the business award, beating the other nominees, Stanley Fink of Man Group and Penny Newman of Café Direct.And if the Golden Globes are a pointer to the Oscars, what about the Great Britons? Dame Helen Mirren won the arts category over Sacha Baron Cohen and David Hockney.

But he also shows that there’s no need for rancour towards an old flame after a break-up.At the beginning of 2006, Woolworths issued a profits warning after a deal between its EUK distribution arm and Tesco ended acrimoniously.A year on, the division is one of the retailer’s few bright spots but Bish-Jones has not forgotten his former customer. “And should you think this [invitation] extravagant given the financial performance …well in the spirit of ‘every little helps’, I will leave you to guess how EUK has a spare table for me to use!”Shovelling itThe government’s decision this week to block a largely residential development at Peruvian Wharf, on the north bank of the Thames, east of the Isle of Dogs, may lead to resumption of cargo-handling there.The Port of London Authority said it had well-developed plans for the site to be used for handling recycled waste and building materials, including aggregrates linked to construction of the London 2012 Olympics complex.Both uses seem a bit more neighbourly than the cargo that gave Peruvian Wharf its name – guano imported from South America in the 19th century for use as fertiliser.It’s a trunk callAon director Charles Keville was forced to conduct a press briefing by conference call from his railway carriage just south of East Croydon on Thursday after a tree blocked the line.The train did eventually start to move but only shortly before the end of the briefing at Aon’s Devonshire Square offices on its Political and Economic Risk Map.Keville also lamented that the insurance broker had not come up with a symbol to depict “Celebrity Big Brother risk,” after the furore over alleged racist bullying of Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty.Ifs, ands & buttsThursday’s stormy weather and the lifting of some hosepipe bans was not the only reason for a 7 per cent fall in shares in Straight, the water-butt maker that saw demand soar last year.The company, run by the extravagantly moustachioed Jonathan Straight (does anyone ever dare to call him “butthead”?) got its own internal plumbing in a tangle after trying to cope with the flood of orders, which pushed up costs.DHL will now take over its warehousing and distribution. No doubt with an eye on the weather, Straight said trading was in line with expectations.Fit for porpoiseDeep-Sea Leisure, the aquarium operator, said on Thursday that it had reduced staff turnover by implementing a “a range of human resources policies” including “competency-based recruitment”.Meritocracy – it’s a revolutionary concept.Gotta speed it up“Celebrity Big Brother” inevitably sets one musing about the ephemeral nature of public recognition.Mudlark noticed an ad on the Tube for a hair restorer on Thursday, endorsed by Cheryl Baker.

236;AON;AON Plc;2006-10-25T17:38:00Z;Cutlers Gardens goes for £410m;;Cutlers Gardens goes for £410mAmericans are the new big spenders on London commercial property, it seems. Mudlark can reveal that Cutlers Gardens in EC2 has just been bought for about £410m by Rockpoint, a US real estate fund.The sale of Cutlers, a 600,000 sq ft estate of 12 office blocks, is one of the biggest property deals in the history of the City.A joint venture between JPMorgan and US fund manager O’Connor Capital was the seller.Other big US purchases this year include Linklaters’ head office, bought by Beacon Capital for £330m, and Liffe’s HQ, bought for £206m by Atlas Capital.Beacon may also be frontrunner to buy Swiss Re’s Gherkin.Rockpoint’s purchase of Cutlers Gardens happened in just a fortnight. The buildings, at Devonshire Square – between Liverpool Street and the Gherkin – are currently let to tenants including Aon, the insurance company.They were redeveloped by Sir Stuart Lipton’s company, Greycoat, in the early 1980s from former warehouses once used by the East India Company.The estate is due for a revamp, which will include the first hotel in Britain by Missoni, the Italian fashion company.Des Red SquareIt was only a matter of time before Savills, upmarket property agents, would find itself in Moscow, seat of some of the world’s most enthusiastic homebuyers.Mudlark now hears that Savills has taken a multi-million pound stake in Intermark, Russia’s largest estate agent.The investment makes strategic sense given the increased, albeit hesitant, international interest in Russian property.But there are benefits for Savills in London. Russian tycoons have been among the most hardy buyers of £5m-plus homes in Chelsea, Belgravia and Mayfair – accounting for more than one in five such deals last year. A new joint venture called Intermark Savills is to be launched, according to market sources. A similar deal on the commercial property side is more than likely in due course.Lehman’s lineoutOxford and Cambridge rugby players will have the sponsor’s name on their shirts for the first time at the 2006 Varsity Match.The deal with Lehman Brothers follows 30 years of sponsorship by CT Bowring and then its 1982 acquirer Marsh & McClennan. It was secured with little time to spare, less than two months before the December 12 match at Twickenham.Initially only for a year, the link-up is the bank’s first high-profile sport sponsorship in the UK, says Simon Halliday, Lehman’s head of equity sales for financial institution shares.Halliday, however, wears another cap – he won 23 of them in eight years as centre for England – in this context. Now a member of the Rugby Union Council, Halliday was a three-time Oxford blue, although on the winning side only once.Saucy solicitorsSurely only in Scotland would a firm of solicitors boast of its geographical coverage by reference to what partners put on their chips? A display advert by MacRoberts in the Scottish Legal Review, published by the Scotsman newspaper, solemnly averred: “Over a third of our partners prefer salt and sauce.”To the chip-munching natives, this was another way of saying that the 14 partners in question are based in Edinburgh rather than in the firm’s other office in Glasgow.One of the more piquant of the many cultural chasms that divide the two cities is that Glaswegians put salt and vinegar on their fish suppers, while denizens of the Scottish capital favour the said “salt and sauce”.Mudlark’s (admittedly Glaswegian) source describes the latter as “a vile brown concoction which regularly appals unwary visitors”.
237;AON;AON Plc;2006-10-20T18:22:12Z;Warning on pension age rules;;Revised age discrimination rules could lead to a wave of occupational pension schemes closing to further contributions from existing members, pension advisers and lawyers have warned.Such a move would lead to big cuts in benefits for older employees and a widespread levelling down of pension benefits, a string of advisers, including Mercer, Aon, Hewitt and Punter Southall, have told the government.The Department for Work and Pensions on Friday appeared to acknowledge the issue. It said it was “listening to industry concerns” and insisted ministers would consider “all the options for implementation”.Advisers said there were still several problems with the revised regulations, which were rushed out last week after the government scrapped its first effort. It put back implementation of the new rules to December 1 – now just six weeks away.One key issue concerns schemes under the same pension umbrella. Under the legislation, it appears companies will be unable to pay lower amounts into a money purchase pension, whose members are typically younger, while paying higher amounts into a final salary pension that is closed to new entrants and whose members are typically older.Such a difference in payments was likely to be judged “indirectly discriminatory” against younger workers, Mercer and others said. Employers were likely “to be pushed into a corner, and may have little option than to reduce existing members’ benefits in order to comply with the new age discrimination rules”, Deborah Cooper, a principal at Mercer, said.John Cridland, deputy director- general of the CBI employers’ organisation, said the issue “is a highly technical one” but he feared it could have “a very big impact”. “We cannot believe that is what ministers intended. What we need is legislation that tackles age discrimination while maintaining existing pension provision, not reducing it,” he said.Aon Consulting and Hewitt Associates said a big number of defined contribution schemes also faced legal uncertainty where the contributions were related to age. “This could see overall contributions being cut or even schemes closed,” Paul McGlone of Aon said.Some advisers and the CBI urged the government to provide much wider exemption to pension schemes from the age discrimination rules. That could be done, they argued, by using the so-called “public policy” clause, which allows exemptions when they are in the public interest.The DWP said the directive did “not allow a blanket exemption for all age-related aspects of occupational schemes” but stressed it was working with employers and the industry to find solutions.
238;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;The danger of being an executive;;British executives have had a rude awakening. Several high-profile cases have underlined risks directors face, particularly when doing business in the US.Such incidents include the recent extradition of three former NatWest bankers to the US on Enron-related fraud charges, and turmoil in the online gaming industry. The so-called “NatWest Three” have consistently protested their innocence.“Without a doubt, the publicity that has resulted, particularly starting with the NatWest Three, caused directors to for the first time look at their exposure in the US,” says Lee Lindsay, technical director of legal, for directors and officers insurance at Aon.Several Aon clients called the broker to inquire whether extradition would be covered by their directors’ and officers’ (D&O) insurance policy.Ms Lindsay says it has always been Aon’s position that a D&O policy should cover costs of opposing an extradition. “It has certainly raised the hair on the back of the heads of directors and officers in the UK,” she says.D&O insurance protects the director or officer from paying from their own pocket in a case arising from their duties as a director of a corporation. This would cover acts, omissions or misrepresentations committed by the individual while acting for a company.Fraud is excluded. However, Ms Lindsay says policies Aon places would cover defence costs, if a director was alleged to have committed fraud, until there was an adjudication that the director did commit the acts.However, the majority of allegations against directors are settled before they reach court.Ms Lindsay points out there is not a directors’ and officers’ insurance policy responding on behalf of the NatWest Three. She says the case has become a shining example of the advantages of having directors’ personal liability covered by D&O insurance.Despite the increasing risks associated with running companies, Ms Lindsay says D&O cover is still not as common in the UK as in the US. “In the UK there are many companies that do not carry D&O insurance,” she says.“However, I can’t believe for one moment that directors and officers sitting on the boards of companies that don’t have cover, are not going to bring up at their next board meeting,” she says.British directors also face the prospect of a new Companies Act, and must already comply with stringent corporate governance codes that make risk management their explicit responsibility.But UK companies also face physical risks. The threat from terrorism, demonstrated last year by the July 7 attacks in London, has been underlined by the alleged plot to blow up transatlantic airliners. According to Justin Priestley, a director in Aon’s crisis management division: “Unfortunately, there will be an underlying risk from terrorism in the UK for the foreseeable future.”When it comes to the threat from natural catastrophes, attention usually focuses on hurricanes in the US, but the UK is also at risk. Matthew Foote, senior catastrophe risk analyst at Willis, the insurance broker, says Thames flooding is a significant risk for the UK.“The Thames has the potential for both river flooding and storm surge, in the place with Britain’s largest concentration of risk. It is a very interesting problem, particularly with the wider debate on climate change.”Meanwhile, there remains debate about one of the traditional ways of laying off risk – insurance. UK companies’ commercial motor and property insurance remains competitive, although Dane Douetil, chief executive of Brit Insurance, says there are “some very early signs of that coming to an end”.But attention has focused on the relationship companies have with their insurance broker.The Financial Services Authority, the chief City regulator, recently weighed into the debate.John Tiner, chief executive of the FSA, said this month it would investigate forcing insurance brokers to disclose to customers their commission.At the moment, the regulator requires brokers to disclose it only if a customer requests it.The FSA had previously indicated it would prefer the industry to come up with its own solution, and forcing brokers to disclose commissions would be a last resort.But Mr Tiner said the broking and underwriting communities were “locked in conflict” and an industry-led solution was “light years away.”“We feel the time has come for us to take a more objective and forensic look at the possibility of mandating commission disclosure,” says Mr Tiner.
239;AON;AON Plc;2006-04-28T16:08:41Z;Negative vibes can be your best friend;;You might think that, from time to time, I get a stock idea or two from Wall Street analysts. It’s true that I do get ideas but not in the way you might imagine. I actively look for companies that analysts do not like, not for ones that they do.If a company is universally admired, if analyst reports are full of praise and compliments, then the stock will usually sell at a premium. The good news is generally priced into the stock, and then some. When a company is widely criticised by analysts, when bad news is emphasized in their reports, that, too, will be reflected in the stock price.Wall Street analysts, like most investors, tend to overreact to both good news and bad news. It is the analytical bias toward linearity that gets them into trouble. Whether a particular company is enveloped by good news or bad news does not matter. More of the same, whether good or bad, is projected, in a linear fashion, into the future.Bargain hunters can take advantage of Wall Street analysts and their bias by sifting through reports looking for companies where negativity is pervasive. When the negativity is concentrated around temporary, fixable problems, there’s a good chance the investor has found a bargain.In the face of some temporary bad news in late 1994, the stock of leading hospital provider HCA was hit with eight consecutive analyst downgrades. After the fifth of these, the stock hit a 52-week low at $34.70 and started to rise. About six months later the stock was higher by 50 per cent.Did the analysts miss something when they downgraded HCA en masse in late 1994? The group was, in fact, suffering temporary problems such as an increase in uninsured hospital patients. Getting the facts right, however, is just the first step in the process. The second is to determine whether or not the negative information is already discounted into the stock price. In the case of HCA, the bad news was not only fully discounted, it was overly discounted.When analysts are acting in unison they become a proxy for the crowd on Wall Street. Contrarians understand there is money to be made by going in the opposite direction from the crowd. When the crowd is uniformly positive, it is time to get negative. When the crowd is uniformly negative, it is time to get positive.Even when there are numerous analysts covering a stock, there is often a uniformity of opinion. One year ago only one out of 19 analysts was bullish on the stock of insurance broker AON. The negativity surrounding it was uniform and substantial. But the negative sentiment was more than reflected in the too-cheap stock price. The stock has doubled in the last year, from $21 to $42.Overstock, which I mentioned in this column two months ago, is a company we have continued to buy recently in the face of uniform analyst negativity. Over the last month, every one of the five analyst reports published on Overstock has been negative. The negativity is overdone. This is one of the most undervalued companies I have seen in many years.Overstock is an internet retailer. Analysts put internet retailers in one of two brackets based on profitability. Profitable internet retailers win plenty of praise from analysts. If the internet retailer is profitable, a rich valuation is attributed to the stock – a value equal to two or three times sales is the norm. If an internet retailer is unprofitable, negative reports are the norm. Market values equal to half of sales are common for unprofitable internet retailers.Blue Nile is an example of an internet retailer in the first bracket. This leading jewellery retailer sells at three times sales. Overstock is in the second bracket, selling at half of sales because the company is unprofitable.To analysts of internet retailing it is an all or nothing proposition. Either you are profitable and deserving of a rich valuation or unprofitable and deserving of a big discount. There is ample opportunity for astute investors, then, in owning unprofitable internet retailers that are on the cusp of profitability.The mindset of analysts is a significant handicap here. Rather than extrapolating a lack of profits into the future in a linear fashion, an analyst has to take a more flexible, anticipatory view. It is not that difficult. For example, prior to profitability certain components of the income statement show demonstrable improvement.Evidence of impending profitability for Overstock is to be found in the growth in gross profit dollars. Gross profit dollars have grown from $26m in 2003 to $66m in 2004 (up 154 per cent), and to $121m in 2005 (up 83 per cent). As the company grows, many of these dollars will drop to the bottom line, or net profit. The benefit to the share price will be substantial. I expect shares of Overstock to at least triple in value by 2010.Arne Alsin is a portfolio manager for Alsin Capital and for the Turnaround fundarne@alsincapital.com
240;AON;AON Plc;2006-02-10T17:24:01Z;Decent earnings help to shrug off commodities dip;;Wall Street put in a resilient performance this week as a number of impressive earnings offset the impact of falling commodity prices which hit energy and mining stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to hold on to gains, adding 1.2 per cent over the week to 10,919.05 with the broader S&P 500 edging up 0.2 per cent to 1,266.99 while the Nasdaq eased back a fraction of a point to 2,261.88.Energy stocks slumped along with crude prices after an increase in US stockpiles offset supply concerns from key producers Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela.The S&P energy index was the worst performing industry group, down 4.5 per cent. EGO Resources, the oil and gas exploration company, led the decline, dropping 12.3 per cent over the five sessions to $69.37, while oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron fell 3.2 per cent to $59.43 and 1.5 per cent to $56.27 respectively.Metal producers and gold miners were not immune to falling commodity prices. With both gold and base metal prices heading south this week, US Steel saw its shares give up 2.8 per cent to $54.80 and gold miner Newmont Mining shed 8.1 per cent to $54.80.Woes were further compounded by losses in the housing sector, following a bearish forecast from luxury housebuilder Toll Brothers.In the latest sign that the US housing market – a principal driver of the US economy in the past couple of years – may have peaked, the company said first quarter sales fell 29 per cent and cut its sales guidance for the full year.Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, while Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, called the housebuilder’s performance a “seriously startling plunge in activity”.Toll Brothers’ shares fell 7.3 per cent on the week to $29.82, taking their slide since the start of the year to 18.2 per cent.Although not a particularly good week for techs, Cisco Systems, the world’s biggest maker of networking equipment, was a strong performer in the second half of the week after the company’s chief executive delivered an upbeat outlook statement to complement fiscal second-quarter profits which avoided any shocks. Cisco shares were up 8.9 per cent on the week to $19.76.Electronic Data Systems, the computer services company, unveiled fourth-quarter net profit which more than doubled that of the previous year. The company picked up some positive broker comment in spite of falling revenues from General Motors, its biggest customer. EDS shares were up 1.3 per cent on the week to $25.72.Completing a trio of technology movers, software maker Oracle offered guidance on Friday that met with modest approval. The company said that following its merger with Siebel Systems it planned 2,000 job cuts across the combined company. Its shares were little changed on Friday, but rose 3.9 per cent to $12.69 on the week.The Dow was propped up by Walt Disney, which gained after the media conglomerate delivered an unexpected gain in first-quarter profit. News that it had sold off its radio assets to Citadel Broadcasting for $2.7bn further boosted sentiment for the stock, helping it finish the week up 6.7 per cent at $26.68.The blue chip index also found support in Pfizer. Shares in the drugmaker peaked on Wednesday after it said it was considering the sale of its consumer products division, home to well known brands like Listerine and Sudafed. Analysts said the unit might be worth more than $10bn, enabling the company to concentrate more of its energies on pharmaceuticals development and a return to earnings growth in 2006.The company disappointed on Friday however, when it said sales and adjusted earnings for 2006 would only be in line with those of last year as patents expired and generic competition bit. The shares slid 2.5 per cent on Friday, but were up 1.6 per cent on the week to $25.68.General Motors, the troubled carmaker, was once again the worst performer on the Dow this week. Promises of dividend cuts and slashing executive salaries failed to convince investors that unionised workers would accept cuts in wages, benefits and jobs. “There appears to be an ever increasing probability of confrontation with unions,” said Deutsche Bank, which downgraded GM to “sell” from “hold”. The shares fell 5.5 per cent to $21.87.Aon, the world’s second- biggest insurance broker and Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications were the top gainers this week on the S&P.Aon jumped 13.1 per cent to $38.11 after it reported that fourth-quarter net income almost tripled while Univision surged 11.1 percent to $34.70 after the company said it was considering a possible sale. CBS and News Corp both expressed interest while Time Warner and Walt Disney were also cited as possible bidders.
241;AON;AON Plc;2005-11-20T17:33:11Z;Swiss Re grows to match mounting catastrophes;;When reinsurance executives gathered in Monte Carlo in September for their annual industry get-together, they were already contemplating far-reaching changes to the reinsurance sector after the up to $60bn of insured losses inflicted by Hurricane Katrina, write Andrea Felsted and Haig Simonian.The industry is now reeling from another shock: Swiss Re leapfrogging Munich Re to become the world?s largest reinsurer after its $7.6bn acquisition of General Electric?s reinsurance activities. According to Charlie Cantlay, deputy chairman of Aon UK?s reinsurance division, the deal represents ?a very significant move in the business?.Swiss Re first began working on the deal when expectations were that prices in the reinsurance sector would fall, says one London-based analyst. But with this year?s hurricane losses, rates are now rising sharply in areas affected by the storms. ?At the embryonic stage it was a defensive transaction, and now it is almost an aggressive transaction,? he said.The acquisition marks a decisive shift towards growth after three cautious years at the company under John Coomber, chief executive, who will step down from his post at the end of the year. The British-born actuary has steered the group through the difficulties of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center ? whose lead reinsurer was Swiss Re ? and collapsing bond and equity markets.Now, Swiss Re is putting new stress on growth. Mr Coomber believes size has become increasingly important for at least two reasons. First, the increasing magnitude of natural catastrophes means companies have to put an even higher emphasis than before on portfolio diversity. Second, a bigger company can achieve greater pricing power.He believes now is the time to write more business, since prices are likely to continue to rise following this year?s hurricanes in the US and flooding in Europe and Asia. ?We see prices rising to levels at the top of the cycle,? said Mr Coomber. ?We?re gaining share in the property and casualty market at the right time.?Mr Coomber, who will be replaced by Jacques Aigrain, emphasises that Swiss Re will not risk its AA credit rating in its new focus on growth. Based on the strength of its balance sheet, ?Swiss Re is excellently positioned to take advantage of the opportunities for 2006 renewals,? he said. Moreover, with the deal not due to be completed until the middle of next year, there is unlikely to be any impact during the crucial January 1 reinsurance renewals.For the wider reinsurance market, a bigger concern is whether GE Insurance Solutions will continue to acquire retrocession cover ? the reinsurance of reinsurance.Alan Griffin, chief executive designate of JLT Reinsurance Brokers, part of Jardine Lloyd Thompson, said GE?s reinsurance operations were a significant buyer of retrocession cover, whereas Swiss Re was not. Indeed, Swiss Re said it expected to save $600m by 2008 through the GE business buying less retrocession cover.GE?s reinsurance business is a also a provider of retrocession cover, whereas Swiss Re tends to concentrate on offering reinsurance cover only to insurers. ?The market is watching the retrocession capacity that they continue to offer clients, as well as their buying appetite,? said Mr Cantlay of Aon.One rival that did seem relaxed about the deal was Munich Re, which made clear it was concerned with profitability, not the volume of business. Munich Re also indicated it was unlikely to try and regain the top slot through a large acquisition.?Having the number one ranking in reinsurance is a question of volume,? the company said. ?What we are aiming at is profitability, so it?s not the top line [that matters] but the bottom line.?
242;AON;AON Plc;2005-11-07T18:49:13Z;Munich Re boosts offshore premiums by 400%;;"Munich Re has pushed through premium increases of at least 400 per cent in oil rig reinsurance since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita tore through the Gulf of Mexico in August andSeptember.The world’s biggest reinsurer, which on Monday confirmed profit targets despite the resultant €1.1bn of losses, said: “These risks will remain insurable but only if prices and conditions are adequate. So far rates have been increased by more than 400 per cent.”Hurricane Katrina, which pummelled the US Gulf coast,causing devastating flooding in New Orleans and wrecking offshore energy installations caused estimated insured losses of about €40bn.Reinsurers are typically able to use large catastrophes as a trigger to push up premiums.Munich Re said the most dramatic premium increases had been in offshore energy installations, but added that future policy renewals would likely see hikes of up to 50 per cent in US property cover and smaller increases in Europe.And Aon, the world's second largest insurance broker, also said on Monday that 2005 had been the worst year on record for the energy insurance industry - but added the market was capable of weathering the storm.Aon estimated Katrina and Rita would cost US energy insurers from $3,5bn-$5bn - on top of that came losses froma fire at Suncor in Canada and losses at an insurance mutual.“Our estimate of global premium income for the energy sector is in the order of $3.5bn for this class, so simple arithmetic clearly demonstrates a significant net loss to underwriters,” said Magne Seljeflot, chairman of Aon’’s natural resources global practice. “However, the energy insurance market, like the energy industry itself, is accustomed to this boom or bust cycle.”And Munich Re said €3bn of revenues from its €27bn investment portfolio had more than offset the freak hurricane season. For the three months to the end of September, Munich Re reported net profits of €513m, up by a third on the same period last year.The group made a €563m gain from selling down its stake in insurance group Allianz, plus smaller gains from divesting other stakes in MAN, the truck maker, and banks Commerzbank and BHW.Jörg Schneider, finance director, said he expected a €1bn book gain this month from exchanging the group’s 18 per cent stake in Munich-based bank HVB into shares in UniCredito, theItalian bank which is in the process of acquiring its German rival.The acquisition will turn Munich Re into one ofUniCredito's biggest shareholders with a stake of between 6.5 and 7 per cent, Mr Schneider added.""We can imagine a smaller shareholding. But there are no concrete plans [to cut it],"" he said.Munich Re should hit its 12 per cent return on equity target for the full year, Mr Schneider said, which on current calculations translates into a record €2.6bn net profit. “There is a prospect of a far higher dividend,” Mr Schneider added.Munich Re also told analysts that from next year it would target a risk-adjusted return on capital, rather than a straight ROE, in order to stop an estimated €8bn of excess capital dragging down its return calculations. Analysts said it would only be logical if that target, expected to be announced in March, were accompanied by plans to return excess capital to shareholders.Bob Yates, analyst at Fox, Pitt-Kelton, said: “I would be very disappointed if there weren’t some details of a capital management programme. We expect a share buy-back of about €1bn.”"
243;AON;AON Plc;2005-10-18T09:06:46Z;UK: Worries over supply chain top bombings;;Businesses face many risks, but the attacks on London’s transport system this summer have put terrorism on the agenda.According to Peter Berring, chairman of the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers, whose members include 80 per cent of FTSE 100 companies: “[Terrorism] has been pretty high on the risk management agenda for a while anyway. The recent events have just solidified people’s fears that terrorism is a serious issue in the country.”However, two recent studies have highlighted risks unrelated to terrorism as the most pressing to UK businesses.A recent study from FM Global, an insurer of commercial and industrial property, found risks to the supply chain were of most concern to financial executives in the UK.The survey of 500 financial executives, at companies in Europe and North America with at least £300m of annual turnover, found 31 per cent of UK respondents cited supply chain issues as the leading property-related threat.The UK companies surveyed did not view terrorism or sabotage as a significant business threat. Although the study was carried out in March, FM Global does not believe the situation will have changed after the London attacks.A risk management survey carried out by Aon, the insurance broker, found the risk from regulation and legislation was troubling British risk managers.Although in fifth place in the survey, it was the first time this risk had appeared among the greatest hazards identified by the study, which analysed responses from 82 risk managers, insurance managers, finance directors and company secretaries in the UK’s top 1,000 organisations.The biggest threat to British businesses, according to Aon’s survey, was loss of reputation.The poll, carried out several months before the attacks on London, put the risk from terrorism in eighth place.In the UK, minds are being concentrated on risk management by corporate governance requirements, new listing rules and the implementation of European Union directives.For the first time, the 1,300 companies listed on the main stock market must publish an operating and financial review for the financial year that began in April.This separate document – to be penned by directors and published alongside the annual report and accounts – details the non-financial risks they believe the company might face and how they are responding.The combined code on corporate governance requires companies to demonstrate they have in place the processes for identifying and assessing risk. Boards must have a view of the key risks and, on an annual basis, include a statement on corporate governance and control in their accounts.Douglas Flint, finance director of HSBC, headed a group reviewing the 1999 Turnbull guidance. These rules on internal financial controls make up part of the combined code.Mr Flint recently recommended only limited adjustments to the current guidance.However Richard Sharman, a partner in KPMG’s risk advisory services group, says the proposals require risk management to be “more embedded” within companies, and for frameworks for managing risk to be reviewed more often.According to a study from Lloyd’s, in association with the Economist Intelligence Unit, the Financial Services Authority’s regulatory regime imposes considerable obligations on senior management to identify, asssess and manage the risks involved in their business.In the UK, as in the US, the insurance part of risk management has come under scrutiny after New York state attorney general Eliot Spitzer’s inquiry into practices in the US insurance industry.A year ago, Mr Spitzer accused Marsh, the world’s biggest insurance broker, of falsifying and rigging bids on contracts and favouring insurers at the expense of clients in return for higher commissions.A study by Freshfields, the law firm, found no evidence of bid rigging at Marsh UK, although it said that incentive commissions had influenced brokers.London market sources believe bid rigging would have been difficult in the London insurance market because it is a subscription market. This means insurers each cover a proportion of the same risk, rather than placing the whole policy with one insurer.But concerns have been raised about the impact on the London insurance market of contingent commissions, controversial bonuses paid by underwriters to brokers for bringing large amounts of business or particularly profitable accounts, which have not been outlawed by the the FSA.Contingent commissions linked to volume of business have been virtually eliminated in the London insurance market, according to a recent report from PwC. However, the study found commission based on the profitability of business still existed.Some brokers have also introduced business models for dealing with the way they are remunerated for providing services to underwriters, such as issuing policies, which were used in the past to justify contingent commissions.Although most of the big brokers are now fully committed to disclosing commissions, calls are growing for all British brokers to divulge automatically to clients what they earn from securing insurance cover for them.The FSA has stopped short of forcing brokers to disclose what they are paid. Instead, it requires brokers to divulge commission only if the customer asks, although they are free to disclose more information than set down in the rules. However, the FSA has said it would support an industry code of conduct on disclosure.Airmic’s Mr Berring is waiting to see what the level of disclosure will be as buyers come to renew their policies.“The jury is out,” he says. “There have been a lot of discussions and actions. We are watching to see how that translates into proper functions as we go through our renewal process.”
244;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Aon cuts 750 jobs from UK workforce;;Aon, the world’s second largest insurance broker, said on Wednesday that it would cut 750 of 6,800 UK jobs over the next 24 months as it seeks to realign its business in light of the changing shape of the insurance market.The biggest changes will be to its specialty and risk services divisions and corporate shared service functions. The Chicago-based broker expects the cuts, which are part of a larger restructuring program, to cost about $54m.In August, Aon said it planned to take a pre-tax charge of as much as $300m in the third-quarter for restructuring.Insurance brokers have struggled to come up with alternate streams of revenue since Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general, cracked down on so-called contingent commissions. Companies accept these from insurers in exchange for steering better business their way.Aon employs about 48,000 around the world.
245;AON;AON Plc;2005-08-30T19:13:39Z;Storm over the oil industry;;"As the 200mph gusts lashing the Louisiana coast subsided on Tuesday, oil companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico were left counting the cost of the latest major big hurricane to pass through torment the region.The four hurricanes that struck there Gulf last year resulted in around $28bn of damage across all sectors, according to Aon, the US insurance company. Insurance Premiums climbed for anyone operating in the hurricane-prone area – and, following the damage wrought this week by Hurricane Katrina, industry experts now expect it will those to rise further. “It will certainly harden the resolve of underwriters to look for premium increases for the Gulf of Mexico business,” says Tim Fillingham, who heads up the of energy practice at insurance company Aon’s UK arm.It is just one more element in a worrying story of escalating costs faced by oil companies operating around the world. The lack of qualified staff to operate rigs, especially in the US and in the North Sea, the a scarcity of oil rigs for hire and the higher cost of raw materials such as steel are beginning to affect adding to upward pressure on oil crude prices as well as impinging on oil companies’ the sector’s ability ies to find and produce new oil. Tougher Meanwhile, the increasingly aggressive Bargaining of by oil-rich countries is strengthening the squeeze: also raising costs for international oil companies keen to exploit their resources. countries such as Venezuela are demanding hundreds of millions of dollars more in taxes and royalties for existing and future projects. headed by international companies. The rapidly increasing costs of doing business for national and international oil companies are now is starting to be felt by the consumers at the petrol pump.Neil McMahon, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, sees cost inflation as a key factor behind the recent escalation in crude oil prices. “The oil and gas industry is a marginal business like any other,” he wrote writes in a recent research note. “If costs rise, commodity prices must escalate to sustain ing returns for the marginal player.”The issue of costs might not get much attention as hurricanes, terrorist threats to oil production, the dwindling spare capacity of oil in Saudi Arabia and the insatiable thirst for energy of in China and the US. But many analysts have come to believe that cost inflation is being viewed as a significant key reason that why oil prices are so high and a sign that they will remain so for some years to come.at least the end of the decade. Sanford Bernstein expects the cost of producing a single barrel of oil to increase by 9 per cent a year, from about $22 a barrel this year to $36 a barrel in 2010, and . More critical to the oil price, the investment bank projects that the cost of finding and producing the so-called marginal barrel – beyond which the activity becomes unprofitable – will double to $60 over the same period. by the end of the decade. The mounting Uncertainty about how much new projects will cost also prompted Goldman Sachs this month to raise its prediction s of the long-term oil price from $45 a barrel to $60.This week’s hurricane blew past 2,800 platforms, shut ting down 1.4m barrels a day of production – equivalent to about 7 per cent of US demand. Chevron, the US’country’s second largest energy group, had the greatest number of rigs in the storm’s path. But hundreds of operators are set to face losses that they will eventually pass on to consumers. There is little that companies can do in the face of ferocious weather. But what are the other business costs that are prone to escalate and what are upstream oil and gas companies doing to limit the damage?For a start, the hurricane could also make it even harder to find already scarce oil rigs. with oil prices at record highs, companies are scrambling to extract as much from their existing fields as possible and are pushing hard to find new resources. Spare drilling rigs are becoming difficult to come by and are dramatically more expensive. than a few years ago.In 1990 companies paid some $93 .23 to drill one foot ($284 a metre). In 2003, the most recent year for which data was is available, the cost in real terms had more than doubled to $204 .03 per foot, according to the International Energy Agency, the developed countries’ energy watchdog. organisation. Hiring a deep-water rig for a day in the US Gulf of Mexico now costs $400,000, double what it cost 5 the price of five years ago. Smaller rigs that drill in shallower water have more than tripled in price. from $25,000 a day in 2002 to $86,000 today.But This was before Hurricane Katrina ripped through the heart of the US oil industry, passing over more than nearly half of the 231 rigs looking for oil in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A total of 117 rigs – worth $7bn – of the 231 rigs lay in its path, with of which 48 were having been hit by winds of more than 74mph, iles per our, according to Rigzone, the industry news outlet. A full damage assessment has yet to be made, but preliminary indications are not good. With often only a single spare rig available for hire in the region, Katrina is likely to be a huge setback.Even before the hurricane, oil service companies were having a difficult time battling to meet ing demand. During the lean years of the 1990s, when oil prices were low, companies invested little and are now scrambling to catch up. “Oilfield activity is very strong around the world,” says Stephen Whittaker, director of communications at Schlumberger, the oil services group. “We’ve seen an increasing demand for oilfield service technologies over the past two years in response to growing global energy needs.”Like other oil services companies, Schlumberger’s Revenues have benefited jumped by 21 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2004 but even oil service companies worry that they could start to be affected by the increase in the price of raw materials and the shortage of available staff. Gene Shiels, assistant director for investor relations at the rival Baker Hughes, says: another large oil services company, said: ““So far the oil services industry has been able to increase prices ahead of the raw materials increase and pass the cost – and then some – along to their consumers, such as national and international oil companies.” But he added, that some raw materials, especially strong steel that does not easily corrode, are becoming difficult to find because of fierce competition from China.Steel prices rose 70 per cent last year to $650 per tonne metric ton, but have since retreated to about $500. , according to Corus, the metals company. (have graph) The impact has been more immediate for those oil companies who that have been hit by steelmakers renegotiating existing contracts as the price increase rise for steel has outstripped the penalty they face for breaking their an agreement.Because of the pressures, national and in­ternational oil companies have had sharply to increase their estimates of how much projects will cost. At today’s oil prices, that should not matter too much, but oil companies worry that multi-billion-dollar projects could be rendered unprofitable if oil prices were to drop back. Until the costs become clear, some oil companies will opt to hold back at a time when the world is desperate for new supplies of oil and gas.”Costs have increased significantly over time and it’s now hurting some of our projects,” says Ali al-Hammadi, chief operating officer for Qatargas, the Gulf state’s liquefied natural gas producer. , in an interview earlier this year. ““There aren’t enough engineering, procurement and construction contractors, there aren’t enough shipyards and the prices are going up.”Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest supplier of crude oil and the country with holder of the most reserves, is also seeing costs escalate rise but from a lower level. producing a barrel of oil costs less in Saudi Arabia than in most of the rest of the world and Ali Naimi, the kingdom’s oil minister, is not yet concerned. He says: “Commodities worldwide are up. Steel, cement, all the parts, machinery, it’s all going up. But when you are talking of a less than $2 producing cost . . . there is no pressure.”But not every company can boast production costs as low as those of Saudi Arabia. And the fact that as countries such as Saudi Arabia are are not letting international oil companies multinationals tap their oil resources, has pushed companies groups such as Europe’s Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Total, ExxonMobil and Chevron have been pushed into exploring and extracting in ever more remote and hostile territory. It is here that they are being hit the hardest.In an increasingly tight labour market, Getting enough people to work on a large project is becoming a major challenge. difficult if the skills that are required are specialised or the project location remote, those problems can multiply, as Royal Dutch Shell recently found. The cost of its highly ambitious flagship gas project at Sakhalin Island, off the east coast of Russia, has ballooned to $20bn – twice the original estimate. The companygroup said that says the rising price of services and raw materials were are in large part to blame.Shell’s other mammoth projects, in Nigeria and Canada, have also been hard hit by rising costs. It Shell recently warned that the cost of expanding its oilsands project at in Athabasca, in the Canadian province of Alberta, was set to climb. “It is clear that there is a significant upward trend in construction costs due to the heated global market for engineered equipment and bulk materials,” Shell Canada said. at the time. There are also indications that the company’s Pearl Gas-to-liquids project in Qatar is rising in cost. In the light of the cost overruns, Shell is reviewing its capital expenditure budgets, which could now rise from the expected $15bn a year.While Shell has been hard hit by the rising costs, it is not alone. BP has been relatively successful at holding down costs but still expects its capital cost estimates to rise from $14.5bn this year to around some $15bn in the next year. At the last results presentation, Lord John Browne, BP’s chief executive, said he ex­pected costs to keep on rising. “Certainly, The market for the typical mix of goods and services that we procure in the exploration and production sector went up about 9 per cent in 2004,” he said. “We saw that trend continue in 2005 and we expect it to continue in 2006. Of course, we do not just sit still and take this; we use technology and the fact that we are a very big buyer of goods and services to get the leanest possible prices.”Rising costs have also hit Exxon­Mobil, though it says it has so far been able to mitigate them through good project management. “You know, ““We’re all dealing with the same industry environment and market forces and really the key in differentiating performance is how you manage those costs,” said Lee Raymond, ExxonMobil’s chief executive, at the company’when presenting its results. presentation earlier this year. ““The things that have differentiated our performance in the past are even more important in this kind of environment,” he said, added, citing good project management, advance planning and technology as ways of holding costs down.Companies with well-organised procurement systems that who have been able to locked in rig rates early, such as ExxonMobil, will be less affected by the price rise than less organised peers, those who did not act in the same way, says the chief executive officer of one large European oil company. said. He adds ed that the real crunch for him and his competitors will come in a few years, when international and national oil companies ready to invest in large projects – such as the one being planned in Russia’s Arctic region – are forced to compete for to get the services companies. they need. “There are only three companies that can do that kind of work and they will be able to name their price.” he said.Oil services companies are not the only ones alone in driving a high hard bargain. Countries rich in oil are demanding a bigger slice of the growing oil revenue pie from their international partners, thereby pushing up the cost of finding and producing new oil. by hundreds of millions of dollars. Most, such as Nigeria and Kazakhstan, are setting tough terms for new contracts. But some, such as including Venezuela and Russia, are even rewriting existing rules to demand ing win higher tax payments.es from the likes of Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Statoil, of Europe, and Chevron and ExxonMobil of the US, and pushing up the cost of business for international oil companies by hundreds of millions of dollars.What has changed in the past few weeks is that those costs are beginning to impact affect oil prices on the futures markets in New York and London and at the pumps across the world. If With oil companies cannot having little room to mitigate curb their costs, higher price bill, it will be up to consumers to change alter their behaviour? The American Petroleum Institute, the energy companies’ umbrella group, yesterday called on Americans to consume energy wisely in the light of the hurricane – repeating echoing a sentiment that Opec, the IEA and many oil companies themselves have already expressed several times this year.The question now is If consumers will heed that call, and prices will may ease gradually. Otherwise it may not need another Katrina for havoc to be wreaked in the market. or whether oil’s price surge will prompt a sudden and painful reversal of fortunes.Companies find few takers for jobs that have lost their attractionAn unusual visitor knocked recently at the door of the John 3:16 Mission – a shelter for the homeless – in the tough inner city of Tulsa, Oklahoma, writes Carola Hoyos. The visitor had a mission of his own: to recruit workers for the rigs that dot the US state, which is rich in oil and natural gas.As the oil and gas industry tries to meet surging demand, companies are struggling as never before to find the staff they need – from labourers to engineers and other professionals. It is one more reason why costs are rising in the industry.In the US and Europe in particular, oil companies are facing “the Big Crew Change” – a phrase coined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, which represents industry professionals worldwide. The average age of the industry’s employees is 49 and half the workforce will retire in the next five to 10 years, according to most analysts and oil industry groups. The trouble is in part a result of the lean 1990s when low oil prices prompted large numbers of redundancies and a slowdown in recruitment.The unwillingness of many Americans and Europeans to do hard manual labour and the tightness of the US labour market have made it difficult to find workers for jobs such as cleaning rigs, which pay as much as $17 an hour – more than three times the federal minimum wage.Royal Dutch Shell, the Anglo-Dutch energy group, and other companies in Louisiana are finding recruits for their on- and offshore rigs among young high school drop-outs. In June, the first seven students graduated from a programme of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry association, and Jobs Corp, an education and vocational training programme administered by the US Department of Labor, which trains students in safety and well operations and helps them to complete their high school equivalency exam.Meanwhile, the vilification of oil companies by environmental and human rights groups has made an industry career less appealing for those with more skills, oil company executives say. BP alone has hired 13 search agencies to fill 400 vacancies at its Houston-based operations.Even places such as Angola – which emerged only this decade from 27 years of civil war – are being trawled by some companies operating there for talent to fill top jobs.In one company, Shell, the recruitment problems go all the way to the top: analysts think that Europe’s second biggest energy group – which had a reputation as a training ground for the industry’s brightest – lacks qualified candidates eventually to fill top rank posts such as chief executive and head of exploration and production. Concern over filling such posts is seen as a drag on the company’s share price.How well each company deals with the Big Crew Change may not only determine its pecking order among its peers, but also how well the industry as a whole is able to meet the challenge of supplying a thirsty world with oil."
246;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Cisco's AON technology to aid networks;;Cisco Systems, the world's leading internet equipment maker, on Tuesday unveiled new technology designed to make networks more “intelligent” in order to help corporate customers manage diverse business programmes.The new technology, dubbed application-oriented networking, would make networks faster and more secure by enabling them to read and prioritise data from application-to-application messages flowing within a network such as purchase orders, investment transactions or shipment approvals.Analysts said the technology, which would be embedded into Cisco's routing and switching equipment, represented an important shift from traditional networking gear, which moves data across networks by reading the internet address attached to the outside of each packet of information.Roy Schulte, a research fellow at Gartner, said that by making networks as intelligent as the infrastructure software the companies depend on to manage their data, Cisco's AON technology could change software design and information technology management practices in fundamental ways.Over a shorter term, AON technology blurs the line between infrastructure software and networking technology, said Sandra Rogers, a research director atIDC.Charles Giancarlo, chief technology officer, said Cisco started developing AON technology because most of the software used by corporations consisted of “stovepiped applications” designed to manage customer information, financial records and purchasing data which often did not speak the same language and thus had trouble communicating. Mr Giancarlo said by being able to read entire messages as they passed across a network, AON technology would enable corporations to respond to changing business conditions more quickly. John Chambers, chief executive, said it was “one of the most fundamental changes in my lifetime”.By delivering a product that can handle traditional middleware tasks, Cisco hopes it can garner a share of corporate IT budgets usually earmarked for infrastructure software.Cisco said International Business Machines, the world's largest computer group, and SAP, the world's biggest enterprise resource planning software maker, would develop products compatible with AON.

The S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 1,175.65, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.5 per cent to 1,962.23.Ken Tower, chief market analyst at CyberTrader, cautioned against reading too much into the day’s gains, however. Mr Tower said the ratio between put and call options on the US indices remained elevated, “suggesting a strong lingering scepticism for the market’s ability to rally”.Investors were digesting an Institute for Supply Management survey, which showed that business growth among financial, construction and other services firms moderated last month, in line with expectations.Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow financial, said the large number of positive surprises this earnings season was a sign that companies were countering the effects of high oil prices by increasing productivity and cutting costs.General Motors was the centre of attention on Wednesday after Tracinda, the investment vehicle of Mr Kerkorian, said it would buy as many as 28m shares in the struggling automaker at $31 a share. The move would double Mr Kerkorian’s holdings in the company to 8.8 per cent. GM shares leapt 18.1 per cent to $32.80 on the news. Shares in the biggest US carmaker fell sharply from a January high of $40.30 after it warned on profits this year. Ford, GM’s chief US rival, rose 7.3 per cent to $10.16 on the coat-tails of the GM news.Strong results from a pair of big insurers lifted shares across the sector. Aon, the world’s second-biggest insurance broker, shot up 15 per cent to $24.45 after it beat expectations with profits up 18 per cent. MetLife, a New York-based rival, jumped 12.1 per cent to $43.55 after its earnings beat estimates. American International Group, the biggest US insurer, rose 2 per cent to $54.37.Elsewhere on the earnings front, Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video game maker, fell 6.5 per cent to $49.45 after it reported sharply lower profits for the first quarter and forecast a second quarter loss.Time Warner, the media group, rose 3.6 per cent to $17.28 after profits beat estimates.Utilities companies and energy groups put in the worst performances of the day. Dominion Resources, owner of Virginia’s biggest utility company, fell 3.3 per cent to $72.70 after its first quarter profits fell. Devon Energy, the oil and gas explorer, slipped 0.4 per cent, its second successive day of declines.Microsoft, the world’s biggest software company, slipped 0.6 per cent to $25.21.

Essex has been the ante-post favourite since winning the Pierse Hurdle at Leopardstown and a win on Saturday would put this Irish Cesarewitch winner into the reckoning for the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham.However, another Irish raider is fancied to win on Saturday. Al Eile could only manage third behind Essex last time out, but should be suited by the likely stronger pace and better ground. Four horses since 1996 have lost in Ireland but won at Newbury, and Al Eile, backable at each-way prices, is good enough to claim a place.

In the Tingle Creek at Sandown, Azertyuiop found Moscow Flyer too good but Well Chief was only a short head away from his rival at level weights. Today he has a 4lb advantage and that is enough to give him the edge.The Aon Chase is fascinating.

249;AON;AON Plc;2004-11-17T00:48:54Z;Insurers split over Washington role;;Eliot Spitzer on Tuesday raised the prospect that the federal government should play a bigger part in regulating the insurance industry in the US to root out the corruption and anti-competitive behaviour apparently plaguing the industry.But insurers and brokers remain divided about how appropriate it would be for Washington to do so.“It would be a mistake to suggest that state insurance regulation is to blame for the actions of a small group of law-breaking individuals,” Alex Soto, a member of the executive committee of the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, told a packed room assembled to listen to the Senate subcommittee hearing on insurance brokerage practices.Tired of dealing with patchwork regulation, some big insurers favour the idea of an optional federal charter. Others support a more flexible draft bill from Congressmen Michael Oxley and Richard Baker the State Modernization and Regulatory Transparency Act which would require states to modify insurance laws without creating a federal regulator.Since 1945, when the McCarron-Ferguson Act was passed, the regulation of insurance has been the states' obligation. The act also exempts companies in the insurance sector from antitrust laws.But on Tuesday, Patrick Fitzgerald, the Illinois senator leading the hearing, questioned whether these exemptions applied to brokers such as Marsh and Aon and suggested the McCarron act could be amended.Mr Spitzer called on Congress to open an investigation into abuses in the industry and suggested that the Federal Trade Commission should have some role in insurance regulation.Predictably, state insurance commissioners opposed Mr Spitzer's ideas.“We strongly believe an effective system of national regulation does not mean federal regulation,” Greg Serio, New York's superintendent of insurance, said on Tuesday.“Federal intervention in supervising insurance will simply add additional layers of uncertainty, confusion and cost for policyholders regarding ‘who is in charge' of regulating claims payments when disasters and personal losses occur,” Mr Serio added.However, calls for more federal oversight are likely to increase as the investigation into corrupt practices in the insurance sector expands, analysts say.On Tuesday, Mr Spitzer accused brokers of accepting loans, trips and stock incentives from insurers in exchange for steering them better business. He also urged regulators to take a closer look at the way premiums are set. The flow of capital to insurers in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, especially those partly owned or operated by brokers was also called into question yesterday by Mr Spitzer. “That is a Pandora's box that should be opened …It will not be pretty,” he said.In addition to the ongoing investigation into conflicts of interest in the sector, subpoenas are now being issued to companies regarding a product called finite reinsurance that it is feared is being used to smooth out earnings.The Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Spitzer's office and Greg Serio, New York state's insurance commissioner are all looking at the matter.

However, there is increasing concern that New York attorney- general Eliot Spitzer's 500 pound bombs might be hitting a few too many civilians. He and his enforcers might want to consider ways to limit the collateral damage to insurance purchasers and the insurers' credit market counterparties.There's no question that the storms of lawsuits are going to have an impact on the industry's capital base. Already, the credit default swap spreads on brokers Marsh & McLennan and Aon have blown out by 10 times, from 30 basis points to 260-300bp. While the brokers are still rated investment grade by the agencies, the credit markets are rating them as double-B junk. Among the underwriters, Ace has gone from 50 or 60bp to about 100bp, and even giant, AAA-rated AIG has creaked from 19bp to 33bp as of yesterday, which begins to put it in the un-god-like category.“This is having a much bigger impact on the insurance industry than the regulator's actions against the investment banks and mutual funds had on them,” says a credit-speculating hedge fund manager.The problem is that this isn't a mere spectator sport, or vehicle for hedgies to justify their two-and-twenty percentage points. There are actual insurance customers and credit market counterparties who depend on the timely payments and reliable guarantees they get from the industry.This doesn't seem to have penetrated the consciousness of the people in Spitzer's office. While they won't talk for the record about the risk of collateral damage, those close to the investigation, as the phrase goes, seem to believe that it's not their problem. If disaster occurs, then the customers and counterparties have only the brokers and underwriters to blame.If the only issue with real world problems was the allocation of blame, then this attitude would be reasonable. Then, for example, the US military need not be concerned about non-combatant Iraqis being killed by blast effects; the insurgents could be blamed for everything. However, the military does understand that collateral damage is harmful to their accomplishing their mission, so they try to minimise it.Just as the military has actual enemies, so there are actual guilty people here. The AG's office should go ahead and remove the executives responsible for the betrayal of the companies' customers, up to and including all the senior management and members of the boards of directors, and prosecute and punish those who committed criminal acts, enforce needed changes in business practices.However, the AG and his people should do all that with the interests of the customers and counterparties in mind - the public, in other words. Unlike the banks, the insurance industry doesn't have a Fed to back the liquidity and smooth functioning of the system. Analysis of the financial-economic effects of the enforcement actions, and modifying the actions on the basis of that analysis, is necessary. The idea should be to avoid the decapitalisation of companies the public depends on, while punishing the people responsible. Otherwise, the AG's office will find itself acting like someone picking up a ticking time bomb and shaking it to see if anything falls out. Not smart.■ If the US speculative community is finding entertainment value in the insurance world, so their counterparts in Europe are being offered some needed excitement by the public fight between the Hungarian government and the country's central bank.Earlier this month, some parliamentary deputies in the government's coalition introduced a proposal to change the central bank's governing law to increase the number of members on the monetary policy council from between seven and nine to between nine and eleven. This was a lot more than a mere technical change; the clear intent is to stuff the policy council with some easy-money votes. There is an election coming up in early 2006, and the less than wildly popular government would be in a better position with interest rates lower than today's short term policy rate of 10.5 per cent.Hungary is of great interest to hedge funds; it's hard to find double digit rates these days, albeit a return that could face devaluation risk.“It's too bad the government is getting into this fight with the central bank,” says one proprietary trader at a major bank. “We regard Drascovics (Tibor Drascovics, finance minister) as a safe pair of hands. But are they trying to push rates down too fast and pump up the economy with a devaluation?”I asked the minister if the deputies' law meant the government was backing off from Euro-orthodoxy, perhaps going for a devaluation and further postponement of euro-entry.“We are not considering changing the target date (2010) at all,” he replied. “That is out of the question. The real question is do we need such a strong currency to achieve inflation targets. The central bank says yes, we do need it.” As for the central bank's high interest rates, “I hope next year rates will go down fast, because inflation is going down fast.”This fight will only get more interesting, and the potential volatility greater, as the election approaches. Betting on the one month forint rate contract one year forward looks like a reasonable bet."
251;AON;AON Plc;2004-10-22T23:12:48Z;Aon to stop accepting incentive commissions;;Aon, the second-biggest insurance broker, is the latest to announce it will stop taking incentive commissions - the fees that are at the heart of New York attorney-general Eliot Spitzer’s investigations into the insurance industry.Both Chicago-based Aon and Willis, the London-based broker, were on Friday downgraded to a “negative” outlook by Moody’s Investor Services as a result of the probes into the insurance industry and, in Willis’s case, its decision to stop accepting incentive commissions.Moody’s has held both broker’s actual ratings steady. A negative outlook is a signal a company is in line for a potential downgrade to its ratings.“As additional substantive information becomes available on the investigations and their potential implications of Willis and the brokerage market, Moody’s may take further rating action,” the agency said in a note about Willis. Last year, incentive commissions from favoured insurers accounted for $80m in revenue for the London-based broker.“If contingent (incentive) commissions were suspended, this could result in a material decline in the cash flow of insurance brokerages in the short run, and that will be a key driver in any rating adjustments,” said Thomas Upton, insurance analyst at S&P, in a note on Friday.Commissions, paid to brokers by insurers based on the amount of business done, are accepted practice in the industry but have been attacked as compromising a broker’s obligation to deliver the best value.On Friday, S&P assigned a negative outlook to US property and casualty insurers’ commercial credit lines in general as a result of its expectations that downgrades in the sector will outnumber upgrades over the next year.Earlier this week, S&P handed the company at the heart of Mr Spitzer’s investigations, Marsh McLennan, a savage three-notch downgrade to BBB-plus, leaving it three steps above “junk” status. Marsh was the first to announce the suspension of incentive commissions. Moody’s has also downgraded Marsh, leaving it four notches above junk. Aon was this week downgraded by S&P by one notch to BBB-plus.S&P analysts said on Friday that the charges of bid-rigging levelled by Mr Spitzer were the most serious.“In the long run, the damage to a broker’s reputation by any proven allegations of bid rigging could compromise its competitive position,” said S&P’s Mr Upton.
252;AON;AON Plc;2004-10-19T19:54:06Z;Insurance probes set to spread;;The crackdown on corruption and bid-rigging in the US insurance industry is poised to extend across the country as state regulators follow the lead of Eliot Spitzer, the New York state attorney general.As shares in the leading insurance brokers fell on Tuesday, insurance commissioners in several states in the US were working to co-ordinate action. They are expected to discuss possible moves such as requiring companies to provide more disclosure on incentive commissions on a conference call on Wednesday.?All of the insurance commissioners want to get involved, especially those who have companies doing business in their states,? the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said. ?Most feel there is something they can do to monitor these companies.?Shares in Marsh & McLennan, the parent of Marsh, the broker at the centre of Mr Spitzer's lawsuit, closed down 6 per cent to $24.10 in New York, a loss of about 50 per cent since Thursday.On Tuesday, Moody's Investor Services, the credit rating agency, lowered its rating on Marsh & McLennan's debt one notch to A3.Aon, the second biggest insurance broker, is under scrutiny, according to people familiar with the matter. On Tuesday, its stock fell almost 10 per cent at $19.20.Some health insurers fell on news that groups including UnumProvident, the biggest US disability insurer, Aetna and Cigna had received subpoenas related to the probe.In a research note, Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs said: ?HMOs have the least exposure relative to other insurance businesses. We believe this morning's sell-off is overdone.?The sell-off is partly being driven by fears that the widening investigation will force brokers to stop accepting incentive commissions from insurers, an important source of earnings. Other big concerns include the looming threat of legal action and settlement costs.?The prospect of losing [these commissions] is sending shock waves throughout the industry,? Barry Meiners, of the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, said.Mr Spitzer's office has indicated that regulators believe commissions affect brokers' judgments. All groups might be forced to return them even if there is no evidence that individual customers were harmed, one official told the FT. In Europe, the share prices of Zurich Financial Services and Swiss Re diverged. Analysts noted the relative exposure of ZFS to the US market compared with the more limited presence of Swiss Re.Shares in Swiss Re rose 2 per cent, with ZFS shares up only 0.9 per cent.
253;AON;AON Plc;2004-10-17T22:33:53Z;The question is: Just how mutual, just how beneficial?;;When Jeffrey Greenberg was named chief executive of insurance broker Marsh & McLennan in January 1999, he said of American International Group, the insurance company led by his father, Hank: “I don't think there's the slightest conflict of interest. AIG gets business from Marsh and we depend on AIG to provide insurance for our clients. It's a very mutually beneficial relationship.”Just how beneficial, and in what way, is the focus of a new investigation by Eliot Spitzer, New York's aggressive attorney-general. His move against AIG and three other insurance companies was a long time coming. One of the key elements of Mr Spitzer's allegations the payment of contingent fees (payments to brokers by underwriters such as AIG) was first raised in 1998. Marsh's $2bn purchase of Sedgwick, its UK rival, in September 1998 was a catalyst for customer complaints about the growing dominance of Marsh and Aon. The customers said the consolidation of the industry gave brokers the chance to extract ever higher customer commissions, while receiving payments from underwriters. This raised questions of independence.A Marsh spokeswoman at the time said complaints by customers about contingent fees were nothing new, although Hank Greenberg, the AIG chief, said: “We feel these are real issues that do raise some concerns.”Marsh, which has been a highly profitable company over the years, was locked in a struggle for dominance with Aon that saw both make several high-cost acquisitions in a few years. The Sedgwick purchase came while Marsh was still digesting its purchase of another broker, Johnson & Higgins. It tried to buyLondon-based Benfield group, another broker, in 2002, but failed to agree a price.This July it bought Kroll, the security firm, for $1.9bn a big outlay that resulted in its counterparty credit rating being downgraded to AA from A+.As it continued its expansion, Marsh continued to defend the practice of contingent fees. In June several of its senior executives at the World Insurance Forum said a broker did not create a conflict of interest by helping a customer buy insurance while simultaneously acting as an intermediary paid by an underwriter.This latest probe means all three of Marsh's businesses are under regulatory scrutiny. The group also owns Putnam, the fifth-largest fund management company in the US. A year ago it fell foul of another big Spitzer investigation into the market timing of mutual fund shares.Market timing was, similarly, a somewhat questionable industry practice that was known about for years. It turned out to be more widespread than believed, and to have the tolerance or even full co-operation of some fund executives despite public claims that they discouraged it.Putnam's chief executive, Lawrence Lasser, was fired following Mr Spitzer's claims, and the company paid $110m to settle regulators' allegations that it had allowed short-term traders to arbitrage its mutual fund shares at the expense of long-term investors. Putnam has since lost one-quarter of its assets as investors pulled out more than $60bn. New chief Ed Haldeman has worked to regain investors' trust, but money has continued to drain away, mostly going to rivals.Marsh's third arm, Mercer Consulting, is also under scrutiny. The SEC last December began an inquiry into conflicts of interest by pension consultants such as Mercer, which last year contributed 22 per cent of Marsh's profit. The inquiry centres on how the consultants decide which money managers to recommend to pension funds.
254;AON;AON Plc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
