0;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-01T17:59:05Z;Deals are fading ink amid Covid-19;Uber Eats grocery push, crumpled newspapers, Apple rains on Android, Microsoft 365;"Deals can stop making sense in the age of coronavirus. All due diligence and valuations go out of the window when businesses just come to a complete halt, with no timeline available for when they might start making money again.Xerox gave in to the inevitable last night and called off its five-month effort to buy rival printer and PC maker HP. As Lex points out, it had needed to borrow heavily — to the tune of $24bn — and while a rising share price last year gave it ammunition, the recent sell-off slashed Xerox’s market value by half to $4bn. HP suffered less. Its market value, at around $26bn, is roughly where it was before the bid.Xerox said the environment was not conducive to pursuing an acquisition, even though “the banks who agreed to finance this acquisition . . . never wavered in their commitments, even during the market turmoil caused by COVID-19”.The banks are on the hook though for another drawn-out deal that did manage to close today. T-Mobile US completed its merger with rival mobile network Sprint, with the help of $23bn of loans from 16 banks, after Covid-19 disrupted plans to sell the debt to third-party investors. It’s the largest acquisition financing deal to get stuck on banks’ balance sheets since the 2008 financial crisis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, more than 300 deals, worth nearly $100bn, have been pulled since November 17 2019, when the first case of coronavirus was detected in China, according to Refinitiv. It still sounds like a perfect time for private equity groups to start picking up some bargains, although our Due Diligence newsletter discovered they may have problems of their own.1. Uber Eats accelerates grocery deliveries
Uber’s Eats unit is accelerating its push into grocery delivery, striking new alliances with retailers including French supermarket chain Carrefour, as it looks to offset the decline in its ride-hailing business because of the coronavirus lockdown. The San Francisco-based company is this week launching rapid deliveries of food, toiletries and cleaning products in a wide range of locations around the world, from Brazil to France.2. Newspapers crumpled by coronavirus
Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp is suspending the print editions of 60 newspapers in Australia as the spread of coronavirus causes a rapid decline in media advertising. The London Evening Standard has furloughed a number of employees, imposed pay cuts and suspended its weekly magazine. JPI Media, owner of the Yorkshire Post and Scotsman titles, is putting 350 employees on furlough.3. Huawei’s made-in-USA boast
Huawei managed to purchase $18.7bn in US components last year — up by 70 per cent from the previous year, chairman Eric Xu told the FT in an interview reported in this week’s Tech Scroll Asia newsletter. The surge came in spite of the fact that Huawei was added to the US sanctions list in May last year. An FT teardown of Huawei’s new P40 Pro smartphone shows several important US components inside the phone. 4. Apple rains on Android
Apple has bought the Dark Sky weather app and its developers say it is no longer available for download on Android phones. Expect Apple to incorporate it into its own Weather app for iOS devices.5. Detecting coronavirus voices
Israeli start-up Cordio Medical is beginning clinical trials on an app-based AI system that analyses speech to diagnose and remotely monitor Covid-19 patients, reports VentureBeat. The company claims it can detect changes in lung fluids and the onset of inflammation even before patients do.Microsoft rebranded Office 365 to Microsoft 365 this week and announced it would be “the subscription for your life”. For the same $10 a month subscription, users will get improved desktop Office apps, 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage per person, 60 Skype minutes, security features and technical support. Microsoft Teams for consumers was pushed as an apparent eventual replacement for Skype, whose daily active users are up 70 per cent to 40m thanks to the popularity of video conferencing in the pandemic."
1;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-01T11:42:35Z;Xerox/HP: paper jam puts an end to deal;The industrial logic of takeovers is challenged when the world economy grinds to a halt;Xerox’s attempt to buy rival US printer maker HP was never going to be easy. Coronavirus made the highly leveraged $31bn hostile offer impossible. On Tuesday, Xerox pressed the “cancel” button on a five-month pursuit. It is the highest profile deal to founder so far.The industrial logic of takeovers is challenged when the world economy grinds to a halt. Demand for HP and Xerox copiers and printers has evaporated overnight. The stock market is still in retreat. Investors and companies are hoarding cash. Xerox is not alone in having to drop its takeover bid. More than 300 deals, worth nearly $100bn, have been pulled since November 17 2019, when the first case of coronavirus was first detected in China, according to Refinitiv. The stock-and-cash offer was a stretch from the start. Xerox was trying to buy a much bigger company. It needed to borrow heavily — to the tune of $24bn. A rising share price last year gave it ammunition. But the recent sell-off slashed Xerox’s market value by half to $4bn. HP has suffered less. Its market value, at around $26bn, is roughly where it was before the bid.HP’s management must feel vindicated. The group looks better placed to weather a looming recession. Two-thirds of revenue came from its PC business last year. The printer business is more consumer focused. Sales for both laptops and home printers should get a temporary boost from home working and studying.HP has a strong balance sheet. It has no net debt. The $15bn share buyback programme it announced last month as part of its defence can easily be put on hold. Having missed an opportunity to consolidate, Xerox may find itself a target when the pandemic attenuates. Consolidation still makes sense for an industry that is in secular decline. People close to the two companies have long speculated that Xerox’s hostile offer was an attempt to coax HP to present its own takeover offer for Xerox. The get-together could still happen - but it will be on HP’s terms rather than Xerox’s.Lex coronavirus advice exchange.

2;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-03-06T05:00:48Z;Coronavirus is talk of Tulane as dealmakers descend;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;"FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.One thing to start: JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon has had emergency heart surgery and will hand over day-to-day running of the bank to co-presidents Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith while he recovers. More here. One thing to watch: On Saturday we’ll be sending you a special edition of DD on the Business of Football, which will collect some of our best work over the course of the past few months.At the annual Tulane mergers and acquisitions conference in New Orleans, there was more talk among US dealmakers about who was missing than over those that had turned up. With coronavirus at the forefront of everyone’s mind, some attendees opted to skip the conference entirely while others, like Ted Yu, who runs the M&A division at the Securities and Exchange Commission, joined by video conference.People were giving each other the elbow . . . instead of shaking hands to avoid transmission. Some had started doing it as a joke while others were taking it very seriously. Blair Effron, above, co-founder of Centerview Partners, got the coveted spot of going first to give his views on the state of the M&A market. He touched on two things sweeping across America: Covid-19 and the presidential primary fever. Kamala Harris, one of Effron’s preferred Democratic party candidates, quit the race a while back. But at one late-night dinner in the French Quarter as talk turned to Joe Biden’s comeback on Super Tuesday, speculation was rife that Harris would end up as his running mate.As he paced up and down the main ballroom at the Roosevelt Hotel, Effron told attendees that both the virus (a slide from his presentation is below) and upcoming election would weigh on dealmaking in 2020. Over the long term, environmental, social and governance objectives would become paramount to M&A, he said.M&A activity has been sluggish since the start of the year. The recent wavering and volatility in global stock markets driven by the spread of the virus is likely to complicate dealmaking, according to Paul Schnell, a partner at law firm Skadden Arps.Among the issues: the challenges of conducting due diligence and handicapping the effects of the virus on a target’s business; the availability and cost of acquisition financing if market volatility remains high; negotiating deal terms, including “material adverse change” provisions.At least one deal is keeping bankers and lawyers busy, even as the coronavirus dominates headlines. HP on Thursday rejected Xerox’s latest takeover approach and advised its shareholders not to tender their stock to Xerox. DD’s Eric Platt and Ortenca Aliaj spoke to HP chief executive Enrique Lores, who said he was evaluating other combinations. “Consolidation is going to happen in this space,” he told them. Many DD readers will be well aware that, just as stock markets were having a coronavirus-induced meltdown last week, private equity dealmakers tied up one of the biggest leveraged buyouts since the financial crisis. The story behind Advent International and Cinven’s €17.2bn deal to buy Thyssenkrupp’s lifts business has started to become clearer in this deep dive by DD’s Kaye Wiggins and Robert Smith, and FT colleague Joe Miller. The price tag was €700m higher than the final sum offered by a rival group led by buyout giants Blackstone and The Carlyle Group, the only other bidder at the final stage of the auction. Advent and Cinven’s deal valued the company at a hefty 14 times its adjusted earnings of just under €1.2bn. Leverage on the deal is roughly eight times earnings, an eye watering figure.Cue raised eyebrows from private equity types who remember the large and highly levered club deals of the pre-crisis era. “Every single cycle has a deal like that, a peak deal,” one said. Yet, in a sign of the allure of the Thyssenkrupp business, many people close to the bids that lost out to Advent and Cinven — and there were at least four other bidders — have been reluctant to criticise the winners. “I can’t say they’re going to do a bad deal,” one wounded rival said. “I wish I could, but they’re buying a fantastic business.” Private equity groups are sitting on record-sized funds that they have to invest — so, the buyout theory goes, why not pay up for a business with steady, reliable servicing revenues that make it relatively recession- and coronavirus-proof? Advent and Cinven planned to expand the business by acquiring new companies “as fast as it can reasonably digest” them, Ranjan Sen, a Frankfurt-based managing partner at Advent, said. The deal has got a vote of confidence from the riskier parts of the debt markets. On top of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans that equate to 6.9 times adjusted earnings, there could be an extra slice of financing known as payment-in-kind (PIK) debt, which is higher-risk because the borrower can pay interest with further debt.Large pools of money have been dedicated to this kind of lending, such as Blackstone’s GSO Capital Partners. As one banker put it, “people are falling over themselves to get into the PIK”. Maybe they’re right. But it would be ironic if this elevators deal someday comes crashing down.

It’s the latest move that puts him at odds with his father.Only weeks after criticising his father’s news outlets for promoting false scepticism about climate change, James Murdoch, below, is using his holding company Lupa Systems — which was created with part of the $2bn he received after his father sold 21st Century Fox to Walt Disney no less — to fund early-stage companies that use technology to tackle disinformation and foster a “more sustainable news ecosystem”.

3;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-03-05T16:56:09Z;HP open to other deals as it rejects Xerox offer;Computer maker dismisses $35bn stock-and-cash bid by smaller rival as inadequate;HP chief executive Enrique Lores said the $31bn printer and computer maker was evaluating other combinations as the company rejected an unsolicited offer from Xerox on Thursday.“Consolidation is going to happen in this space,” he told the Financial Times on Thursday. “There are other potential M&A [transactions] that we are constantly analysing. HP has a very global portfolio and M&A is a way to create value for our shareholders.”The Palo Alto, California-based company has been locked in a hostile takeover fight with its smaller rival Xerox. Xerox, which is backed by activist investor Carl Icahn, this week offered to buy stock from HP shareholders in its bid to force a combination of the two groups. HP, which recommended its shareholders not tender their stock, said that its board had received opinions from its financial advisers at Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities that the current Xerox offer is “inadequate”. Xerox declined to comment.Mr Lores and HP have remained adamant that the $35bn stock-and-cash offer from Xerox undervalues the company and that the debt Xerox will need to borrow to finance a takeover of its larger rival would be “irresponsible”. While Mr Lores said that he remained “open to a transaction” with Xerox, he ruled out the structure that his rival has proposed given his focus on keeping debt levels to roughly a third of what it has envisaged.There are many ways to put the two companies together. At this point the conversation is not about who buys whomThe HP chief executive on Tuesday held talks with his counterpart at Xerox, John Visentin, and the two discussed scheduling an in-person meeting for next week, according to filings with US securities regulators. People close to the two companies believe the $35bn bid from Xerox is an attempt to coax HP to present its own takeover offer for Xerox, after deal talks fell apart last year.“There are many ways to put the two companies together,” Mr Lores said. “At this point the conversation is not about who buys whom.”He added: “It [a deal] needs to have the right value. It needs to have the right capital structure and needs to be supported by the right synergies.”HP has moved to thwart the hostile approach from Xerox and to gain an upper hand in any negotiations. Last month it unveiled an aggressive plan to return $15bn to shareholders in the next three years, more than half of which would be completed over the next 12 months. To fund the share repurchase programme, HP said it would divert all of its free cash flow to share buybacks with the remainder to be subsidised by debt.The buyback programme alone could see HP double its leverage, which would make it nearly impossible for a Xerox bid to stay within Mr Lores’s target debt ratio of two times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Mr Lores said the company’s buyback plan had been well received by shareholders. “They like that we'll be returning close to 50 per cent of our market cap to shareholders over the next few years,” he said. HP shares were unchanged on Thursday as the broader market slid more than 2 per cent. Xerox stock declined roughly 4 per cent.
4;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-02-27T05:00:29Z;Icahn-inspired Xerox boss armed for bloody battle;John Visentin has emulated his backer’s aggression in a $35bn bid for HP;John Visentin is not someone you would imagine in a battle alongside Carl Icahn. A Canadian of blue collar origins, he spent most of his career working in big tech, including a 27-year stint at IBM — not launching the kind of corporate raids with which Mr Icahn has menaced executives for the past four decades.Yet in early 2018, after Mr Icahn learnt that Mr Visentin’s talks to become Xerox’s new chief executive ended following the company’s deal with Japan’s Fujifilm, the New York investor hired the executive as a consultant to plot opposition to the deal. Since then, Mr Icahn has won a proxy fight against Xerox’s old management, killed the deal with Fuji, and replaced the company’s chief executive with Mr Visentin — the ultimate reward for his ally.Now Mr Visentin, with the backing of Mr Icahn, is pursuing one of the goriest M&A battles of the year: a very hostile and highly-leveraged $35bn bid for HP, a rival manufacturer of printers and PCs more than three times its size.There is a twist. Many people close to the two companies believe Xerox’s bid and its aggressive tactics are a ploy to achieve a rather different kind of deal.HP held abortive talks about buying Xerox earlier last year. It believes Mr Visentin’s bid is really an attempt to coax the company to come back and present an offer to buy Xerox, according to people involved in the negotiations.It may well end up that way. HP has twice ratcheted up its defences in the past week, by implementing a poison pill and promising $15bn worth of share buybacks to make a hostile approach from Xerox more difficult to consummate. But it also said it was willing to reopen talks over a combination.People close to Xerox admitted that being taken over by HP was indeed a possibility. The only caveat, they said, was related to the leadership of the combined company. Specifically: Mr Visentin wants to lead it.Those people argue that Xerox’s boss would be the better choice, having already proved willing at his own company to aggressively cut jobs and leverage the balance sheet. They added that his rival Enrique Lores, who rose through HP’s ranks from an intern in 1989 to become chief executive four months ago, is considered to be too mild-mannered to successfully integrate the two groups. “His [Mr Visentin’s] history is very impressive,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale management professor who knows both Xerox and HP. “He seems to have a very sensible concept of how to work with HP on this deal.” Xerox claims that a combination would generate $2bn in cost and revenue synergies. “A combined company would be both more profitable and better-positioned to diversify into higher growth markets,” Mr Visentin told analysts last month.Touting his own achievements, he added: “If you look at our team and our track record of what we’ve done with ‘Project Own It’ here, we delivered $1bn [of synergies] over the past 18 months, and we’re on track to deliver the $450m-plus in 2020. So, we have the track record.”People close to Mr Lores argued that his experience at HP and engineering background made him better equipped to manage a complex company, and he had some support on Wall Street. “You can’t cut your way to growth,” said an experienced analyst tracking the sector, adding that “Mr Visentin would struggle to manage a company as diverse as HP”.Some of the hostile tactics Mr Visentin turned to in pursuit of HP, such as threatening to overthrow HP’s board of directors, are straight out of the activist handbook written by Mr Icahn and his cohorts. The fact that Mr Icahn was on both company’s shareholder registers was no subtle warning of what loomed for HP. HP has fought back by highlighting the worrying amount of debt that Xerox would need to borrow to fund its current bid, which makes the offer more akin to a leveraged buyout and would leave the combined company with a debt to earnings ratio of four times.Xerox already has a junk credit rating, limiting the amount of debt it can raise for a bid and making it harder for the company to lift its offer again. Its current bid values HP at about $23.59 a share, or roughly $1 above where HP shares changed hands on Wednesday. Shannon Cross, analyst at Cross Research, said that the share buyback announced by HP might be sufficient to convince its shareholders to back the company’s management rather than take Xerox’s offer.“We continue to believe a highly levered transaction, as would be required under terms outlined by Xerox, would be poorly received by investors,” Ms Cross said.HP, meanwhile, has hinted at exploring talks with other companies — Japan’s Canon and Ricoh have been floated by advisers as potential takeover targets — meaning their strategy could all still backfire on Messrs Visentin and Icahn. Some investors, though, have started betting the pair might just get their way. Xerox shares climbed after HP said on Monday that it would engage in discussions.“I have often been critical of Carl Icahn inspired initiatives,” said Mr Sonnenfeld. “But in this case I think they’re on to a logical path. These companies bring a lot to each other.” 
5;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-02-10T15:18:22Z;Xerox raises its takeover offer for HP;Proposed deal values the personal computer maker at about $35bn including debt;"Xerox has made a new offer of about $35bn, including debt, to buy personal computer maker HP, as it seeks to win over the support of its rival’s shareholders in a move that could escalate hostilities between the two companies.The latest sweetened offer of $24 per share — $18.40 in cash and 0.149 Xerox shares for each HP — represents a 41 per cent premium to HP’s unaffected 30-day stock price.The Connecticut-based company will take its offer directly to shareholders after HP’s board twice rejected a previous $22-a-share bid, saying it undervalued the company. Xerox will start its public takeover bid in March by offering to buy shares directly from investors. Shares in HP were up 2.7 per cent to $22.32 in early trading while Xerox shares advanced 1.1 per cent to $37.61.Xerox said it had met a number of HP investors as it has been actively trying to convince them of the merits of a combination, but did not name the shareholders to which it had spoken.“The tender offer announced today will enable these stockholders to accept Xerox’s compelling offer despite HP’s consistent refusal to pursue the opportunity,” Xerox said in a statement on Monday. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns stakes in both companies and ranks as one of HP’s largest shareholders, has lobbied in favour of a deal.HP has raised concerns about how its smaller rival Xerox will fund the deal, as well as questioning the business rationale. Xerox’s market value is less than a third of HP’s, but Xerox claims that the combination could potentially unlock as much as $2bn in annual cost savings.HP is particularly concerned about the decline in Xerox revenues and believes that a decision last year by Xerox to end its joint venture with Fujifilm left a sizeable strategic hole in Xerox’s portfolio. Xerox raised $2.3bn from the Fujifilm sale that it can use in its pursuit of HP as well as $24bn in financing for the deal from Citigroup, Mizuho Financial Group and Bank of America.In recent weeks Xerox has acquired a small stake in HP and has subsequently tried to replace its entire board — a common tactic in the arsenal of activist investors but an unusually aggressive move for a company trying to accomplish a merger. HP labelled the nominations “a self-serving tactic” by Xerox in its hopes to expedite a deal. The Xerox nominees include Betsy Atkins, the chief executive of venture capital firm Baja Corporation; Kim Fennebresque, who was previously a top banker at Lazard and UBS; Matthew Hart, an American Airlines board member; Jacob Katz, the former chairman of tax advisory group Grant Thornton; and Fred Hochberg, who served as the president of the US Export-Import Bank during the Obama administration."
6;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-01-23T23:50:24Z;Xerox/HP: moxie proxy;Drawn-out battle will give takeover target the time to show its restructuring plan is working;Watching the fight between Xerox and HP can feel a lot like watching a pair of bickering old-timers. The veteran tech companies have been trading barbs since November, when Xerox first went public with a $33bn takeover bid for its much larger rival printer maker. On Thursday Xerox launched a fresh attack. Two months after its hostile offer it now wants to overthrow HP’s board.A proxy fight is a tactic more often used by activist investors to pressure companies to come to the table. It is unusual to see it deployed by one company against another. Especially when the target’s market value is four times bigger than the would-be acquirer’s. Xerox’s main advantage is Carl Icahn. The billionaire activist investor owns 11 per cent of Xerox and has a long history of winning proxy fights. He managed to dissolve Xerox’s planned merger with Fujifilm in 2018 and install John Visentin as chief executive. Mr Icahn owns just 4 per cent of HP and supports the idea of a tie-up.HP has size and time on its side. The computer and printer maker rakes in six times more revenue and generates three times more free cash flow than Xerox. It also has no net debt. Even the $2bn in synergy touted by Xerox sounds less impressive when you consider that HP is already targeting $1bn of cost savings.Printer making is a fading industry in the digital age. It makes sense for Xerox and HP to join forces. The fact that the two held talks last year suggests as much. Price and control seem to be the main sticking points. HP has hinted that it would be open to a sweetened offer. Xerox is adamant HP must come to the negotiating table first.Xerox should stop being so stubborn. A drawn-out proxy battle will give HP the time necessary to show its restructuring plan is working. At the very least, it would give management time to use the company’s strong balance sheet to ramp up returns and keep the peace.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
7;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-01-23T18:09:50Z;Xerox tries to overthrow HP’s board;Copier company escalates hostile takeover bid for printer maker;"Xerox escalated its $33bn hostile takeover fight for control of HP on Thursday, proposing a new set of directors for the printer and computer maker’s board in an attempt to force HP to the negotiating table.The 11 nominations from Xerox, which is dwarfed in size by HP, include current and former investment bankers and consultants, as well as former executives from Verizon, Hilton and Novartis.The tactic, a common weapon in the arsenal of activist investors, is an unusually aggressive move for a company trying to accomplish a merger.HP has so far rejected overtures from Xerox, warning that it has “significant concerns” about the health of Xerox’s business and is sceptical of its rival’s ability to find $2bn of cost cuts if the two companies were to combine.Xerox in recent weeks bought a small stake in HP, giving it the right to nominate directors to the HP board, according to a person briefed on the matter. Its list of nominees would replace the entire HP board if a majority of shareholders backed its full slate of candidates. The Xerox nominees include Betsy Atkins, the chief executive of venture capital firm Baja Corporation; Kim Fennebresque, who was previously a top banker at Lazard and UBS; Matthew Hart, an American Airlines board member; Jacob Katz, the former chairman of tax advisory group Grant Thornton; and Fred Hochberg, who served as the president of the US Export-Import Bank during the Obama administration.“HP shareholders have told us they believe our acquisition proposal will bring tremendous value,” said Xerox chief executive John Visentin. “We believe HP shareholders will be better served by a new slate of independent directors who understand the challenges of operating a global enterprise.” Carl Icahn, the activist investor who owns stakes in both companies and ranks as one of HP’s largest shareholders, has pressured HP to agree to a tie-up. But the computer giant has so far refused to open its books to its smaller rival, which is valued at $12bn, including its debts.“These nominations are a self-serving tactic by Xerox to advance its proposal, which significantly undervalues HP and creates meaningful risk to the detriment of HP shareholders,” HP said in a statement.HP shares on Thursday rose 0.7 per cent to $22.08, eclipsing the $22 a share cash-and-stock offer Xerox has presented. HP has previously argued that the Xerox proposal “significantly undervalues” the company.In November, HP chief executive Enrique Lores and board chair Chip Bergh wrote to Mr Visentin, saying that his company’s “aggressive words and actions” to force a combination were opportunistic.“Fundamental issues have not gone away, and your now-public urgency to accelerate toward a deal . . . only heightens our concern about your business and prospects,” they said.HP is particularly concerned about the decline in Xerox revenues, people briefed on the matter said. In their letter to Mr Visentin, the HP pair also said they believed the decision by Xerox to leave its Fujifilm joint venture left a “sizeable strategic hole in Xerox’s portfolio”.Xerox has not been deterred by the HP defence. In January, the Connecticut-based company disclosed that it had secured up to $24bn in financing for the deal from Citigroup, Mizuho Financial Group and Bank of America. Xerox also cashed in $2.3bn from the sale of its 25 per cent stake in the Fujifilm joint venture when it sold its share to the Japanese company."

9;XRX;Xerox Corp;2019-11-27T02:41:01Z;HP/Xerox: good on paper;Savings as a result of a deal are appealing, but who will be in charge needs answering  ;If HP wants to convince shareholders that it can afford to reject Xerox’s $33bn acquisition it will need a better argument than its latest set of quarterly results. A teeny revenue rise does nothing to strengthen the US printer and personal computer maker’s case that it should be left alone.Fellow printer maker Xerox wants to buy bigger rival HP for $22 per share, a 20 per cent premium to HP’s undisturbed share price. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns shares in both companies, is pushing for the partnership. Markets like the idea too. Xerox and HP have added nearly $4bn to their combined market value since the offer was announced.The holdout is HP, which claims its shares are undervalued and is convinced that plans for a strategic overhaul are about to yield great results. The company has already spent billions of dollars in buybacks to appease shareholders as it tries to think its way out of a market decline. Emails and apps have reduced the need for home printers. Smartphones and tablets have chipped away at the market for personal computers. Revenues of $15bn in the last quarter of the fiscal year were up less than 1 per cent on the previous year and only slightly more than expected.Xerox’s cash and equity offer is a bold one. A rising share price this year means the company has an equity value of $8bn. It may have landed over $2bn from its sale of a stake in Fujifilm Holdings but it will still need to borrow heavily to buy HP, which has an enterprise value of $30bn. HP could choose instead to borrow and use the money to make an acquisition (Xerox maybe) while raising buybacks. Does Xerox have a better plan for HP than the company’s existing proposal of generous share buybacks, cost cuts and an attempt to move into services? Probably not. The appeal of a deal is that a combined business can stop competing and make cost savings. The question is who gets to be in charge.
10;XRX;Xerox Corp;2019-11-26T22:28:30Z;Xerox turns to HP shareholders with $33bn takeover proposal;Hostilities escalate as PC maker reports upbeat earnings and outlook;Xerox said it would take its proposal for a $33bn takeover of HP directly to the personal computer maker’s shareholders, escalating hostilities between the two companies in the wake of HP’s rejection of the idea. Xerox made the declaration on Tuesday shortly before HP announced a bullish earnings projection for its next fiscal year.The embattled PC and printer maker, which turned down a request to open its books to Xerox over the weekend, recorded revenue growth of only 0.3 per cent in the latest quarter, ending a fiscal year in which sales only advanced 0.5 per cent.However, at $15.4bn, revenue was still ahead of expectations and represented growth of nearly 2 per cent on a constant currency basis.Its shares rose more than 1 per cent to about $20.40 in after-hours trading, giving it a lift in its efforts to fend off Xerox’s unwanted $22-a-share bid. It has left the door open to turning the tables and acquiring Xerox, which is far smaller than HP, and said it wanted to conduct its own review of Xerox to see if a potential merger had any merit before giving its rival non-public information.Xerox last week threatened to turn its bid into a hostile one if HP declined to enter into merger talks. Xerox had pushed for both groups to begin evaluating one another in an attempt to move closer to a deal. “We plan to engage directly with HP shareholders to solicit their support in urging the HP board to do the right thing and pursue this compelling opportunity,” John Visentin, Xerox chief executive, wrote in a letter on Tuesday to Enrique Lores and Chip Bergh, HP’s chief executive and chairman, respectively.Carl Icahn, the activist investor who owns stakes in both companies and ranks as one of HP’s largest shareholders, has lobbied in favour of the tie-up. HP has been sceptical of Xerox’s ability to fund the deal. Xerox has less than a third of HP’s equity value. But Xerox is flush with cash after it agreed to sell its 25 per cent stake in a venture with Fujifilm to the Japanese group for $2.3bn. In the letter on Tuesday, Mr Visentin sought to dispel concerns that Xerox would be unable to finance the transaction, saying the offer “does not contain a financing contingency”, and “is neither ‘highly conditional’ nor ‘uncertain’ as you claim”. HP declined to comment on the letter and on an earnings call with analysts Mr Lores said he would not answer any questions about Xerox.The company said it expected to see pro forma earnings per share of $2.24-$2.32 in the fiscal year that began this month. That is above the $2.23 analysts had been expecting from HP.In a letter on Sunday to Xerox’s Mr Visentin, Mr Lores and Mr Bergh wrote that the “fundamental issues have not gone away, and your now-public urgency to accelerate toward a deal . . . only heightens our concern about your business and prospects”. Xerox shares fell 1 per cent on Tuesday to $38.30, giving the company a market valuation of roughly $8bn.
11;XRX;Xerox Corp;2019-11-25T01:25:15Z;HP refuses to open its books to Xerox over $33bn buyout offer;Acquisition target pushes own review to determine if combining businesses ‘has any merit’;HP refused to open its books to Xerox and once again rejected the printer and photocopier maker’s $33bn buyout offer on Sunday evening, putting the company on track for a hostile battle with the Carl Icahn-backed group.The HP board said the offer from Xerox “significantly undervalues” the company and that it would not conduct mutual due diligence with its rival, given the uncertainty it believed Xerox would face attempting to raise the cash portion of its $22 a share offer.HP instead pushed to conduct its own review of Xerox to determine if a combination of the two companies “has any merit” before it gives Xerox nonpublic information about its business. “It is clear in your aggressive words and actions that Xerox is intent on forcing a potential combination on opportunistic terms and without providing adequate information,” HP chief executive Enrique Lores and board chair Chip Bergh wrote in a letter to John Visentin, the Xerox chief executive.“Fundamental issues have not gone away, and your now-public urgency to accelerate toward a deal . . . only heightens our concern about your business and prospects,” they wrote.The overwhelming support our offer will receive from HP shareholders should resolve any further doubts you haveXerox declined to comment.The two companies had spent months this year pursuing a potential transaction but the negotiations ultimately fell apart. In November, Xerox made a buyout proposal for its larger rival, but was rebuffed days later. HP left open the possibility that the two companies could come to an agreement at the time.Xerox, which has less than a third of HP’s equity value, had set a Monday deadline to begin mutual due diligence towards a deal and threatened to take its offer directly to HP shareholders if the personal computer maker did not agree.“The overwhelming support our offer will receive from HP shareholders should resolve any further doubts you have regarding the wisdom of swiftly moving forward to complete the transaction,” Mr Visentin wrote in a letter to HP last week.Xerox is flush with cash after it agreed to sell its 25 per cent stake in a joint venture with Fujifilm to the Japanese group for $2.3bn, ending a near two-year dispute that at one point included a dramatic court battle with Mr Icahn.The activist investor has pushed for a combination between the two groups and now ranks as one of the largest HP shareholders, according to Refinitiv data.HP’s chief executive and board chairman on Sunday said they were concerned about racing to complete a deal given the decline in Xerox revenues. They also said they believed Xerox’s decision to exit its Fujifilm joint venture left a “sizeable strategic hole in Xerox's portfolio”.“There are significant concerns about both the near-term health and long-term viability of your business that have a significant impact on Xerox's value,” Mr Lores and Mr Bergh wrote in their letter. “The question of whether there is a path to turn around your business is a threshold issue.”
12;XRX;Xerox Corp;2019-11-21T16:20:08Z;Xerox threatens to go hostile in HP takeover bid;PC and printer maker given days to agree to pursue a ‘friendly combination’;Xerox has given HP an ultimatum in its effort to acquire the PC and printer maker, threatening to turn its bid into a hostile one unless the company agrees by next week to pursue a “friendly combination”.HP turned down the $22-a-share bid on Sunday, saying it “significantly undervalues” the company, and asked for more information about Xerox’s business prospects. HP left the door open to “a potential combination” of the two companies.In its response on Thursday, Xerox said its board is “determined to expeditiously pursue our proposed acquisition of HP to completion — we see no cause for further delay”.“Accordingly, unless you and we agree on mutual confirmatory due diligence to support a friendly combination by 5:00pm. EST on Monday, November 25, 2019, Xerox will take its compelling case to create superior value for our respective shareholders directly to your shareholders,” John Visentin, Xerox chief executive, wrote in a letter to HP’s board.HP didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.People briefed about the talks between the two companies said there was a strong desire on both sides to find a way to combine the companies as they agree that they would complement each other.Xerox’s letter is an attempt to push HP to come to the table in a more constructive way rather than a full blown hostile threat, said a person close to the situation.Xerox, known for its office printers and photocopiers, launched its unsolicited bid on November 5, a month after HP announced its intention to cut jobs under a turnround plan. HP’s shares were down 4 per cent year-to-date as of Thursday. Xerox has gained more than 95 per cent.In the letter, Mr Visentin said there would be “no financing condition to the completion of our acquisition of HP”.Activist investor Carl Icahn, a shareholder in both Xerox and HP, has called a tie-up a “no-brainer”. He told the Wall Street Journal in an interview last week he wasn’t set on a particular structure for a combination.
13;XRX;Xerox Corp;2019-11-17T21:02:05Z;HP board unanimously rejects Xerox offer;Door remains open to higher bid as PC group questions trajectory of smaller rival;HP’s board of directors has unanimously rejected a $22-a-share bid from rival Xerox, while leaving the door open to “a potential combination” of the two companies.Carl Icahn, the veteran activist investor, owns stakes in both companies, and has described a tie-up as “a no-brainer”. Launched on November 5, Xerox’s unsolicited cash-and-shares offer represented a premium of about 20 per cent to HP’s closing share price. But in a letter to Xerox chief executive John Visentin sent on Sunday, HP’s board dismissed the bid, saying it “significantly undervalues” the company.Still, the HP board signalled its openness to a transaction, while demanding more information about Xerox’s business prospects and the scale of any potential synergies.PC sales accounted for nearly two-thirds of HP’s $58bn revenues in 2018. But the smaller printer and ink cartridge business is far more lucrative, bringing in 71 per cent of the company’s operating profits last year.Any proposed tie up with Xerox, which makes printers and photocopiers, would have to contend with “significant questions . . . regarding the trajectory of [the Xerox] business,” HP’s letter said. Xerox’s annual revenue had fallen by nearly 10 per cent since June 2018, on a trailing 12-month basis, and now stood at $9.2bn, the letter added.HP has acknowledged having “conversations . . . from time to time” about a tie-up with Xerox. The computer maker said it had already made known its “fundamental” questions about Xerox’s direction “in connection with our prior requests for diligence”.With “substantive engagement” from Xerox management, the HP board said it would be in a position to “quickly” evaluate the merits of a potential deal.In making an unsolicited approach for its larger rival, Xerox has been trying to capitalise on a rally in its shares, which have risen 47 per cent in the past year.HP has shed about 14 per cent of its value over the same period, even allowing for a November rally after news of the bid interest emerged.Mr Icahn disclosed a 4.24 per cent stake in HP to the Wall Street Journal last week, stating that companies “in shrinking industries tend to decline much more slowly than many market participants may predict, while continuing to generate substantial amounts of cash.”He also holds a 10.6 per cent stake in Xerox, and said he expected a combination would unleash synergies.
14;XRX;Xerox Corp;2019-11-06T22:12:48Z;Xerox makes $30bn bid for rival HP;Combination could lead to cost savings of up to $2bn a year, say analysts;Xerox has launched a bold bid to acquire its much larger rival HP for more than $30bn, including debt, in a move to revive the fortunes of two former tech innovators that have struggled for growth in recent years.The US printer and photocopier maker made a cash-and-stock offer late on Tuesday valuing HP, which makes printers and personal computers, at about $22 per share, according to people briefed on the matter.Xerox’s unsolicited proposal represents approximately a 20 per cent premium on HP’s closing price on Tuesday.Citigroup has agreed to finance Xerox’s offer, which would have a meaningful cash portion, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.As part of the proposal John Visentin, Xerox chief executive, would lead the new combined company, people briefed on the matter said. Dion Weisler, HP chief executive, announced this year that he would be stepping down “due to a family health matter”.Xerox’s market value is less than a third of HP’s but the combination could potentially unlock as much as $2bn in annual cost savings.HP’s share price jumped more than 10 per cent on Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal first reported that Xerox was planning a bid. Xerox’s stock price rose 2.3 per cent.HP acknowledged in a statement late on Wednesday it had received an offer from Xerox, without indicating whether it would engage. The PC maker added it had considerd a deal in the past, without specifying any time frame.A person close to HP said the likelihood of a deal materialising remained slim, although no final decision had been taken.Xerox is trying to take advantage of the recent run-up in its share price, which is up 26 per cent over the past 12 months. HP by contrast has shed nearly 18 per cent of its value over the same period.The move came just hours after Xerox agreed to sell its 25 per cent stake in its joint venture with Fujifilm to the Japanese group for $2.3bn.Despite the windfall, Jeriel Ong, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said Xerox will need to borrow heavily to complete the transaction.Both companies operate at different ends of an industry that is in cyclical decline. Xerox makes large printers and copy machines for office use. Most of its $10bn revenues last year came from renting and servicing them for businesses.HP, on the other hand, specialises in consumer printers. While PC sales accounted for nearly two-thirds of HP’s $58bn revenues in 2018, printers — and, more precisely, ink cartridges — are its main cash cow. The division brought in 71 per cent of its operating profits last year.HP’s main printing business, in A4-sized documents, has been in decline, putting pressure on it to expand in the commercial A3 market where Xerox is stronger. HP recently claimed to have hit 10 per cent of the $50bn A3 market. Together with Xerox’s 15 per cent share, a combination would make the two a much stronger competitor to market leaders Ricoh and Canon, according to analysts at UBS.A purchase of HP, second only to Lenovo in PCs with a market share of 22 per cent, would mark a historic moment in the PC industry, where Xerox was an early pioneer.Steve Jobs, then Apple’s chief executive, saw Xerox’s work on a graphical user interface, controlled by a mouse, on a visit to the company’s research centre in 1979, giving him the idea for the Mac. Xerox’s failure to capitalise on its breakthrough ideas has since become a leading case study in how companies often miss out on big new markets they help create.Xerox declined to comment.

But, in terms of financing the deal, Xerox is a much smaller company — its market cap is only $8bn and HP Inc's is now $30bn, after its shares rose 11 per cent today on the report. Still, HP shares are down nearly 20 per cent over the past 12 months while Xerox's have risen nearly 30 per cent, and the Journal suggests an informal funding commitment from a major bank could help bridge the gap. There is also the $2.3bn Xerox can expect from the sale of its 25 per cent stake in the Fuji Xerox joint venture.A merger could strengthen two Silicon Valley legends (think the original HP start-up garage and the innovation that came out of the Xerox PARC laboratory) against strong Asian competition. UBS analysts recently downgraded HP's shares from “Buy” to “Neutral”, citing the print supplies industry being in secular decline and margins for its PC business coming under pressure. With 22 per cent of global shipments in the third quarter, HP is the number two PC maker behind China's Lenovo (25 per cent).It has more than 40 per cent of the printer market, while Xerox leads in copiers and “managed print services”. Lex says the move could unite two US manufacturers of increasingly obsolete office technology. This could all collate well, but Xerox first needs to add more paper.1.

16;XRX;Xerox Corp;2019-11-06T17:54:13Z;Xerox/HP: printer jamming;A merger would unite two US manufacturers of an increasingly obsolete office technology;Talk about a minnow swallowing a whale. Printer maker Xerox is looking at taking over its much larger peer HP. The move would unite two US manufacturers of increasingly obsolete office technology.Details remain scant. But a combination makes sense. Xerox specialises in the office and business end of the printer business. HP, on the other hand, focuses on smaller printers for consumer use.Joining forces would create a company with nearly $70bn in annual revenues. A tie-up will also unlock billions in savings. The sticking points will be structure and financing. These may be messier to sort out than a broken ink toner. Especially given that HP has just installed a new CEO.You cannot blame Xerox for trying. Its shares have surged 26 per cent over the past 12 months, giving currency for a cash and stock deal. HP, by contrast, has shed nearly 18 per cent of its value over the same period. On a forward earnings basis, HP is trading at around eight times, a substantial discount to 13 times a year ago.Still, Xerox’s smaller size will limit the amount of equity it can offer. Its market value stands at just $8bn. HP is worth $30bn, after investors bid up the stock by 10 per cent on Wednesday.To get HP to the table, Xerox will have to stump up a generous cash component. An offer of $22 a share, with two-thirds of that in cash, may do the trick. At this level, the bid would give HP an enterprise value of around $32.7bn and represent a 20 per cent premium to Tuesday’s closing price.Xerox is expecting a $2.3bn cash windfall from the sale of its stake in its joint venture with Fujifilm Holdings. But it would have to borrow heavily - to the tune of $24bn. A back of the envelope calculation suggests the new company would have net debt 3.5 times 2019 ebitda. That is high.

17;XRX;Xerox Corp;2019-11-05T09:23:36Z;Xerox exits Fujifilm joint venture with $2.3bn sale to Japanese partner;Investors cheer deal that draws a line under a bruising two-year battle;Xerox has agreed to sell its 25 per cent stake in its joint venture with Fujifilm to the Japanese group for $2.3bn, ending a near two-year dispute that pitted the Japanese company against activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.With the deal announced on Tuesday, Fujifilm will be officially scrapping its $6.1bn bid for the US printer and photocopier maker and dropping its $1bn lawsuit against Xerox, which it filed last year after Xerox abruptly called off their proposed merger.“These agreements reset our relationship with Fujifilm and provide both companies with tremendous opportunities to grow,” John Visentin, Xerox’s chief executive, said in a statement. The sale draws a line under a bitter battle that saw the 113-year-old US copier maker capitulate to the demands of its two major rebellious shareholders by firing its then chief executive Jeff Jacobson.The deal marks a defeat for the personal ambitions of Shigetaka Komori, the 80-year-old chief executive of Fujifilm, who had sought to cement one of the oldest US-Japan corporate partnerships — the Fuji Xerox joint venture, which has grown to generate nearly half of the Japanese group’s revenues since its creation in 1962. But investors welcomed his decision, with shares in Fujifilm rising 6.7 per cent after the Wall Street Journal reported on the deal ahead of its announcement after market close. Xerox called off its controversial sale to Fujifilm in May last year in a truce with Mr Icahn and Mr Deason, who had criticised the deal as undervaluing the US company. But even then, Fujifilm had not given up hopes of salvaging the deal. The Japanese group on Tuesday said it had gained confidence that it could run the joint venture on its own after carrying out job cuts and various restructuring measures to improve its profitability. The agreement also involves the purchase of Xerox’s stake in a smaller joint venture with Fuji Xerox.“This transaction is an ideal next step for Fuji Xerox and Fujifilm that we believe serves our stakeholders well,” Mr Komori said in a statement. Fujifilm shareholders had been sceptical of the proposed merger, questioning the merits of spending such a large sum of money for a business in a saturated market. They had urged Mr Komori to invest more in other businesses such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics that the group branched out into when its analogue film business crumbled.“Many investors had thought Fujifilm should not buy a company that has little growth potential,” said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management. “The money should be more wisely spent on other growth areas.”
18;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-10-23T03:03:51Z;Pressure is on for Icahn and Deason to produce results at Xerox;Investors may wonder if duo outsmarted themselves to detriment of all company backers;Winning the case was never part of the master plan. But a shock courtroom victory in late April for investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason handed them control of Xerox and halted a complex merger struck by the US office products company that the pair hated.Yet in the months since, the superior M&A options for Xerox championed by the duo have yet to materialise. Its stock price has languished. Even their legal victory has vanished as a New York appeals court last week overturned the April verdict that had upended a signed merger deal Xerox had with Fujifilm, the Japanese company with which it has a longstanding joint venture in Asia.The appellate victory vindicates the actions of Jeff Jacobson, the deposed Xerox chief executive, and the rest of the board whom Mr Icahn and Mr Deason had trashed as incompetent and compromised. As for ordinary shareholders, they are left to wonder if these two pugnacious personalities outsmarted themselves to the detriment of all Xerox backers. The US maker of printers and photocopiers has a decades-long arrangement with Fujifilm to distribute its office equipment in Asia via a unit called Fuji Xerox. When rumours of a deal combining Xerox with the joint venture surfaced in January, Mr Icahn and Mr Deason began to agitate against the combination describing management as “lacking intestinal fortitude”. Their contempt only grew after the complicated deal terms were announced at the end of January. Xerox and Fuji Xerox were to combine in an effective merger of equals with Fuji taking a slight majority of the equity. Other than a special dividend, Xerox shareholders were not being cashed out by the all-share deal and the $1.7bn in annual estimated synergies were set to take years to be realised.Mr Deason, who became a top shareholder in Xerox after selling his company to the group in 2010, and Mr Icahn objected to the complexity and economic split. They accused Xerox management and board of signing up an inferior Fujifilm deal simply because they were to get jobs at the new company. Mr Deason, with the support of the veteran activist investor, then sought an injunction to block the announced deal as well as to allow him to run a proxy contest to replace the Xerox board. Their argument stated that the Xerox board breached their fiduciary duties by signing a merger that favoured their selfish interests. The New York state judge granted the injunction in late April ruling that the former Xerox CEO was “hopelessly conflicted” and the board “acted in bad faith in structuring and negotiating the proposed transaction”. The injunction was seismic. It halted a shareholder vote and allowed Mr Icahn and Mr Deason to run a proxy contest. The Xerox board surrendered and Mr Jacobson departed. A new Xerox head was handpicked by the pair along with five new board members. The new Xerox leadership then terminated the merger over concerns of accounting problems at the joint venture. After all that, the Xerox stock price, which had jumped to $34 a share after the merger was announced, has now drifted below $27. Boards are frequently accused of breaching their duties. But what made this injunction shocking to most legal observers is that courts rarely intervene in a live M&A process. Rather they let shareholders vote on the deal so they are not deprived of the chance to approve a value-creating transaction. Wrongdoing can be litigated later with the remedy of monetary damages. One adviser involved in the deal said: “Xerox shareholders were robbed of voting on the deal. Icahn and Deason promised the world. Where are HP and Apollo?”, referring to the other rival bidders for Xerox that had been floated but have not yet materialised. In reversing the injunction last week, the New York appeals court ruled that any conflicts of interest were disclosed and that the deal was not obviously “unreasonable on its face”. As it was structured, the original deal was likely going to be voted down and Fujifilm and Xerox were in the process of renegotiating. However, the renegotiation collapsed because of the consequences of the injunction. Despite filing a breach of contract lawsuit against Xerox over the deal’s collapse, Fujifilm reiterated its interest in a combination with its US rival in a statement last week. Mr Deason and Xerox did not respond to a request for comment. In a Financial Times interview, Mr Icahn remained both defiant and amenable to Fujifilm. “John Visentin [the CEO of Xerox] is doing a tremendous job cutting waste. You need patience to make it work. We were not opposed to a deal with Fuji . . . there are a lot of synergies but there was no way we were going to get into a position where we owned 49 per cent of a company and Fuji owned 51 per cent. A deal makes sense but it just makes more sense for them.” Mr Icahn added: “Investor activism really works. Over the decades, we’ve averaged 17 to 18 per cent annualised returns and have created perhaps $1tn for shareholders.” The pressure is on, however, to make it work soon at Xerox.sujeet.indap@ft.com
19;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-09-06T04:00:52Z;Why big companies squander good ideas;The FT’s Undercover Economist on the real reasons that corporate innovation dies;"J F C Fuller did not invent the tank. That distinction should probably fall to E L de Mole, an Australian who approached the British war office in 1912 with a design that was — in the words of historians Kenneth Macksey and John Batchelor — “so convincingly similar to those which finally went into service that one wonders why it was never adopted from the outset”. But when the British army eventually introduced the tank, it was J F C Fuller, chief staff officer of what would later become the tank corps, who understood what to do with it.At 39 years old, Fuller was a small man with a neatly trimmed moustache and a hairline that had retreated over his crown and was beginning to march down the back of his head. He could have passed for a butler in a costume drama, but his appearance belied an inner radicalism. (He had been friends — and then enemies — with the occultist Aleister Crowley.)Late in 1917, after almost 400 British tanks had, with modest success, lumbered across the German lines at the battle of Cambrai, Fuller applied his radical streak to the problem of using the tank effectively. A new and much faster tank, the Medium D, could travel 200 miles at a speed of 20 miles per hour. Fuller proposed that these tanks would attack the German army’s brain — the string of German headquarters miles behind the front line. A Medium D could roll across the trenches and be on the German command posts in an hour; Fuller’s attack would come from nowhere. Air support would disrupt German road and rail travel. “Bad news confuses, confusion stimulates panic,” wrote Fuller. His idea was dubbed Plan 1919. By striking suddenly at the German command, Plan 1919 would cause the German army to disintegrate. It would, Fuller declared, be “the winning of the war in a single battle”.His astonishing idea became “the most famous unused plan in military history”, according to his biographer Brian Holden Reid. But, of course, that is not entirely true. It was used to great effect, in 1940 — by the Germans. J F C Fuller had invented blitzkrieg. The story might be a historical curiosity, had echoes of it not been repeated so frequently since the British army stuffed Fuller’s plans for blitzkrieg into a desk drawer. Organisations from newspapers to oil majors to computing giants have persistently struggled to embrace new technological opportunities, or recognise new technological threats, even when the threats are mortal or the opportunities are golden. Why do some ideas slip out of the grasp of incumbents, then thrive in the hands of upstarts?There is an obvious explanation for all of these failures and missed opportunities: people are idiotsIn 1970, the photocopying giant Xerox established the Palo Alto Research Center, or Parc. Xerox Parc then developed the world’s first personal computer, with a graphical user interface, windows, icons and a mouse. Bill Gates of Microsoft and Steve Jobs of Apple observed developments at Xerox Parc with great interest. Xerox still makes photocopiers. In 1975, a 24-year-old engineer named Steven Sasson built the world’s first digital camera — a patched-together device scavenging a lens from a Super-8 camera, magnetic tape in a portable cassette recorder and a TV screen. Sasson worked for Eastman Kodak, where in 1989 he and his colleagues also constructed the first modern digital SLR camera. Kodak built a sizeable line of business in digital photography, and earned a small fortune from the patents. Yet Kodak could not adjust to a world in which every phone contained a camera. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2012. In 1999, Sony launched the “Memory Stick Walkman”, one of the world’s first digital music players. Sony was armed with the iconic Walkman brand, some of the world’s best consumer electronics engineers and the talent-soaked Sony-BMG music label. The Memory Stick Walkman went nowhere and, two years later, it was eclipsed by a product that transformed the fortunes of a struggling Apple: the iPod.And in 1918, Britain had the best tanks in the world, a clear vision of how to use them and, in Fuller, one of the best military strategists to emerge from the British army. The German army was forbidden to use tanks at all; it was scarcely more than a collection of officers, a head without a body. Heinz Guderian, later one of the leading Panzer commanders, had not even seen the inside of a tank until he managed to go on manoeuvres with the Swedish army in 1929. Yet by the late 1930s, the British had conceded technical and tactical superiority to Hitler’s new army.There is an obvious explanation for all of these failures and missed opportunities: people are idiots. “Now we can get back to some real soldiering,” remarked one senior officer to Fuller at the end of the first world war — as though defending Britain in an existential struggle had been a frivolous distraction from tending to noble horses, bright buckles and shiny boots. The army blocked publication of Fuller’s books for several years; they were seen as insubordinate.When Steve Jobs visited Xerox Parc in 1979, and saw a windows-and-mouse interface for the first time, he couldn’t contain himself, according to an article by Malcolm Gladwell. “Why aren’t you doing anything with this?” he yelled. “This is the greatest thing. This is revolutionary!” If Jobs had been teleported into the British war office in the 1920s, he might well have said the same thing.Idiocy is a tempting explanation and not without merit. The top man in the British army, Field Marshal Sir Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd, responded to the threat of Nazi militarisation by increasing the amount spent on forage for horses by a factor of 10. Cavalry officers would be provided with a second horse; tank officers would get a horse too. As I say: people are idiots.When Steve Jobs saw Xerox’s windows-and-mouse interface, he couldn’t contain himself. ‘This is revolutionary!’ he yelledBut there is something about the “idiot” theory that feels too glib. Consider Xerox Parc: how is it that a corporation could be smart enough to establish such a superb research centre, but then fail to take advantage? Was Sony really run by idiots in the 1990s? Even Montgomery-Massingberd is too casually caricatured. These organisations stumbled for a reason. Management theorists have a word for it: disruption.“Disruption describes what happens when firms fail because they keep making the kinds of choices that made them successful,” says Joshua Gans, an economist at the Rotman School of Management in Toronto and author of The Disruption Dilemma. Successful organisations stick to their once-triumphant strategies, even as the world changes around them. More horses! More forage!Why does this happen? Easily the most famous explanation comes from Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School. Christensen’s 1997 book, The Innovator’s Dilemma, told a compelling story about how new technologies creep up from below: they are flawed or under-developed at first, so do not appeal to existing customers. Holiday snappers do not want to buy digital cameras the size of a shoebox and the price of a car. However, Christensen explains, these technologies do find customers: people with unusual needs previously unserved by the incumbent players. The new technology gets better and, one day, the incumbent wakes up to discover that an upstart challenger has several years’ head start — and once-loyal customers have jumped ship.Christensen’s story is an elegant one and fits some cases brilliantly. But there are many examples that do not fit — such as the failure of Xerox to exploit the cutting-edge research at Parc. The mouse and the graphic user interface aren’t a low-end competitor to the photocopier. They’re from a completely different universe.The iPod didn’t sneak up on Sony from below: the company had seen the potential of a digital music player and moved quickly. Dominant organisations often see the disruptive technologies coming. “Kodak and Blockbuster weren’t caught by surprise,” Joshua Gans tells me. “They knew what the future looked like. They didn’t know later than everybody else, they knew ahead of everybody else.” They knew; but they were unable to put together the right response.There is also a striking counter-example to Christensen’s idea that disruptive technologies begin as flawed or low-quality options. The iPhone was priced as a premium product with never-before-seen capabilities. It devastated Nokia and Research In Motion — now simply named BlackBerry Ltd in an echo of its once-iconic offering. Christensen has tried to fit the iPhone into his theories. At first he predicted that incumbents would easily respond, and later he recast it as a disruption in a different industry altogether: “It was intended to disrupt the laptop. And that’s the way it happened.”The laptop? Tell that to Nokia and BlackBerry.Anyway, is the tank a low-end competitor to the horse? That’s a stretch. When a theory needs to be made this elastic, it may be time to look for another theory.In 1990, a young economist named Rebecca Henderson published an article with her supervisor Kim Clark that presented a different view of why it is hard to do new things in old organisations. The relevant word is “organisations”. Dominant organisations are prone to stumble when the new technology requires a new organisational structure. An innovation might be radical but, if it fits the structure that already existed, an incumbent firm has a good chance of carrying its lead from the old world to the new.Consider, for example, IBM — the giant of mainframe computing. IBM is a survivor. It predates the digital computer by more than three decades. While the performance of computers was being revolutionised by the semiconductor, the integrated circuit, the hard drive and the compiler, IBM maintained a dominant position without breaking stride. This was because the organisational challenge of making and selling a sophisticated mainframe computer to a bank in the 1970s was not greatly different from the organisational challenge of making and selling a mechanical tabulating machine to a bank in the 1930s. Change was constant but manageable.When computers started to be bought by small businesses, hobbyists and even parents, IBM faced a very different challenge. It did build a successful business in PCs, but was unable to maintain its old dominance, or bring to bear its historical strengths. In fact, the PC division prospered only as long as it was able to snub the rest of the organisation, often partnering with component suppliers and distributors that directly competed with IBM divisions. Internal politics soon asserted itself. A case study co-authored by Henderson describes the PC division as “smothered by support from the parent company”. Eventually, the IBM PC business was sold off to a Chinese company, Lenovo. What had flummoxed IBM was not the pace of technological change — it had long coped with that — but the fact that its old organisational structures had ceased to be an advantage.Rather than talk of radical or disruptive innovations, Henderson and Clark used the term “architectural innovation”. “An architectural innovation is an innovation that changes the relationship between the pieces of the problem,” Henderson tells me. “It can be hard to perceive, because many of the pieces remain the same. But they fit together differently.” An architectural innovation challenges an old organisation because it demands that the organisation remake itself. And who wants to do that?The armies of the late 19th century were organised — as armies had long been — around cavalry and infantry. Cavalry units offered mobility. Infantry offered strength in numbers and the ability to dig in defensively.Three technologies emerged to define the first world war: artillery, barbed wire and the machine gun. They profoundly shaped the battlefield, but also slipped easily into the existing decision-making structures. Barbed wire and machine guns were used to reinforce infantry positions. Artillery could support either cavalry or infantry from a distance.Tanks, however, were different. In some ways they were like cavalry, since their strength lay partly in their ability to move quickly. In other ways, they fitted with the infantry, fighting alongside foot soldiers. Or perhaps tanks were a new kind of military capability entirely; this was the view taken by J F C Fuller.These discussions might seem philosophical — but in the light of Henderson’s ideas, they are intensely practical. “You have to find an organisation that will accept the new bit of technology,” says Andrew Mackay. Mackay runs an advisory firm, Complexas, but was also the commander of British and coalition forces in Helmand, Afghanistan, in 2008. “The organisational question is deeply unsexy, but it’s fundamental.”A more recent example: is the helicopter basically a kind of aeroplane, and therefore an asset of the Royal Air Force? Or something quite different? Who should be in charge of drones today?So it was with the tank. If it was to prosper, it needed an organisational home. Someone would have to argue for it, someone would have to pay for it, and someone would have to make it all work, technologically and tactically.Perhaps the two most obvious places to put the tank were as a standalone unit (since it offered quite new capabilities) or in cavalry regiments (since it was highly mobile and the horse was becoming obsolete). There were traps along either route: the established regiments would resist a standalone structure for tanks, which would compete for resources while the postwar army was shrinking. A new tank regiment would lack both allies and the heft of historical tradition. After various twists and turns, it was the cavalry that ended up as the organisational home of the tank. And cavalry officers certainly understand a highly mobile strike capability. But they were never really organised around the concept of “mobility”. They were organised around horses. The cavalry officer loved his horse and rode it with skill. His regiment was devoted to feeding and caring for the horses. Would he not resist the usurper tank with every fibre of his being? Xerox Parc developed or assembled most of the features of a user-friendly personal computer, but Xerox itself did not have the organisational architecture to manufacture and market it. Xerox Parc did develop the laser printer, a product that matched the company’s expertise nicely. As Gladwell pointed out, this easily paid for the entire Parc project.The laser printer was like artillery or the machine gun for Xerox: it was an exciting new technology, but it was not a challenge to the organisation’s architecture. The personal computer was like the tank.The same is true for Sony and the Memory Stick Walkman. As Sony expanded, it produced radios and televisions, video recorders and camcorders, computers, game consoles and even acquired a film and music empire. But to keep this sprawl manageable, Sony’s leaders divided it into silos. As Gillian Tett explains in The Silo Effect, the silo that produced the PlayStation had almost nothing to do with the silo that produced portable CD players. The Memory Stick Walkman was like the tank: it didn’t fit neatly into any category. To be a success, the silos that had been designed to work separately would have to work together. That required an architectural change that Sony tried but failed to achieve.The tank was like the personal computer: it required a different organisational architectureAnd for IBM, the shift from a mechanical tabulator to a mainframe digital computer was like the shift from rifles to the machine gun: an awesome step up in firepower, but a modest adjustment to organisational capacity. The tank was like the personal computer: it may have been a logical step forward given the technology available, but it required a different organisational architecture — one that bypassed and threatened the existing power centres of Big Blue. That was the problem.The politics of organisational change are never easy. In the case of the tank, they were brutal. The British public never wanted to fight another war in mainland Europe, and the tank represented an admission that they might have to. The armed forces were starved of cash in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1932, the British army ordered just nine tanks — delicate four-tonners. The total weight of this entire force was less than a single German Tiger tank. But at a time of declining budgets, who could justify buying more?It did not help that the tank enthusiasts were often politically naive. Since an architectural innovation requires an organisational overhaul, it is a task requiring skilful diplomacy. Fuller was no diplomat. His essays and books were dotted with spiky critiques of senior military officers. After a while, even the junior officers who admired his wit began to tire of his “needlessly offensive” lecturing. Despite alienating the army top brass, Fuller was handed a unique opportunity to advance the cause of tanks in the British army: he was offered the command of a new experimental mechanised force in December 1926.There was just one problem: he would have to step away from his single-minded focus on the tank, also taking command of an infantry brigade and a garrison. In short, Fuller would have to get into the organisational headaches that surround any architectural innovation. He baulked, and wrote to the head of the army demanding that these other duties be carried out by someone else, eventually threatening to resign. The position was awarded to another officer, and Fuller’s career never recovered. His petulance cost him — and the British army — dearly. Architectural innovations can seem too much like hard work, even for those most committed to seeing them succeed.Within academia, Rebecca Henderson’s ideas about architectural innovation are widely cited, and she is one of only two academics at Harvard Business School to hold the rank of university professor. The casual observer of business theories, however, is far more likely to have heard of Clayton Christensen, one of the most famous management gurus on the planet.That may be because Christensen has a single clear theory of how disruption happens — and a solution, too: disrupt yourself before you are disrupted by someone else. That elegance is something we tend to find appealing.The reality of disruption is less elegant — and harder to solve. Kodak’s position may well have been impossible, no matter what managers had done. If so, the most profitable response would have been to vanish gracefully.“There are multiple points of failure,” says Henderson. “There’s the problem of reorganisation. There’s the question of whether the new idea will be profitable. There are cognitive filters. There is more than one kind of denial. To navigate successfully through, an incumbent organisation has to overcome every one of these obstacles.” In an email, she added that the innovators — like Fuller — are often difficult people. “The people who bug large organisations to do new things are socially awkward, slightly fanatical and politically often hopelessly naive.” Another point of failure.The message of Henderson’s work with Kim Clark and others is that when companies or institutions are faced with an organisationally disruptive innovation, there is no simple solution. There may be no solution at all. “I’m sorry it’s not more management guru-ish,” she tells me, laughing. “But anybody who’s really any good at this will tell you that this is hard.”Almost a decade after resigning from a senior position in the British army, Andrew Mackay agrees: “I’d love to think that there could be a solution, but I don’t think there is.”If I had to bet on the most significant disruption occurring today, I would point to the energy industry. Chris Goodall is a longtime observer of the renewable energy scene and author of The Switch, a book about breakthroughs in solar panel technology. Goodall points out that solar photovoltaics have enjoyed a dramatic fall in costs, one that shows no sign of abating.Solar PV electricity is now cheaper than electricity generated by gas or coal in the sunny climes where most of the planet’s population live. A few more years and that advantage will seem overwhelming, which is great news for the planet and terrible news for incumbents.Consider General Electric, which this year disappeared from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In little more than a year, the old industrial titan’s share price had halved. One of the key culprits for its woes was a precipitous collapse in the demand for large gas turbines, that, in turn, was the result of a fall in the cost of solar power cells that had been relentless, predictable and ignored. This possibility has been clear to the fossil fuel industry for a while. I know: I used to work in long-range scenario planning for Shell International. Back in 2001, my Shell colleagues and I were discussing thin solar films that could be printed cheaply and applied to windows or hung as wallpaper. We could see the threat of exponentially cheaper solar power — but recall what Joshua Gans said about Kodak and Blockbuster: “They knew what the future looked like. They didn’t know later than everybody else, they knew ahead of everybody else.”They knew. But they could not act. Because what is an oil company to do in a world of abundant, cheap solar energy? Offshore wind farms play to some oil-company strengths; they know a lot about large metal structures in the North Sea. But solar energy is an architectural innovation. The pieces just don’t fit together like an oil rig or a refinery. As a mass-market, manufactured product it is closer to the skill set of Ikea than Exxon. The implication of Christensen’s theory is that oil companies should have set up solar subsidiaries decades ago. Many of them did, without much success. The implication of Henderson’s theory is that the oil companies are in big trouble. Chris Goodall thinks the oil companies should rescue what they can — for example, by developing synthetic hydrocarbons derived from water, atmospheric carbon dioxide and solar energy. Such products would play to oil-company strengths. But for most of their business lines, Goodall says, “The best strategy for the oil companies is almost certainly gradual self-liquidation.”Or as BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley candidly admitted to the Washington Post recently, “If someone said, ‘Here’s $10bn to invest in renewables,’ we wouldn’t know how to do it.”Despite all the obstacles, the British army continued to develop both tanks and tank tactics throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Yet the internal politics proved toxic. The Germans, meanwhile, watched and learnt. If the British were hamstrung by their inability to reorganise what was, after all, a victorious army in the first world war, the Germans had the opposite problem: they had barely any army, and no status quo to defend. There was no organisational architecture to get in the way. When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 and began to expand the German army and invest in tanks, he encountered a German military that had been watching, thinking and experimenting for 14 years. On his 50th birthday in 1939, Hitler celebrated with a parade of Germany’s newly reconstructed army through Berlin. “For three hours,” wrote one witness, “a completely mechanised and motorised army roared past the Führer.” This witness was a guest of honour at the celebrations. His name: J F C Fuller. After quitting the British army in frustration, he had thrown his lot in with the British fascists of Oswald Mosley. He wrote vitriolic attacks on Jews. Some observers wondered whether this was simply an attempt to win favour with the world’s tank superpower, Nazi Germany. One of Fuller’s biographers, Mark Urban, doubts this: “The facility with which Fuller made anti-Jewish jibes in letters and books suggests pleasure rather than duty.”Nobody doubts, however, that Fuller was obsessed by German tanks. After all, there was one army that had really understood and embraced his ideas: that of Adolf Hitler.After the parade, Major General Fuller met Hitler himself in a receiving line at the Chancellery. The Führer grasped Fuller’s hand and asked, “I hope you were pleased with your children?” “Your excellency,” Fuller replied, “They have grown up so quickly that I no longer recognise them.” Illustrations by Janne IivonenTim Harford is an FT columnist.

20;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-06-18T20:09:59Z;Fujifilm seeks $1bn over failed Xerox deal;Japanese company alleges breach of contract and blames Carl Icahn;Fujifilm is suing Xerox for $1bn in damages for alleged breach of contract after the US printer and photocopier maker abruptly called off a proposed merger.Activist investor Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who together own more than a tenth of Xerox, had lobbied against the $6.1bn deal with Fuji, arguing it undervalued Xerox and destroyed shareholder value.The transaction would have seen Xerox merge its business with an Asian joint venture the company operates with Fuji, handing Fuji majority control. Xerox investors were to receive a $2.5bn cash dividend as part of the deal.Fuji said in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday that the “change of heart” from Xerox “is undoubtedly due to external pressures” from Mr Icahn and Mr Deason.“Fujifilm’s board of directors and management negotiated in good faith to yield a transaction that protects a longtime joint venture, ensures access to its shared patents and ongoing research and development efforts, and will earn Fujifilm shareholders a significant return in synergies and other revenues, both immediately and over time,” Fuji’s lawyers said in the complaint.Xerox said it was “extremely confident” that it was able to terminate the agreement “due to, among other things, the continuously expanding unresolved accounting issues at Fuji Xerox”.“Xerox will vigorously defend its decision and pursue any and all remedies available to Xerox arising from Fuji’s mismanagement and misconduct,” the company said.In addition to the $1bn in damages, Fuji is seeking punitive damages, a $183m termination fee and reimbursement of its costs and expenses, including legal fees.“It is inconsistent with shareholder democracy to allow Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, minority shareholders with only 15 per cent of Xerox’s shares, to dictate the fate of Xerox,” Fuji said in a statement.Xerox called off the deal in May, saying that its Japanese partner had failed to deliver audited financials, limiting its ability to consummate the merger.Xerox also fired its chief executive, Jeff Jacobson. He was replaced by former IBM and Hewlett-Packard executive John Visentin, and Keith Cozza of Icahn Enterprises was appointed chairman of the board.The Xerox board said at the time it had repeatedly requested new negotiations with Fuji that could lead to an improved takeover bid.The company said that the deal “cannot reasonably be expected to be completed under these circumstances, particularly given . . . the lack of shareholder support for the transaction on current terms, as well as the unresolved accounting issues at Fuji Xerox”.The Japanese group revealed last year that it had found improper accounting practices at subsidiaries of its joint venture in New Zealand and Australia.The deal has ended up in court before. In April, a judge temporarily halted the deal after Mr Deason, who sold his company, Affiliated Computer Services, to Xerox in 2009, sued to block it.The scathing ruling found that Xerox’s chief executive was “hopelessly conflicted” and that some of its board members had acted in “bad faith” when negotiating the transaction.
21;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-06-07T12:53:55Z;Fujifilm gives Xerox six months to resurrect $6bn tie-up;Japanese group ready to sue US printer and photocopier maker over decision to pull deal;Fujifilm Holdings will consider giving up the fight to resurrect its $6.1bn bid for control of Xerox if there is no progress in talks within the next six months, its chief executive has said. The Japanese group has been making preparations to sue the US printer and photocopier maker after it abruptly called off the deal in mid-May in a settlement with two of its biggest investors, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.Fujifilm maintained that Xerox did not have the right to unilaterally terminate the agreement they struck in January. “Our basic stance is to urge Xerox to implement the deal both companies agreed with,” Shigetaka Komori, the 78-year-old chairman and CEO of Fuji, said on Thursday.“But if nothing happens in six months, that’s just too bad,” Mr Komori said in his first public statements since Xerox called off the deal.The transaction would have seen Xerox merge its business with a joint venture the company operates with Fuji in Asia, handing Fuji majority control. Xerox investors were to receive a $2.5bn cash dividend as part of the deal. But Mr Icahn, an activist investor, and Mr Deason, a businessman, criticised the sale as undervaluing Xerox, attacking the complex structure that would allow Fuji to execute the deal without using its own cash. Following a messy dispute, Xerox fired its then chief executive, Jeff Jacobson, as part of its settlement with the activists. He was replaced by former IBM and Hewlett-Packard executive John Visentin, while Keith Cozza of Icahn Enterprises became chairman. In addition, Xerox appointed a new slate of directors that will give Mr Icahn greater power to control the company’s direction.On Thursday, Mr Komori said he had not been approached by the new Xerox board, but left open the possibility of renegotiating the deal if the terms were not disadvantageous for Fuji’s shareholders. Mr Komori indicated that he may be open to studying a new proposal that included an increase in the cash dividend, although he ruled out significantly altering the current scheme. The divide between Fuji and the activists remains wide. Mr Icahn and Mr Deason have said they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share, which would be a 43 per cent premium to Fuji's offer.“$40 is too high,” Mr Komori said, noting that the company needed to reserve cash to invest in other growth businesses such as healthcare. “If the maths don’t work out, we can’t do it.”The Fuji-Xerox joint venture, which dates back to 1962, has grown to generate almost half of Fuji’s revenues. But the Japanese group also develops and manufactures most of Xerox’s copiers, making it difficult for the US company to call off the partnership even if the deal falls apart.
22;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-06-04T12:14:58Z;Board directors enjoy a more permissive climate;Company boards are pushing the envelope when it comes to conflicted transactions terms;Reams of banker PowerPoint presentations were disclosed in the recent legal fight over Xerox’s ill-fated merger with Japan’s Fujifilm. But one seemingly perfunctory page stands out.The last page of a September 2017 book presented to the Xerox board of directors by Centerview Partners displays a bar chart showing that among the hundreds of large public company transactions since 2015, not a single deal had been voted down by shareholders. The slide’s message was clear: shareholders, almost universally, will go along with whatever a company decides.That conclusion comes at an intriguing moment. A string of corporate law decisions in Delaware courts in recent years has constrained the ways aggrieved shareholders stop M&A that they feel is tainted. The chatter now at law conference panels is that boards have become aware of this more permissive climate where their decision making has less likelihood of being challenged by a judge. As such, boards are pushing the envelope when it comes to conflicted transactions terms and this is causing concern among some observers.The most consequential of these rulings is a 2015 decision called Corwin, which in effect held that if shareholders freely approved a deal after the key negotiation details were disclosed in filings, the courts will not award damages for breaches of fiduciary duty. If shareholders are happy with a deal, why should a judge step in and interfere? *That Xerox slide gives away the game: just win the vote, which happens almost automatically, and all the potential legal headaches of a deal evaporate.“One of the things that would control boards was their counsel coming in and saying ‘if you do this you’re going to get enjoined by the Chancery Court or you’re going to open yourself up to damages’. That threat is basically gone. The lawyers may try to push them back on to the reservation, but in the end the directors and management are smart people and they see what’s happened in Delaware and they say, ‘hey we’re willing to take the risk because the risk is dramatically reduced’,” said Stuart Grant, a prominent shareholder plaintiffs attorney.There are several caveats to the Corwin doctrine. It does not necessarily apply to related party deals. Shareholders can also argue that the disclosures did not include all the key circumstances. Defence lawyers also point out that the court has got tough in the past year on questions about the independence of directors (if, with another director, you own a private jet or bought an NBA team, the court has said there is conflict of interest) as well as on what constitutes controlling a company ( Elon Musk controls Tesla despite only owning a fifth of the company).Still, the tilt away from judicial intervention over bad corporate behaviour seems real. Two well-regarded law professors published a paper earlier this year noting that four revolutionary Delaware decisions from the 1980s — Revlon, Weinberger, Unocal and Blasius — that had together put companies and boards under the microscope have recently been “hollowed out” and “eviscerated” by the Delaware Supreme Court. The consequence, the pair write, is “a weakening judicial and shareholder oversight of directors and officers fiduciary duties”.One prominent New York corporate lawyer admitted that while worries of egregious conduct were now overblown, “there is a kernel of truth” to the idea that boards know they can be somewhat be more aggressive in pursuing self-interested deals. Still, he maintained that pendulum had swung too far in the favour of shareholders before Trulia and Corwin, pointing to the 2016 Rural Metro decision where the Delaware courts awarded $76m to shareholders over board and investment banker corruption.Defenders of a more board-friendly regime in Delaware that has embraced both the supremacy of shareholder voting as well as the efficient market hypothesis point out that investors have dramatically evolved since the 1980s. Ownership is concentrated among sophisticated, well-funded mutual funds, index funds and activists who can organise real dissent.In this sense, Xerox is also a rich example. It had two loud, large stockholders, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, organising a shareholder revolt. Except when the time came to challenge the deal, Mr Icahn and Mr Deason chose not to wait around to win a shareholder vote but rather fight in court. They successfully petitioned a judge in April to halt the Fuji transaction. The rub was that they were clever enough to litigate in a New York court and not Delaware, where the betting was they would have been unsuccessful.* This article was amended to reflect that the Corwin decision was made in 2015sujeet.indap@ft.com
23;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-05-14T17:04:03Z;How Carl Icahn beat Fujifilm in the battle for Xerox;Japanese group left scrambling to salvage deal after activist investor wins challenge;When Shigetaka Komori revealed Fujifilm Holdings’s $6.1bn bid for control of Xerox, the 78-year-old chief executive was ready to delay retirement by several years to ensure the takeover’s success.But the transaction is on the verge of collapse after an extraordinary battle pitting the US company against activist investor Carl Icahn and businessman Darwin Deason.The deal announced in January would have united a company founded in the 1930s as Japan’s answer to Kodak in photographic film with the 112-year-old US copier maker whose products were once so ubiquitous its name became a verb.It would also have cemented one of the oldest US-Japan corporate partnerships — the Fuji Xerox joint venture, which has grown to generate almost half of Fuji’s revenues, dates back to 1962.Since Xerox abruptly scrapped the deal late on Sunday, just four days after promising investors it would seek improved terms, Fuji executives have been scrambling to save it, according to people close to the company. “Mr Komori hates losing,” one of the people said. “He will not give up easily.”People involved in the talks said both Xerox and Fuji had anticipated some shareholder pushback due to the complex and unusual structure that would have allowed the Japanese group to execute the deal without using its own cash. But neither company was prepared for the turmoil that followed.“There were so many twists and turns that were completely unforeseen,” said another person close to Fuji. “There is not a single person who can give a simple rationale for what happened in the last four months.”Had the deal had gone through, Xerox would have merged its business with the companies’ joint venture, giving the Japanese company a 50.1 per cent stake in the combined group. Investors in Xerox would have received a $2.5bn cash dividend as part of the deal and the merger promises $1.7bn in annual cost savings over the next several years.“We don’t want to sing praises for ourselves but I have to say this is such a creative and great scheme,” Mr Komori said when he announced the deal. “I think [activist] shareholders will naturally come on board.”In the current situation, the best-case scenario would be that rationality among all parties prevailsThe two companies had been discussing a merger since March last year but a full takeover was never considered by Fuji, which hoped to invest its cash in other growth areas, according to court documents and company officials. After talks stalled following an accounting scandal at Fuji Xerox, Xerox proposed the new scheme to Fuji in the autumn. A messy stand-off was already brewing. A week before Fuji’s January announcement, Mr Icahn and Mr Deason, then the largest and third-largest shareholders with more than 10 per cent of outstanding Xerox shares, had joined forces to lobby Xerox to put itself up for sale. Mr Deason has been a shareholder for more than a decade but spoke publicly about the company for the first time in January. In a letter to the board, he demanded that Xerox disclose the details of its joint venture and hire independent advisers to explore its strategic options. The duo then called for the exit of Xerox chief executive Jeff Jacobson, whom they described as “neither qualified nor capable of running this company” — an accusation Xerox rejected, saying at the time that it was “confident with the strategic direction in which the company is heading”.And as soon as the deal with Fuji was unveiled, they immediately slammed it as undervaluing Xerox.Mr Jacobson declined to comment.The debate then shifted from the deal’s valuation to its genesis, focusing on whether Mr Jacobson had conspired with Fuji to push through a deal to save his job. In mid-February Mr Deason sued Xerox in New York State court, alleging the deal was a “fraudulent scheme” to give away the American company “for virtually nothing”. “If the deal is consummated, Xerox shareholders will be virtually powerless over the future direction of their investment and will have no opportunity to receive a true control premium for the shares,” lawyers for Mr Deason argued in the lawsuit. Late last month, after contested proceedings, the court sided with Mr Deason and temporarily blocked the sale, ruling that Mr Jacobson was “hopelessly conflicted” in negotiating the deal. It found that Mr Jacobson was advised in November by Xerox’s chairman that he was likely to be replaced, and he should stop all discussions with Fuji about a transaction. Days later the chairman allowed him to resume talks and the judge alleged Mr Jacobson then rushed to complete a deal. People close to the Xerox chief acknowledged he had made mistakes during his tenure but insisted that accusations he acted in bad faith were outright false. In its appeal against the ruling, Xerox’s lawyers argued that the “unprecedented order further threatens to impose imminent harm on Xerox shareholders by disenfranchising them from their opportunity to vote on a transaction that the board concluded was both value-maximising and the only available option.”Xerox said Mr Jacobson was fully authorised to engage in discussions with Fuji and Fuji Xerox, while Fuji said no promise had been made to Mr Jacobson that he would remain as chief of the new company. The Xerox board ultimately reached a unanimous decision to approve the Fuji deal, and both companies had argued that Xerox shareholders should be able to decide the deal’s merits for themselves. Four days after the court ruling, Mr Jacobson agreed to step down in a settlement with Mr Icahn and Mr Deason as Xerox sought to avoid a protracted legal fight. But Xerox reversed the decision two days later, saying its management team would stay since its agreement with the shareholders had expired after Mr Deason failed to drop his lawsuit. In a letter to shareholders, Xerox said it had changed its mind after it became convinced its long-term investors were opposed to a settlement with Mr Icahn and Mr Deason. On news of the settlement, its share price dropped 12 per cent. People involved in the talks said the two companies had been discussing an increase in the cash dividend of about $5 per share.More broadly, Xerox executives were convinced the shareholder revolt was limited to Mr Icahn and Mr Deason, as other investors had communicated their support for the deal.“Frankly, we’d rather see this deal go through than Icahn wrecking the business and trying to make a quick buck,” said a long-term investor who asked not to be named. Mr Icahn and Mr Deason could not immediately be reached for comment.On Sunday came another abrupt Xerox U-turn, with the company firing Mr Jacobson as part of its decision to terminate the deal and blaming Fuji for not providing an assurance over launching a new round of negotiation.Despite a new slate of Xerox directors that will give Mr Icahn greater power to control the company’s direction, people close to Fuji said the company remained open to talks with the new board. Still, even as Mr Komori races to salvage the deal, investors will be asking whether it is worth fighting for. “In the current situation, the best-case scenario would be that rationality among all parties prevails,” CLSA analyst Claudio Aritomi said. “Both Fuji and Xerox need each other. This is not a point where they should be trying to sweeten the deal.”Activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, the largest and third-largest shareholders in Xerox, join forces to lobby the US printer and photocopier maker to put itself up for sale and replace its ‘old guard’ directorsXerox agrees a deal that will see Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings take control of its printer and photocopier business, ultimately giving Fujifilm a 50.1 per cent stake in the merged entityIcahn and Deason urge Xerox shareholders to vote against the Fujifilm deal, calling it the company’s ‘death knell’Deason files a complaint in the Supreme Court of New York, saying the deal was ‘the product of deceit’Xerox and Fujifilm reopen negotiations on their merger that could lead to a higher payout for shareholders in the US groupThe deal is blocked by New York state judge, in a ruling that found Xerox chief executive Jeff Jacobson was ‘hopelessly conflicted’ and that some board members had acted in ‘bad faith’Jacobson and most of the Xerox board agrees to step downXerox makes U-turn of Jacobson and board exit, saying they will now remain because a settlement agreement with dissenting shareholders had expiredXerox terminates Fujifilm deal and fires Jacobson
24;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-05-14T17:01:44Z;Xerox: Re-fuji status;The tactical blunders continue to pile up;For Xerox, there are no permanent allies, just permanent confusion. The copier company on Sunday announced a second settlement with dissident shareholders. They had challenged both its $6bn January merger with its Asian affiliate, Fuji Xerox, and the continuing tenure of existing management. A previous attempt to reach a settlement collapsed earlier this month. That plan sought to ensure the dissidents, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, took control of the Xerox board but final terms could not be agreed.The Xerox board had been steadfast in supporting the Fuji merger until Sunday when it both terminated the deal and handed over control of the board. Fujifilm, the 75 per cent owner of the Asian business, naturally did not appreciate the merger termination. It said it would challenge it in court. Xerox previously had maintained, over the objections of Mr Deason and Mr Icahn, that all shareholders should vote on the deal to determine its virtue. Ironically, such a vote would have been the cleanest way for the two activists to achieve their goals.Xerox on Sunday said it could not complete the current Fuji deal because the accounting scandal at the joint venture prevented the delivery of audited financial statements for the joint venture. Whether that can be a legal pretext for termination remains to be seen. Fuji will argue that Xerox simply has acquired buyer’s remorse. The broad grievance of Mr Icahn, Mr Deason and other shareholders is that the overall terms of the Fuji Xerox joint venture are tilted towards Fuji, preventing Xerox from running an auction process. Essentially, Fuji held a right of first refusal against outside bids for Xerox. However, those terms were struck years ago. Mr Icahn and Mr Deason have a Trump-like tendency to believe they can unilaterally tear-up signed deals. A better tack would have been to allow the Xerox shareholder vote to proceed. A likely victory there would have avoided the current chaos and created new negotiating leverage.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

25;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-05-14T01:13:43Z;Fujifilm shares rise after Xerox deal called off;;Shares in Fujifilm rose in Tokyo on Monday after Xerox called off its controversial $6.1bn sale to the Japanese company late on Sunday. Fujifilm had failed to deliver audited financials, limiting its ability to close the deal, the US printer and photocopier maker said on Sunday. The transaction, as originally struck, was to see Xerox merge its business with a joint venture that the company operates with Fuji in Asia, handing Fuji majority control. Xerox investors were to receive a $2.5bn cash dividend as part of the deal. However, shares in Fujifilm had fallen 7 per cent since the deal was announced as investors feared the company would be forced to sweeten its terms to satisfy a group of activist Xerox shareholders.The stock was up as much as 1.6 per cent in Tokyo on Monday before pulling back slightly to be 1.1 per cent higher on the day.
26;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-05-04T08:45:39Z;Xerox chief executive reverses decision to step down;U-turn sparks fury from activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason;Xerox has said that its chief executive Jeff Jacobson, who earlier this week bowed to pressure from activist investors and agreed to step down, will now remain in his role.Mr Jacobson and other members of Xerox’s board had agreed to leave their positions at the US printer and copier maker following a battle with Darwin Deason and Carl Icahn, two billionaire investors who had fought to block its $6.1bn sale to Japan’s Fujifilm.But late on Thursday, Xerox announced that its current board and management team, including Mr Jacobson, would in fact stay on because a settlement agreement it had reached with the dissenting shareholders had expired. It said this was because Darwin Deason had not dropped litigation against Xerox.Xerox and its board directors were unavailable for further comment. Xerox has been under fire from activist investors since it agreed in January to combine with Fujifilm.The transaction struck in January would see Xerox merge its business with a joint venture that the company operates with Fuji in Asia. Fuji was set to own a 50.1 per cent stake in the combined group.But shareholders, including Mr Icahn, had argued that the deal undervalued Xerox. The transaction was then temporarily blocked last Friday by New York Supreme Court judge Barry Ostrager, who said Mr Jacobson was “hopelessly conflicted” and that some of its board members had acted in “bad faith” when negotiating the transaction.Mr Jacobson had been “about to be replaced” by the Xerox board, who had hired headhunters to find a new chief executive, in the months leading up to the deal being signed with Fuji, the judgment said.The Xerox boss was therefore “hopelessly conflicted during his negotiation of a strategic acquisition transaction that would result in a combined entity of which he would be CEO”, the judgment added.On Tuesday, Xerox struck its deal that said Mr Jacobson would step down and that both Mr Icahn and Mr Deason would end their proxy fight against the company.After Xerox said that deal had now expired, Mr Icahn and Mr Deason hit back in an open letter to Xerox shareholders, saying “the brazen self-interest of the Xerox board defies description”.They added: “This inexplicable turn of events occurred for one reason only: the Xerox board recklessly refused to follow through with the leadership and governance changes we agreed to, demanding unprecedented additional approvals for their own personal self-interest.”The two billionaires also pledged that Mr Jacobson as well as chairman Robert Keegan and other board members including Ann Reese and former Citigroup boss Charles Prince would be held to account for their actions. Xerox was not available for comment on the activist response.Fujifilm said: “We are satisfied at this point that the Court has accepted our view of the importance of an open, orderly and transparent review process before any final decisions are made. As a result, Xerox has announced the expiration of its previously announced settlement agreement. The fact that Xerox stock has fallen more than 12 per cent after the announcement of settlement agreement shows how this was perceived by the market.“We will continue to strongly request Xerox’s board of directors to fulfil the agreement which has been approved unanimously by Xerox’s Board on January 30.“We strongly believe that all Xerox shareholders should be able to decide for themselves the operational, financial, and strategic merits of the transaction.”
27;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-05-04T06:28:51Z;Xerox boss Jeff Jacobson to stay at the helm;;Two days after Xerox chief executive Jeff Jacobson bowed to pressure from activist shareholders to step down, the printer and copier has said he will stay on after all. Xerox on Tuesday said Mr Jacobson would leave the board following a battle with Darwin Deason and Carl Icahn, two billionaire investors who had fought to block  its $6.1bn sale to Japan’s Fujifilm. But late on Thursday night, Xerox announced that its current board and management team, including Mr Jacobson, would stay because a settlement agreement it had reached with the dissenting shareholders had now expired. This came after the New York Supreme Court held a hearing over Fujifilm’s objection to the agreement. Mr Icahn and Mr Deason released an open letter to Xerox shareholders on Thursday night claiming “the brazen self-interest of the Xerox Board defies description.” They added: “this inexplicable turn of events occurred for one reason only: the Xerox Board recklessly refused to follow through with the leadership and governance changes we agreed to, demanding unprecedented additional approvals for their own personal self-interest.”
28;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-05-02T18:20:39Z;Xerox/Icahn: lowering the toner;Activists can seize control when incumbents act egregiously;“The enemy of my enemy is my friend” works fine in war. It is dangerous in corporate governance. Late on Tuesday, the chief executive of Xerox resigned, along with most of the board. It was a logical move after a stunning court defeat last week. A judge halted Xerox’s combination with Fuji Xerox, a large Asian joint venture that Xerox co-owns with Fujifilm.The court found strong indications that Jeff Jacobson, the CEO, and the board had personal motivations for approving a complex deal. This entailed Fuji taking control of the printing company and the joint venture. The proposal did not pay a single dollar to Xerox shareholders. A central piece of collusion evidence was a message between Mr Jacobson and a Fuji executive who referred to Xerox’s largest shareholder, Carl Icahn, as their “mutual enemy”.The newly installed board now includes representatives of Mr Icahn and another dissident, Darwin Deason. It is an incredible turn of events for the two shareholders, who together own less than a fifth of Xerox. They believed Fuji and Xerox conspired to put together a cheap merger so Mr Jacobson could keep his job.Fuji, importantly, did not settle on Tuesday. It still faces charges that it abetted the alleged breaches by the Xerox board. At the very least, the circumstances of the Xerox-Fuji deal are bizarre. The board effectively fired Mr Jacobson in 2017. But he was able to convince them to approve the complex merger even as the joint venture was recovering from an accounting scandal. Xerox argued that the terms were reasonable on the basis that its shares would rally 50 per cent because of massive synergies.The deal originated in a decades-long alliance in Asia between the two companies. Xerox could not easily sell itself to another company without losing much of its value in the joint venture. With Fuji still in legal jeopardy, suddenly Xerox has leverage to improve the JV terms.It is irksome for minorities that the activists’ representatives have been catapulted onto the board. Mr Icahn may privately share their pain. He recently said his strategic plan for the company could double Xerox’s standalone stock price. His best hope might be a sale — Reuters reported on Wednesday that Apollo Global Management had expressed interest, though reaction to that news was muted. Either Mr Icahn delivers the promised gains or he will become the enemy of Xerox stockholders himself.Sign up to Lex’s midweek newsletter from writers in London, New York, San Francisco and Hong Kong at ft.com/newsletters
29;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-05-02T05:17:07Z;Xerox chief steps down after investor battle;Part of settlement with activist investors who oppose group’s merger with Fujifilm;"Jeff Jacobson has agreed to step down as chief executive of Xerox after the US printer and copier maker reached a deal with two of its largest shareholders who fought to block its $6.1bn sale to Japan's Fujifilm.Xerox said it had reached an understanding with billionaire investor Darwin Deason to resolve the bitter legal fight he had waged against the company’s board and the deal it had agreed with Fujifilm. On Friday, New York State Supreme Court judge Barry Ostrager halted the transaction on the view the board and Mr Jacobson were “hopelessly conflicted”. He also agreed to let Mr Deason run a proxy contest to replace the board. Xerox also struck a deal on Tuesday night with activist investor Carl Icahn, and said both Mr Icahn and Mr Deason would end their proxy fight against the US company.Claims that Fuji aided and abetted alleged breaches of duty by Xerox were not resolved in the settlement and will probably be used as leverage against the Japanese company in revising the transaction terms or the joint venture agreement, which Mr Icahn and Mr Deason said was far too restrictive towards Xerox.Fuji had been accused of helping Mr Jacobson complete the transaction because it left Fuji in control and would have thwarted Mr Icahn.In a statement on Wednesday, Fuji said it had “serious concerns” about the settlement and plans to file its objections to court. The Japanese group also decided to appeal against a ruling on Friday that blocked the transaction with Xerox.“We also believe that the Xerox new board of directors has an obligation to comply with the agreements which were unanimously approved on January 30, 2018 and signed by both companies on January 31, 2018,” the company said.Judge Ostrager is expected to sign the agreement on Wednesday. The deal will be voided if the court does not approve it by Thursday. Xerox said it would name John Visentin, a former executive at IBM and Hewlett-Packard, as its new chief executive and appoint six new directors to its board, including Keith Cozza, Nicholas Graziano, Scott Letier, Jay Firestone, Randolph Read and Mr Visentin. Mr Cozza, the chief executive of Icahn Enterprises, will become chairman of the board.Current board members Robert Keegan, Charles Prince, Ann Reese, William Curt Hunter, Sara Martinez Tucker and Stephen Rusckowski will resign as part of the agreement. Mr Jacobson will also lose his seat on the board.""This agreement will help ensure that Xerox and its employees will be able to continue to focus on serving customers and building on the company’s financial and operational performance,"" the current board said in a statement.The lawsuit lodged by Mr Deason had captivated bankers and lawyers in New York, after text messages, emails and board presentations were aired in court. According to the suit, Xerox chairman Keegan last November told Mr Jacobson he risked losing his job and should immediately cut off negotiations with Fuji, a decision that matched the unanimous direction of the board. Days later, Mr Keegan agreed to let Mr Jacobson continue talks with Fuji without seeking authorisation from the full Xerox board.Mr Jacobson then rushed to complete a deal with Fuji to save his job and lead the combined group as chief executive, according to Judge Ostrager.That deal struck in January would have seen Xerox merge its business with a joint venture that the company operates with Fuji in Asia. Fuji was set to own a 50.1 per cent stake in the combined group, with Xerox investors paid a $2.5bn cash dividend and owning the balance of the company.Mr Icahn and Mr Deason both opposed the deal, which they argued undervalued Xerox and gave up control without getting paid a premium.Mr Icahn called the agreement announced on Tuesday a “watershed moment” for corporate governance. “With new leadership in place, we believe Xerox will be much better positioned to take advantage of multiple potential value-enhancing opportunities, including restructuring its relationship with Fujifilm, our supposed ‘partner’ whose conduct over the past year is more unbelievable than what you see on fictional TV shows like House of Cards or Billions,” Mr Icahn said.Mr Deason, who was represented by the law firm King & Spalding, added that the future was “extremely bright for Xerox”. He said: “I am confident the alternatives for Xerox and its shareholders will be fully and expeditiously maximised. John is the right leader at the right time for Xerox.”"

31;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-04-28T06:46:53Z;Xerox-Fujifilm $6.1bn deal blocked temporarily by court;US group’s CEO and board criticised in ruling that marks win for activist investors;Xerox’s $6.1bn deal to sell itself to Japan’s Fujifilm was temporarily blocked by a judge late on Friday, in a scathing ruling that found the US company’s chief executive was “hopelessly conflicted” and that some of its board members had acted in “bad faith” when negotiating the transaction.The temporary ruling from Judge Barry Ostrager of New York State Supreme Court marks a win for two of Xerox’s largest shareholders — billionaire investors Darwin Deason and Carl Icahn — who fought the deal with Fuji. In a 26-page ruling, Judge Ostrager wrote that it was “simply counter intuitive and not credible” that Jeff Jacobson, Xerox chief executive, was not conflicted when pushing for the deal.The transaction agreed in January would see Xerox merge its business with a joint venture that the company operates with Fuji in Asia. Fuji was set to own a 50.1 per cent stake in the combined group. Investors in Xerox were set to receive a $2.5bn cash dividend as part of the transaction, worth roughly $9.80 per share. But shareholders, including Mr Icahn, had argued that the deal undervalued Xerox. Months earlier, Mr Icahn — one of the company’s largest shareholders — had told Mr Jacobson over dinner that he was not right for the job, according to the ruling.Mr Jacobson’s actions following that dinner and up to the deal’s announcement in January, laid out in email and text messages in the New York court, were the “linchpin” of the court’s decision, Judge Ostrager said.The ruling found that last November, Mr Jacobson was advised by Xerox’s chairman that he was likely to be replaced and to stop all discussions with Fuji about a transaction.Days later the chairman yielded to Mr Jacobson and allowed him to resume talks. Mr Jacobson then rushed to complete a deal with Fuji in a bid to save his job and lead the combined group as chief executive, according to the judge.The court ruling found that Mr Jacobson “was hopelessly conflicted during his negotiation of a strategic acquisition transaction that would result in a combined entity of which he would be CEO”.Fuji said it was considering all options, including a possible appeal.“We believe the record shows that Fujifilm negotiated with Xerox at arm’s length to create a transaction combining Xerox and Fuji Xerox that is the only option to provide shareholders of both companies with exceptional short- and long-term value,” the company said. Xerox said it would immediately appeal the court’s decision, saying that it undertook a “rigorous process to reach its decision to approve the proposed transaction.”“Xerox’s Board believes that a combination with Fuji Xerox is the best path forward to create value for the Company and all of its shareholders,” the company said.Fujifilm’s $6.1bn deal, combined with Takeda’s $65bn offer for Irish drugmaker Shire, have driven Japan’s outbound deal activity to a record high of $108bn in the first four months of 2018, according to Thomson Reuters, as Japanese companies seek growth outside their declining home market.Still, some Fujifilm investors had questioned the merit of the Japanese company taking a bigger stake in Xerox’s business, which has suffered a 15 per cent decline in annual revenue to $10bn over the past three years.Such a deal also would break with the Japanese company’s strategy of branching into new areas such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to cushion the decline of its photo film sales.
32;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
33;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-04-27T16:58:58Z;Xerox and Fujifilm reopen $6.1bn merger negotiations;Talks come after pressure from activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason;Xerox and Fujifilm have reopened negotiations on their $6.1bn merger that could lead to a higher payout for shareholders in the US group, just weeks after an activist investor dragged the Connecticut-based company into court over the terms of the deal.The discussions centre on “a potential increase in consideration” for Xerox shareholders, the company said, but it cautioned that there was no guarantee that any changes would be made to the agreed deal terms. Xerox announced in January that it would merge its business with a joint venture that it operates with Fuji in Asia, giving the Japanese company a 50.1 per cent stake in the combined group. Investors in Xerox were set to receive a $2.5bn cash dividend as part of the transaction, worth roughly $9.80 per share.But Darwin Deason and Carl Icahn, the activist shareholders who hold more than a tenth of outstanding Xerox shares, rebuked the company, saying the proposed tie-up undervalued the company.Mr Deason alleged that the deal was “the product of deceit” in a complaint filed in the Supreme Court of New York in February. His lawsuit against the company is continuing.Mr Icahn has urged shareholders to vote against the deal.The two ramped up the rhetoric earlier this month, characterising the deal as “value-destroying” and an “insult to long-suffering Xerox shareholders”.Mr Icahn on Thursday urged Xerox shareholders to read a report on the company published by Barclays.“It’s an independent analysis that proves (1) [Xerox] shareholders ‘deserve better’ (2) ‘the current deal undervalues the company (and provides no premium to shareholders)’ and (3) ‘Icahn’s alternatives . . . would be a better idea in comparison,’” he wrote on Twitter.The company has fired back, saying the pair have been running a “highly disingenuous campaign that distorts and omits key facts about Xerox”.Mr Deason did not comment on the news that the two companies had reopened negotiations. Mr Icahn did not respond to a request for comment.Xerox said: “Consistent with its commitment to shareholder engagement, Xerox has been meeting with its shareholders since the announcement of the transaction.”Fuji added that the deal was negotiated in an “appropriate manner, based on fair valuations from independent experts”. The company said a tie-up was the “best and only plan in creating the future of Xerox. We are also confident that Xerox shareholders judge this the same.”Fuji had envisaged cost savings of as much as $1.7bn as part of a merger with Xerox, which holds a market valuation of $8bn.Analysts with UBS said earlier this year that the deal between the companies “appears to favour Fujifilm shareholders over Xerox shareholders”. But they added that if the cost cuts were achieved, Xerox shareholders stood to earn a premium.Shares of Xerox climbed just over 2 per cent to $31.07 by midday in New York. 
34;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-04-17T21:22:35Z;Icahn, Deason escalate battle with Xerox;;Activist investor Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason deepened their caustic battle with Xerox over the proposed Fujifilm merger on Tuesday, alleging poor governance and laying out their own plan for the company in a presentation.In the presentation, Mr Icahn and Mr Deason, the first and third largest shareholders of Xerox, described the Fujifilm deal as “tortured and convoluted”. The US printer and photocopier company in January had struck a deal that would see it combined with a joint venture operated by the two companies called Fuji Xerox. Fujifilm would have a 50.1 per cent stake.In a letter than accompanied the presentation, Mr Icahn and Mr Dawson said: “Both the substance of the proposed value-destroying transaction and the conflict-tainted process by which it was hatched are an insult to long-suffering Xerox shareholders and make a mockery of well-established corporate governance norms.”The duo said that Xerox never “thoroughly explored transactions with other buyers” and noted it only provides shareholders with a value of $28 per share. They argued their plan could create a total value of between $54 to $64 a share while also retaining operational control.Their four-part plan calls for unlocking growth through new services and partnerships with PC makers. They also plan to cut costs through consolidation in its global imaging systems subsidiary. Third, they propose monetising intellectual property in areas like digital printing, usable analytics spaces and others. Finally, their plan calls for an evaluation of the Asia-Pacific market and removal of the management team.Xerox responded to Tuesday’s letter and presentation in a statement:Mr Icahn and Mr Deason have joined forces in a highly disingenuous campaign that distorts and omits key facts about Xerox, its Board and management team, and the proposed combination with Fuji Xerox. Their ongoing attacks risk damaging the company and its ability to create value for shareholders.Their presentation and accompanying letter rehash prior misleading statements and fail to provide a credible or actionable alternative to create value for Xerox shareholders. Informed readers will clearly see numerous misrepresentations and computational errors, including those regarding the company’s debt balance, valuation multiple, margin structure, solid accounting policies, and current management’s track record of strong execution. Mr Icahn should know better, as he had a representative on Xerox’s Board for more than a year.The presentation comes days after the WSJ, citing an amended lawsuit by Mr Deason filed in New York state court, reported that Xerox’s board had advised chief executive Jeff Jacobson to halt negotiations because it was considering firing him. However, the company has said Mr Jacobson “was fully authorised to engage in discussions with Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox on the proposed combination”.Xerox shares were buoyed by the news and finished the day 3 per cent higher at $29.98.
35;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-02-14T01:49:46Z;Xerox/Fujifilm: lowering the toner;The deal valuation looks rosy but alternatives have not emerged;"Xerox’s chief executive said on Tuesday that the company had to “compete flawlessly against our shareholders”. He corrected himself; he meant other office equipment companies. It is an easy mistake to make, though, when your biggest shareholder wants you fired and your fourth biggest has just sued you.Xerox is proposing a complicated deal in which it would be acquired by Fujifilm, its joint venture partner in Asia, in a deal worth $6.1bn. Carl Icahn, the leading Xerox shareholder with a 9.2 per cent stake, and Darwin Deason, with 3.4 per cent, oppose the deal. Mr Deason sued on Tuesday to block it, alleging it “dramatically undervalues” Xerox.In a new presentation, Xerox — which said the lawsuit was “without merit” — values the deal at $45 a share: a cash component worth $9.80, a continued stake in the joint venture worth $13, continued ownership of Xerox worth $10 and $12 of synergies from shuttering factories and slashing research spending.It is not just Mr Icahn and Mr Deason, however, that are unconvinced: shares in Xerox have fallen since the deal was announced and trade at a 35 per cent discount to Xerox’s valuation of the deal.The joint venture was stricken by an accounting scandal in 2016. Xerox has a record of missing targets. It is no wonder that credibility with shareholders is low. Why should they attach much faith to any numbers beyond the $2.5bn cash component of the proposed deal?Nonetheless, it may remain the best — perhaps only — option. Mr Icahn’s agitation has not flushed out any other bidders. Mr Deason calls for the joint venture to be scrapped but Xerox’s counterargument — that it would take several years and hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild a business independently in Asia, the only region of the world where there is any organic growth to be had — rings true.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

36;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-02-13T18:54:48Z;Activist investor seeks to halt ‘fraudulent’ Xerox deal with Fuji;Deason alleges US group hid a 17-year-old agreement tying the two companies together;Xerox’s proposed merger with Fujifilm is set to be dragged into the courts after Darwin Deason, an activist investor and large shareholder in the photocopier maker, alleged that the deal was ”the product of deceit”.In a complaint filed to the Supreme Court of New York, the billionaire investor, the US company’s third-largest shareholder, said he had acted against the “fraudulent scheme” because Xerox and its directors had failed to run a fair sales process before it agreed to the $6.1bn deal with Japan’s Fuji.Mr Deason said that Fuji and Xerox had concealed from Xerox shareholders a “lock-up” agreement sealed 17 years ago that would give the Japanese printing company control of its US partner’s intellectual property rights in Asia in the event of a sale of the US group. The lawsuit calls those rights a “crown jewel”.The activist also claimed that an accounting scandal at the Fuji Xerox joint venture last year would have given the US company the right to terminate the lock-up agreement but it failed to do so.“The proposed transaction is the product of deceit and bad faith conduct,” Mr Deason wrote in his complaint. “The director defendants should be compelled to go back to the drawing board, free Xerox from Fuji’s deal-restrictive ‘crown jewel’ lock-up, which the company still has the legal right to do, and pursue a fair, transparent, and equitable bidding process that is truly beneficial to Xerox’s shareholders.”Xerox said that the allegations were “without merit” and that the company would vigorously defend itself.The US group agreed in late January to merge its business into the Fuji Xerox joint venture, giving Fujifilm a 50.1 per cent stake in the whole entity. Under the terms of the deal, the joint venture would pay a $2.5bn special cash dividend, or about $9.80 a share, to Xerox shareholders.After the deal was announced, Shigetaka Komori, Fuji’s chief executive, said it would allow the Japanese company to “take control of Xerox without spending a penny”.The statement particularly irritated Mr Deason and fellow activist Carl Icahn, who have both rejected the tie-up, arguing it dramatically undervalues the US company and favours its Japanese partner. The investors argue that Xerox could be sold at a higher premium in a competitive process.Xerox has rejected the investors’ criticisms. “After having considered all strategic alternatives available to the company, Xerox’s board of directors remains steadfast in its belief that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the best path to create value for the company and its shareholders,” the company said. “It is unfortunate that Mr Deason is seeking to interfere with Xerox shareholders’ right to decide and is relying on meritless legal claims.”Steven Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, said the joint venture was rife with inefficiency and would require radical change but it would be a mistake to break up the relationship.“Two-thirds of Xerox’s products, mostly office copiers, are developed by Fuji Xerox and it would take years for Xerox to develop its own,” Mr Milunovich said.

Under the terms of the deal, the joint venture will pay a $2.5bn special cash dividend, or about $9.80 a share, to Xerox shareholders. Shares in Xerox will remain listed.On Monday, Mr Deason and fellow activist investor Carl Icahn urged Xerox investors to boycott the deal with Fujifilm, arguing that it dramatically undervalued the US company and favours its Japanese partner.The activist investors were particularly annoyed by a comment made Shigetaka Komori, Fuji’s chief executive, after the deal was agreed in which he said that the deal would “allow us to take control of Xerox without spending a penny.”Messrs Deason and Icahn claim that Xerox could be sold at a higher premium through a more competitive process.The lawsuit filed on Tuesday also names as a defendant Ursula Burns, the former chief executive of Xerox.
38;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-02-12T15:15:50Z;Icahn urges Xerox shareholders to vote against Fujifilm deal;Activist says merger plan undervalues company and disproportionately favours Fuji;Activist investor Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason have urged Xerox shareholders to vote against the Fujifilm deal, calling it the company’s “final death knell”.US printer and photocopier company Xerox last month agreed to a complex deal that would see it combined with a joint venture the two companies operate called Fuji Xerox, giving Fujifilm a 50.1 per cent stake in the merged entity. Under the terms of the deal the joint venture will pay a $2.5bn special cash dividend, or about $9.80 a share, to Xerox shareholders and shares in Xerox will remain listed.On Monday, Mr Icahn and Mr Deason, the first and third largest shareholders of Xerox, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the deal “dramatically undervalues Xerox and disproportionately favours Fuji”.They noted:When we sketch out the financials of the deal, this is our conclusion: we — the existing Xerox shareholders — are selling approximately $535 million of normalised annual recurring cash flow for about $1.25 billion. In other words, we are selling control of Xerox for a cash flow multiple barely exceeding 2.3x.In addition, we are also surrendering half of all potential future dividend growth. When considered with these economics in mind, the transaction looks like another depressing display of incompetence by a Xerox Board of Directors with no real skin in the game.Fuji Xerox, the joint venture between the two firms, previously came under scrutiny when a panel of independent experts found improper accounting practices at two of its subsidiaries dating back to 2010. Both Mr Icahn and Mr Deason, who have previously called on Xerox to explore strategic alternatives, said on Monday that the accounting scandal presented the best opportunity Xerox had “to get rid of this albatross”, terminate the joint venture agreement and gain access to the $36bn Asia-Pacific market.“To put it simply, the current Board of Directors has overseen the systematic destruction of Xerox, and, unless we do something, this latest Fuji scheme will be the company’s final death knell,” they said. “We urge you — our fellow shareholders — do not let Fuji steal this company from us. There is still tremendous opportunity for us to realise value on our own if we bring in the right leadership.”Xerox said in response:A comprehensive review of strategic and financial alternatives conducted over many months by the independent members of the Xerox Board of Directors, in consultation with independent financial and legal advisers, considered several other options in detail and concluded that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the best path to create value for Xerox shareholders.The transaction provides shareholders with the opportunity to benefit from ownership in a combined company that has enhanced growth prospects and a stronger financial profile to support future value creation, as well as an immediate substantial dividend payment.Xerox shares, which initially climbed 3 per cent on the news in pre-market trade, were up 1 per cent at pixel time.
39;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-01-31T13:14:42Z;Xerox records “meaningful improvements” in Q4 results ahead of Fujifilm merger;Pace of revenue decline slows;Xerox’s fourth-quarter results showed some improvement in line with its plans for a multiyear strategic transformation, but its fate is all but sealed after agreeing to a deal that will see Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings take control of the US company’s printer and photocopier business.The deal will see Xerox combined with a joint venture, Fuji Xerox, that the two companies already operate, handing Fujifilm a 51 per cent stake in the merged entity. Xerox will remain listed in the US and its shareholders will receive a $2.5bn special cash dividend from Fuji Xerox.The decline in revenue that has plagued Xerox was still evident in its most recent quarterly results, although there were signs the company’s multiyear strategic transformation was paying off.The company highlighted “meaningful improvements” in the form of revenue down 2 per cent year-on-year on a constant currency basis to $2.7bn in the quarter ended December 31, but better than the 5 per cent drop a year ago.Total revenues for the full year of $10.3bn were down 4.7 per cent, but in line with company guidance, while its adjusted operating margin of 12.8 per cent, an improvement of 0.3 percentage points, was also in line with the expected range.For the fourth quarter, Xerox recorded a net loss of $190m, narrowing from an $843m loss a year ago, but weighed down by a $400m charge related to US tax law changes. For the full year, the company swung to a $195m profit from a $471m loss.In 2018, the company expects its transformation to continue and flagged revenue to decline by between 2 per cent to 4 per cent, and for its operating margin to be in the range of 13 per cent to 14 per cent.“With positive results across all metrics, our fourth-quarter performance clearly demonstrates the progress we have made and enabled us to deliver on our commitments for the full-year,” Jeff Jacobson, Xerox chief executive, said in a statement.
40;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-01-31T12:03:55Z;Fujifilm/Xerox: wrong whey;Given shrinking pastures the tie-up is unlikely to fatten the pockets of investors;A cow — in business consulting language — is a market share leader in a slowly growing industry. Fujifilm is buying control of bovine Xerox, the US copier and printing group, in order to merge it with a longstanding joint venture. But the groups’ pastures are shrinking and the tie-up is unlikely to produce much for investors to cream off.Fujifilm is giving up control of the joint venture and paying a cash dividend to buy just over half of Xerox. Even if a new equilibrium for printer demand is emerging, combining Xerox with competing ruminants, instead of a partner, would have been a better way to support the industry’s pricing power.Increasing digitisation is reducing demand for office photocopiers. Xerox revenues have been shrinking at 13 per cent annually in the past five years — despite the fact that four-fifths derive from recurring sales, such as repair contracts. The group lost money in the 12 months to September.Fujifilm’s most recent half-year revenues for the office machine business, declined only 1 per cent compared with the year before. It wants to focus attention on fast-growing office markets and cut costs by a tenth. The rest of the company grew 14 per cent in the same period. Fujifilm has successfully pivoted its business towards pharma, materials and imaging.Carl Icahn may not have had the Japanese group in mind as a suitor, when he demanded that Xerox look into selling itself last week. His missive included a hard line against the terms of the Asia joint venture, given last year’s accounting scandals.Fujifilm’s shares fell 8 per cent on Wednesday following the merger announcement and a profit warning. These trade at roughly 13 times earnings. Selling the joint venture, instead of merging it with Xerox, would likely have boosted its valuation. Diehard fans of the struggling office equipment sector could then benefit from cost savings and consolidation. Instead the Japanese group’s dependence on the sector will increase. Mr Icahn probably does not approve of that either.
41;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-01-31T07:13:57Z;Japan’s Fujifilm to take control of Xerox;Combination deal aims to revive ailing US group and thwart activist attack;Xerox has agreed a deal that will see Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings take control of its printer and photocopier business as the ailing US group seeks to fend off an activist shareholder revolt.The deal will combine Xerox, which has a market value of $8.3bn, with a joint venture the two companies operate called Fuji Xerox, ultimately giving Fujifilm a 50.1 per cent stake in the merged entity. The joint venture will pay a $2.5bn special cash dividend, or roughly $9.80 per share, to Xerox shareholders.*Shares in Xerox will remain listed and its brand will survive, but the transaction marks the fall of an American corporate icon, which has grappled with falling revenues as it failed to adapt to rapid changes in the industry.Ties between the two companies date back to the early 1960s when they formed a copier joint venture, which has grown to generate almost half of the Japanese group’s total annual revenues of ¥2.3tn ($21bn). Using an unusual structure, the deal will be carried out in three phases. Using $6.1bn in bank lending, Fuji Xerox will first buy back Fujifilm’s 75 per cent stake in the joint venture. The Japanese group will use the proceeds to acquire 50.1 per cent of Xerox, and Fuji Xerox will ultimately merge with Xerox. The structure means that Fujifilm does not dip into its cash and can carry out further acquisitions.But analysts questioned the merit of Fujifilm taking a bigger stake in Xerox’s business, which has suffered a 15 per cent decline in annual revenue to $10bn over the past three years. Such a deal also would break with the Japanese company’s strategy of branching into new areas such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to cushion the decline of its photo film sales. “It’s a non-growth business and there is no reason why they should buy Xerox itself,” said a Fujifilm analyst in Tokyo, who declined to be named before the deal was closed. “Fujifilm has 75 per cent of the joint venture with Xerox so they already have enough exposure there. They should focus their resources in growth areas or return funds to shareholders.” Underscoring the tough business environment, Fujifilm said it would cut 10,000 jobs in the Asia-Pacific region at its joint venture with Xerox, representing about 22 per cent of it workforce at Fuji Xerox. It also lowered its full-year operating profit guidance by 30 per cent to ¥130bn to reflect related restructuring charges. The Japanese company is scheduled to hold a news conference on its business strategy on Wednesday evening.Shares in Xerox jumped 8 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal reported the two companies were nearing a deal. Fujifilm dropped 8.3 per cent on Wednesday. Xerox has been under pressure from Carl Icahn, the New York-based activist investor, who demanded the US company revise or end its joint venture with Fujifilm. Darwin Deason, the third-largest investor in Xerox, joined Mr Icahn’s protest last week, with the two jointly urging Xerox to explore strategic alternatives including a sale, and to carry out a change of leadership. They have specifically targeted Jeff Jacobson, Xerox’s chief executive, arguing that “he is neither qualified nor capable of successfully running” the company. It is unclear whether the new deal, where Mr Jacobson would be named chief of the combined company, would satisfy the activist investors’ demands.Fuji Xerox, the joint venture between the two firms, also came under scrutiny last year after a panel of outside experts found improper accounting practices at two of its subsidiaries in New Zealand and Australia dating back to 2010. In the wake of the scandal, Shigetaka Komori, the chairman of Fujifilm, took over as chairman of the joint venture.Mr Komori defended the deal on Wednesday, saying the company will have enough cash to continue investing in growth areas.“We believe Xerox’s corporate value will increase with this merger so I think the shareholders will give their consent,” he said at a news conference in Tokyo when asked about the activist investors who have questioned the joint venture.* This article has been amended to correct the source of the special dividend and Fujifilm’s stake in the ventureJapanese shareholders get their pockets picked again / From Elizabeth Desmond, London, UK

Fujifilm is expected to make a stock and cash offer to Xerox that would give it a 51 per cent stake in the new combine company, said one person with direct knowledge about the deal terms. A deal, which could be announced as early as Wednesday, is likely to value the Connecticut-based company a little over $8bn, which was the market value of Xerox at the end of trading on Tuesday, another person said.A spokesperson for Fujifilm declined to comment. Xerox also declined to comment.Shares in Xerox jumped 8 per cent in after-hours trading after the Wall Street Journal first reported that the two companies were nearing a deal.

43;XRX;Xerox Corp;2018-01-22T18:00:49Z;Xerox: copy that;A sale of the famous US copier company looks to be on the cards ;"Carl Icahn has done fine in Xerox, where he first declared a stake worth $780m in November 2015. Only two months later, Xerox took the activist’s advice and split into separate hardware and a services companies; it also handed over board seats with no shots fired. Today, Today Mr Icahn is the leading shareholder in both Xerox and Conduent, with stakes adding up to a combined $1.2bn. After that success, Mr Icahn tired of the failure to print better results. He could have put his money in the S&P 500 for a similar gain. Recently, shares in Xerox have gone sideways. Rather than take profits, he is demanding more change. Chief executive Jeff Jacobson must go. In fact, failing to oust him “could inevitably result in the loss of our entire investment”. The company must take a hard line with Fujifilm, a joint venture partner in Japan. Now Mr Icahn has told Xerox it must look at a sale.Galling it may be, but given past form and cold logic, Xerox is likely to copy the prescription from its irascible investor, who is supported by Darwin Deason, another large shareholder. Consolidation makes sense in such a mature industry and there is plenty to go at — Wells Fargo noted last year that 40 per cent of the copier market is shared between 18 smaller players. Xerox is showing little sign of turning the corner by itself. Revenues are falling at 5 per cent a year while operating margins are shrinking. The company is reported to be talking to Fujifilm about a possible new deal or sale. But given a large accounting scandal there, Xerox should be casting the net wider.Who else could acquire it? Hewlett-Packard, which itself separated from its services arm in 2015, already bought Samsung’s printing business for $1.1bn. It should be able to swallow $8bn Xerox too; HP has modest net debt and $4.5bn in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Canon is similarly positioned. The only difficulty, as with a jammed printer, will be deciding who comes first in the queue.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

Between them, the two investors own more than 40m shares in the company, or more than 15 per cent of outstanding shares.“Because we are completely aligned regarding our views on the following subjects, we have agreed to act in concert and have formed a ‘group’ with respect to the contemplated solicitation of proxies to elect four new individuals to the board of directors at the 2018 annual meeting of Xerox’s shareholders,” Mr Icahn and Mr Deason said in a joint statement on Monday.Mr Icahn is ramping up his campaign against Xerox amid reports that the company is in merger talks with Fujifilm.Mr Icahn said the “old guard” directors at Xerox “have historically lacked the intestinal fortitude to challenge and demand accountability from Xerox management,” and Mr Jacobson “is neither qualified nor capable of running this company”.A spokesman for Xerox said the company’s board and management “are confident with the strategic direction in which the company is heading and we will continue to take action to achieve our common goal of creating value for all Xerox shareholders”.Every day that the ‘old guard’ remains in power is a waste of time that could inevitably erode the value of our investment down to nothingMr Icahn is nominating four new directors to the board of Xerox ahead of its 2018 shareholder meeting. They include Jonathan Christodoro, the former managing director of Icahn Capital who recently resigned from the Xerox board, along with Keith Cozza, Jay Firestone and Randolph Read.The investors said in their statement: “Every day that the ‘old guard’ remains in power — feebly overseeing the company’s steady decline — is a waste of time that could inevitably erode the value of our investment down to nothing. We simply cannot wait any longer for things to change. We must act before it is too late. Stay tuned, fellow shareholders. This is just the beginning.”Mr Deason has been one of the five largest shareholders in Xerox for nearly a decade and has previously negotiated with the board in private.But he said in a letter to the company’s board last week that he was changing his “longstanding position” to demand that the details of the joint venture with Fuji be disclosed.“I further demand that the board hire new and independent advisers following discussions with us to evaluation the company’s strategic options with Fuji, including the potential termination of what I suspect but am unable to yet confirm is a one-sided value-destroying agreement disfavouring Xerox,” he said.

Their letters followed a report from the Wall Street Journal that said the potential deal could include a change of control of Xerox.In Monday’s letter Mssrs Icahn and Deason argued that while consolidation in the industry is “inevitable”:We implore the “old guard” directors — who have historically lacked the intestinal fortitude to challenge and demand accountability from Xerox management — to not do us all the tremendous disservice of allowing Jeff Jacobson to lead the negotiations. He is neither qualified nor capable of successfully running this company, let alone negotiating a major strategic transaction that will do more than save his own job.Unfortunately, we have little faith that Xerox’s “old guard” directors will listen to us, which is why real change is needed now more than ever. Every day that the “old guard” remains in power — feebly overseeing the company’s steady decline — is a waste of time that could inevitably erode the value of our investment down to nothing.

If the ‘old guard’ directors are similarly incapable, or unwilling to do the work necessary to rectify this dire situation for shareholders, then they must be replaced.”The agreement should be scrapped entirely if it is blocking other opportunities for Xerox, he said.Mr Icahn, who has invested in Xerox since 2015, is growing increasingly agitated with the company. He said there was “very little time” left for change, which includes his demands to revamp the board and replace chief executive Jeff Jacobson.A spokesman for Xerox said they “are aware of the letter from Carl Icahn”, and added: “The Xerox Board and management team are focused on creating value for all shareholders and will continue to take action to achieve this objective.”Mr Icahn said he supported the view taken by Darwin Deason, the company’s third-largest shareholder, who demanded in a letter to Xerox’s board on Wednesday that the company disclose the details of its joint venture agreement with Fujifilm.“I further demand that the board hire new and independent advisers following discussions with us to evaluate the company’s strategic options with Fuji, including the potential termination of what I suspect but am unable to yet confirm is a one-sided value-destroying agreement disfavouring Xerox, that Fuji has repeatedly breached,” Mr Deason said. “I am very disappointed in Mr Jacobson and his lethargic approach regarding Fuji.”Xerox and Fuji are also in merger talks, the Wall Street Journal has reported. While Mr Icahn said he is “not predisposed to approve or disapprove of any transaction with Fuji or any other party,” the “current management team and the ‘old guard’ directors are ill-equipped to negotiate a major transaction with Fuji.”The fund “would likely oppose any deal that saddles a new company with a management team comprised of the detritus of the Xerox ‘old guard’,” he said.A spokesman for Xerox said that it was “aware” of the letter. “The Xerox board and management team are focused on creating value for all shareholders and will continue to take action to achieve this objective,” the spokesman said.Mr Icahn said in December he would nominate four new directors to the board of Xerox ahead of its 2018 shareholder meeting.Jonathan Christodoro, the former managing director of Icahn Capital, resigned from the board over a disagreement. That ended a standstill agreement between the fund and the company and allowed them to submit the nominations.“In the many decades we have been investing and serving on boards of directors, we cannot recall another situation where relations with a company have deteriorated to such an extent that one of our representatives was forced to take the drastic step of resigning from a board over a disagreement,” Mr Icahn said.The activist is re-nominating Mr Christodoro, along with Keith Cozza, Jay Firestone and Randolph Read. He is targeting at least five directors who he deems part of the “old guard” — the directors who hail from the time when Ursula Burns was chief executive of Xerox.Xerox bowed to pressure from Mr Icahn almost two years ago to split itself in two and create separate businesses for its hardware and services.

Together with its subsidiary Pentagon Lock, Apax raised £315m for its stake at a price of 616p — a 4.6 per cent discount to Monday’s close.Despite the share price drop, Sophos is still trading near record highs, at around 600p a share shortly before publication time, as a wave of cyber attacks has boosted demand for its products.The fallout from the WannaCry and Petya cyber attacks, which hit organisations around the world in the summer, has helped Sophos — which sells anti-virus and encryption software to mid-market companies — more than double its market value since the start of the year.The Oxfordshire-based company is one of the UK’s major technology success stories.Since its initial public offering in 2015, the software group has steadily added customers and gained market share in a sector that analysts estimate to be worth $35bn. It supplies cyber security services to companies including Pixar, Ford, Toshiba and Xerox, as well as the UK’s National Health Service, which was severely disrupted by the WannaCry attack in May.The sale is the third time Apax has cut its stake since the IPO. After selling 5 per cent of Sophos two weeks after it listed in July 2015, in December that year Apax sold 60m shares — around a 13 per cent stake — at a price of 265p a share.

The group’s billings – which represent future revenues that have been invoiced to customers – rose 15.8 per cent to $164.3m.“The demand environment in cyber security remained strong,” said Kris Hagerman, chief executive officer. “We saw continued significant customer and partner interest in our leading next-generation anti-ransomware solutions, with awareness further raised following recent high-profile global attacks like WannaCry and Petya.”Sophos supplies cyber security services to companies including Pixar, Ford, Toshiba and Xerox, as well as the UK’s National Health Service, which was severely disrupted by the WannaCry attack in May.The group has added customers steadily since floating on public markets in 2015 and rapidly gained share in a market that analysts estimate to be worth $35bn. It is now the third largest technology company in the UK.Earlier this year, Sophos bought the commercial software business of US-based group Invincea, which already has customers in government, healthcare and financial services. The $100m deal to drive expansion in the US boosted billings from the region, which grew by “over 25 per cent” in the quarter.Global cyber attacks this year have lifted shares in cyber security companies including Sophos, Barracuda Networks and FireEye as investors predict large businesses will spend more on cyber defence software to protect their operations.Sophos said cash earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the quarter was $27.3m – up 6.6 per cent on the same period last year. Operating losses widened to $15.6m as the company spent more on adding customers.
50;XRX;Xerox Corp;2017-01-10T12:40:07Z;Yahoo! Or not. Sympathise with staff stuck with the name;Better to work under a wacky new moniker than a damaged one, writes Andrew Hill;The good news: Yahoo clearly has not spent a cent devising “Altaba”, the new name for the investment company that will be left after the operating business is sold to Verizon. The bankers’ working title of “RemainCo” is hardly less exciting.Further good news: the people who came up with what seems to be a combination of “alternative” and “Alibaba” (Yahoo’s stake in which is its most valuable asset) did not decide to call the new company “Alibernative”.The bad news: one underwhelming naming ceremony does not signal an end to wilder rebrandings.Fuelled by the never-ending cycle of mergers and demergers, inventing new names is an annuity business for brand gurus and a dependable source of nonsensical justifications from the marketing department.I thought this sector had reached a low point in 2014, when PwC rebranded Booz & Company, the consultancy it had bought, as Strategy&. But the past year has seen the birth of Conduent, which sounds more like an intimate skin balm than the business process services group that was part of Xerox. Arconic, which makes multi-material products for aerospace groups and carmakers and emerged from Alcoa, could be an old-fashioned cocktail mixer. In fact, according to the group, the A stands for Alcoa, the “arc” for the “arc of progress”, and the “conic” alludes to the iconic products the company produces.Whatever. History suggests that if a company is successful, people do get used to its new handle, however outlandish it seems at first (think of Accenture or Diageo, at first ribbed for their portmanteau brands).The people I usually pity in rebranding exercises are the front-line employees. They suffer the indignity of having to explain themselves — and their new name — long after the marketing department has packed away the jargon and the branded freebies. For instance, I can only imagine the pain of staff at “Everything Everywhere” before that 2010 telecoms joint venture was renamed EE.Yahoo looked an odd brand at first — though co-founders Jerry Yang and David Filo’s original name “Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web” was never going to last. Still, the brand was enough to energise its early hires. According to Karen Angel’s book Inside Yahoo!, published in 2002, the group’s first head of marketing even replanted her garden to bloom in Yahoo’s purple and yellow colours.Those flowers have long since wilted. Now, my sympathies are with the staff who will continue to work at the operating businesses, under the unchanged Yahoo banner, rather than the few who will run Altaba. As the once-mighty internet group’s reputation suffers slow death by a billion data breaches, a rebrand, however dull or wacky, would probably come as a merciful relief to Yahoo’s job-seeking employees.andrew.hill@ft.com
51;XRX;Xerox Corp;2016-11-28T16:56:08Z;When business spin-offs spin out of control;Case of Xerox v Darwin Deason has important lessons for creditors;To resolve battles with dissident investors, spin-offs can provide a straightforward solution for besieged companies. Shareholders receive a piece of the newly separated company while keeping shares in the slimmer parent. Each company, afterwards, may become easier to value. The dream scenario may be that a bidder emerges willing to acquire either of the leftovers at a premium price.But as a recent dispute at Xerox illustrates, when shareholders decide a corporate separation is good for them creditors can feel that this is at their expense.Xerox said in January it would split itself in two after Carl Icahn took a 7 per cent stake in the copier business. In 2010, it had acquired a successful technology outsourcing company, Affiliated Computer Services, for $6.4bn in cash and stock.ACS was founded by Texan Darwin Deason. He made a fortune mastering the dull back-office functions banks and companies need to survive. Xerox’s goal — now dashed — was to bundle multiple corporate services and sell the package to big companies.The impending spin-off unwinds the ACS deal. The outsourcing unit will be listed as a new enterprise called Conduent that will have annual revenue of about $7bn (leaving $10bn at Xerox). As for Xerox creditors, Conduent will, as is common practice at spun-off companies, borrow $2.4bn and send most of the cash raised back up to Xerox, which will use the funds to pay down its existing debt.While owning 6 per cent of Xerox common stock, Mr Deason also happens to be a Xerox creditor. He owns $300m of convertible preferred stock which he received for his super-voting ACS shares in the 2010 acquisition. In the upcoming spin-off, Xerox had planned to keep Mr Deason’s preferred stock at Xerox with no participation in Conduent. But after months of negotiation Mr Deason sued to stop the Xerox separation, believing the terms of his preferred stock entitled him to a stake in Conduent.According to his October court filing, the legal provisions of the preferred stock make “clear that he only agreed to sell the fruits of his life’s work [ACS] in exchange for a guaranteed, substantial stake in the combined company on terms that would preclude Xerox from marooning his investment in a company separated from [Conduent]”. Mr Deason estimated that the value loss to him from deprivation of a Conduent stake could be as high as $200m.After initially calling Mr Deason’s position “meritless”, Xerox settled in just three weeks. It chose to swap Mr Deason’s $300m of preferred shares for $120m and $180m of preferred shares at Conduent and Xerox, respectively. Given Xerox’s $16bn enterprise value, a lengthy scuffle over a $300m security seemed unproductive for the company.While it will not be litigated, the technical legal dispute related to the securities itself is interesting. Mr Deason argued that the preferred stock documentation dictated that in a company reorganisation he should be able to participate in whatever new entity was created. Common shareholders received shares in the new company. The preferred stock could be converted into common shares and thus were similarly entitled.Xerox countered that the Conduent spin-off constituted not a reorganisation but a “small distribution”. In its view, Mr Deason’s convertible shares should simply have the Xerox conversion price adjusted down to reflect the loss of Conduent’s earnings.The duties of company boards are to shareholders. Creditors’ primary protection is in the legal documents describing their securities. Mr Deason’s convertible preferred stock left him in the position of being both a creditor and a de facto shareholder. As a shareholder, he felt entitled to a stake in the new company. But as a creditor, he was just as worried about how a weak, standalone Xerox could support his preferred dividend.Such potential abuse of creditors and others incidental to shareholders is a continuing theme in spin-offs. In perhaps the most notorious instance, oil driller Kerr-McGee separated its chemicals unit to form Tronox in 2004. But after allegations of environmental damage, Tronox collapsed, leaving Kerr-McGee and its new owner Anadarko to pay out $5bn in damages. More recently, the spin-off controversy has centred on their tax-free feature. Yahoo notably abandoned its Alibaba spin over tax liability concerns.In 2015, there were $177bn worth of US spin-offs, up from just $17bn in 2010. Shareholders have come to favour the technique to create value for themselves. But expect all other affected stakeholders to struggle to keep up.
52;XRX;Xerox Corp;2016-10-28T11:18:26Z;Xerox chops guidance amid waning printer sales;;Xerox has moved to cut the upper end of its full-year earnings guidance amid continued weakness in demand for its printers and copiers, which pushed the company into another quarter of sales decline.The New York-based company said it now expected earnings per share on a GAAP basis to come in at between 45 to 48 cent for 2016 and full year adjusted EPS to be between $1.11 to $1.14.This compares to the forecast of GAAP EPS of 45 to 55 cents and adjusted EPS of $1.10 to $1.20 it gave just three months ago.Shares in the company, down 10 per cent so far this year, fell by another 1.5 per cent in pre-market trading.Xerox, which began life at the turn of the 20th century as a maker of photographic paper and grew to become the world’s dominant maker of photocopiers, has seen its fortunes wane in recent years as the rise of cloud computing and emailing lessens the need for printing documents.The trend can be seen in its document technology business, which includes sales of printers and copiers. Revenue from the unit, Xerox’s mainstay for over half a century, fell 9 per cent to $1.6bn in the three months to end of September.Under pressure from billionaire US investor Carl Icahn, Xerox announced in February plans to split the ailing hardware business from its services unit, which supplies software and advice designed to make daily business processes more efficient.For the third quarter, the services unit reported an 1 per cent increase in revenues to $2.4bn.Overall, group sales for the quarter fell 3 per cent to $4.21bn, falling short of market expectations of $4.3bn. Net income was $184m, against a net loss of $31m in the prior year period.
53;XRX;Xerox Corp;2016-07-11T22:11:08Z;Xerox held merger talks with RR Donnelley;;Xerox, the US company best known for its printers and photocopiers, has held merger talks with RR Donnelley & Sons, the owner of the Edgar financial-statement wire service, according to people briefed about the situation.Talks between the two follow Xerox’s decision in February to split into a hardware technology company generating $11bn in revenues and a services business worth $7bn in sales, writes James Fontanella-Khan in New York.According to Bloomberg, which first reported the merger talks, Xerox plans to merge with RR Donnelley before splitting but eventually it would be part of the hardware-focused unit.Xerox decided to split the business in two after its management had come under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn, who had long campaigned for shake-up at the company.RR Donnelley, which in 2012 accidentally released the disappointing quarterly earnings of Google, sparking a panicked sell-off of the company’s shares, had also announced last year a plan to separate the company into three parts.Shares in RR Donnelley, which had a market valuation of about $4bn, rose nearly 6 per cent on the news. Xerox, which had a market capitalisation of nearly $10bn, rose a little more than 2.5 per cent.
54;XRX;Xerox Corp;2016-05-24T17:01:40Z;Xerox: slow Burns;The company’s chief executive has had to swim against the current;"Half a century ago Xerox was a heck of a growth story. By the time Ursula Burns took charge in 2009, copying and printing had long been slowing. Her tenure as chief executive, which will end when the company splits in two this year, can be judged only in that context. Decline management has three aspects. Find some growth; conserve capital; deploy that capital with care. Cash that the turnround does not require should be returned, not punted away on unrealistic projects. Better to be run for cash than to burn it.Ms Burns took care of the growth bit in her first year, with the $6.4bn acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services, a business services outsourcer (accounting, payroll, customer service and the like). It has increased sales at about 1 per cent a year since the deal, better than the 7 per cent average annual decline for the document business over the same period. Now, Xerox is separating the companies again — a straightforward admission that the promised cost synergies and cross-selling opportunities were not worth the bother.On capital conservation, Ms Burns’ record is much better: selling and administrative costs have fallen at twice the rate of sales since the deal. But as Xerox’s business mix shifted towards outsourcing and away from equipment, a higher cost of sales depressed margins. The group still generated lots of cash and $6.1bn has been distributed in the past five years. Alas, $4.8bn went via share buybacks at an average price above today’s.Xerox shares have returned 70 per cent in Ms Burns’ tenure, less than half the broader market. This looks bad. Yet Xerox’s 10-year chart mirrors that of its closest peer, Lexmark, and, leaving out the giddy 1990s, the shares have been flattish for four decades. The ACS deal and the buyback failed. But anyone wishing to judge Ms Burns should describe which of her other options had a better chance of success. Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

Sales fell 4 per cent to $4.28bn, in line with estimates.Following activist pressure from billionaire US investor Carl Icahn, Xerox said in February that it would split into two companies to revive the troubled technology group.It plans to divide into a hardware business, known as document technology, and a services unit that supplies software and advice, designed to make daily business processes more efficient. The company said it would incur $200m to $250m in separation costs this year, including $8m in costs for the first quarter.Shares in Xerox have fallen 20 per cent in the past year as the company tries to shift away from its copier business to a variety of IT services. They closed the day 13.3 per cent lower at $9.68.“I’m pleased with our progress on our strategic transformation and separation,” said Ursula Burns, chief executive and chairman. “We have accelerated our cost reduction efforts across the company and expect to begin realising the benefits in the second quarter.”Shares in Valeant, which have tumbled nearly 75 per cent since the beginning of last year, advanced early on Monday after the company confirmed Joseph Papa, the former chief executive of Irish drugmaker Perrigo, would become its new chief executive and chairman, replacing Mike Pearson. However, the later last further ground, closing down 2.2 per cent at $35.17.Mr Papa, who had served as chief executive of Perrigo since 2006, is expected to join by early May.Valeant has in the past year faced probes from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress and two attorneys-general over its accounting practices and business model.Robert Ingram, chairman of Valeant’s board, said Mr Papa’s “strong shareholder orientation, background in science, and unmatched record of accomplishments” led the board to believe he was the “ideal leader” for Valeant.Mr Papa resigned as chief of Perrigo on Sunday, and the Dublin-based drugmaker saw its shares dive 18 per cent on Monday after warning on profits and naming John Hendrickson as its new chief executive.Shares in Tribune Publishing rose 52.9 per cent after Gannett, the publisher behind USA Today, proposed to buy the company for $12.25 in cash a share, valuing the deal at about $815m including debt.The offer is a 63 per cent premium to Tribune’s closing price on Friday. Gannett first made an approach for Tribune on April 12 and was refused.Energy stocks were on the back foot as the price of Brent crude slipped 1.4 per cent on Monday. Cabot Oil fell 4.2 per cent to $22.30, Chevron was down 0.5 per cent to $101.52, ExxonMobil lost 0.2 per cent to $87.34 and Chesapeake Energy declined 2.3 per cent to $6.40.Other cyclical sectors, such as materials and industrials, also declined, as fears over the global economy came back into the spotlight.Meanwhile so-called defensive stocks, such as consumer staples, utilities and telecommunications, performed better.Stocks on Wall Street began the week on a sour note amid the slide in crude prices and following a lacklustre week, in which downbeat corporate results weighed on investor sentiment.The S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent to 2,087.8 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 17,977.2, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent lower at 4,895.8.

Disappointing results from Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and Microsoft proved a drag.On Monday, Xerox, the company best known for its printers and photocopiers, reported adjusted earnings of 22 cents a share before the market open. The figures missed analysts’ estimates by 1 cent. Sales of $4.28bn were in line with estimates. The company, which will divide into a hardware business and a services unit that supplies software and advice, said it expects to incur $200m to $250m in separation costs this year.A 0.6 per cent decline in Brent crude, the global oil marker, to $44.86 a barrel, and a 0.9 drop in West Texas Intermediate, the US oil standard, to $43.32 a barrel also weighed on markets.Later, investors will turn their attention to sales of newly built homes and a regional manufacturing survey. Economists estimate that new home sales will advance 1.6 per cent to 520,000 in March, from the previous month. Meanwhile, a survey of manufacturing activity by the Dallas Fed is expected to strengthen to -10 in April, from -13.6 the previous month.But all eyes remain on the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan that are slated to announce their monetary policy decisions later this week. While the Fed is expected to stay its hand on Wednesday, investors will watch for changes in language as they determine the timing of the next interest rate rise.Meanwhile, it was reported last week that the Bank of Japan, which introduced negative interest rates in January, could aid banks by offering negative rates on some loans when it meets.On the corporate front, more than 180 companies on the S&P 500, including Apple, are projected to report results.
57;XRX;Xerox Corp;2016-01-29T20:53:01Z;Week in Review, January 30;"US carmakers impress; Icahn, RBS, Zurich and Boeing also in the news";A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Lower fuel prices give US carmakers a helping handTwo of America’s big three carmakers thanked sport utility vehicles and low fuel prices for high octane performance this week, writes Andy Sharman.Rising US sales of larger “gas-guzzlers” has driven the world’s second-largest car market to record levels— and that was reflected in the carmakers’ latest financial results.On Thursday, Ford reported its best ever earnings, from its highest revenues for more than a decade, and posted its healthiest automotive operating margin since the 1990s. Sales were propelled by a growing demand for high-margin pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles in the US — which were made more affordable by low domestic fuel prices and easy credit terms.A day earlier, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles had reported that its revenues were up more than 15 per cent to €113bn last year, while operating earnings climbed more than a third to €5.3bn.That gave Sergio Marchionne , Fiat Chrysler’s captivating chief executive, the confidence to raise the group’s already ambitious midterm financial targets. For example, it now wants to have €5bn in net cash by the end of 2018, versus €5bn in net debt in December.Ford and Fiat Chrysler also reported their first full-year profits in Europe for at least five years.However, they remain hugely reliant on the US, which is the source of the vast majority of operating earnings for the two carmakers.Here, both Ford and Fiat Chrysler — like crosstown rival General Motors, which reports annual results next week — appear convinced the good times can continue.But investors are less certain, and this week seemed to be worrying that the only way from here is downhill — if not for sales then, at least, for profitability. Ford’s shares fell as much as six per cent following its results, while Fiat Chrysler’s declined about 7 per cent over the two days after its announcement.Shares in each of the big three US carmakers have declined by double digits so far this year.Activist Icahn scores Xerox victory but AIG fights backCarl Icahn demonstrated the power he wields over some of the biggest US companies this week by persuading Xerox, the brand famous for its printers and photocopiers, to break in two, writes Alistair Gray in New York.However, another of the billionaire investor’s corporate quarries, American International Group, is fighting back against his campaign for a split of its insurance businesses.Earlier this week, AIG moved to fend off the powerful activist investor by setting out measures to improve profitability and investor transparency.As part of the plan to win over other investors, AIG will launch its mortgage insurance division on the stock market, hasten cost-cutting actions and segregate “legacy” assets from the rest of the business.But the measures stop far short of Mr Icahn’s demands.Along with the hedge fund manager John Paulson, he has called on AIG to take more radical steps to remove its designation as “systemically important” by US authorities, a label that brings with it tougher regulations.Shareholders in AIG, which taxpayers bailed out during the financial crisis, were promised this week they would be in line for $25bn, through share buybacks and dividends, over the next two years if they backed management.Peter Hancock, chief executive, kicked off a roadshow for investors on the east coast this week and is preparing to travel to Chicago and Los Angeles to rally more support.● Related Lex note: AIG — stakes in the groundZurich investors pin hopes on comeback under GrecoMario Greco quit as chief executive of Generali after three years spent turning round the Italian insurer, to rejoin his former employer — Zurich Insurance, whose shareholders hope he will oversee a similar revival, writes Ralph Atkins in Zurich.Mr Greco’s appointment was a coup for Zurich, which has been hit by setbacks over the past six months, although the immediate share price reaction was muted. The 56-year-old Italian is credited with a sweeping overhaul at Generali, slashing costs and selling assets to shore up the Italian group’s financial strength.Zurich had been on the lookout for a new head since December, when Martin Senn quit as the Swiss insurer’s boss. Mr Senn had been under pressure since he was forced to halt a £5.6bn bid for RSA, the UK insurer, to deal instead with problems in Zurich’s general insurance division.To add to the problems, Zurich, whose shares are down almost 27 per cent compared with a year ago, last week warned of $275m of losses related to storms in the UK and Ireland.Tom de Swaan, Zurich’s chairman, had made clear he wanted to appoint an outsider as chief executive who could act as an “entrepreneurial leader”. In the event, he turned to a Zurich alumnus. Mr Greco worked at Zurich from 2007-12 as head of life operations and then general insurance.His goal at Zurich will be to boost earnings, improve underwriting performance and ensure the Swiss insurer successfully rides the wave of consolidation across the global insurance sector.RBS on course for eighth successive annual net lossRoyal Bank of Scotland warned that it will post its eighth successive net annual loss for 2015 and revealed a £3.6bn hit from litigation charges and pension costs, writes Emma Dunkley in London.The state-backed bank said it had accelerated a payment into its defined benefit pension scheme to plug the deficit, resulting in a £1.6bn hit to its equity. RBS also earmarked an extra £2bn to cover conduct charges in the US and UK.The surprise trading update on Wednesday, which sent the share price down by a few per cent, came the day before UK chancellor George Osborne announced that a discounted Lloyds’ share sale to retail investors in the spring will be postponed, because of market turmoil.The share prices of both banks have fallen below the levels at which the government bailed-out the lenders during the financial crisis, making it tough for Mr Osborne to continue selling down the taxpayers’ stake.The government came under fire last year when it began selling RBS, offloading 5.4 per cent of its stake at a £1.1bn loss to taxpayers.Just under 10 per cent of Lloyds is now held by the government. Nearly 15 per cent of the stake has been sold over the past year through a “trading programme”, which drip-feeds shares into market as long as the price is above the 73.6p originally paid by the government in the bailout.In another move, Lloyds announced on Friday that it will call in £3bn of special bonds, which pay up to 16 per cent a year, in early February, after winning a landmark court case at the end of last year. The move will provide Lloyds with a £900m cash injection over the next four years.● Related Lombard note: RBS, stricken chickenFears over demand for jets clouds Boeing costs boostBoeing achieved some success this week in an area that has consistently troubled the US aircraft maker — but it was overshadowed by far bigger concerns about civil aerospace demand, writes Robert Wright in New York.The positive news concerned the costs of building the flagship 787 Dreamliner wide-body jet.The company brought down the average gap between what it costs to build each 787 and the revenue it receives for the aircraft to $5.9m in the fourth quarter, according to results released on Wednesday.The figure was a big improvement on the $15.6m recorded in the third quarter and suggests the programme is on the brink of bringing in more cash than it sends out.However, the achievement was overshadowed by Boeing’s announcement that it expected to build only between 740 and 745 aircraft in 2016, down from 762 in 2015.The projection deepened concerns that the recent boom in civil aerospace might be coming to an end and sent Boeing’s shares down 8.7 per cent, to $116.83. The company also gave a lower than expected projection for 2016’s core earnings per share.The company argues that this year’s dip represents temporary factors — such as customers postponing orders for current-generation versions of its 737 narrow-body and 777 widebody aircraft in anticipation of the arrival of new models.Work on the 747 jumbo jet— which the company once manufactured at the rate of seven per month — has been cut to just six a year as lacklustre air cargo demand has reduced demand for the four-engine jet.Amid a worsening world economy and low oil prices that reduce the incentive to spend on new aircraft, many analysts are concerned the company’s prospects could be worsening.● Related Lex note: Boeing — technical difficultiesBack to top of page

Mr Icahn will be given three seats on the board of the services business, which at the end of the third quarter accounted for about 56 per cent of Xerox’s revenue. The move is the latest attempt by Ursula Burns, Xerox chairman and chief executive, to revive the troubled technology company. The split marks a victory for Mr Icahn, whose targets in recent years have included Apple, AIG and eBay. The billionaire investor disclosed a stake in Xerox in November, arguing he wanted talks on “improving operational performance and pursuing strategic alternatives, as well as the possibility of board representation”.He has since built that stake to 8.1 per cent, making him the company’s second-largest investor. Xerox has been shifting away from its copier business to an array of IT services. The company’s shares are down 14 per cent since the start of 2015. They bounced 5 per cent in pre-market trading on the news in New York.The decision to break the company into two publicly traded units was reached after a series of talks between Mr Icahn and Ms Burns in recent months.

Anyone hoping to emulate Apple needs to match the meticulous operating machine established by Jobs from its early days.In our special report on Corporate Longevity today, Richard Waters writes about how Jobs saw the potential of the graphical user interface on a visit in 1979 to Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center, when Xerox itself did not. Xerox has survived the technological revolution on which it failed to capitalise, while others, such as Eastman Kodak, have had their longevity compromised by an inability to adapt to the pace of innovation.To the victors the spoils, but today’s technology behemoths can also earn brickbats from the masses as their success distorts markets. Steve Jobs was mourned by Occupy Wall Street protesters on his death in 2011, writes Gary Silverman, but voters in San Francisco have shown signs in the past week of turning against tech companies and the excess wealth they are creating.Flag as ImportantVodafone declares a turning point The mobile operator has seen a return to growth in revenue and earnings from operations.

62;XRX;Xerox Corp;2015-11-10T05:03:21Z;Cutting through a web of wires;For tech companies, product innovation does not always guarantee success;As head of Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (Parc) throughout the 1990s, John Seely Brown was in charge of one of Silicon Valley’s most creative research labs.Parc had invented many of the technologies that defined the personal computer era, such as the graphical user interface. It was where Steve Jobs, on a visit in 1979, picked up the ideas that inspired what was to become the Macintosh.According to Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs, the Apple co-founder had no trouble understanding the significance of what he was seeing that day. His reaction to the Parc breakthroughs: “You’re sitting on a goldmine. I can’t believe Xerox is not taking advantage of this.”The width of a continent away, at Xerox’s east coast headquarters, it was not so obvious. According to Seely Brown, the new ideas emerging from the Silicon Valley lab were rejected by the managers responsible for maintaining the company’s established business — what he calls its “core”.“When we pushed them into the core, the immune system of the core ate them up,” he says.Xerox’s failure to capitalise on its own in-house inventions has become one of the tech industry’s most notorious examples of missed opportunity. It did not prove fatal: Xerox is still very much alive, passing its first century nine years ago. But it missed the chance to become a leader of the new personal computing industry and has played only a marginal role in the digital revolution ever since.Old tech companies sometimes survive a surprisingly long time. Very few, though, manage to stay at the forefront through successive generations of technology, says Sir Michael Moritz, a partner at venture capitalist Sequoia and early backer of companies including Yahoo and Google. “It’s easier to survive than to continue leading,” he says.The seismic shifts that have reverberated through the tech world over the past half century have turned out to be disruptive to all but a small handful of companies either flexible or lucky enough to adapt. The moves from mainframe computing, first to mini-computers then PCs, the internet and smartphones, have brought successive waves of new companies to the fore.For the incumbents, running a successful business while anticipating the next upheaval presents a challenge that is acute in tech. “Unlike a ketchup or a soft drink brand, it’s much harder to run your business when you have to spend an enormous of time and effort on research and development,” says Sir Michael.Even tech companies that see the future clearly often have a hard time adapting to technologies that require an entirely different business approach.Eastman Kodak, unlike Xerox, was keenly aware of how digital technology would overtake the analogue products on which its fortune was based. Already 85 years old at the time, it was far-thinking enough to develop the world’s first digital camera, in 1975.But Kodak failed to follow through. It was overtaken by faster-moving rivals with lower costs and the freedom to reimagine how people would want to capture and share pictures in a connected world.Like Nokia, which started life producing wood pulp, Samsung’s origins have little to do with the consumer electronics for which it is now best known. From its founding as an exporter of dried fish and other food to China, Samsung expanded steadily with the emerging South Korean economy to become the largest of the country’s family controlled chaebols, or conglomerates.Starting with TVs, it has pursued a remorseless strategy of vertical integration in electronics for nearly half a century, using its scale in fields such as LCD screens and semiconductors to become the world’s largest smartphone maker.Together, the Xerox and Kodak cases are symptomatic of a wider problem in the tech world. Both companies rode their founders’ original inventions for decades and became synonymous with 20th-century American capitalism. But when the technology foundations on which their fortunes had been built began to shift, they failed to adapt.The shortening of corporate life expectancy caused by the digital revolution is not limited to the tech industry. Fast-moving start-ups, using the low-cost and flexible technologies of cloud computing, along with the global reach of the internet, pose a serious threat to all companies trying to maintain leadership in their industries, says Seely Brown.He quotes figures from Richard Foster, co-author of Creative Destruction, to make his point. In 1958, the average US company in the S&P 500 had been in the index for 61 years: by 2012, that had fallen to just 18 years. No company is now safe. But the periodic shifts in computing have made the tech world a particularly difficult place to operate.As a result, the sector’s rare long-term survival stories stand out. But it is hard to find a common explanation for their success.Apple, currently the world’s most valuable company, is rare in having been a pioneer in two different eras, first personal computing and then, after a brush with bankruptcy, in smartphones.“It’s a company that got started twice by the same man, that’s the difference,” says Sir Michael who, as a journalist, followed Apple’s early years closely.Like many in Silicon Valley, Sir Michael links success closely to the personal involvement of company founders, and has little time for later generations of hired managers. In this view, the golden age of tech start-ups seldom outlasts their creators — and few founders have the personal longevity to keep their companies at the forefront for a protracted period, like a Rupert Murdoch or a Warren Buffet. On this reading, tech companies are never built to last.Yet a handful have defied the odds. Most notable has been IBM, which went through a near-death experience a quarter of a century ago after the rise of personal computing threatened its mainframe-centric business. Thanks to the long-term nature of corporate information technology investments — the huge costs in existing systems that tie customers to the same suppliers for long periods — companies like this still have a chance to adapt, provided they can rebuild their products and services to suit new buying habits.An early example of Corning’s approach to developing new materials and then using them to invent new businesses was a heat-resistant glass developed for train signalmen’s lanterns, which was then repurposed as cookware and branded Pyrex.Though under family control for much of the US glassmaker’s history, Corning has not always been insulated from the upheavals of the tech world. It was forced to contract sharply after being caught up in the optical networking boom and bust of the late 1990s. But a culture of deep research and long-term investment has contributed to its unusual longevity.But even the biggest are now facing disruption from cloud computing, as customers turn away from buying technology to run in their own datacentres and instead outsource their IT needs to companies such as Amazon Web Services.“IBM is struggling, even though it looked like they’d reinvented themselves,” says Tim O’Reilly, a US tech publisher and commentator. “I think a lot of the traditional tech companies are really troubled.”As a result, massive upheaval has been sweeping through industry, carrying away older companies through a series of big mergers that has spread from chip makers into IT systems.Some, like Dell, which is planning the tech industry’s biggest acquisition with the purchase of storage maker EMC, hope to position themselves as the consolidators. Others, like Hewlett-Packard— which itself tried to grow bigger through acquisition — have reversed course and are breaking up.In the shadow of what is fast turning into one of the tech industry’s biggest upheavals, a new generation of companies is now trying to prove that it will have more staying power. Yet even for these companies, there is little breathing room.Facebook, born in the desktop computing world, has already been forced to adapt. Founder Mark Zuckerberg used the acquisitions of mobile apps Instagram and WhatsApp to reposition itself for the smartphone era, and with the purchase of virtual reality company Oculus the company has made a conscious attempt to put itself at the forefront of what could be the computing industry’s next big wave, based on virtual reality.“Mark Zuckerberg was masterful in making sure he wasn’t outflanked by the move to mobile,” says Sir Michael.Google, which failed to break into social networking, has also been grappling with the mobile transition. But its founders have their own idea of how to transcend their internet search origins and defy corporate mortality. By relaunching as holding company Alphabet, they hope to turn Google into the first company capable of pursuing a range of giant, unrelated technology bets.It is an ambition that its chief executive Larry Page hopes will also make it the world’s first trillion-dollar corporation. History suggests, though, that even for a company as rich and brainy as Google, it will not be easy to break free from the tech industry’s cycle of creative destruction.

Sales at its document-technology segment fell 12 per cent to $1.8bn.The Connecticut-based company reported a loss of $34m or 4 cents a share compared with profits of $266m or 22 cents a share in the year-ago period. Xerox took a pre-tax charge tied to its government healthcare IT business.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 24 cents a share topped Wall Street forecasts for 23 cents a share.For the full year, the company expects earnings in the low end of its range of $0.95 to $1.01 per share.Shares in Xerox, which have declined more than 27 per cent so far this year, fell 3 per cent to $10.03.Shares in Pep Boys — Manny, Moe & Jack jumped more than 23 per cent to $14.98 after Japanese tyremaker Bridgestone said it would pay $835m for the Philadelphia-based car mechanics company.Pep Boys shareholders will receive $15 in cash, which represents a 23 per cent premium over its closing price on Friday.The deal is expected to add 800 locations to Bridgestone’s network of automotive service centres. The transaction is expected to close in the beginning of 2016.Valeant shares declined 5.3 per cent to $110.06 after the Canadian drugmaker said it had confirmed the “appropriateness” of its accounting treatment of Philidor, a speciality pharmacy group it acquired an option to buy last December.Valeant shares were pressured last week after a short seller questioned the relationship in a note.Elsewhere, disappointing sales of new homes in September weighed on shares of US homebuilders.A release from the commerce department showed that new home sales fell 11.5 per cent in the US, wider than expectations for a 6.5 per cent fall.Shares in DR Horton, the largest US homebuilder by market value, fell 0.7 per cent to $30.92.Meanwhile, shares in competitor Lennar fell 0.9 per cent to $51.64, while PulteGroup shares slid 0.9 per cent to $18.18. Shares in Toll Brothers, another property developer, fell 0.3 per cent to $36.66.China’s decision to cut interest rates late last week failed to bolster stocks in the US on Monday.By close, the S&P 500 slide 0.2 per cent to 2,071.18, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.1 per cent to 17,623.05 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.1 to 5,034.70.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
64;XRX;Xerox Corp;2015-08-18T13:23:33Z;Faxes at work: from funky to clunky, but holding on;Not all users are ready to hang up on an apparently outmoded tool of communication;"When reactors at the Fukushima nuclear plant went into meltdown in 2011, operators tried to send a fax to alert authorities in the nearby town of Namie.Receipt of the fax “could not be acknowledged”, plant operators noted in a report a year later, leading to attempts to reach the town by landline, mobile, satellite phone and finally in person. The town had been devastated by the earthquake and tsunami that triggered the Fukushima crisis.The use of faxes at Fukushima — fax messages were also sent to notify officials in Tokyo of the unfolding disaster — is a reminder of the hardiness of an apparently outdated technology.Email may be faster, and cloud-based word-processing systems such as Google Docs better geared to collaboration, but the fax — short for facsimile — survives. It has adapted to the advent of email and has even found at least one new use.Why does the fax survive? The technology’s virtues for those businesses that continue to see a future in the fax is that it is cheap and relatively simple to use, according to a survey by research firm IDC. It is also regarded as more secure than an email for confidential data such as medical records.In an IDC poll of more than 1,000 businesses in the US last September, just over half said fax use in the past year had stayed constant while just under a fifth said it had gone up. Very few said they never used the technology.Peter Davidson, of Davidson Consulting, which researches the fax sector, notes that the ease with which people used to send a fax for, say, notifying someone when they would be back in the office has been transferred to email and text. “But when you send important documents, you want to know [they have] got there, which you can do with the fax. It is also extremely difficult to intercept a fax.” Unless, of course, the interceptor is physically standing next to a fax machine.The changing world of work
The workplace reflects how work and the people doing it are organised. FT writers this week consider four office items and what they tell us about the working environment today:
● personal photographs;
● faxes;
● the desk:
● and voicemailSiddhartha Bhattacharya, head of technology marketing at Xerox, notes that digital signatures in PDFs have been widely adopted, but are not always considered legitimate for contracts: “There are many companies that still require an actual signature on the dotted line.”The fax’s popularity in Japan is associated with the complexity of the writing system — making scanning a written image easier than typing — and the Japanese practice of sending guests a map with invitations.Many Japanese government and political offices still insist on receiving written communications by fax. The document is passed between officials, who may stamp or initial the paper to create a physical record of who has read it.The fax also lingers in Israel, a country associated with technological innovation. While business use of faxes has declined in Israel, government offices prefer faxes for transmitting documents. Shally Tshuva, a partner at consultancy Deloitte Israel and author of a report on the adoption of technology in the country, says: “There are two issues. It is partly to be sure that a document is authentic. The second is whether digitisation helps those who are already at the [socio-economic] high end, and widens gaps.”The perception among some in the Israeli public sector, he says, is that poorer social groups may be less adept at scanning and emailing documents, while even blue-collar workplaces such as garages will still have a fax machine.Faxes became ubiquitous in business life in the 1980s, but the technology has been in use since the early 20th century when Arthur Korn, a German physicist, first used telephone lines to relay images. The technology was quickly adopted by the military to transmit maps and weather charts, and by newspapers to send photographs.Xerox launched the first commercial fax machine in 1964, followed by other companies, and over the subsequent decades faxes became an essential business technology.More generally, however, the fax machine has been steadily supplanted by computers with internet connections. The UN’s telecoms body, the ITU, stopped gathering data about faxes in 2000 although it notes that “some countries have a regulatory or cultural mindset to better accept fax rather than emails.”As communications shift to faster technologies, there is a competitive cost to companies that continue to rely on physical paper trails. Deutsche Post DHL is overhauling the IT system at its freight forwarding division, where the DHL unit makes heavy use of paper because it grew by acquisition, which involved knitting to­gether companies with their own IT systems.Stephen Furlong, analyst at Davy, says that has affected its competitiveness with rivals, because making information flow efficiently is particularly crucial in decentralised businesses such as logistics: “The more efficient your information flow, the more you can cut costs and make the right decisions for customers.”As well as slowing the conduct of business compared with email, fax mach­ines can be irritating to operate. When they were in heavy use, they were a byword for frustration: a fax might not go through at the first at­tempt, the message might be blurred or faded. In 2002, a fuzzy fax was blamed for a crucial misunderstanding over an order for Germany’s Fuchs tanks by Israel.However, the internet has not entirely superseded the fax; in fact, it has created at least one new use for it, which is as a way of linking businesses with high and low technology. Customers placing an order on an online food delivery portal can have their message transmitted to a restaurant by fax. The faxed order can then be handed on physically to a delivery man who does not have a fax machine, and may not have a smartphone.On the one side there are the smart chaps in Berlin. And on the other are people who need delivery slips and bills on paperThe same logic applies to a big manufacturer dealing with multiple suppliers whose technology may use differing technology levels.Martin Hager, chief executive of Retarus, a Munich-based company that manages cloud-based communications services including faxes, says: “With a fax one doesn’t need to know who’s at the other end, or what technology they have. You just need a telephone number, and the document comes out the other side — whether as paper or as an entry into a computerised scanning system.”The use of faxes to bridge high and low tech is not new in itself — faxing lunch orders from an office to a local sandwich shop was familiar enough in the 1980s — but the combination of fax and the internet helps support the creation of new online marketplaces.As internet businesses increasingly set up in sectors such as domestic cleaning or laundry services, where there are differing levels of technology, the fax has been given a new lease of life.Customers can place orders on a smartphone, via businesses in Berlin or London, but those orders are often carried out by contractors who need faxed documents.“On the one side there are the smart chaps in Berlin,” says Mr Hager. “And on the other are people who need delivery slips and bills on paper.”"
65;XRX;Xerox Corp;2015-06-17T11:38:26Z;Let algorithms show if they can make better hiring choices;It is not just our biases that get in the way but that past performance cannot predict results;"We reported this week that top professional services firms in London, Scotland and the US practised widespread discrimination, shutting out recruits who did not belong to a select social and educational group.Some of the firms had made an effort to look beyond top universities. London law and accountancy practices had offered internships and mentoring to school and university students from less privileged backgrounds, according to the UK’s Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, which studied the situation in England and Scotland.But that did not significantly raise the number of trainee lawyers and accountants they hired from those groups. The problem was that, faced with a final set of potential recruits, too many interviewers opted for people with whom they felt comfortable.One called it the roommate test. “Are they someone you want to share a room with?” Another said: “I’m very interested in people who’ve gone travelling” — which, as the Social Mobility Commission pointed out, required money.Some firms said they did not have the time to search beyond the top universities, which had already selected the best students. “Number one people go to number one schools,” said one US lawyer, quoted in a book called Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs.An interviewer at a London law firm agreed that it was statistically highly probable that there were able recruits at non-elite universities, but asked: “How much mud do I have to sift through . . . to find that diamond?”But, even after dredging familiar waters, many of the firms did not seem happy with what they had found. The UK commission reported that many of the recruiters said the people they thought would be the best lawyers and accountants often did not end up having very successful careers.No one who has ever done any hiring should be surprised by this. My own record in appointing people is mixed: some worked out, others did not.It is not just our biases, unconscious or not, that get in the way. It is that people who succeed in one job do not necessarily thrive in the next one.This is particularly true when people move into management. Those who seemed decisive flounder when having to deal with so much more information. Some, who seemed adept at talking people round, become authoritarian and inflexible when, as bosses, they encounter opposition.As the investment advice says: past performance is no guarantee of future results.This is why, while I am sceptical about some of the claims of big data enthusiasts, I am prepared to give a hearing to those who say algorithms would make better hiring decisions than humans.Xerox Services teamed up with Evolv to help it recruit people for its call centres. Evolv used data on what made people leave their jobs to help Xerox reduce staff turnover.People who belonged to fewer social networks were more likely to settle down at work. Xerox found that staff attrition at some call centres fell by 20 per cent. Other findings accorded with mine: experience was no predictor of how a candidate would perform.The data-based process “actually opens up doors for people who would never have gotten to interview based on their CV”, Xerox said.Could it work for more senior jobs? Laszlo Bock, Google’s head of “people operations”, insists it could. You do it “by looking at large sets of data and inferring relationships, similarities, and predictors of success and failure”, he wrote in a LinkedIn post.Instead of looking for people with four years of accounting experience, you search for those with “ability to learn quantitative methods combined with a zeal for catching and correcting the smallest of errors, persuade with data, and thrive in social settings”, then use the data to tell you what sorts of people are likely to have that.I still see problems: interrogating the data still requires those fallible managers to understand and articulate what they are looking for.Also, humans are not aeroplanes or even driverless cars. Doing their jobs requires them to interact with other quirky unpredictable people.But let us see more experiments in data-driven recruitment and compare the outcome with what we have now. We can look at whether the results are any more impressive than our current flawed methods — and whether we uncover any hidden diamonds.michael.skapinker@ft.com

66;XRX;Xerox Corp;2014-12-19T22:37:59Z;Nike disappoints amid Fed-fuelled rally;Future orders fall short of expectations for sportswear group;Nike shares fell out of favour after future orders at the US sportswear group disappointed Wall Street, going against the trend in stronger overall US equities markets.Although future orders only just fell short of expectations, it was enough to hit a stock that has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 this year. The shares fell 2.3 per cent to $94.84, leaving their gain for the year at 20 per cent.Nike’s quarterly results, however, underlined why investors had chased the shares higher this year and were setting higher expectations. Profits climbed 23 per cent and revenues rose 15 per centThe slump in the oil price provided a boost for Carnival, the world’s biggest cruise operator.Shares rose almost 1 per cent to $44.79 as the company behind the eponymous brand, as well as Costa Cruises, said it expected its fuel bill to drop by $475m in its current financial year, which began at the start of the month.This was worth 61c a share in full-year profits, according to Carnival, which now forecasts will be between $2.30 and $2.60 a share. Wall Street was expecting $2.36, according to a poll by Bloomberg.Cheaper oil has contributed to a 30 per cent rally in Carnival shares since mid-October.Arnold Donald, chief executive, said the company had “worked hard to contain costs and achieved an almost 5 per cent reduction in fuel consumption for the year as we continue to implement energy conservation measures”.Carnival has been spending heavily on marketing to arrest setbacks that have damaged its reputation, most notably the Costa Concordia disaster off the Italian island of Giglio in 2012.The company said profits for the year to November 30 rose to $1.2bn, or $1.59 a share, from $1.1bn, or $1.39, in the year-ago quarter.Shares in Ally Financial surged more than 2 per cent to close at $23.25 after the US Treasury sold its remaining 54.9m shares at that price, against the previous closing price of $22.75 on Thursday.The sale will allow Ally to exit the troubled asset relief programme, which was put in place during the financial crisis.Xerox shares also received a fillip from news that the company had agreed to sell its information technology outsourcing arm to the French IT services company Atos SE for $1.05bn.Xerox shares rose as much as 2.2 per cent to $14.20 after the group said it would divest a slower-growing unit to focus on building up its business-process outsourcing and document outsourcing operations.The company has seen its market value rise from a low of $10.26 in February this year as it restructures.Overall, US equity markets extended their gains, after a surge over recent days in the S&P 500 benchmark index sparked by the US Federal Reserve’s latest policy statement.The S&P had climbed 4.5 per cent over the previous two sessions, lifted by the central bank’s commitment to take a “patient” approach towards raising interest rates, while signalling it was on track to boost rates in 2015, providing more certainty for investors.The S&P 500 index gained 0.5 per cent to 2,070.65 by the end of Friday’s session, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 17,804.80, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 4,765.38.
67;XRX;Xerox Corp;2014-11-28T15:52:39Z;Harriet Green and the dangers of the glass cliff;;Harriet Green, ex-chief executive of Thomas Cook, certainly broke through the glass ceiling on her way up to the top of corporate Britain. But was her abrupt departure from the travel group this week further evidence of the existence of a “glass cliff”, off which female CEOs are often said to plummet?Research by Strategy& (formerly Booz & Company) earlier in the year suggested female chief executives were more likely to be forced out of their roles than their male counterparts. The consultancy indicated that this might be because companies that wished to appoint a woman to the top job took more of a risk. The other reason cited for the disparity was that male-dominated boards might be less supportive of female chief executives.The “glass cliff” was a phrase coined some years earlier, in reference to the challenge assigned to women who take the helm at companies in crisis. Why do women find themselves in these precarious positions? Academics Susanne Bruckmüller and Nyla Branscombe ran experiments a few years ago that seemed to illustrate a “status quo bias” among people considering whether a woman or a man would be best placed to run a company. As they wrote in Harvard Business Review in 2011:As long as a company headed by men performs well, there’s no perceived need to change its pattern of male leadership. Only if male leaders have manoeuvred an organisation into trouble is a switch to a female leader preferred.Women leaders, according to the glass cliff theory, often seem set up to fail. I remember Jack Welch voicing his fear more than 10 years ago that if Patricia Russo, then at Lucent (later Alcatel-Lucent), Carly Fiorina, then at Hewlett-Packard, and Anne Mulcahy of Xerox did not overcome the challenges they had been handed, perceptions they had failed would set back the cause of senior women executives. In the end, of the three, only Ms Mulcahy succeeded in backing away from the slippery slope.The Bruckmüller-Branscombe description certainly fits Thomas Cook in 2012, when Ms Green was appointed. The company, previously led by men, was facing a cash crisis and the share price stood at less than 19p. But Ms Green’s subsequent trajectory as chief executive looks nothing like that of Ms Russo or Ms Fiorina – both of whom left when their companies’ share prices were struggling. Although Thomas Cook this week forecast more moderate growth, its shares were trading near 140p ahead of Ms Green’s exit. So far, we know only that the chairman says the board (for the record: three women, four men, excluding executive directors) agreed unanimously on Tuesday to enact a transition plan.Ms Green has proved a forthright promoter of her own image as a tough boss – notably in a colourful interview with The Times a month ago, conducted in part during an early-morning workout at the gym in Brown’s hotel. Perhaps the most surprising part of this week’s unexpected events is that, until Tuesday, she looked like the woman most likely to shatter the glass cliff utterly.
68;XRX;Xerox Corp;2014-07-09T20:14:20Z;Forget the CV, data decide careers;The human touch of job interviews is under threat from technology but can new techniques be applied to top-level recruitment?;"“I no longer look at somebody’s CV to determine if we will interview them or not,” declares Teri Morse, who oversees the recruitment of 30,000 people each year at Xerox Services. Instead, her team analyses personal data to determine the fate of job candidates.She is not alone. “Big data” and complex algorithms are increasingly taking decisions out of the hands of individual interviewers – a trend that has far-reaching consequences for job seekers and recruiters alike.The company whose name has become a synonym for photocopy has turned into one that helps others outsource everyday business processes, from accounting to human resources. It recently teamed up with Evolv, which uses data sets of past behaviour to predict everything from salesmanship to loyalty.For Xerox this means putting prospective candidates for the company’s 55,000 call-centre positions through a screening test that covers a wide range of questions. Evolv then lays separate data it has mined on what causes employees to leave their call-centre jobs over the candidates’ responses to predict which of them will stick around and which will further exacerbate the already high churn rate call centres tend to suffer.The results are surprising. Some are quirky: employees who are members of one or two social networks were found to stay in their job for longer than those who belonged to four or more social networks (Xerox recruitment drives at gaming conventions were subsequently cancelled). Some findings, however, were much more fundamental: prior work experience in a similar role was not found to be a predictor of success.“It actually opens up doors for people who would never have gotten to interview based on their CV,” says Ms Morse. Some managers initially questioned why new recruits were appearing without any prior relevant experience. As time went on, attrition rates in some call centres fell by 20 per cent and managers no longer quibbled. “I don’t know why this works,” admits Ms Morse, “I just know it works.”Organisations have long held large amounts of data. From financial accounts to staff time sheets, the movement from paper to computer made it easier to understand and analyse. As computing power increased exponentially, so did data storage. The floppy disk of the 1990s could store barely more than one megabyte of data; today a 16 gigabyte USB flash drive costs less than a fiver ($8).It is simple, then, to see how recruiters arrive at a point where crunching data could replace the human touch of job interviews. Research by NewVantage Partners, the technology consultants, found that 85 per cent of Fortune 1000 executives in 2013 had a big data initiative planned or in progress, with almost half using big data operationally.HR services provider Ceridian is one of many companies hoping to tap into the potential of big data for employers. “From an HR and recruitment perspective, big data enables you to analyse volumes of data that in the past were hard to access and understand,” explains David Woodward, chief product and innovation officer at Ceridian UK.Members of one or two social networks stayed in their job longer than those belonging to four or moreThis includes “applying the data you hold about your employees and how they’ve performed, to see the causal links between the characteristics of the hire that you took in versus those that stayed with you and became successful employees. Drawing those links can better inform your decisions in the hiring process.”Data sets need not rely on internal data, however.“Social media data now gives us the ability to ‘listen’ to the business,” says Zahir Ladhani, vice-president at IBM Smarter Workforce. “You can look at what customers are saying about your business, what employees are saying, and what you yourself are saying – cull all that data together and you can understand the impact.“Most recruitment organisations now use social media and job-site data,” says Mr Ladhani. “We looked at an organisation which had very specialised, very hard to find skill sets. When we analysed the data of the top performers in that job family, we found out that they all hung out at a very unique, niche social media site. Once we tapped into that database, boom!”Ceridian, too, has worked with companies to “effectively scan the internet to see what jobs are being posted through the various job boards, in what parts of the country,” says Mr Woodward. “If you’re looking to open a particular facility in a part of the country, for example, you’ll be able to see whether there’s already a high demand for particular types of skills.”Experts appear split on whether the specialisation required for executive recruitment lends itself to big data.“I hire 30,000 call-centre people on an annual basis – we don’t hire that many executives,” says Ms Morse, adding “there’s not enough volume”. However Mr Ladhani disagrees, believing that over time the data set an organisation holds on senior management hires would become statistically valid.As more companies start to analyse their employee data to make hiring decisions, could recruitment finally become more of a science than an art?“The potential is clearly much greater now than ever before to crunch very large volumes of data and draw conclusions from that which can make better decisions,” says Mr Woodward. “The methods and computing power being used in weather forecasting 10 years ago are now available to us all . . . who knows where this may go.”It is a trend worth considering – to get your next job, perfecting your CV could well be less important than having carefully considered the footprint you leave in cyberspace.——————————————-Case study: Demographic drilling down helps LV= recast recruitment adsKevin Hough, head of recruiting at insurance firm LV=, was a pioneer of ‘Big Data’ before he had heard the term.The insurer has 5,800 employees across 17 UK sites. A year ago, the question of where best to target its recruitment advertising provided an innovative answer. “We took all of the postcode data from our HR database – where our current staff live and where they are located – and split that by their [seniority]” explains Mr Hough. “Using software called Geo-Maps, which works similarly to Google Maps, we could zoom in and out of clusters of our people to see where they are willing to travel from to get to work.“On top of that we were able to overlay where people were applying from, taken from our recruitment data. The next iteration was where our Facebook and LinkedIn followers are from: the demographic of people following us, what interests them, the diversity and inclusion breakdowns, male and female and so on, on which social media platform.“We were able to build up a profile of who our successful candidate was, the age demographic, and where people were hunting for jobs. What was really interesting was the reach some of our advertising was having, and more importantly some of the gaps.”Recruitment advertising at LV= has subsequently been redesigned. The investment and expertise required to analyse the data were negligible, says Hough. “For Geo-Maps it was literally as basic as getting a licence for the software and uploading our data to it from a spreadsheet. Sometimes with all the clever systems that people have in organisations you can be blinded to the simple, raw data that is sat there.”Next, LV= will add performance review data.“The ongoing piece is to say of that group we recruited a year ago, which are still there? It helps to shape not only how we attract the people, but will even start to shape some of the roles themselves.”"
69;XRX;Xerox Corp;2014-03-11T18:25:52Z;Jardines’ influence in Asia quiet but widespread;;For such a storied company, Jardines’ influence is far quieter but far more widespread in Asia than most of its customers realise.Any Hong Kong resident will be familiar with the trading house’s main operations because of its intertwined history with the territory. But in Indonesia, a more recent conquest, the majority of customers will never have heard of Jardines – even though many will spend their days using its products and those of Astra, the big conglomerate that Jardines controls.A typical office worker in Jakarta might drive to work on an Astra-owned toll road in an Astra-manufactured Toyota Avanza, financed and insured by Astra.After using Astra-distributed Xerox and Fuji equipment at the office, a building that could very possibly be managed by Jardines-based Jakarta Land, the worker can take lunch at the Jardines’ owned Mandarin Oriental in the heart of the business district, paying with a credit card from Astra-backed Permata Bank.When the work day is done, the worker might well shop at one of Jardines retail outlets, whether it is convenience store Starmart, hypermarket Giant or pharmacy Guardian. Soon, Indonesians will also be able to pick up their flat-pack furniture at the country’s first Ikea store, which will be operated by Jardines.Hong Kong citizens, meanwhile, are used to the conglomerate’s businesses. Jardines’ best-known presence is formed by its Wellcome supermarkets. These, and main competitor the ParknShop chain owned by Li Ka-shing, hold a steady two-fifths of the market each. Jardines’ Mannings pharmacies compete against Hutchison’s Watsons chain, while its 7-Elevens operate in another virtual duopoly with a different tycoon family.Jardines also operates Hong Kong’s Ikea stores, where its habit of keeping its name at least one remove away has advantages. This year, Ikea’s Lufsig toy wolf became an unexpected sellout hit in the territory because Lufsig’s name in Chinese sounds rude. Discontented Hong Kong citizens then threw the toys at CY Leung, the territory’s chief executive, to protest at his government. The gesture was a double-pun since he has long been nicknamed the “wolf.” Ikea has since renamed the toy in the region.
70;XRX;Xerox Corp;2013-12-10T17:10:52Z;GM lifer Barra is ready to hit the open road;;Of two immediately obvious facts about Mary Barra, chief executive elect at General Motors, the more interesting is not that she is a woman but that she is a company “lifer”.To my mind, GM looks as though it is signalling that it has turned the corner following the trauma of government bailout, just as Citigroup did when it appointed career insider Michael Corbat as chief executive last year.Mrs Barra joined the carmaker at 18 and has worked her way through its manufacturing, engineering and executive departments to her current position as head of purchasing, product development and supply chain.Loyalty to a single employer is now the exception rather than the rule, with the likes of Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn actively (and self-interestedly) promoting the idea that executives should work a series of short term “tours of duty”. Cynics would say employee disloyalty to companies is only the flipside of companies’ evident lack of long-term commitment to staff. But I say hurrah for the likes of Mrs Barra (and not only because, like her, my first job was at my current employer and I stayed).Lifers can be a source of complacency, poor culture and “not invented here” negativism that is out of tune with the networked, collaborative, open environment that most modern companies try to cultivate. But they can also add dedication, deep expertise and vital corporate knowledge to the dynamism and energy that outsiders bring. Munich Re, Barclays and Tesco, for instance, are all led by men who joined their companies as trainees.Some research shows that, at CEO level, bringing an outsider on board pays off if the company is facing crisis and needs a new attitude (although there are exceptions to this rule, notably lifer Anne Mulcahy, who led Xerox out of the doldrums in the 2000s). Generally, a company that is stable benefits from the appointment of an insider – and if a board picks an insider, it often seems to be someone who has already proved they have the necessary qualities of experience and durability.So whether Ms Barra’s promotion will pay off depends in part on whether you believe GM really is now ready to hit the open road again. If it is, her combination of deep knowledge and staunch loyalty could make her just the right person to take the wheel.
71;XRX;Xerox Corp;2013-07-04T00:59:17Z;Father of the computer mouse Doug Engelbart dies at 88;Engelbart’s demonstration in 1968 went down in Silicon Valley folklore;Doug Engelbart, the inventor of the computer mouse and a technology visionary whose ideas helped to lay the foundations for today’s networked personal computing, has died at the age of 88.Besides the mouse and graphical user interface that are now standard on PCs, he carried out influential work on computer networking and hypertext to link documents – all ideas that he promoted long before the PC and the internet were even invented.Engelbart’s breakthrough moment came in 1968, with what has gone down in Silicon Valley folklore as one of the most dramatic live tech demonstrations ever conducted.Appearing before a large crowd at a San Francisco computer conference, he showed off a working version of a computer mouse that he used to manipulate icons on a screen, as well as methods of linking information between computers so that users could access and share ideas.At a time when human interaction with computers was still defined by punch cards fed into large mainframes, his practical demonstration revealed an almost complete vision of what would become commonplace some three decades later.Engelbart traced his inspiration to an essay by the inventor and scientist Vannevar Bush, which laid out a vision of a network of connected information that has been cited widely as one of the first expressions of the technological possibilities that later gave rise to the internet. He picked up Bush’s essay, titled “As we may think”, in Life magazine while on service in the US Navy in 1945.“I remember being thrilled,” he once said of the discovery. “Just the whole concept of helping people work and think that way just excited me.”Born in 1925, Engelbart’s college life was cut short by the second world war, which led to a period as a naval radar technician. He later credited his ideas for the graphical user interface to his experience with radar, which suggested new ways for presenting digital information.“I knew about screens,” he said, “and how you could use the electronics to shape symbols from any kind of information you had.”Engelbart went on to work as an aerospace engineer after the war before moving to SRI International, a Silicon Valley research institution, where he conducted the work for which he was to become best known.His breakthroughs in computer interface design while at SRI were picked by researchers at Xerox’s Palo Alto research centre. It was there that they were seen by Steve Jobs, inspiring the Apple co-founder to produce the Macintosh computer in 1984 that redefined the experience of personal computing.Engelbart is survived by his second wife, Karen O’Leary Engelbart, and four children from his first marriage.
72;XRX;Xerox Corp;2013-01-24T18:27:24Z;Xerox says shift to services is paying off;;Xerox shares rose more than 3 per cent after the provider of printers and business services reported an 11 per cent slide in fourth-quarter earnings but said it had a good deal pipeline for the next year.Ursula Burns, chief executive, said that the “shift to a services-led growth portfolio is paying off”.Xerox has sought to transform itself into a services-focused company as digital commerce and communication threaten its traditional core business of photocopiers and printing.Alongside selling document systems, supplies, technical service and financing of products, Xerox also processes student loan payments, Medicaid claims and parking tickets.The company plans to spend up to $500m on acquisitions in 2013, largely centred on the services sector, up from $276m in 2012.“Throughout 2012, we focused on scaling our services business and adjusting our business model to align with growth opportunities in the $600bn market we serve,” said Ms Burns. “Our fourth-quarter results reflect steady progress.”Net income attributable to Xerox declined to $335m in the three months to December 31 from $375m in the same quarter a year ago. Diluted earnings per share held steady at 26 cents.Excluding items such as amortisation, earnings were 30 cents per share, down from 33 cents. In November, Xerox said it expected adjusted earnings of 28 cents to 30 cents.For the first quarter of 2013, the company forecast adjusted earnings of 23 cents to 25 cents a share, in line with expectations, and maintained its full-year earnings outlook.Revenues for the quarter fell 1 per cent to $5.9bn, slightly beating forecasts of $5.88bn. Shares rose 3.4 per cent by midday in New York trading to $7.84.Revenue from Xerox’s services division grew 6.6 per cent to $3.05bn. Operating margin in this segment drove up overall margin improvement in the fourth quarter 30 basis points to 10.3 per cent, which analysts said also led to share price gains.But Dylan Cathers, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said the company still faced major road blocks that would hamper revenue growth.“My biggest worry is that there is a lot of competition out there and Xerox does not have the firepower to compete with bigger names such as IBM, Accenture and many Indian outsourcers who are becoming more aggressive,” said Mr Cathers.“Also, just because there is a deal pipeline, doesn’t mean the company will be able to close those deals. Due to the economic climate, it is taking a lot longer for companies to sign off on contracts,” he added.Sales from the technology business dropped 8 per cent to $2.5bn. Since the financial crisis, the company has come under pressure as businesses and governments pulled back on spending in order to cut costs. But, the company said it expects to see a softening of this decline in equipment sales in 2013.“The company’s transition will be a multiyear process,” said James Kelleher, analyst at Argus Research, before the earnings release.“Xerox is still tied to the copying business, where we will continue to see declines in revenue. But at some point this will stabilise. Only when this happens will you see the market start to be positive on the stock,” he added.
73;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-12-04T23:05:39Z;US tech companies hit downbeat tone;;A string of disappointing earnings guidance has left the technology sector among the worst-performing industry groups on the S&P 500 this quarter.The S&P 500 information technology index has lost 6.4 per cent since the final quarter started, compared with a 2.3 per cent decline for the broader benchmark over the same period.Having briefly ranked as the best-performing sector earlier this year, IT stocks have hit their current low mark as a result of slowing global growth, particularly in Europe and China, which has prompted downbeat earnings guidance from a number of high-profile companies.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said: “Concerns about economic activity not being as robust as many had anticipated from China and Europe have weighed on the sector.”The poor performance has been underpinned by weakness in Apple shares, the world’s largest company by market value and the heaviest-weighted US equity on the S&P 500. The iPhone and iPad maker in October published an outlook that fell well below market forecasts and its shares have declined 13.7 per cent in the quarter.Apple now faces its first year-on-year decline in earnings per share since the second quarter of 2003, according to Bloomberg data.Other household names to have issued negative guidance for the quarter include Ebay, Juniper Networks, Texas Instruments and Xerox. Of the 32 technology companies to provide guidance so far for this quarter, 29 have said earnings per share will fall below forecasts, according to FactSet.At present, that represents the highest level of pessimism for the sector’s quarterly earnings since the market research company began tracking the data six years ago.“Many technology stocks that investors focus on have really turned into large-cap mature companies,” said Oliver Pursche, portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services.“That’s a very different picture to what investors typically think about tech companies,” he added, citing large dividend payouts from Apple and Intel.One notable exception has been Cisco, the US network equipment maker and a harbinger of economic activity, which hailed a recovery in US demand and issued a surprisingly upbeat outlook in its latest results.The poor guidance comes ahead of what is usually a strong part of the year for many technology companies as holiday shopping moves into full swing, according to Colin Gillis, tech analyst at BGC Partners.“Management always has an incentive to be conservative when issuing guidance, but given the turmoil in Europe and slow growth in the US it’s worth paying attention to what they are saying,” he said.
74;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-11-13T18:48:04Z;Budget issues weigh on Wall Street;Investors concerned fiscal cliff will not be averted;Home Depot, the largest US home improvement retailer by revenues, reported third-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations as consumers spent more on home repairs amid signs of recovery emerged in the US housing market.The company’s revenues rose 4.6 per cent to $18.1bn as a rebound in the construction of new homes and improving consumer sentiment helped drive purchases. Shares in the retailer added 3.6 per cent to $63.38 and gained more than 50 per cent year to date.Analysts at Citi Research reiterated their “buy” rating and said: “We see a clear organic runway through market share gains and capitalising on improving trends while maintaining expense discipline.“Furthermore, the company is signalling its belief in the business through more aggressive share buybacks and investments in technology enhancements.”Homebuilders initially benefited from Home Depot’s positive outlook but by the end of the trading reversed gains and closed lower.Shares in DR Horton initially rose but closed 0.7 per cent lower at $19.25. The biggest US homebuilder by annual closings reported better than expected quarterly profit after market close on Monday. Net sales rose 21 per cent on low mortgage rates and falling inventories. PulteGroup shares also rose initially, but reversed gains to close 0.5 per cent lower at $16.17.Overall, US equities failed to hang on to modest gains and closed down near multi-month lows.Caution and fear took over, as the negotiations over the budget deal and the looming fiscal cliff, weighed on investor sentiment.“Markets are looking for good news or optimism that the fiscal cliff will be averted,” said Channing Smith, equity strategist at Capital Advisors.“However, most investors fear that might not be the case. They are also overwhelmingly trying to lock in profits, as they believe that taxes on capital gains and dividends will rise now that Barack Obama has been re-elected as president,” Mr Smith added.The S&P 500 index started the trading day lower but reversed losses and traded most of the day in positive territory, but selling during the last hour brought the index down. The benchmark closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,376.05.The index also breached a psychologically significant level, falling below its 200-day moving average. Most technical analysts believe that would lead to further downward trend.Technology and financials sectors were leading the losses, while utilities and consumer discretionary stocks managed to retain modest gains.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index edged down 0.7 per cent to 2,883.89.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, fluctuated throughout the day but closed fractionally lower at $542.59. The stock is still more than 20 per cent below its peak reached in mid-September.Microsoft shares lost 3 per cent to $27.10 after Monday’s news that Steven Sinofsky, the head of Windows, had abruptly left the company after 23 years at Microsoft. Mr Sinofsky oversaw the launch of the Windows 8 software but has been criticised for his abrasive management style. He will be replaced by Julie Larson-Green.Analysts at Nomura remained positive about the stock and retained their “buy” rating saying they did not “think the move is a reflection on the success of Windows 8 one month after its release”.Shares in Google fell 1.1 per cent to $658.83, while Oracle lost 1 per cent to $29.99.Cisco Systems closed virtually flat, but stock prices jumped 6.8 per cent to $18.00 in after-hours trading after the company reported solid earnings and surprised Wall Street analysts.Among financials, JPMorgan shares sold off, down 1.3 per cent to $40.04, while Wells Fargo lost 1.5 per cent to $32.02.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent to 12,756.18.MetroPCS jumped as high as 3 per cent but pared gain to trade 1.1 per cent higher to $10.16 amid high volumes. The stock is also one of the most heavily shorted on the S&P 500 index and Tuesday’s jump may be due to covering of a large short position.Among energy companies, Southwestern Energy Company saw its shares rise 3.4 per cent to $35.10.In other earnings news, TJX, which operates discount apparel retail stores such as TJMaxx and Marshalls, reported third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and raised its full-year profit guidance. Shares in the retailer rose 2.7 per cent to $42.06.Xerox shares rose 1.4 per cent to $6.42 after the provider of printers and business services announced a dividend increase and an additional $1bn boost to its share buyback programme at the company’s investor conference. The company lowered its outlook for the current quarter after determining a $100m restructuring charge.
75;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-10-23T19:22:14Z;US results raise fresh fears for economy;;US companies have warned of weaker global demand and are cutting jobs, raising fresh fears about the health of the world economy and sending shares tumbling.DuPont, Xerox, UPS and 3M were among the companies that warned of difficult trading conditions, including faltering demand in some Asian markets and Europe’s continuing crisis.Ursula Burns, chief executive of Xerox, said the printing and business services company had been hit by “widespread economic uncertainty, especially in the United States”, and warned: “Economic challenges will continue putting additional pressure on the business.”Scott Davis, chief executive of UPS, said the freight company was operating in “an environment of slowing global trade”.Dow Chemical, the US chemicals group, said after the market close it was cutting 2,400 jobs, 5 per cent of its global workforce, and shutting 20 plants to save $500m per year, and cutting capital spending by a further $500m.It identified seven larger plants being closed: four in Europe, two in the US and one in Japan.Andrew Liveris, Dow’s chief executive, said: “We are operating in a slow-growth environment in the near-term”.Signs of further difficulties in the global outlook are a blow to President Barack Obama’s attempt to show that the US economy is on an improving trend. With only two weeks before the US election, the health of the US economy remains at the centre of the campaign.US equities fell sharply on Tuesday, with investors alarmed by the downbeat reports.The S&P 500 initially dropped 1.8 per cent, pressed by companies in the materials, energy and financials sectors. The index later clawed back some ground to be down 1.4 per cent by the close.The recent losses in the US stock market benchmark have wiped out its gains since the Federal Reserve, which ends a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, launched a third round of bond purchases last month.US corporate earnings have so far been in line with forecasts that quarterly profits and revenues will fall for the first time since 2009.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said: “I give more weight to fundamentals than liquidity from the Fed. The fact that we are seeing a 2 per cent drop in profits for the first time since 2009 . . . represents a directional change in the market.”DuPont, the largest US chemical group by market capitalisation swung into loss at its continuing operations for the third quarter, and warned of weaker-than-expected demand for some products. It suffered a particularly sharp drop in sales in the Asia-Pacific region, where volumes dropped 10 per cent and prices fell 5 per cent from the equivalent period of 2011.It also plans job losses, cutting 1,500 worldwide to improve productivity.Other companies also highlighted the impact of the slowdown in China, particularly on businesses reliant on construction and infrastructure spending. Inge Thulin, chief executive of 3M, told analysts: “In China, the year clearly has not played out the way most anticipated.”DuPont closed down 9 per cent, Xerox down 5 per cent, and Dow and 3M down 4 per cent. However, UPS reported relatively strong results in spite of the difficult economic conditions, and its shares closed up 3 per cent.The poor US results, together with weak data out of Spain, also weighed on European equities for a third day in a row. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index of the region’s biggest stocks fell 1.66 per cent, the CAC 40 dropped 2.22 per cent and Xetra Dax ended 2.1 per cent lower.Spain’s 10-year bonds were trading up 13 basis points at 5.62 per cent, while equivalent Italian debt was trading 10bp higher at 4.86 per cent as news of a further contraction in the Spanish economy, worries about its budget deficit target and a ratings downgrade by Moody’s of the debt of five the country’s regions knocked sentiment.Marchel Alexandrovich, European financial economist at Jefferies, said markets were focusing on the fact that a workout of the eurozone was predicated on growth and Spain at some point asking for a bailout.
76;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-10-23T15:36:04Z;Xerox hit by weak global spending;;Xerox reported a more than 12 per cent decline in third-quarter profits and again cut its earnings outlook after the provider of printers and business services said companies and governments pulled back on spending amid global economic uncertainty.The Connecticut-based company reported a profit of $282m, or 21 cents a share, down from $320m, or 22 cents, a year earlier.Adjusting for items such as amortisation, earnings were 25 cents per share, in line with expectations, down from 26 cents. In July, it forecast adjusted earnings of 24 to 26 cents per share.Weak European economic conditions have hampered Xerox’s equipment sales in the continent as businesses have become more prudent with their spending. State and local governments in the US also tightened their pursestrings in the last quarter.Xerox lowered its earnings outlook for the year and now forecasts $1.07 to $1.09 a share in adjusted profit, down from its prior estimate of $1.07 to $1.12.The company announced a restructuring charge of $50m to $100m for the fourth quarter but excluded the amount from its earnings outlook until plans are finalised.Shares in the company closed down 5.1 per cent to $6.67.“We began the year knowing we would face certain challenges, especially as the European economies came under significant pressure . . . However, we did not predict the incremental strains on the business from more worldwide, widespread economic uncertainty, especially in the US,” said Ursula Burns, chairman and chief executive officer on an earnings call.“During the third quarter we experienced a much more constrained spending environment in the US . . . due to budget constraints, less funding is available for major government projects,” said Ms Burns.Alongside selling document systems, supplies, technical service and financing of products, Xerox also services student loans, processes Medicaid claims and parking tickets.Xerox has been working to transform itself into a services-focused company as digital commerce and communication continued to pose a threat to the company’s traditional core business of photocopiers and printing. The company has come under acute pressure in recent years as businesses and governments have streamlined operations in order to cut costs.Revenues fell 3 per cent to $5.42bn from the same period last year, falling short of analysts’ expectations of $5.49bn.Revenue from service, outsourcing and rentals increased 1 per cent to $3.73bn, while sales from its technology business dropped 12 per cent to $1.54bn.In 2009, Xerox acquired Affiliated Computer Services, which set in motion the company’s push away from printing. Earlier this year the company also bought Lateral Data, a software provider to law firms, for $30m and agreed to acquire WDS, a UK-based provider of technical support and consulting to wireless telecoms companies.While Xerox has invested heavily in the shift away from its technology business it is having trouble changing the focus of its brand, which is best known for its office copiers and printers.“Xerox is damned by its own name. It’s unfortunate,” said James Kelleher, technology analyst at Argus Research ahead of the earnings. “Their brand is so iconic. But it is in the midst of a significant transformation.”“Their technology business will have another couple of tough quarters as hardware spending by businesses is still weak. While we might get more momentum on the services side, it’s a very low-margin business. This is not looking like a blowout quarter and the company is a tough sell to investors,” Mr Kelleher added.

My colleagues and I are currently in California, US on our international field seminar. I am writing this blog while on board our bus taking us from Palo Alto to San Francisco.Every year ESMT organises an international field seminar for its students as part of the MBA programme. While the previous MBA class went to California and China, this year the destinations are California and Turkey/Russia. The field trip is to give us first-hand experience of how businesses are being managed and also to familiarise ourselves with the ground-breaking ideas in business which are shaping our world.So far we have spent a week at Palo Alto where we visited companies like Asset Management Ventures, Tesla Motors, Bloom Energy, IDEO, Xerox PARC and Mozilla. These companies have given us a candid exposure into their business models, strategies and prospects. As a Ghanaian who is conscious of the challenges of the developing world, I was particularly excited to know how a non-combustible and sustainable energy developed by Bloom Energy is already helping to conserve energy.I have been motivated by the role of the private sector in development as almost all of the Silicon Valley successes have been nursed and grown by individuals working with a robust private equity sector.At this stage what I call the lessons from Silicon Valley include:Getting to know the city has also been a lot of fun for us, and I am certainly looking forward to the next few days in San Francisco.
78;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Lexmark cuts 1,700 jobs and quits inkjets;;Lexmark International, the US printer maker, on Tuesday said it would stop making inkjet printers and cut around 1,700 jobs, or around 13 per cent of its workforce.The move, which is expected to result in annual savings of $95m, comes as Lexmark faces falling demand for its consumer-oriented inkjet printers. Revenues at the inkjet printer business fell 66 per cent in the first half of this year, forcing the company to cut its full-year forecasts last month. The company had already cut 625 employees in its consumer supplies manufacturing business earlier this year.Lexmark, which plans to focus on selling more sophisticated laser printers and software, said it was exploring the sale of its inkjet technologies. It will also close its plant in Cebu in the Philippines, by 2015. Around 1,100 of the jobs being eliminated are in manufacturing.Lexmark is one of a number of printer companies struggling with declining demand. Xerox and Canon both cut their profit forecasts in July, citing concerns about tightening European consumer spending. HP reported a 23 per cent drop in printer sales last week.Lexmark has been diversifying away from basic printer equipment with a number of acquisitions, including the purchase of Perceptive Software, which provides workflow and document management software, in 2010. The company bought Brainware, Isys and Nolij earlier this year to bolster the Perceptive Software unit.“Today’s announcement represents difficult decisions, which are necessary to drive improved profitability and significant savings,” said Paul Rooke, Lexmark chairman and chief executive officer.“Our investments are focused on higher value imaging and software solutions, and we believe the synergies between imaging and the emerging software elements of our business will continue to drive growth across the organization.”Lexmark, which employees around 13,300 people, said it would take a pre-tax charge of $160m related to the restructuring, with $110m of this falling into the current financial year.The company said it would by back $100m worth of shares in the second half of the year, in line with its aim of returning 50 per cent of its free cash flows to shareholders.

Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

The stock has declined 16 per cent this year.In the second quarter, net income attributable to Xerox was $309m, or 22 cents a share, down from $319m. Excluding items such as amortisation, adjusted earnings were 26 cents for the three months to June 30, in line with analysts’ expectations. In April it had forecast earnings of 25 to 28 cents.Xerox has been working to transform itself into a services-focused company as digital commerce and communication continued to pose a threat to the company’s traditional core business of photocopiers and printing.In 2009 Xerox acquired Affiliated Computer Services, which set in motion the company’s push away from printing. This month the group bought Lateral Data, a software provider to law firms, for $30m and agreed to acquire WDS, a UK-based provider of technical support and consulting to wireless telecoms companies.Revenue from the company’s services business was up 7 per cent in constant currency.“With more than half our total revenue coming from services, accelerating growth in this segment of our business is a priority,” said Ursula Burns, Xerox chairman and chief executive officer.“Our second-quarter results reflect solid progress with 8 per cent growth from business process outsourcing, 9 per cent growth from IT outsourcing and 6 per cent growth in document outsourcing, all at constant currency.”However, the continued weak macroeconomic environment, particularly in Europe, resulted in a 4 per cent decline in the company’s technology revenue, which includes the sale of document systems, supplies, technical service and financing of products, the company said.Total revenues fell to $5.54bn, down from $5.61bn in the same period last year and missing analysts’ $5.59bn forecast.Operating margins fell to 9.7 per cent from 10.4 per cent.James Kelleher, senior analyst at Argus Research said the printing business is cyclical, exposing Xerox to headwinds from a bad global economy. But as it shifted more of its business model into services, there would be a greater stability in its operating margins.

She is one of the few senior women working in Silicon Valley, as vice-president of solutions at Mindjet, an IT company.Ms Wohltman grew up in Missouri and studied philosophy at Yale University. She has had a long career in IT, having worked for Xerox, Webex and Genius.com.In her spare time, she enjoys tennis, white-water canoeing, stand-up paddle boarding and watching films.Ms Wohltman will be available to answer your questions in a live web chat on Thursday, 28 June 2012, between 12.00 and 13.00 BST. Post your questions now to ask@ft.com and they will be answered on the day.1. Who are your business heroes?The business leader I admire most is Anne Mulcahy, former chief executive of Xerox. When I worked in Xerox’s internet group, the group reported directly to Anne (before she became chief executive) and I was fortunate enough to get to spend time with her, both in business and social settings. She is a remarkably effective leader who knows how to set priorities and establish high standards, without displaying any ego or temper. She was a coach and mentor to many women (and men), showing a genuine interest in the people who worked for her.2. Why did you choose to do an MBA?Having studied philosophy in college, I had very little knowledge of the business world in general and absolutely no understanding of economics, finance or strategic analysis. Once I decided to pursue a career in business, I had to go to business school.3. What is the best piece of advice given to you by a teacher?One of my first professors in business school at UCLA, Sam Culbert, told me that I would be both miserable and a failure if I tried to alter my personality or hide who I was in order to fit in the business world.4. What is your biggest lesson learnt?Don’t shy away from being assertive. I think many women are raised to be polite at the expense of being direct. Being direct doesn’t make you a bitch. It makes you effective. You can show respect for people and still be direct.5. What would you do if you were dean of a business school for the day?I might do something different, like invite some artists in to talk about how they approach their work. I guess this is similar to attending a TED conference or watching their videos, which give you a chance to learn from people who are doing something completely different. Undergraduate and graduate business programmes are so competitive and I think one comes away with a sense that working harder is always the answer. It’s not. Just grinding away is not a recipe for success – being open to new perspectives, talking to people about their ideas and giving yourself time to think, is more likely to help you be more successful in the long run.6. Who is your ideal professor?I think Martin Scorsese would be a wonderful professor, because he’s so passionate about what he does and, from what I can tell, he loves sharing his knowledge. He’s a tremendous student of film and film-making and I love the way he talks about movies – he’s so animated and entertaining.7. What is the last book you read?The last business book is Consumption Economics: The New Rules of Tech by J. B. Wood, Todd Hewlin and Thomas Lan, which I’m reading now. It deals with the dramatic effect that cloud computing is having on business models. Since Mindjet delivers work management solutions across platforms, including mobile and the cloud, I’m finding it very relevant. For fun, I just read Olen Steinhauer’s An American Spy. I love spy stories and detective stories.8. Have you even been to any workshops/seminars that have helped you in your career?When I was just starting at Mindjet, our chief executive arranged an offsite with a guy who teaches at Stanford and who is also a career coach. He led us through exercises that really helped us function better as an executive team. I tend to be dubious about anything that seems remotely touchy-feely, so I had very low expectations, but the exercises we did were pretty practical and fed very naturally into our strategic planning process, so I was impressed.9. What is the worst job you have ever had?One summer during high school, the only short-term work I could find was delivering telephone books. The route I was given was dominated by four-storey apartment buildings with no elevators, meaning that I had to go up and down stairs all day long lugging phone books. It was great exercise, but a pretty awful job.10. What advice would you give to women in business education?My advice for both women and men is to find what interests you, not what you think will make you the most money. I got this advice from a friend who was a few years older than I was and who had become a very successful investment banker. She was on the fast track and making a ton of money, but, over time, she became completely disenchanted because she had never been interested in the first place. She ended up leaving banking and founding a Montessori school in Ontario, where she’s really happy.Compiled by Charlotte Clarke
82;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-05-29T13:44:31Z;UK groups lag behind in adding services;;"Xerox has enjoyed such success in making copiers that the company’s name has become a verb. Yet when the US group filed its first-quarter results last month, it was not printers and copiers that were driving revenues; for the first time, Xerox’s services accounted for more than half of sales.Instead of focusing on selling clients as many printers as possible, Xerox now seeks to help customers manage their entire printing operations and the associated costs as efficiently as possible.“All our printers are connected to our service delivery centre, and we have developed software which allows us to monitor what our customers are doing, orchestrate the delivery of supplies, tell the customer how to reconfigure their equipment in order to save costs, and so on,” says Andy Jones, director of Xerox’s European outsourcing operations.For manufacturers, such a strategy of selling not just products but also services tightly linked to them offers significant benefits. It provides an extra revenue stream, as well as a closer relationship with customers, which, in turn, can make it harder for rivals to steal business.The British government in 2010 set boosting manufacturers’ exports of advanced services as a priority and some British manufacturers are already ahead in this: Spectris, which specialises in making precision instruments, has added a second string to its bow by signing contracts to use its creations to monitor the noise caused by aircraft at Heathrow and the vibrations resulting from work on the Crossrail project in London.Rolls Royce, in addition to making aircraft engines, rents them out to airlines and guarantees their functioning under its Total Care programme. The group already garners just over half its revenues from services.Yet beyond such stand-out examples, argues Tim Baines, professor of operations strategy at Aston business school, too few British manufacturers are adopting this approach.In the US, according to research by Barclays, 55 per cent of manufacturers offer services as well as products; in Britain, it is less than 30 per cent. Prof Baines says that among smaller companies, the figure is lower still.The reason, suggests Stephen Bird, chief executive of Vitec Group, which provides equipment and services to the broadcasting, entertainment and photographic industries, is the difficulty in changing the mindset of an organisation from one focused on products to one that also sells services.“Manufacturing companies are often run by people with an engineering background who are brilliant at designing products, but don’t necessarily have the skills to look at the broader model,” he says.Mr Jones agrees. A consequence of Xerox’s new strategy was that it sold its clients fewer products: some big industrial customers went from having 50,000 to 22,000 Xerox-made devices. “That was counter-intuitive for a business built on selling more and more products,” he says.No less counter-intuitive was the realisation that, since it was offering to take complete responsibility for its customers’ printing needs, Xerox would have to support printing devices made by its rivals.“That was a difficult internal transition. But you have to change your mindset and start thinking about the long-term opportunity,” says Mr Jones, pointing out that as old devices supplied by rivals wore out, Xerox was able to replace them with machines of its own.There are certainly risks for manufacturing companies that venture on to the turf of their service-peddling rivals. “Everything is different,” says Mr Jones. “The business model, the financial measurement of performance, the levers you use to control the business, the way risk is shared in contracts.”On such unfamiliar terrain, it is easy for manufacturers to slip up. “If you get it wrong and deliver a bad service, you’re toast,” says Des Evans, chief executive of the UK subsidiary of the German truckmaker MAN, which in addition to making trucks provides its customers with a variety of fleet management services.Yet, Professor Baines argues that manufacturers retain some advantages in competing with service companies to provide services linked to their products.When a product breaks down and needs repairing, he argues, services companies are good at getting it fixed and returning it, and can probably do so faster than the manufacturer. But, he points out, the manufacturer can re-engineer the part so that when it comes back, it does not break again.Despite the risks, in some cases, argues Mr Evans, manufacturers have no choice but to branch out into services if they want to survive.“If you look at what has happened in trucking: ERS, Ford, Foden – they focused too much on the product and not enough on the service. And as a result, they’re out of the game,” he says."
83;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-03-08T22:35:10Z;US corporate bond sales rise to $39.1bn;;A flood of corporate bond sales showed no sign of abating on Thursday as companies rushed to sell dollar-denominated debt in what is shaping as the busiest week for investment-grade issuance in three years.Hewlett-Packard, Mississippi Power and Century­Link – an internet, television and voice services provider – were among investment-grade companies that sold debt this week, pushing total issuance to $39.1bn as of Thursday.That is the highest weekly level since companies sold $42.9bn of debt in the week of March 9 2009 and the fourth-biggest week on record for US investment-grade, according to data tracker Dealogic.The calendar continued to build on Thursday, with at least eight investment-grade companies, including Continental Airlines, Xerox Corp and Consolidated Edison, pricing more than $6bn of deals.“We’ve seen the floodgates open for new issues. Looking ahead, can we keep this pace? Probably not, and we may see a slowdown in the next couple of quarters, but this is still shaping up as a strong year for debt sales,” said Adrian Miller, senior vice-president for global markets strategy at GMP Securities.Low corporate borrowing costs in the US and the relative safety of the dollar had attracted foreign issuers to the US capital markets, analysts said.Of this week’s deals, more than 20 per cent came from issuers that were not domiciled in the US, according to Dealogic.“There’s been a lot of demand also for the US dollar. A growing number of European companies, which have traditionally relied on European banks for financing, is turning to the US markets,” said Mr Miller.Amid the heavier supply, average spreads, or risk premiums, on investment grade bonds have widened only to 186 basis points on Wednesday, from 180bp at the end of last week, a Barclays Capital Index showed.Spreads are still much narrower on the year after ending 2011 at 234bp.Average yields, which last week touched a low of 3.27 per cent, have risen to 3.33 per cent this week.“The surprising thing is not that you are seeing strong issuance when corporate yields are at or near all-time lows,” said Matt Toms, head of public fixed income investments at ING Investment Management.“The thing that has surprised people has been the consistent demand from people looking for yield that is more attractive than US Treasuries.”Yields on US Treasuries are hovering near historic lows.Investment grade issuance has dominated the week with companies selling $7.4bn of junk bonds so far in the US. The biggest week this year for junk bonds came when issuance totalled $15bn in the last week of January.

They are alleged to have passed sensitive information to five other defendants, who used it to place trades through Mitesh Shah, another defendant. He worked as a broker at Finspreads, a spread betting company now called City Index, the court was told.The seven men all deny insider dealing charges relating to six stocks, including Reuters and Biffa Group.Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Ali Mustafa worked in the printroom of UBS, while Ersin Mustafa was site operations manager in the confidential printroom of JPMorgan Cazenove, both operated by outside company Xerox.He told the court that the brothers “got hold of confidential information and passed it out to the other defendants, which could then use it for spread betting”, adding that they cannot have had “the slightest doubt what they were doing was wrong”.The prosecution say the information was disseminated to Truptesh Patel; Pardip Saini; Paresh Shah, who is the brother-in-law of Bijal Shah, another defendant; and Neten Shah, the uncle of Bijal, who were all day traders in stocks.The court was also told that there were “very substantial links” between the trading defendants through various family links and friendships. The court heard that Ersin Mustafa also knew Pardip Saini as he was a customer of his health supplements business.The jury heard of the role allegedly played by £120,000 a year broker Mitesh Shah, head of the Asian desk at Finspreads. Mr Bowes told the court, “we say Mitesh Shah was the watchdog who didn’t bark”. He “was in on it”, the prosecutor alleged, saying he used a mobile phone to circumvent the company rule that all phone calls be recorded.The court was also shown an email sent by Mitesh Shah to another defendant in which the broker discussed buying a new mobile phone, writing that he was “just a little worried on this mobile”.“Why would be getting a little worried on that mobile if he was an honest broker just doing his job?” Mr Bowes told the jury.The court was told that there was no allegation whatsoever that anyone at either of the two investment banks did anything wrong.The jury was also told that Ersin Mustafa was not before the court and so they did not have to return a verdict on him. “You must not speculate upon the reason for his absence and must not treat his absence as any support for the prosecution case,” Mr Bowes told the jury.The trial continues."
85;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-02-13T18:55:50Z;Fixation on gender quotas is a distraction;Point to the benefits of fielding a diverse team;"Gender fatigue is the secret lassitude that grips chief executives and directors when asked for the Nth time to discuss targets, quotas, audits and reports aimed at bringing more women into the boardroom.As this month’s first anniversary of the publication of Lord Davies’s report setting gender targets for UK companies approaches, businesses can expect a new assault.But endlessly batting the board quota question back and forth distracts companies from the scarcity of women in their executive ranks.It is time for advocates for change to get beyond the pros and cons of quotas, and appeal to the part of the brain that should be immune to tiredness: the part that wants the business to go on growing.First, as the global quest for the best people intensifies, remind companies that it makes sense to fish in the deepest and widest pool of possible candidates. A more balanced management team is better placed to pitch to a broader range of customers. “Why would you exclude the third-largest market in the world [behind China and India]?” asks Beth Brooke, global vice-chair of Ernst & Young, which is one of several businesses backing The Third Billion, a campaign to harness the economic power of women.Second, point boards to the research by Catalyst, the US-based group, and others that shows corporate performance and productivity improve as the diversity of the leadership team increases.Third, win over sceptics with new evidence that groups of people with varied backgrounds and outlooks are also more innovative. That is one finding from the first stage of a study due later this year from the Centre for Talent Innovation (which recently changed its name from the Centre for Work-Life Policy, to reflect the strong business case for better balance). It suggests a more varied team “contributes significantly to the generation of ideas”. But at later stages, when more homogeneous groups have to endorse, develop and deploy those ideas, these innovations often “wither on the vine”.Reshaping a management team to reap these advantages is hard.
To sponsor rising female managers, for example, requires a far greater investment of leaders’ time and effort than merely to mentor them. Sponsors stake their reputations on the performance of the women they back – not to mention, in the case of male sponsors, risking the unsavoury gossip that such a commitment can still provoke. It looks far simpler to get headhunters to track down female candidates for the next non-executive vacancy.Arguing for legislative intervention at last week’s summit of British, Nordic and Baltic prime ministers in Sweden – which addressed the gender issue – Rannveig Rist, general manager of Rio Tinto Alcan’s Iceland plant, stated it was “not sufficient to steer ‘gently’ in the right direction”.I like the sentiment but I think the threat of quotas on its own can be a potent weapon against complacency. The risk of taking gender equality for granted is evident from the US experience. With its prominent female chief executives, from Xerox’s Ursula Burns to Kraft’s Irene Rosenfeld, the country looks to be a model. In fact, the recent evidence tells a surprising cautionary tale of stagnation and drift. According to Catalyst, the proportion of Fortune 500 board seats held by women is only edging upwards. More worrying, the percentage of female corporate officers, which nearly doubled to 16.4 per cent between 1995 and 2005, has fallen since then.But board quotas are a blunt instrument. They respond to only one measure of gender imbalance and offer only one solution – and a divisive one at that. Even female chief executives disagree about whether the unintended consequences of legislation (resentment about tokenism, female directors spread too thinly, and so on) outweigh the benefits. That’s not surprising: I would no more expect businesswomen to be unanimous about how to encourage balance in the boardroom than I would expect them to speak as one on the best way to organise their supply chains.So when the gender question next comes up at a board meeting, set the non-executive quota discussion to one side for a moment. Instead, wipe that glazed look off weary directors’ faces by underlining the real and proved business benefits of fielding a more diverse executive team: new markets, new people and new ideas.andrew.hill@ft.com"
86;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-01-30T19:25:24Z;Tech powers and a harsh lesson in survival;;"From troubled BlackBerry maker Research In Motion to fading internet power Yahoo and the bankrupt Eastman Kodak, the business headlines this year have told a familiar story: the fortunes of once-dominant technology powers can fade with unnerving severity.Disruptive shifts in technology platforms and business models have become an unpleasant fact of life for tech companies and their investors alike. As Facebook gears up to make its regulatory filing as early as Wednesday that will set its initial public offering in train, the latest batch of troubles is a sombre reminder that the longevity of a seemingly entrenched business is far from assured.Yet the shortening life cycles of tech powers are not inevitable. As companies as different as Apple and IBM have shown, it is possible to come back from the brink of irrelevance. Microsoft, frequently written off as a relic of the fading PC age, has also been laying the groundwork for a broader repositioning of its business, though its success is still unproven.Given the sort of rapid shifts that can afflict technology companies, being alert to the danger is the first and most important quality needed for survival. That makes RIM, once comfortable in its role as the pioneer of mobile email, Exhibit A in corporate denial.Asked about the threat to BlackBerry from the launch of the iPhone, the Canadian company’s leaders brushed aside any danger, points out Rita McGrath, an associate professor at Columbia Business School. By the time they saw the need to overhaul their own product line up – a move that eventually forced them into an acquisition to purchase a suitable new mobile software platform – it was too late.RIM has fallen foul of some of the biggest forces to shape technology markets. One is the “consumerisation” that has turned parts of the once slow-moving corporate technology business into fashion-driven markets demanding new skills. RIM hardly believed that its BlackBerry users, tied to their corporate email systems, would so quickly cut the tie.Another is the winner-takes-all nature of technology platform shifts that can quickly leave former industry leaders out in the cold. With software developers switching their attention to the new Apple and Google mobile software platforms, RIM now faces an uphill battle in putting itself back at the centre of the mobile technology ecosystem.Even when they do succeed in identifying the mortal threat posed by a future technological disruption, however, it has proved remarkably hard for many tech concerns to adapt.“The evolving digital technologies had been obvious to us since the late 70s,” says Larry Matteson, a former Kodak executive who was once in charge of 23,000 people in the company’s manufacturing division. That foresight didn’t prevent a long slide that resulted in a filing for bankruptcy protection earlier this month.Kodak played it by the management text book: it identified its sustainable competitive advantages and sought to use these as a basis for diversification into new markets that would make up for an expected erosion of its film business.Those strengths, according to Mr Matteson, now a professor at the Simon Graduate School of Business at the University of Rochester, included a powerful research and development base, particularly a world-leading position in organic chemistry; a specialist manufacturing capability learnt in the film business; and one of the top global consumer brands.Kodak followed the logic of this analysis into markets as diverse as blood tests, photocopying and pharmaceuticals, with the acquisition of drug company Sterling. None proved to be the foundation for a big new business and all were later spun off.This sequence of failures points to two of the main lessons from failed attempts by tech companies to adapt.One is that it is not enough to dabble in new technologies. “Innovation needs to be treated as material and systematic, not an on-again-off-again process,” says Columbia Business School’s Ms McGrath. The vested interests inside corporations arrayed against disruptive change can be powerful.Sony, for instance, has struggled to overcome the entrenched interests of its powerful product divisions, leaving it vulnerable to the sort of disruptive new products that often cross internal corporate boundaries, like the combination of Apple’s iPod and iTunes store.Despite often being the product of recent innovative thinking, tech companies may be worse suited to the challenge than other types of company, Ms McGrath adds. The hubris from their success is still strong, and they often lack broad management skills. “When the engineers are in power, it’s easy to find that non-engineering suitable problems are not addressed,” she says.The other lesson is that strategic choices still count. Simply trying to change course and copy a disruptive new technology is often the wrong path to take. IBM, seeing the threat to its mainframe computing business from the rise of the “client-server” era, threw its full corporate weight behind the PC business in the early-1980s. Yet it was only IBM’s eventual decision to retreat from PCs that signalled it had learnt the strategic lesson: to stick to its high-margin IT business with the addition of software and services.Kodak made a similar strategic mistake. Two decades ago, seeking a new direction, it brought in a rising star from Motorola, George Fisher, to help lead a move into digital cameras.“They were thinking about taking a business with 60-80 per cent [profit] margins and going into consumer electronics, where 5 per cent is pretty good,” says University of Rochester’s Mr Matteson.Failing to make a go of it in digital photography, Kodak compounded its error by switching course into another challenging market: ink-jet printers. That has left it struggling against the likes of Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark and Canon, which dominates the consumer market.IBM and Xerox, by contrast, turned in their moment of crisis to their core businesses, looking for ways to reinforce their value to their customers by enhancing what they had always done best.“Too many companies focus on their products and not what the products are solving for the customer,” says Ms McGrath. “Xerox finally figured out that customers don’t want copies, they want workflows that allow them to get the right information to the right place for the right reasons, cost-effectively.”As Steve Jobs proved after returning to a near-bankrupt Apple in 1997, stripping away failed product strategies of the past and finding new ways to excite customers is the surest way to revival.For other executives struggling against the apparent inevitability of tech-company decline, it is a high mark to match."
87;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-01-27T19:55:33Z;Eurozone: playing the blame game;Companies are falling over to blame the eurozone for weak results;Companies the world over are falling over themselves to blame the eurozone for weaker than expected results. This week, German industrial Siemens said full-year targets would be harder to achieve because of the debt crisis in Europe. Xerox also reported “significantly impacted” European revenues and its shares fell 10 per cent. On Friday, Procter & Gamble wrote down the value of its appliances and salon professional businesses mostly due to the “prolonged deterioration in the macro environment”, particularly across Europe.Investors should be sceptical of this blame game. After all, how often do managers say they were taken by surprise by the strength in the emerging markets? Never – lucky success stories were always predicted and skilfully executed. Companies cannot have it both ways though. Plenty of people were worried about Europe a long time ago.Then there is the question of how “it’s not our fault” events should be treated in the books. P&G, for example, was quick to label the $1.5bn writedown as “non-core” and remind shareholders that the charge was “non-cash” from an accounting perspective. But is an economic slowdown really a non-core event for a company that sells consumer products? And while writing down goodwill is technically a non-cash item in the current period, the truth is that in retrospect P&G paid too much over the book values for Gillette and Wella when it originally bought them. It was real cash then.Certainly, there are times when investors should adjust earnings for genuine shocks when trying to estimate the value of a company. A natural disaster or a rare product recall are two such occasions. But for truly global companies (P&G generated a fifth of its sales from western Europe in 2011), the ebbs and flows of global economic growth are as core as it gets.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

In the US, giants Apple and McDonald’s turned in strong performances with the former doubling its profits to $17bn and the latter benefiting from robust international growth. In the media sector, both Time Warner and Netflix recorded better than expected subscriber numbers while Xerox took a more conservative view aimed at slow but steady growth.

Swiss drugmaker Roche launched a $5.7bn hostile offer for the US’ Illumina while one of Europe’s major steelmakers, ThyssenKrupp, confirmed it talks to merge one of its divisions with Finland’s Outokumpu. Also in the industrial sector, German bellwether Siemens reported worrying first-quarter results while Airbus-owner EADS reshuffled its top management, but remains beholden to its Franco-German political masters. Elsewhere two shrunken Scandinavian goliaths – Nokia and Ericsson – have their work cut out for them after recent poor performance.In Asia, the Chinese were celebrating the arrival of the Year of the Dragon, so the action shifted to Japan, where both Nintendo and Toyota are suffering from the strong yen. The video game company tripled its estimates for full-year losses to Y65bn while things are finally starting to look up for the carmaker after a string of bad luck. As the weekend begins, the spotlight will swing back to the great and the good in a small Alpine town.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
89;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-01-25T22:14:34Z;Fed boost puts S&P 500 in bull market;FOMC meetings leads to afternoon rally;The S&P 500 closed Wednesday in bull market territory after climbing 0.9 per cent to 1,326.06, a gain of 20.6 per cent since the close on October 3.The market had opened lower as Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, added to pressure on the European Central Bank to take a hit on its Greek bond holdings. But it pared losses later when the Federal Open Market Committee said interest rates would stay low until late 2014, longer than previously stated.That triggered a 15 point afternoon rally for the benchmark index, but analysts were cautious about both the FOMC meeting and prospects for the bull market.“It’s clear the make-up of the Fed board has become more dovish and it will do what it can to inoculate the US economy from global problems,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial. “On the other hand, the Fed is acknowledging that US growth will be substandard, which can’t be good for equities.”Apple had earlier briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as shares surged following Tuesday’s blockbuster results.Shares closed up 6.2 per cent at $446.66, having hit an all-time high of $454.45 at the open.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to gain 1.1 per cent to 2,818.31, and triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.Qualcomm, which manufactures microchips used in the iPhone 4S, climbed 0.6 per cent to $59.00, as analysts at JPMorgan said: “Apple’s very strong numbers give us more confidence that Qualcomm should report strong numbers and guide well in its earnings report next Wednesday.”Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, climbed 3.1 per cent to $6.73, despite opening sharply lower after cutting full-year guidance. But Nvidia, which hopes to supply the next generation of Macs, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.85 after reducing fourth-quarter sales projections.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,758.85, lagging other indicesGoldman Sachs fell 0.5 per cent to $108.31, and Morgan Stanley was off 0.1 per cent to $18.12, as JPMorgan analysts said a new method for calculating risk requirements, without reference to rating agencies, could reduce Goldman’s 2012 tier one capital ratio by 1.2 percentage points and Morgan Stanley’s by 0.8 percentage points.“Yet another US investment bank disadvantage,” JPMorgan said and removed “buy” recommendations on both banks.Illumina climbed 46.3 per cent to $55.15 as Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, launched a hostile bid for the diagnostics company. Roche has offered $44.50 a share in cash, but investors appear to believe Illumina will hold out for a higher price.Airlines advanced after Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group both beat projections by analysts. Delta was up 6.2 per cent to $9.96, and US Airways added 17.3 per cent to $7.52.Yahoo slipped 0.8 per cent to $15.56 despite reporting results in line with expectations. Scott Thompson, the internet portal’s chief executive, laid out new strategic plans but remained tight-lipped over plans for a sale.Boeing opened sharply lower after disappointing analysts with its 2012 forecast. But the stock closed up 0.6 per cent to $75.82.Quarterly earnings reports propelled several large moves in the S&P 500. Textron surged 14.5 per cent to $24.76 for the best performance in the index after forecasting higher 2012 profit than analysts expected, amid growing demand for its Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.CA Inc climbed 9.6 per cent to $25.02 as the software developer easily beat analyst expectations.Xerox fell 9.9 per cent to $7.81 as it said fourth-quarter and full-year earnings could be well below analyst expectations, with slow global growth expected to hit demand for printers.Corning shed 10.7 per cent to $13.05 as the world’s largest maker of glass for flat-panel televisions saw quarterly earnings halve as LCD display prices sank.With almost a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalisation reported, companies have so far produced the lowest earnings beat-rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, with revenue gains outpacing profit increases, as margins are squeezed.“The V-shaped recovery in corporate profits seems to be at an end,” warned Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.In after-hours trading, shares in Netflix surged 10 per cent to as much as $108.00, after the DVD delivery and web streaming company reported earnings that beat expectations.
90;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-01-25T20:25:13Z;Xerox: slow grower fails to excite;Until the economy provides a boost shares are likely to remain boring;Xerox can no longer be described as a copier company but most of the various services it provides have one feature in common with making copies: tedium. Xerox’s expansion into business process and technology services has made it a specialist in the ennui-inducing functions that corporations cannot be bothered to do themselves – from document management to IT support to human resources to benefits administration.One might think that, in a volatile and skittish world, a company that efficiently performs dull but essential tasks would be a pretty popular investment. Xerox’s share price says different. It has lost half its value in the past five years and fell by a 10th on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and presented conservative targets for 2012, including revenue growth of just 1-2 per cent, even including the impact of several small acquisitions.The whipping may look a bit severe, considering Xerox’s operational and financial profile. It is a slow grower but should be steady. The great majority of its sales are from recurring sources. And the fact that it is more domestically focused than many peer companies suddenly seems like an advantage as the US recovery outpaces that of other developed nations.At less than $8, the shares look very cheap, with a muscular free cash flow yield of 15 per cent. The company is paying down debt and buying back shares.But there is a certain level of expansion that a company must maintain to attract even value-minded investors. Xerox’s sluggish top line has forced it to bring expectations for free cash flow generation down. Heavy pension contributions, forced by low interest rates, are not helping returns either. Until the economy provides a boost to growth, the shares of the boredom company are unlikely to cause much excitement.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
91;XRX;Xerox Corp;2012-01-25T18:28:56Z;Xerox reduces guidance on European weakness;Shares fall as company reduces guidance;Shares in Xerox tumbled on Wednesday after the the office copier and printing company reduced its guidance for 2012 because of economic weakness in Europe.It reported flat total revenues of $5.96bn – just shy of analysts’ estimates of $6.08bn – but revised lower its earnings per share, operating cash flow and revenue growth targets for the next year as a result of economic uncertainty and restructuring costs.Xerox shares fell more than 10 per cent in early trading and were off 9.9 per cent at $7.81 by market close in New York.Ursula Burns, Xerox chairman and chief executive officer, acknowledged the “challenging economic environment” but said the services business was performing well.She said: “Installs of Xerox equipment increased 8 per cent in the fourth quarter. And our managed print services are proving not only to be the industry standard, but also an engine of growth for our business.“Signings for our diverse services offerings were up 15 per cent in the fourth quarter”.Growth in the Connecticut-based company’s services business, which includes IT outsourcing and business processing, offset a loss in its technology unit, which was hit by a fall in demand for supplies and technical services.Total revenues in its services unit rose 6 per cent year-on-year to $2.86bn, while its technology business experienced a 5 per cent decline to $2.71bn.Adjusted earnings per share were 33 cents, up 14 per cent compared with the same quarter of the previous year. The company said it aimed to post adjusted earnings per share in a range of 21-24 cents in the first quarter of 2012.Hendi Susanto, analyst at Gabelli & Co, said: “This quarterly result is at the lower end of the guidance, and the 2012 outlook too has been revised lower, driving the share price down.“Delayed purchasing decisions because of negativity in Europe, unfavourable currency fluctuations and ongoing pension expenses are all challenges the company faces”.“Xerox’s revenue growth target for 2012 is now 2 per cent, before it was 4 to 6 per cent. Operating cash flow guidance is between $2bn and $2.3bn versus prior guidance of $2.3bn to 2.6bn. Earnings per share for 2012 is now expected at between $1.12 and $1.18 cents compared to prior guidance in the range of $1.18 to $1.28”.
92;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-12-21T19:14:05Z;Oracle: big issue;Expectations must be trimmed for all business technology vendors;Stock market bulls have argued in recent years that, while spending by indebted consumers and governments is likely to remain sickly, big companies, which are enjoying record profitability and strong balance sheets, are in rude health and will spend to grow further. The 14 per cent fall in Oracle’s shares early on Wednesday after its weak earnings report suggests that this particular stool’s one good leg is becoming wobbly.Oracle sells more software to big companies across industries and geographies than anyone else. In the past quarter, new software licence revenues grew just 2 per cent, a 10th of the rate of a year ago. It appears that those robust global companies are feeling a bit cautious. The pressing issue is what this means for the earnings of other big business technology vendors. These fit into two camps: the slow-growing value plays, and innovative growth plays (Oracle falls between the two).Consider a representative sample of the former – IBM, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, SAP, Dell and Xerox. Analysts expect near-term sales growth in the 3 per cent to 4 per cent range on average. Even this may be a bit optimistic, but the reason to own these stocks is their cash generation and low valuations more than their revenue trajectory. For the latter group – EMC, VMware, Salesforce.com, NetApp – the outlook is for strong double-digit growth. If the slowdown reaches cutting-edge parts of data storage, virtualisation and cloud computing, look out.Oracle is not a perfect bellwether. Last week’s results from technology services leader Accenture were solid. Business technology spending has not simply stopped. But Oracle’s results are unsettling, not just for other technology companies but for companies and investors who have hitched their financial wagons to the fortunes of the world’s largest companies.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
93;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-12-07T23:33:18Z;The right fit for doing a deal;;"Ursula Burns, chief executive of Xerox, called the company’s chief financial officer from a Manhattan street in August 2009: “I said: ‘I don’t want your opinion about whether it’s a good move or not; I first want your opinion about whether it’s possible.’ And he called me back and said: ‘It’s possible. We can figure out a way to do it. And, by the way, I think it’s a great deal’.”Ms Burns was about to commit Xerox to what, even by the debased standards of mergers and acquisitions rhetoric, would be a transformational deal. The mooted acquisition of outsourcer Affiliated Computer Services would add 74,000 staff to Xerox’s 54,000 and treble the revenues of its services business to nearly $10bn, equal to the company’s core business of selling, leasing and servicing high-end copiers and printers. Compared with the companies the group had acquired to date, ACS – worth $6.5bn, plus debt – was a giant.“Every night, we’d say: ‘OK, are we moving forward or not?’ And most nights we thought we weren’t going to get the deal done,” Ms Burns says. “We’d go to bed going, ‘oh my God, what the hell did we do?’, because something else bad [had] happened.”Ms Burns, who started at Xerox as an intern, had taken over from Anne Mulcahy as chief executive six weeks earlier. Her fear of failure was understandable and familiar to every executive or director who has ever authorised a big bid. Despite growing academic evidence that companies are getting better at takeovers – and that acquirers outperform non-acquirers – M&A disasters haunt the boardroom.Ten years after the merger of America Online and Time Warner, Jerry Levin, the latter’s former chief executive, apologised for “the worst deal of the century”. Similar cultural misunderstandings have blighted Alcatel-Lucent, which is still recovering from the 2005 US-French merger that cost the jobs of its chief executive and chairman in 2008. Ben Verwaayen, who took over as CEO, says the corporate spirit is now “we can win”, but that when he joined it was “we need to fight internally”. The UK’s G4S recently withdrew a £5.2bn agreed bid for ISS of Denmark after investors balked at the strategic departure.“There isn’t a deal where an element of hubris hasn’t come into play,” says Scott Moeller, director of the M&A Research Centre at London’s Cass Business School. The risk of over-reach, he adds, can be mitigated by meticulous planning: “Proper integration can’t take place without superior due diligence.”Integration of the Xerox-ACS transaction, which completed in February 2010, is a work in progress, but it highlights the sorts of issues dealmaking chief executives should consider.Ms Burns says a number of factors gave her confidence that Xerox was well placed to take on ACS. Her company had come close to collapse in 2000 but had emerged stronger under Ms Mulcahy. Ms Burns had already thought through Xerox’s identity and concluded that “our line of business was not only copying or document management: it was business process transformation” – ACS’s bread and butter. While others discussed the mechanics of the deal, the Xerox chief assessed ACS for “fit and fitness”.ACS knew all about processes – from mortgage applications to insurance claims – and Xerox had the brand, global reach and research and development expertise. But Ms Burns remembers thinking: “They do business A, we do business B. They are from Texas and Salt Lake City . . . we’re from the north-east. We speak north-eastern; they speak middle [America], Bible belt. It’s a cultural disaster if you can’t figure out a way to manage this where both sides actually keep the things that are important to them.” There were similar fears at ACS that Xerox might stifle its entrepreneurial spirit.Pre-deal due diligence may seem obvious but potential gaps between merging companies are often addressed too late. Three-quarters of senior executives surveyed recently by the consultancy McKinsey said they understood their own cultural strengths and weaknesses, but less than half analysed them in the context of specific deals.Ms Burns says she sought to answer key questions about the way ACS worked. For instance, like her and Ms Mulcahy, Lynn Blodgett, ACS chief executive, was a “lifer” in the business. Two key parts of ACS were run by women, an important signal for Ms Burns – the first African-American woman to run a big publicly listed US company – that ACS shared Xerox’s “love of difference”. She judged its culture to be closer to Xerox’s than it seemed at first glance.Ms Burns notes that the alignment of the two companies was more important than the letter of the contract she was about to sign. “If we have to run the business by looking at a [legal] agreement, I’d better have 50,000 accountants and a million lawyers,” she says.Still, the deal received a tepid reception from the market when it was announced in September 2009. Many had not heard of ACS (some “thought we were buying the American Cancer Society”, says Ms Burns).Tom Blodgett, Lynn’s brother and head of ACS operations in Europe, says that had Ms Burns said “ ‘we’re going to smash these [companies] together’, that would have been a disaster”. Instead, ACS has kept its name, but will take on the Xerox brand in 2012.Ms Burns saw part of her role as keeping staff focused: “Don’t get paralysed about things like how is research going to be organised when you’re in the processing centre. It’s not for you to worry about,” she says.Cross-pollination of the two companies is yielding new initiatives. Some Xerox “multi-function machines” – ACS staff have learnt not to call them copiers – feature a “live key” that allows, say, credit card applications to be scanned into the ACS system rather than be sent by mail. Ms Burns is hitting targets, though some analysts worry higher services revenues will not offset short-term economic pressure on the old core business.The chief executive has also made a point of listening and communicating to staff what she knows about the reorganisation – and what she does not. “This may not work . . . and so the next time you see me I may be out of work – which will not be good,” she says, in what seems a rare moment of self-doubt. But she adds, with the quiet certainty of someone who has done her homework: “I’m very confident it will work.”"
94;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-11-21T00:00:36Z;Push to help women find the keys to the C-suite;;"Enrolling on an MBA programme, particularly at an elite school, is for some the equivalent of taking an elevator to the executive suite. While the majority of Fortune 500 company chief executives do not hold MBAs, a significant 35 per cent do.If you want to see more women in the boardroom, you could do worse than ensure that higher proportions study for an MBA, one argument goes.Cagla Bekbolet, of Egon Zehnder International, the executive search firm, says: “I don’t think I’ve ever been asked whether a candidate has an MBA or not.” However, that does not mean the MBA is not an asset on the resumé.“It gives me confidence in a candidate’s intellectual curiosity and rigour,” she says. While there are more men than women on board shortlists she adds, there does not appear to be any gender difference proportionately in those with MBAs.The MBA remains a “badge of eligibility for top roles”, says Moira Benigson of London-based executive search firm MBS Group. She is handling an assignment to recruit a European chief executive for a US group, run by a woman with a Stanford MBA who is “incredibly disappointed by the level of what she calls ‘the smarts’. Now we’ve had to realign the brief, so that they have to have an MBA from a great school,” she says.How do you get more women on to corporate boards? This is a question that divides both sexes, writes Adam Palin.While men appear largely sceptical about the introduction of a legally binding quota aimed at increasing the number of females in boardrooms, women view the suggestion more favourably, according to a recent Financial Times survey.A poll of more than 700 European business school alumni – 475 men and 242 women – working in Europe, was conducted by the Financial Times in October.The survey revealed that almost half (47 per cent) of women believe the European Union should introduce legislative quotas.Only 19 per cent of men however agreed, with approximately half (49 per cent) describing the potential impact to businesses as negative.Further reading and poll resultsThe number of women chief executives of Fortune 500 groups will, assuming no unforeseen changes, hit a record 18 in January. Of those who lead the US’s largest groups – seven Fortune 100 companies are run by women – five have MBAs: Meg Whitman, president and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard (Harvard); Lynn Elsenhans, chairman, CEO and president of Sunoco, (Harvard); Irene Rosenfeld, chairman and CEO of Kraft Foods (Cornell); Indra Nooyi, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo (Yale); and Ellen Kullman, chair and CEO of DuPont (Kellogg).When, earlier this year, London Business School set a diversity target for its MBA programme, it did so in the belief that diversity in the boardroom starts at business school. “We are committed to seeing more women in business and when we looked at ways of achieving that, we thought ensuring our own MBA student intake was 30 per cent female could be one way of doing it,” says Diane Morgan, associate dean of degree programmes. Female participation in the school’s MBA had stalled at about 28 per cent. By setting a target, extending application deadlines and focusing on countries such as Russia and Japan, where the number of female applicants had been historically low, that has risen to 31.4 per cent this year.However, the proportion of women enrolling on MBA courses globally is still under a third and has remained at this level for the past eight years.Ms Benigson says: “MBAs have the edge. It’s not just the teaching but also to do with your peer group – it gives you incredible access if you’ve been to a top school. It’s a very, very good club to join. It is still very male-dominated, but that is changing.”The Financial Times’ ranking of top 50 women in business includes 12 MBA alumni (24 per cent), clearly below the average for Fortune 500 chief executives. Of these, six are from US universities, four from Indian business schools and two from European schools. The majority (52 per cent) of women in the elite ranking have postgraduate qualifications.These data reveal that some nationalities are more MBA-focused than others. Top US and Indian female chief executives are far more likely to have an MBA than their European or non-Indian Asian counterparts. Almost all Indian chief executives in the ranking, whether or not now located in India, hold MBAs.I felt MBAs were for people who didn’t really know what they wanted to doThe list includes six women who started and built up the enterprises they lead. They are all in Asia and none has an MBA. Like some of the Fortune 500 high-tech entrepreneurs – Oracle’s Lawrence Ellison, Michael Dell, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, visionary college dropouts all – they tend not to have studied for advanced business degrees. That may change with the growing focus on entrepreneurship in business schools.Some women chief executives completed masters and doctorates in disciplines other than management. For example, Ursula Burns, chief executive of Xerox, decided against an MBA in favour of a masters in mechanical engineering.“I joined Xerox as an engineer in a research lab and I was ambitious to be a very good engineer, hands-on, analytical, running experiments. I didn’t know about corporate structures and treasurers and CEOs, but I did know about chief engineers.”Women who qualified as accountants or lawyers do not generally have MBAs: others got into a fast-paced career and never looked back. Maggie Wilderotter, chief executive of Frontier Communications, is one. “I felt MBAs were for people who didn’t really know what they wanted to do, or felt they didn’t have opportunity where they were and they needed this to boost them to the next level.”But women chief executives who did invest in an MBA place high value on the experience. “Not only did it give me very good foundation skills in all disciplines of business …it also taught me how to solve problems,” says Nancy McKinstry, CEO of Wolters Kluwer. “To this day I take a very analytical approach.”"

96;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-11-15T12:36:34Z;4. Ursula Burns;Ursula Burns is as close as you can get to a celebrity chief executive;"Company: XeroxLast year’s position: 6Age: 53Nationality: AmericanSector: Electronic equipmentLocation: USUrsula Burns is as close as you can get to a celebrity chief executive. She is the first African-American woman to lead a Standard & Poor’s 100 company and, at least by postcode, from the wrong side of the tracks. But Burns is not really interested in all the brouhaha. “My gender and my race – they are what I am. They are not special or unique to me,” she says. “It’s Xerox [that has allowed] someone different from the main to get here.”Burns keeps her feet on the ground: “If I allowed myself to get crazy I wouldn’t do normal things, but I ride the subway, I take the bus in New York City.”Burns’s childhood has been well documented. She was raised by a single mother, “a low-income person with a very firm set of beliefs”, who managed to send her to a fee-paying, all-girls Catholic school in a neighbourhood that “was not very safe [and] not very clean”. However, Burns says that once you got through the door of her Baruch housing development home in lower Manhattan, “it was a fairly normal house”.Growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, racism came with the territory. “I was in the north, so we didn’t have segregated bathrooms, but [it was] very clear that blacks were treated very differently from whites, and poor blacks were treated differently from regular blacks; women, across the board, were not considered,” she says. “We had three things going against us – [being] poor, black and women.”Against all the odds, Burns went on to study mechanical engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, and, as she puts it, “the rest is history”. As a student, Burns was keen to start earning, but a GEM bursary (which promotes underrepresented groups in post-graduate science and engineering education) allowed her to get her masters from Columbia University.Her first work experience was with the company she now runs. “When I walked in the door as an intern, I was fairly outspoken, [with] strong opinions – sometimes wrong and strong. I had the look and banter of someone from New York City,” she says.“Today, I still speak as fast as hell and have very distinct views about how the world should go and grow. I don’t play golf. I like certain kinds of music. I dress and look a certain way.”She never experienced pressure to fit in. “I was never told: ‘In order for you to do A, you must change B.’ They never asked me to compromise on things that were too hard to change, because they made me the person I was,” she says.Burns says the reason she stayed put at Xerox was that she “never got bored. I never stayed in a job longer than I could learn it and improve it, I never got stuck anywhere”. By fast-tracking her career around the group with spells in the UK and Japan, she “worked in lots of different companies” while never actually leaving the business.She now encourages her staff to be as direct as she is. “People would say all the time, ‘I knew this wouldn’t work’. And I would say, ‘Well, if you knew this wouldn’t work, then why didn’t you say so?’ If you know things, you should take a stand.” A tendency for reticence in corporate life is not something she values. “I think it’s easy to be quiet, and I can’t imagine why we would reward that,” she says.Xerox has had to transform itself from supplying copiers to providing a business process and document management service. “We have assets in innovation, we have an asset in a global reach, we have assets in some great people and we have a brand that’s just amazing. We are really good at process and difficult problems,” Burns says by way of explaining the decision to buy Affiliated Computer Services, the world’s largest diversified business process outsourcing company, for $6.4bn in 2010.“It was a huge decision because it was a big company and you had to finance it. But it wasn’t a huge decision in the sense that the fit meant we could make better music if we were together,” she explains.On the question of diversity, Burns is optimistic: “There will be more women; we’re lining up.”She believes that women “need a little help from society”; that men and spouses have to comprehend that there will be times when “you are going to pay a little more attention to your children than your competition”.“Men are not always nice to women when they are few,” she says, adding that this must change. But, she warns, “It’s not going to take five minutes to fix.”"
97;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-11-11T13:40:59Z;Kenya to India: exporting the mobile money model;;"At a leafy Nairobi private members club that so delights in a bygone era it bans telephones, Michael Joseph, former chief executive of Safaricom, is telling his well-to-do audience they don’t understand mobile money.“Our target market was actually the guy standing outside there waiting to serve you dinner or drinks…we didn’t aim for you,” says the current strategy advisor to the World Bank and Vodafone. The UK company owns 40 per cent of Safaricom, the telephone company that launched a mobile money transfer service so successful it speedily took over Kenya’s economy and business school syllabuses worldwide.Kenyans pay school fees, collect their salaries, shop for groceries, buy everything from drinks in beer shacks to airline tickets thanks to mobile money, sending transfers at the push of a few buttons on a mobile telephone. Some of the audience pays its workers by M-PESA, named after the Swahili for money (pesa). If Joseph has his way, Kenyans will also soon insure themselves on a grand scale against ill-health, for funeral costs, make savings and take out loans.Since it launched in 2007, the service has garnered 15.1m customers. At peak times, there are 200 transactions every second and the equivalent to 20 per cent of the country’s GDP washes through the system.“This thing grew like topsy, it’s an incredible growth curve,” says Joseph.The company is so dominant, with about 80 per cent of the mobile market, that as Joseph points out, even those who rely on rival schemes still deploy “M-PESA” as a verb akin to Xerox or Fedex.But replicating Safaricom’s success has long proved beyond reach. Since the UK’s aid agency gave a £1m grant in 2006 to try to facilitate microfinance payments, which led to the birth of the service, none of the other 120 or so copycat mobile money platforms has performed as well. Only the Philippines comes close, with about 3m customers, while Tanzania may yet overcome a sluggish start.When it started, Joseph says M-PESA was never intended to make a profit, only to increase customer loyalty, but within two years it was profitable and today it provides 16 per cent of Safaricom revenues, saving this week’s deeply disappointing half-year results from an even worse performance.No longer Safaricom CEO, Joseph’s new day job is convincing regulators across the world to open up to mobile money.While he has no truck with South Africa for its tardy take-up, Joseph thinks India will take off. “India will probably be the next big place,” he says, after the regulator visited Kenya and altered its policies. “It will dwarf anything, if they get it right, that we have in Kenya.”In a variant on the Kenyan model, the Indian mobile money will have to partner with a bank, meaning customers might even make interest from the money they store. In Kenya, 12-15bn shillings are stored on M-PESA systems at any one time, but Safaricom is not allowed to make a profit on the interest and neither is the customer. Instead, interest earnings go into a charitable M-PESA foundation. Any attempt to change this is likely to spook banks, which have in the past attempted to close down M-PESA.Central banks outside Kenya have been wary of giving way to mobile money, fearful that too much money will circulate outside their control, of the negative impact it might have on the banking system and of the risk of fraud. Safaricom has already sacked 2 per cent of its workforce for fraud this year, and last month Kenyan prisons agreed to jam prison network coverage because inmates have proved all too cunning at innovating mobile money scams along the lines of “whoops I just sent you $2,000 by mistake, please send it back to me soonest”. Even so, Joseph says fraud within M-PESA is a twentieth of that within the banking system.In Kenya, he says success is down to two crucial factors: his own determination to push it through when he was Safaricom chief and a distribution network of 32,000 agents nationwide.“My role was to make it happen. I just said you have to do it, and if you don’t do it I’ll fire you,” he says, adding not entirely convincingly that he didn’t mean it. M-PESA agents were also branded, trained and uniformed. “You can’t just have some scummy little store…we have to pretend to be like banks. Banks pretend that they’re very rich by having this very super nice hall with marble and columns and all this stuff, so you think they’re rich, so they won’t steal your money; as you know it’s an illusion,” he jibes. “Unless you put the agent out there it doesn’t happen.”Even South Africa, which took umbrage at the thought of doing business with agents who often doubled as illegal immigrants who don’t pay taxes, seems to be softening. Where once it produced a 21-page document of regulations keeping mobile money in check, today’s rules fill only six pages. Joseph says they are beginning to understand that mobile money can usefully knit together formal and informal economies – linking legal money transfer and listed company’s bottom lines to an informal network of agents.“This is a new way of banking – it’s not an extension of traditional banking,” he says, before heading off to the airport to take up his cause with regulators worldwide.Related reading:

98;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;IBM names Rometty as next chief executive;First female head of 100-year-old company;IBM has named Virginia Rometty to succeed Sam Palmisano as its chief executive from the start of next year, making her the first female leader in the 100-year history of the US computing giant and one of only a handful of women to head a large US corporation.Currently head of sales, marketing and strategy, Ms Rometty is also the first head of IBM not to have run part of its traditional hardware business. At one time she headed the business services unit that accounts for around a third of IBM’s total services division, but has otherwise spent her 30-year career at the company mainly in sales and marketing roles.In an interview, she brushed aside questions about her relative lack of broad operating management experience, adding that services now accounted for some 60 per cent of IBM’s total business. Also, having led sales in some of IBM’s main markets, she stressed her experience in packaging IBM’s range of hardware, software and services into broad solutions for its customers – that core of the approach that has seen the company rebound under Mr Palmisano to become the biggest supplier of technology to big companies and governments.“The 15-year arc of IBM has been about services, and she’s been right in the middle of that,” said George Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research.A close lieutenant of Mr Palmisano during his decade at the helm, Ms Rometty was instrumental in planning the 2002 acquisition of the PwC consulting business that broadened IBM’s range and added a stronger business component to its technology skills. She was also given the job of integrating the business with IBM’s other units, helping to make a success of Mr Palmisano’s riskiest corporate gamble.“He stuck his neck out, and it was Ginni that made it work,” said Bob Djurjevic, an analyst at Annex Research.Ms Rometty, 54, had been the favourite to succeed Mr Palmisano, who earlier this year passed 60, the normal retirement age for IBM CEOs. Other executives elevated by a management reorganisation last year into positions that made them potential successors included Steve Mills, head of software, and Mike Daniels, head of services. However, both are closer to the company’s retirement age and had been seen as less likely candidates for the CEO job.Her appointment makes IBM the largest company with a female chief executive, ahead of PepsiCo, where Indra Nooyi has served as chief executive and president since October 2006.Ms Rometty will now compete with Hewlett-Packard’s chief executive Meg Whitman for the unofficial title of most powerful woman in technology, continuing the bitter rivalry between the two companies. Other high-profile female chief executives in the technology and industrial sector include Ursula Burns of Xerox and Ellen Kullman of DuPont.Ms Rometty joined IBM in 1981 as a systems engineer. She takes charge of the company as steady profit growth has lifted the value of its shares to the highest since the company went public in 1915. Earlier this year it briefly topped Microsoft to become the second most valuable technology company after Apple, capping a turnaround that began in the early 1990s after it fell behind in the early days of the PC era.
99;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-10-24T22:44:42Z;The art and science of picking a leader;As with transplants, there is a risk of rejection;Whatever the reason for Michael Woodford’s abrupt exit from Olympus (of which more later), everyone can agree that if the board’s chosen chief executive leaves prematurely, something has probably gone wrong.It happens surprisingly frequently at large companies with heavyweight boards. Léo Apotheker lasted 11 months at Hewlett-Packard. Ian Smith – announced with a fanfare as directors’ top choice to succeed Sir Crispin Davis at Reed Elsevier – stepped down in 2009 after less than nine months at the media and information company.If executives who are supposed to be the cream of the cream are souring within months of their appointment, it is a fair bet that below the top level, the incidence of fluffed hires, poor promotions and recruitment U-turns is even greater. Directors should surely be asking themselves: why are we bad at picking good leaders?That is the title of a recent book by Jeffrey Cohn and Jay Moran, which adds to the pile of titles on the topic. The authors are consultants specialising in succession planning and executive recruitment, as are James Citrin and Julie Hembrock Daum, who wrote another recent book, You Need a Leader – Now What? If you look past the “Hire us!” subtext, they offer some interesting guidelines. Interesting, but far from definitive.Drawing on a study of CEO transition at companies in the US and Europe, Mr Citrin and Ms Hembrock Daum refine the intuition that outside hires often underperform insiders. That is largely true when outsiders are appointed to run healthy, growing companies, they say. But when a company is “in a significantly challenged or crisis condition”, the reverse is true. In the US, outside hires picked to run troubled companies are three times as likely to achieve top-quartile performance than insiders.The snag is that the exceptions they cite punch a large hole in their broad conclusions. Anne Mulcahy, the quintessential Xerox insider, followed outsider Rick Thoman as chief executive in 2000 when the company was palpably in crisis.Mr Citrin and Ms Hembrock Daum say this “pendulum effect” is an important exception to their overall thesis. But it is no disrespect to Ms Mulcahy, who led a successful turnround, to suggest that in Xerox’s darkest hour, with investigations and bankruptcy looming, the list of external candidates must have been short. The same goes for companies that pull board members into executive positions in a crisis – the authors’ second exception. Such hybrid chief executives have the best record of any type of CEO, yet boards rarely appoint them.Matching the right individual to the right situation using the right process is complicated. However experienced, directors are people, picking people. That is always a task with unpredictable consequences – and outcomes as varied as the people involved. Knowing the essential truths of leadership selection or recognising the attributes of great leaders will help but, as Mr Cohn and Mr Moran put it, “the trick is knowing what these attributes mean and how to spot them”. The number of books that try to teach the trick just shows how difficult it is to carry off.When Jack Griffin lost his job as head of Time Inc this year after only five months, Jeff Bewkes, CEO of parent company Time Warner, told staff that Mr Griffin’s “leadership style and approach did not mesh” with the company’s. It was a rare public reminder that appointing corporate leaders is as much art as science. If it is at all scientific, it is more like a heart transplant than a laboratory experiment. Even after a suitable replacement organ is identified, there is a risk of rejection. CEOs should have a chance to demonstrate their worth. But directors who remove an executive who proves unsuitable – like surgeons who pick the “wrong” heart – should probably be given greater benefit of the doubt.I have less patience for the Olympus board, however. Mr Woodford had honed his style – identified as a reason for his dismissal – over many years at the company. He had a mandate to shake things up. Olympus directors may now feel they picked the wrong candidate. But if the ex-CEO has uncovered an unhealthy culture, ripe for reform, they may go down in history – and in the next set of headhunters’ how-to manuals – as the board that picked the right man, but by mistake.andrew.hill@ft.com
100;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-10-05T02:10:28Z;Technology only partly explains demise of Kodak;;From Prof Charles McMillan.Sir, The idea that disruptive technology explains the demise of Kodak (Tony Jackson, October 3) is, at best, limited. Like the Detroit car companies, Kodak’s problems were not sudden, nor limited to film as a chemical process (ignoring price/cost issues) rather than digital. Clearly, Japanese consumer electronic companies were pioneering digital technologies from the 1970s. The (then) six camera companies excelled at more than film or digital technologies, incorporating innovations in lens technology and shutters, but also simple ways to load the film, learning from Sony and Panasonic about cartridge technology. Fuji, with its alliance partner, Xerox, taught the US company about quality management in manufacturing, while the camera (and TV) companies like Sony pioneered incredible resolution of pictures and images – the core technology of Xerox. Canon, not only a camera maker (and founded by a medical doctor), pioneered medical imaging for X-ray, a field also cultivated by Kodak.Yet Kodak assumed that it owned the US camera market. But when the Olympics were held in Los Angeles in 1984, Fuji, not Kodak, became the sponsor. (Fuji also bought out Xerox in Japan.) That was the signal that Fuji was taking on Kodak frontally in the US market. Kodak, typical of too many companies, appealed to government for protection and filed law suits, claiming that Japan was a closed market, despite the presence of very successful American companies such as IBM and Texas Instruments in Japan. An alternative Kodak strategy, promoted by James Abegglen at Boston Consulting, was to have Kodak invest directly in Japan, in order to prevent Fuji and the Japanese camera makers from building huge market share both at home and in the growing Asian market, and thus building up cash reserves to expand in the US market. Kodak lost the court cases, the US government stood hapless, and Kodak sold its medical imaging division to Canada’s Onex Corporation, which merged it with a company in Israel.Unlike in medicine, where pathology is so central to learning about disease, business school academics and the media too often ignore the pathologies of bad management, poor corporate governance, and the failure to play the global game. Technology – new, disruptive or re-engineered – only goes so far in explaining the success or failure of companies.Charles McMillan, Schulich School of Business, Toronto, ON, Canada
101;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-08-18T17:54:52Z;Clouds gather over media’s advertising rebound;;Advertising-dependent media companies are growing skittish as the turbulent markets and cloudy macro-economic climate has called into question their hopes for a continued rebound in spending from consumer groups.Although ad spending by retail, food and automotive groups in the US has been strong through the year, analysts and executives say the prospect of continued turmoil could force advertisers to pull back, depriving television, print and radio groups of revenues.So far media executives are putting on a brave face. During analyst calls after quarterly earnings in recent weeks, the heads of leading US media groups all expressed optimism that ad spending would remain robust for the rest of this year and into 2012.“The national ad market continues to be buoyant,” said David DeVoe, chief financial officer of News Corp, which said last week’s fourth-quarter results had been boosted by strong advertising at its Fox News and FX networks.When CBS reported earnings earlier this month, chief executive Leslie Moonves said the climate was not as bad as it had been during the peak of the financial crisis in 2008. “It’s been a rough couple of days but we haven’t seen anything that reflects . . . the same tone as then, which was much more of doom and gloom,” Mr Moonves said. “We are not feeling that or seeing any of that.”But two weeks of market volatility sparked by the downgrade of the US’s credit rating by Standard & Poor’s has called these rosy projections into question.“Things can change pretty quickly,” said David Joyce, the managing director of media equity research at Miller Tabak. “The volatility in the stock market may have caused some overreaction, and that caused nervousness among consumers and businesses, which in turn could affect advertising.”David Sable, chief executive of Young and Rubicam, the ad agency that represents Xerox, LG and Land Rover, suggested that those not planning for more economic malaise were in denial. “Anybody that’s not thinking about adjusting their spend is playing ostrich,” he said.Those best positioned are the broadcast and cable networks that sell much of their advertising inventory during the “upfronts”, at which cable and broadcast networks debut their new shows to advertisers and media buyers. These were strong this year, Mr Sable said. More vulnerable are the local TV stations, newspapers and radio stations that rely on notoriously fickle local advertisers.“The companies that will be hurt the worst are CBS and News Corp, which have the most local stations,” said Mr Joyce. “But they do have other assets.”So far however, analysts have not significantly lowered their ad spending forecasts.Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne on Thursday reiterated his forecast for 3.2 per cent growth this year and 4.1 per cent growth next year, thanks to continuing demand for automobiles, and healthy balance sheets and high margins at big US companies.“It’s too early to say what effect the S&P downgrade will have,” said eMarketer analyst David Hallerman.“It’s especially true of media and television, the numbers are set and locked in, so if we see ongoing cutbacks, the results will be in 2012.”
102;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-05-30T23:02:34Z;Far from home and lonely;;An elegant woman in her 40s is addressing 200 young men and women in a large auditorium in Shenzhen, the sprawling city just across the border from Hong Kong. “Is it necessary to fall when learning to walk?” Sun Yu asks. “Necessary,” many of her audience of workers at a Fuji Xerox factory loudly respond.Ms Sun launches into a rambling tale about a young Englishman who works in a factory but loses his job just when his father falls ill and needs financial support. Things start looking up, however, when on a visit to the British Museum the young man sees a photo of an old ship that has weathered many storms. Fast-forward a couple of decades and he is the head of an insurance company. The storyline might be convoluted but the moral is clear: “Life,” Ms Sun intones, “is a university with setbacks.”Ms Sun is not a celebrity motivational speaker, nor has her audience paid large sums to listen to her. She is one of a growing band of psychiatrists and psychotherapists who work with big factories in southern China to help their young migrant workforce cope with the stresses of work – and growing up.In part, the move is aimed at increasing employee retention. Earlier this year, Stephen Green, an economist for Standard Chartered wrote a report entitled “Wanted: 25m workers”, which argued that labour productivity would be critical in China at a time when job creation is outpacing new entrants to the workforce. The focus on the well-being of workers is also a response to a wave of suicides last year at the huge factory of Foxconn, the behemoth contract manufacturer of Apple’s iPhones and other consumer electronics products.Fuji Xerox, which makes copiers and printers at its Shenzhen plant, presciently started a corporate social responsibility programme aimed at employees at the factory in 2006. Unusually, the effort is headed by someone – Liu Meihua – who is herself a young migrant worker, rather than by a senior manager. Ms Liu recounts how the scheme was started because the production team complained that many young workers lacked basic communication skills. The first course was “How to express yourself.”At the time, Ms Liu says, she did not know what “CSR” meant. What she lacked in management jargon, however, she more than made up for in empathy. After the company surveyed 500 workers, she decided many of the issues were not work-related but stemmed from the youth of the workforce and the dislocation they felt living so far from home.Indeed, at Ms Sun’s talk at the factories of Fuji Xerox, many of the young men and women look so young they might have been playing truant from school. The average age of the workers is 20. Ms Liu says the generation born in the 1990s are “very creative, but we need to give them guidance, otherwise they quit the job without thinking about the consequences”. The courses she and her colleagues have devised range from learning to save money and making friends in a new environment to communicating with colleagues.Toshihiko Okaji, the genial president of Fuji Xerox in Shenzhen, characterises the CSR scheme as “like a mother. If they have a problem, there is someone to listen.” HR, on the other hand, is perceived as “discipline”, he says. “They are quite separate. Young people don’t go to HR when they have a problem.”Staff turnover at the factory has fallen to 3.5 per cent a year, possibly a record for southern China, where migrant workers switch from factory to factory or are lured away by new opportunities available closer to their homes in China’s inland provinces.Variants of this profoundly different way of managing a young workforce in China are being adopted by other multinationals to increase staff retention. At the Flextronics industrial township of 52,000 employees in the city of Zhuhai, the maker of components for Xbox consoles for Microsoft, as well as products for other electronics manufacturers, has started a “big brother, big sister” mentoring initiative to help young employees who are struggling to adjust to working and living away from their families.The management of the Zhuhai canteen has been taken back from a vendor and is now run by people with hotel food and beverage experience, which means the food is much tastier and attracts more employees. There has also been a focus on extra-curricular competitions that allow employees to show off their talents at anything from Chinese calligraphy to fashion design. A recent fashion show at the factory featured recycled material, including outfits made from PCB boards and plastic wrapping. The head of HR at the Zhuhai factory, Jayesh Menon, displays in his office a striking Cubist mask made by an employee that incorporates safety equipment including mufflers and goggles.There is nothing abstract about the results, however. Staff turnover at Flextronics Zhuhai fell 20 per cent in 2010 at a time when wages were rising sharply in southern China. Mr Menon says that the turnover of staff declines when the company hires from vocational schools rather than the general labour market.In March, Flextronics said it would begin working with a Chinese non-governmental organisation to prepare rural migrants for the different lives they will lead as factory workers.Flextronics has also eased the transition by creating a migrants’ centre in Zhuhai with another NGO. On one morning earlier this year, nearly all the volunteers were Flextronics employees from the large province of Hunan, creating a kinship of its own. A young woman in a pink windcheater says: “When I moved to this area, I was new. I hoped to make some friends here.” A total of 40,000 people had used the centre by the start of this year, about 80 per cent of them from Flextronics. Jiang Hong Yan, the factory’s psychotherapist, identifies the primary problems for the young workers as homesickness and “lots of love stuff”.Both are in evidence at the end of Ms Sun’s talk at Fuji Xerox. The session has run from 1.30pm to 4.30pm, but she gives out her phone number at the end to employees who want a private chat. A few young women cluster round her. One left the Foxconn factory down the road to escape a messy break-up with a boyfriend before starting at Fuji Xerox. She weeps as she explains her need to support her parents because she cannot bear to see them work so hard on the farm at home. A 22-year-old, Song Chaoqun, wants to get out of working in packaging and, eventually, teach Japanese. She demands to know if her career is already at a dead end. “I’m still young and don’t know what my future will be . . . Society is unfair from the beginning, everyone’s opportunity is different,” she says, close to tears.What these young workers seem to need is a fairy godmother. The infinitely patient Ms Sun is almost up to that challenge. She says she too felt ignored when she first moved to Shenzhen years ago: “Everyone starts from the bottom. We feel alone and confused because home is far away. But let’s keep doing something we really like and be prepared for any opportunity that may occur in the future.”The young women around her appear calmed by this advice and the meeting ends almost an hour later in a spirit of sisterly camaraderie.
103;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-04-17T16:42:34Z;The ‘boss’ with two brains;;Welcome to Bill’s and Jim’s leadership show. Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe have sat down to reflect on the first 14 months of their joint tenure as SAP’s co-chief executives and, although they are dissimilar, they are proving well-versed in creating an aura of perfect unity.“We have a unique way of making one plus one equal three. That is a real blessing for the partnership,” starts off the American-born, sleek Mr McDermott, who occasionally looks Mr Snabe in the eyes, pats his back and at one point shakes his hand.“We had worked together for eight years …There was a lot of trust and camaraderie and we both have a tremendous history together,” he says.“We have a common ambition to make a difference in the world,” chips in the Danish-born Mr Snabe, the quieter and more reflective of the duo at the head of the world’s largest business software maker.If this show of unanimity at a London meeting seems somewhat too perfect, it is nevertheless this leadership style that has made a real difference at the 39-year-old German software group over the past year.When the management couple took over from Léo Apotheker in February 2010, the company was in bad shape. Customers were baying over high management fees and product delays, employees were bewildered by job losses and perceived management aloofness, and investors had lost faith because of a slowdown in business momentum.The US-Danish team came in with a promise to turn SAP into a “happy company”, and their new style and strategy might have been exactly the type of adrenalin kick the embattled group needed. Company insiders say the mood at the software behemoth has improved. Its business is emerging solidly from the downturn, while last June’s takeover of US mobile software specialist Sybase has broadened its product strategy.Mr McDermott says the two men spent the first two weeks after taking over “working day and night” on a strategy that would create growth and re-establish trust at the company. But sceptics have remained wary over how two such different people could be able to manage a company better than a single chief executive.The differences between the two are quickly obvious. The 49-year-old Mr McDermott, who is mainly responsible for customer relations, is a charismatic salesman with a tanned, immaculate appearance and who charms and draws in his audience with open- handed gestures. He came to SAP nine years ago after rising through the ranks at technology companies Xerox, Gartner and Siebel.Mr Snabe, who takes care of product development, is an intellectually minded and introspective mathematician with a sporty and friendly appearance, who looks younger than his 45 years. The SAP stalwart speaks five languages and is a true technology fan who once stuck an Apple logo on to his standard office computer.A company insider who knows both managers well puts it more bluntly: “McDermott is a brilliant salesperson but he neither understands the Europeans very well nor the company’s technology in depth. Mr Snabe is an intellectual who is not as well received in the US but who knows the company inside out.”In spite of their constant show of affectionate respect, they are equally eager to point out the benefits of having such different strengths and weaknesses.“We both go in the room with each other open-minded to a new way or approach,” Mr McDermott says. “Very often we come out of the room with a third dimension that neither of us thought about before.”“If we always agreed, then there would not be much synergy,” Mr Snabe says, looking at his constantly nodding fellow chief executive. “We are both unpolitical in our approach, we are very much fact-driven and we want to challenge assumptions. We very often come out with the same gut feeling and conclusion.”And he points out another benefit: “Once we have made the decision, we have four hands to make sure that it will be implemented, so it will be executed faster.”Indeed, when Hasso Plattner, the group’s billionaire co-founder and chairman, brought them in to replace Mr Apotheker, he had referred to SAP’s tradition of a co-chief executive structure and its use at other companies such as Microsoft. “Microsoft had its best times when Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates were working together,” the 67-year-old said at the time.Yet there are many who say that Mr Plattner, who has a triple role as chairman, shareholder and technological adviser, is still the one who really pulls the strategic strings.Thomas Otter, research director at Gartner, the research firm, says: “Bill McDermott and Jim Snabe are managing the SAP field and development organisations but the technology vision lies with Vishal Sikka [chief technology officer] but also partly with Hasso Plattner. While this multi-headed model seems to be working fine at the moment, it is complicated.”The management duo concedes Mr Plattner’s role as visionary. “We recognise that we are standing on the shoulders of a giant …and we truly respect and trust his genius,” Mr Snabe says. But he adds firmly: “He is not the guy who defines the strategy of the company.”Mr Snabe and Mr McDermott remain keen to display their friendship and trust in almost every answer and gesture. “I feel as though I always know where Bill is going,” Mr Snabe even says, adding that he is a “great friend and partner”. Mr McDermott talks of the duo “sharing bread” and regularly meeting at the dinner table with their families and occasionally also with Mr Plattner.But Mr Snabe looks quietly amused and vaguely appalled when he realises that he and Mr McDermott have in­advertently chosen matching navy suits and similarly patterned ties that match SAP’s brand colour.In fact, in spite of all the bonhomie, the two are rarely in the same place at the same time, reflecting the global nature of an internationally minded and staffed group that is somewhat isolated from the Teutonic “Deutschland AG” network of other blue-chip Dax 30 companies.While Mr Snabe is based at the group’s headquarters in Walldorf in the economically vigorous south of Germany, Mr McDermott has his office and home at the US headquarters in Newton Square, Pennsylvania.They communicate daily by phone and e-mail and use SAP’s own system to share at an instant all crucial data and information between themselves and throughout the company. Meanwhile, day-to-day meetings of managers and executives are increasingly undertaken with highly sophisticated video software that mocks up a virtual board table resembling the “holodeck” of the Star Trek science fiction series.If, as Mr McDermott says at one point, “the real thing we have in common is our differences”, it does not seem to be stopping them also making a difference to the company they make a practised show of jointly leading.
104;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-03-30T20:28:39Z;No need for acts of management bravado;;"Beyond the Familiar
Long-Term Growth Through Customer Focus And Innovation
By Patrick Barwise and Seán Meehan
Wiley, £17.99It would be surprising if this book were surprising. A dramatic leap of topic or treatment would contradict the authors’ central message that the heroic strategic shifts, breakthrough products and transformational acquisitions that are the stuff of business legend offer a perilous path to success.Instead, as in their earlier book, Simply Better (2004), Patrick Barwise and Seán Meehan point managers towards the well-mapped low road of organic growth and incremental innovation. The views from here are less spectacular but you are more likely to arrive at your destination in good shape.Not that this route is an easy one. Beyond the Familiar is better written and less frantic in style than the shelfloads of books that goad their readers towards rash acts of management bravado.But, like their more excitable peers, the authors promote the idea that business these days is thoroughly exhausting. For instance, the book acclaims electronics group Philips’ reorientation of its brand around the “sense and simplicity” strapline, but the authors make no bones about what this sort of change requires – “extreme persistence …occasional willingness to be unpopular [and] a never-ending effort by the leadership”. Management teams whose success is celebrated here are “ag­gressive”, “fearless” and, above all, “relentless”. If you are not relentlessly improving your promise to customers, your communication with staff, your commitment to quality, and so on, you are nowhere.This goes even for Apple, the acme of effortless cool. The company’s products may be – in the words of actor Stephen Fry, their highest-profile fan – “gorgeous and lovely” but, as Barwise and Meehan point out, Apple did not blaze this trail. To call Apple a pioneer for producing the Mac, iPod and iPad is to “ignore the amount of unglamorous incremental innovation work behind the razzmatazz of the headlines and the big product launches”.Apple is more of a “fast follower”. Steve Jobs recognised and exploited the potential of breakthroughs by Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970s, including the graphical user interface and the computer mouse. Xerox, on the other hand, wrong-headedly en­visaged its Star computer “as a networked ‘office of the future’ system …aimed at its traditional customer base of office managers”. The device flopped because Xerox “never went ‘beyond the familiar’, never made the effort to understand end-users”.Barwise and Meehan make plain that they offer no silver bullet to guarantee long-term growth. As in the Apple example, they prefer to teach a series of counterintuitive lessons, wrapped neatly around case studies.Focus groups and market research? Handle with care. In seeking to make the venerable Tide laundry detergent brand “emotionally relevant” again, Procter & Gamble drew on more direct and informal customer contacts. Delight your customers? By all means but devote as much or more attention to not annoying or disappointing them. Customer satisfaction is all very well but customer dissatisfaction can erode trust in established brands faster than you can say “please hold, your call is important to us”.In the same vein, companies that push to develop unique features for their product or service should remember that customers often just want what they buy to work. By all means improve it (relentlessly), but never lose sight of the baseline of reliability.Barwise and Meehan certainly do not stray from that line. On its own terms, Beyond the Familiar lives up to its promise, rewards readers’ trust and re­inforces Simply Better’s straightforward lessons. The problem with their slim new volume is that it is, well, a bit too familiar.Where the authors do expand on the earlier work is in placing greater emphasis on the importance of bridging the gaps between perception and reality that blight modern business. What a company thinks of its products can be damagingly different from the way they are received in the marketplace, as the recent financial crisis exposed.The book illustrates this with a crushing case study of General Motors’ “dismal” record over the past half-century. The company “has had a culture which rejects unwelcome news, and its leaders have been unable or unwilling to change this”, they write. The opposite of a GM-style culture of “fear and denial” is the “open organisation”.It is no coincidence that the authors put it at the centre of the simple diagram of success that starts each chapter. But achieving and maintaining this ideal state – where problems and ideas are freely discussed, managers get honest feedback and minions’ mistakes earn a pat on the back – will remain a struggle as long as executives remain open to the temptations of heroism."
105;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
106;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-03-29T15:13:49Z;Climate change agenda;;Energy management and information are complementary technologies which, applied collaboratively, can make a huge contribution to the planet’s carbon economy.There are concerns, however, that despite this potential to deal with the problems of global warming, sufficient momentum has yet to be created to make a real difference. And this despite powerful political pressure for change, linked to the low-carbon agenda.There are three elements to the equation. First, the need to overhaul and modernise the generation, distribution and pricing of energy – the introduction of the “smart grid”.Second, the need for organisations worldwide to manage and control their energy requirements through improved information and communication technologies.The downside here, according to a survey by the consultancy IFS, is that environmental monitoring is not popular with companies – almost two-thirds of those canvassed would only invest in monitoring equipment if required to do so by law or if it helped to sell their products or services.Third, the IT industry itself, which contributes some 2 to 3 per cent of greenhouse emissions annually, has an obligation to put its own house in order.This latter issue has led to some interesting innovations: one data centre in Switzerland is cooled by water from a nearby lake.The commercial potential of developing intelligent energy management has not been lost on the IT industry: companies including IBM, Xerox and software suppliers such as SAP, Oracle and Cisco have been to the fore in announcing products that promise sustainability and climate change management.The IT industry as a whole, however, is still “immature” in its offerings according to an analysis of some 19 vendors published last year by WWF Sweden, the conservation organisation, and the Gartner group.It found that BT, IBM, Cisco, Ericsson, Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu and SAP were “leaders in integrating sustainability into ICT”.This was based on their commitment to managing environmental issues in their operations and supply chains, together with what they were doing to advance low-carbon products and services and develop products to reduce emissions.But, according to Dennis Pamlin, an independent consultant working for WWF Sweden, “We were surprised at the lack of disruptive innovation with the majority of responses essentially focused on incremental client-driven developments. If the ICT industry is to deliver on its promise of making a significant contribution to enabling a transformation to a low-carbon economy, it is going to contribute substantially more than marginal incrementalism.”Fujitsu, for example, was the only company with a carbon reduction goal based on its customers’ emissions rather than just its own.This disillusionment is shared by Lyndon Hedderly, a partner with Centrix Consulting.“IT is contributing to a more sustainable world, but the question arises as to how the large software companies are helping reduce carbon emissions. The answer is disappointing.“While most companies have the usual internal targets, their software products do little to reduce CO2 emissions.“Where reduction claims are made, it is usually a reference to virtualisation or a marketing angle giving an existing product a sustainable spin …If IT is to increase its role in managing energy, the big software companies need to innovate”.Nevertheless, there has been enough activity for green technology bloggers to wonder whether enterprise energy management has become “the new customer relationship management”.Start-ups developing and delivering this kind of software include Hara Software, C3 and ENXSuite.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies such as SAP are buying in expertise – it recently acquired Clear Standards, a privately held provider of carbon management tools.Richard Scott, head of carbon consultancy for the Sustainable Energy group at Eon, the UK power and gas group, says the IT sector is playing a big role in shaping the way organisations manage and report sustainability.“Partnerships between the renewable energy and IT sectors are now vital, as the combined knowledge is shown to produce solutions that help achieve energy efficiency goals while being cost-effective.“The best carbon accounting software adds considerable value to the process, bringing the ability to mine, capture and analyse energy use and carbon emissions data at a granular level.”Liz Parminter, energy specialist with PA Consulting, argues that the world is at a tipping point for lowering carbon emissions and that there is a need to bring several industries together to generate changes.“In the past in the electricity industry, we have thought about it from a network perspective. Now, we have to involve the automotive industries, manufacturing industries, white goods, networks companies and communications groups.”International standards – say for charging electric vehicles – will have to be agreed, people’s demands for power will have to be monitored, 40-year-old distribution infrastructure will have to be updated.Even with the best will in the world, it could be 15 to 20 years before the planet benefits fully from the marriage of energy and the information technologies.…………………………………………..Smart grids: Pilot projects assess consumer preferences and the best ways of improving power deliveryThere are a number of ways to define smart grids.To some, the term simply means smart metering – the use of computer and communications technology to measure the consumption of electricity better.Energy professionals, however, prefer a broader definition. The European Union Technology Platform’s is as good as any: “Electricity networks that can intelligently integrate the behaviour and actions of all users connected to it – generators, consumers and those that do both – in order to efficiently deliver sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies”.Smart grids, therefore imply the addition of computer intelligence to the generation of electricity, its storage, transmission and distribution, together with its consumption by, for example, electric vehicles.Smart metering, on the other hand, is based on consumer demand and can be used, along with differential pricing, to persuade customers to reduce power use.By the EU’s definition smart grids do not exist anywhere yet, although elements of the technology are being tested in a number of countries and cities. Liz Parminter, energy specialist with PA Consulting, says: “Smart grids are the future rather than something that is here and now”.There are, however, a number of high-visibility trials in progress. In Boulder, Colorado, for example, the mid-Western utility Xcel Energy has created SmartGridCity, a pilot to help the company understand which energy management tools its customers prefer and which technologies are best at improving the way power is delivered.The company has installed some 23,000 automated smart meters across the city.Singapore’s Energy Market Authority has been operating a pilot smart grid since the end of 2009 to address the problems of unexpected power outages and the intermittent nature of some renewable energy sources such as wind and wave power.The pilot involved the installation of smart meters allowing homeowners to see how much power they are using minute by minute. It also envisages that electric vehicles could be used as a distributed storage system, which could be tapped into at peak periods.These pilots and others, such as the Duke Energy Envision Centre in Erlanger, Kentucky, a demonstration smart-grid-equipped “home” built by Duke Energy, the power company, with the consultancy Kema, are proving the case for the intelligent management of energy provision.There are questions yet to be answered: what measures, for example, must be taken to protect communications systems against hackers, but governments and the energy industry are enthusiastic about smart grids and the need to improve energy efficiency is on their side.
107;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-01-31T20:29:16Z;Nifty Fifty;Apple and Google investors could learn from once-mighty companies;Quick, name a “one decision stock” – a business team so good that valuation is a secondary consideration. For those investors foolish enough to believe in such things, Google and Apple – market darlings for the better part of a decade – might well fit the bill.But go back 40 years and Xerox and Kodak, two stocks that tumbled last week and have had awful decades, were similar bellwethers that fund managers happily owned at nearly any price. Leading members of a group dubbed the “Nifty Fifty”, they traded at an average of 42 times price-to-earnings at their 1972 peak, pricier than today’s tech leaders but a similar multiple of revenue.A decade ago , the finance professor Jeremy Siegel revisited the Nifty Fifty and calculated what a reasonable p/e ratio would have been with 29 years of perfect foresight. Xerox would have been fairly valued at 9 times and Kodak at 11 times. Polaroid, the most richly-valued of the group at 95 times in 1972, has since disappeared altogether.Not all did badly. McDonalds and Walt Disney had high starting valuations that eventually were justified. Somewhat cheaper Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Coca-Cola, did well too. Technology stocks did worst, but the best predictor of future return was not industry but starting valuation. The cheapest five stocks traded at 26 times earnings while the most expensive group sold for 63 times. Extrapolating returns calculated by Siegel, the cheaper group had a return 2.3 times higher.Duds such as Kodak or Polaroid notwithstanding, fund managers in 1972 did a decent job of picking lasting franchises but not good investments. A portfolio of companies chosen purely on the basis of a low p/e would have done better. Followers of Apple or Google might still ponder the words of Warren Buffett, who feasted on fallen members of the Nifty Fifty after the group dropped by 70 per cent in the subsequent bear market. “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.”E-mail the Lex team in confidence
108;XRX;Xerox Corp;2011-01-19T23:23:09Z;Technology: A dip in the Valley;;When Facebook was accorded a $50bn valuation in a private financing launched this month, it looked like business as usual in Silicon Valley. The suburbs strung out along the peninsula below San Francisco that comprise the heart of the US technology industry had once again turned out a groundbreaking company to take the world by storm.To some industry veterans, however, eye-catching successes such as the social networking site – whose share offer by Goldman Sachs drew so much attention that the bank felt obliged to exclude US investors for regulatory reasons– provide little indication of the underlying trend in the country’s technological competitiveness. If anything, they help to mask a deeper malaise that threatens the American system of innovation.Drawn by the quick profits from high-flying internet concerns, US technology investors have lost interest in the more serious work needed to sustain a lead in some of the world’s most advanced industries, says John Seely Brown, a former head of Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center, once one of the Valley’s most renowned corporate research and development laboratories. “We’ve lost the will for patient investment. In the natural sciences, you don’t see ideas develop that fast,” he says.Mr Seely Brown is far from alone. A deepening angst has gripped the US technology industry as the country has emerged from recession. If America is to create new, high-paying jobs, it is in the convergence of high science and entrepreneurial dynamism that much of the hope resides. But many leaders in the technology industry, which has been held up as a beacon of US economic leadership, no longer feel as confident of their own ability to deliver the goods.“I don’t know how many Facebooks you can build,” says Bill Watkins, a computer industry veteran. Like others in Silicon Valley, he has been drawn into the region’s latest boom industry: green technology. As chief executive of Bridgelux, a company that makes low-power lighting using light emitting diodes, he is at the forefront of a promising new field – but now warns that the LED industry is fast slipping away to Asia.The US remains the clear leader in science and technology on virtually any measure – its share of global R&D spending stands at 40 per cent, while it employs 70 per cent of the world’s Nobel prizewinners and is home to 15 of the world’s 20 top universities, according to Rand, a US think-tank.But the balance has been shifting. By 2007, the most recent date for which figures are available, Asia’s share of global R&D spending had risen to 32 per cent, up five percentage points in the previous five years, according to Unesco. On paper, the 1.4m researchers in China now equal the number in the US, though their output has been far lower.Silicon Valley’s magnetic attraction for entrepreneurial talent from around the world is also less powerful than it was. About one-quarter of venture capital-backed companies in the US over the past 15 years were set up by immigrants, with a heavy bias towards technology industries, according to the National Venture Capital Association. That movement of talent in favour of the US does not look sustainable. With US venture capitalists redirecting more of their money to Asia, and start-ups from elsewhere winning support from American investors – new stock market listings by Chinese internet companies on Wall Street exceeded those by local American ones last year – many immigrant entrepreneurs are feeling an irresistible pull to return home.For US tech companies, this is not necessarily bad news. Adept at crossing borders to take advantage of new markets and tap low-cost workforces and pools of engineering talent elsewhere, their ties to their country of origin have been growing looser. But for the US itself, the risk of losing out on the next big technologies would be far more severe. As Mr Watkins says: “What’s good for American stockholders is not necessarily good for America.”In the popular psyche, American technological leadership seems almost innate. It is seen as the product of an ingenuity, a sense of risk-taking and a hunger for the new that could only have taken root in a country as democratic, socially mobile and close to its pioneer roots as the US. But such romantic notions have lately been taking a cold shower.Forget the loss of electronics manufacturing to Asia, which began in the 1980s, or the shift of information technology services to India, which has been the story of the past decade: the R&D and design work that goes into many areas of electronics manufacturing – bringing with it high-paying jobs – has also been moving elsewhere. And in entirely new markets such as green technology, despite strong US scientific credentials and heavy investment from Silicon Valley’s venture capital investors, the centre of gravity has been moving to Asia.The belief that American individuality and creativity somehow assure future leadership is “a clear exposition of the arrogance of empire”, warns Michael Moritz, one of the Valley’s leading start-up financiers. Freed of “the debilitating effects of affluence”, he adds, “the need to succeed is far greater in the emerging economies”.Nor is there any inherent resource advantage, as information and talent flow freely. “We’re not smarter than they are,” says Mr Watkins.Some of the trends that lie behind the erosion of leadership – such as the decline of the US share of the world’s R&D spending, and the inability of its educational system to turn out enough science and technology students to feed national demand – have been playing out for decades. But the current angst has a more pointed cause. It comes from a sense of relative decline: others are catching up. The rise of China, in particular, has had a powerful psychological effect.In many ways, this unease is irrational. “Why should I be upset that other countries are lifting themselves out of poverty, whether that’s physical or intellectual?” asks Nathan Myhrvold, a former chief technology officer at Microsoft whose current firm, Intellectual Ventures, has amassed one of the world’s biggest portfolios of technology patents.For all the concerns, the US still has a big global lead. But that does little to erase the doubts. “Relative decline is decline,” says Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a US think-tank. Even optimists such as Mr Myhrvold concede that, as Asia rises, Americans find themselves in an unfamiliar position. “The US is the new Europe,” he says.There is also a growing fear of absolute decline as more parts of the US technology industry move offshore. “A company that loses its ability to develop its own manufacturing is on the road to oblivion,” says Mr Moritz.The concern stems from the close ties between design and manufacturing that characterise the evolution of new technologies. Developing prototypes and refining manufacturing processes becomes harder when the design and manufacturing of products takes place half a world apart. As a result, the US is losing “the capabilities to build serious, complex stuff”, warns Mr Seely Brown.The US machine tool industry has already largely been lost to other countries. Applied Materials, the world’s largest maker of manufacturing equipment for the chip industry – and, increasingly, for solar cell makers – startled US rivals last year when it announced that its chief technology officer would move to China to be closer to the company’s manufacturing plants.The failure of the US educational system to turn out enough engineers and others with needed technical backgrounds presents a second direct threat and has become a perennial subject of complaint for tech employers. “In the short run, you can fill gaps through immigration,” says Brad Smith, general counsel of Microsoft. “But you have to question whether that’s healthy and sustainable.”The ability of the US to win the competition for talent is no longer taken for granted. Sophie Vandebroek, a Belgian engineer who moved to the US in the mid-1980s to train, says that at the time it was “the place to be – this was where the hot research was happening”. Ms Vandebroek stayed and eventually became chief technology officer at Xerox – in spite of the low status accorded to engineers in the US: “It’s kind of at the bottom of the professions.” Now, she and others warn, US immigration rules that make it harder for foreign students to stay, along with the availability of good jobs at home, are causing the country to leach much-needed foreign workers.Concerns about competition are most heavily focused on new industries in which global leadership has yet to be established. The pressure is most acute in so-called green technologies. China and some other countries in Asia have adopted policies designed to wrest control of these industries even before they have become fully established, US executives and financiers warn“We invented LEDs but we’re losing the business to Asia, and it’s the same with solar,” says Mr Watkins of Bridgelux.The game is not yet lost. For now, in some industries that are still forming, the Valley boasts an impressive array of start-ups. In areas such as electric vehicles, advanced solar manufacturing and energy storage, it has established a technological lead, says Alan Salzman, managing partner of Vantage Point, a venture capital firm that specialises in green tech. “If this is the industrial revolution of the 21st century, then this is where the jobs are going to come from,” he adds.If it is not to become left behind in businesses such as these, the industry’s leaders say, it is time for a policy rethink. “Simply put, the US needs to decide it is ‘open for business’ and willing to compete in the global marketplace for factories and jobs,” says Paul Otellini, chief executive of Intel. “Costs are higher here, not driven by labour rates but rather by lack of incentives or tax credits that are available to US corporations in most other countries.” Without education reform, there will be a “critical engineering skills gap [that] will ultimately translate into fewer jobs and inventions in this country”.The administration of President Barack Obama has signalled its greater willingness to consider such calls, though it is not yet clear whether powerful tech companies such as Intel will get what they want.Silicon Valley may still act as a magnet for the world’s engineering and entrepreneurial talent. It is the place where many of the brightest Indian, Chinese and European brains still congregate. Facebook’s success is evidence that “innovation is still kicking” and the American melting pot is still happening, says Mr Myhrvold. But for the country at large, it would not pay to take that much for granted.
109;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-12-10T23:38:38Z;Equity X factor often spells exasperation;X doesn't often mark the spot;Investors should be wary when companies show more flair for marketing their shares than their products. In his 1989 bestseller One Up on Wall Street, investing legend Peter Lynch warns that “a flashy name in a mediocre company attracts investors and gives them a false sense of security”, and he specifically cautions against buying stocks that have an x in their name.Though I am inclined to give a man who generated average annual returns of 29 per cent for Magellan, the world’s largest mutual fund, the benefit of the doubt, Mr Lynch’s acolytes have no way of knowing whether his warning was the investing equivalent of an old wives’ tale. Until now, that is.There are 109 stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index, among the broadest measures of US equities, that either begin or end with an x, and a few that do both. One obvious measure of how speculative such “x stocks” are is their price-to-earnings ratios but, in the first hint that Mr Lynch was on to something, only 49 of them made a profit in the past year. A way around this is to aggregate the market value and net earnings of the entire group. The results are not pretty. “X Inc” trades at a steep 29 times trailing earnings versus 18 for the entire index. On price-to- book, a measure that cannot be negative, the average “x stock” trades at 4.9 times, nearly, more than double the index. They are also twice as volatile on average.Unsurprisingly, the list is packed with futuristic-sounding names like GigOptix, Cytrix, Keryx Biopharma, Affymetrix and Oncogenex that offer technological promise but scant profits. Some that are profitable like Netflix must keep growing rapidly to justify current multiples. Partially making up for this are some large, profitable companies in the relatively dowdy logistics and retail industries such as FedEx, CSX and TJX. And then there are those like Idexx and Xilinx that break the stereotype by adding a gratuitous second x while sporting pedestrian valuations. The company that blazed the trail for double-x stocks was Xerox, a blue-chip that appreciated by 5,000 per cent during the 1960s after changing its name from Haloid. Inventing the photocopier probably helped too.Still, an x can often spell even worse trouble than a frothy valuation. A disproportionate number of “x stocks” have been embroiled in scandal, with Canada’s Bre-X being perhaps the largest. The company was on the verge of being bought by Freeport-McMoRan after supposedly discovering the world’s largest gold mine in Indonesia. When it emerged that ore samples had been infused with jewellery shavings, Bre-X’s lead geologist became the fall guy – literally – plunging to his death from a company helicopter.Another “x stock,” the futuristic-sounding YBM Magnex, lured investors with purportedly surging industrial magnet sales. After being valued at $1bn in 1998, it was exposed as a money-laundering front for Russia’s leading mafia kingpin.Weirdest of all was Solv-Ex. The company, which claimed to have developed a novel way to extract Canadian oil sands, so impressed British fund manager Peter Young that he set up unauthorised offshore accounts to magnify his exposure to the firm. When it emerged that its plant and technology were a sham, it cost his employer Morgan Grenfell an estimated £400m. Mr Young became a tabloid sensation by coming to court in a dress, pleading insanity.One does not have to be a Scrabble star to grasp how rare the letter x is in the English language – Samuel Morse did so when developing his code – so modern-day telegraph operators would surely notice that listed companies with an x in their name show up about 17 times more than common words.Lynch retired a decade before the dotcom bubble burst. It would have been interesting to see how he steered the billions at his disposal when confronted with glamour stocks such as Pets.com. Retiring in the prime of his career, he avoided the dilemma of ignoring his instincts or facing outflows to rivals claiming he “just didn’t get it”. His seemingly throwaway comment about x stocks is yet more evidence that he most certainly did.
110;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-11-19T22:37:52Z;Breaking the glass ceiling at home;Corporate queen should wed male Kate Middleton;On the front of Wednesday’s Financial Times was a picture of Kate Middleton smiling adoringly at the future king of England and giving every impression of delight over her new job as the nation’s foremost corporate wife.The image was at odds with the message emblazoned across the skyline that day about thrusting corporate women. It was even more at odds with the magazine folded into the paper containing the FT’s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in world business.When I had tired of ogling Ms Middleton’s hand, held stiffly so as to show off the sapphire engagement ring that used to belong to her dead mother-in-law-to-be, I turned to the article inside. It was an account of how successful career women are all getting stuck in the “marzipan layer” just below the boardroom. According to the author, Sylvia Hewlett of Columbia University, this is because too few men are willing to pull women up on to the top of the cake. Men, she argues, are worried about being seen to support a woman too openly because they fear they might be suspected of having an affair with her.This strikes me as a pretty feeble reason for the lack of women CEOs. Prof Hewlett is right to say that men hold women back, but is wrong to think the holding back happens at work. In fact, it happens at home. The biggest reason that alpha women don’t become CEOs is that they have made the common, yet fatal, error of marrying an alpha man.My evidence for this is based on long observation of the women I know. Some of them did brilliantly for a bit, but then their careers stalled. The problem was not that they had had too many children (successful women seem to have lots of them) but that their alpha husbands insisted on putting their own careers first.Until last week this was just a vague prejudice. But on Wednesday I sat down with the FT’s list of the 50 top business women and Googled each one, searching for information about their home lives. Annoyingly, some of them have succeeded in keeping their private lives private, but with the rest I found my theory spectacularly well borne out. Nearly all have children, but I could not find a single one with an alpha male husband.The only whiff of an alpha mate came from the household of Andrea Jung, CEO of Avon, whose husband was the CEO of Bloomingdale’s. I use the past tense not because he lost the job, but because he lost his wife – the marriage didn’t last.As far as I could tell, all the others have husbands who have been prepared to sacrifice their careers in order to aid the glorious ascent of their wives.Indra Nooyi, CEO of Pepsi and the world’s most powerful businesswoman, is married to a man who quit his job and became a consultant to fit in with his wife and children. Ditto with Irene Rosenfeld at Kraft, whose husband decided to be self-employed 20 years ago to help her. Ditto with Ursula Burns at Xerox.There are three pretty obvious reasons an alpha husband is a problem for the aspiring female CEO. First is logistics. If you want to be really successful you need to be mobile. You need to have a husband like Gregg Ahrendts, who wound up his construction business so Angela could move to London to be CEO of Burberry. You also need to have someone who is prepared to see the children occasionally. And above all you need a bit of encouragement. If you have spent all day competing with men at work, you don’t want to go on competing at home. You want someone like Lloyd Bean, Ursula Burns’s husband, who worked at Xerox long before she joined, but who claimed delight when his wife whizzed past him in the fast lane. Or like the husband of the Indian banking supremo Chanda Kochhar. She says he is “genuinely happy about my progress”.The lesson for a future female corporate queen is to give more thought to her choice of spouse. She should go for someone who is mentally her match, but who is happy to play a supporting role. In other words, Mr Right should be a male Kate Middleton.Alas, there is a problem here in both demand and supply. High-flying women are programmed to go for high-flying men. Most men aren’t attracted to women who are more successful than they are. And until those things change, there is not going to be more than the odd sprinkling of women emerging from the sticky yellow marzipan into the glorious royal icing on top.lucy.kellaway@ft.com
111;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-11-16T20:48:20Z;6. Ursula Burns;;This profile is part of the FT’s 2010 Women at the Top ranking of 50 prominent businesswomen around the world.6. Ursula Burns, 52Nationality: AmericanCompany: XeroxSector: Business servicesLocation: USThree-year TSR: 154.1%Ursula Burns is making history: the first African-American woman to lead an S&P 100 company and the first woman to take over from another woman chief executive of an S&P 100 company. Her back-story is the American dream come to life. Raised by a single mother who ran a daycare centre and ironed shirts by night, Burns grew up in a housing project in New York. She first worked at Xerox as a summer intern and finished as the boss. She has never worked anywhere else.She was strongly influenced by a mother who believed “where you are is not who you are” and ensured Burns got a college education – first a BSc in mechanical engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of New York University and then a masters from Columbia. Burns’ progress at Xerox went into warp drive when Wayland Hicks, then a senior executive, saw potential in the outspoken 31-year-old and offered her a job as his assistant. She thought at first that he wanted her to be a kind of secretary, but soon realised that the job offered her a rich and privileged insight into the inner workings of the firm. Her boldness and fearlessness were rare qualities in the company whose culture she has described as “terminal niceness”.In 1991, she became executive assistant to Paul Allaire, then chairman and chief executive, and was promoted to vice-president of global manufacturing. By the time she was made senior vice-president in 2000, she began working closely with chief executive Anne Mulcahy in what both have described as a true partnership, building a strategy for the company.Xerox is in transition. Burns got the top job not only in the depths of recession, but also at a time when the company has been striving to meet the digital challenge for a decade. With sliding revenues and in a digital age when the printed page is no longer at the heart of business transactions, Xerox is overdue a transformation. The brand that became a transitive verb now needs redefinition.With the $6.4bn acquisition of ACS, the IT outsourcing services company, in February this year, Burns has made the move to start that transformation. The purchase adds 80,000 staff and builds a platform for a new services business. It makes Xerox a $22bn global leader in document management and business processes. With new products aimed at the fast-growth small and medium-sized enterprises market, it is also diversifying its client base away from the biggest companies.Recent advertising stresses the variety of services it offers, from claims reimbursement to human resources benefits management. Burns is a board director of American Express and involved in non-profit organisations including First (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), the National Academy Foundation, MIT and the US Olympic Committee. She was last year named by President Barack Obama to help lead the White House national programme on science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and was appointed as vice-chairwoman of the President’s Export Council in March this year.

113;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-11-10T23:32:43Z;Choose tomorrow’s leader today;;"W ith so much hanging on successful leadership, you might expect boards to be experts at picking the perfect candidate to pilot their companies. Recent chief executive shake-outs at BP, Nokia and LG Electronics suggest otherwise.Concerns over succession are not confined to the handful of premature CEO departures that play out in the media spotlight. Berkshire Hathaway’s announcement last month of Todd Combs as an investment manager prompted speculation that he could be the chosen successor to 80-year-old Warren Buffett.In Creating People Advantage 2010, a recent global executive survey conducted by Boston Consulting Group and the World Federation of People Management Associations, half the respondents identified gaps in their ability to generate tomorrow’s CEOs. Yet, paradoxically, CEO succession ranks higher on boardroom agendas than ever.Treating succession as an “event, rather than a process or a discipline” is a common failing, says Roselinde Torres, a partner at BCG who leads the company’s leadership practice. History has a habit of repeating itself, she says: the loss of one CEO triggers a search, internal candidates are scrutinised and headhunters summoned. Then the directors make a choice and succession drops off the agenda – until next time.Yet sustained investment in succession can pay dividends. A long-standing policy of developing future leaders allowed McDonald’s to appoint the current CEO Jim Skinner to replace Jim Cantalupo and then Charlie Bell, who died within a year of each other, without hiring externally. Richard Floersch, chief human resources officer, says McDonald’s now requires managers right down to individual restaurants to name “ready-now” and “ready-future” candidates who could replace them. The relevant employees then agree on a career development plan.At Procter & Gamble, CEO Bob McDonald has had his feet under the desk for just over a year, but already half a dozen hopefuls are locked in competition to succeed him. Between now and the next succession, the contenders will be wined and dined, mentored and given development roles designed to reveal “how they stack up against each other”, says Moheet Nagrath, global HR officer. “It’s a constant process that takes place year in year out.”The P&G model resembles the General Electric horse race in which Jack Welch pitted successor Jeff Immelt against rival contenders James McNerney and Bob Nardelli, both of whom left to run other companies. While less of a gamble than grooming a single heir-apparent, who could fall from grace or be poached by a competitor, contests still need managing to deliver the best candidate.Getting succession on the agenda can be a challenge in itself. Although boards are ultimately responsible for CEO appointments, the fact that non-executives do not work in the business means that, in practice, it is the incumbent CEO, assisted by the chief human resources officer, who develops the succession pool and puts forward candidates. “If CEOs want to duck the succession issue they find ways of doing it,” says Joseph Bower, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of The CEO Within.Criteria for choosing between candidates are not hard and fast. If the outgoing CEO has done well, a business may be tempted to go for a clone who, it hopes, will do the same. But this risks picking leaders to fight yesterday’s battles. As Chip Goodyear, former CEO of BHP Billiton, puts it: “There’s not one right CEO [for a business].” A strong financial manager may suit a recession; whereas an upturn may favour an entrepreneur.At BHP Billiton, Mr Goodyear developed a handful of managers who could replace him. The board chose Marius Kloppers. But all the frontrunners, Mr Goodyear says, “could handle a CEO role”.Mr Goodyear, who joined BHP as chief financial officer, is himself no stranger to the highs and lows of leadership transition. Having parachuted into the CEO job in a leadership crisis in 2003, he transformed the organisation after its merger with Billiton into one of the world’s most successful mining businesses. Last year, however, he joined Temasek Holdings, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, as CEO-elect. But disagreements on strategy led to his appointment being terminated before he took up the role. Of this experience he merely comments: “When you come in from the outside …there are going to be risks.”Being involved part-time in the business means boards have limited chances to study candidates close up, potentially favouring the biggest self-promoters. One way round this, says Richard Emerton, a senior client partner at executive search group Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann, is to give candidates special projects so directors can “observe and interrogate them on a genuine business issue”. Better still, he adds, is if the incumbent can be prevailed upon to hand over some of his or her responsibilities so the board can watch how the contenders shape up in actual CEO roles.Persuading CEOs that this is a good idea could prove tough, however. In the October issue of the Harvard Business Review Anne Mulcahy, former CEO of Xerox, described how hard she had found it to “give up power and accountability” to Ursula Burns, her preferred successor.According to Shlomo Ben-Hur, a professor of leadership and organisational behaviour at IMD, thousands of years of human history have primed leaders to mistrust power-sharing: “As the chief of a tribe, you don’t necessarily want to assign a deputy. You want to remain [powerful] until the very end.”How much consideration should companies give to external candidates? Analysis by Booz & Co, the consultancy, suggests that internally appointed CEOs generate higher shareholder returns than external hires. But that is not to say companies can ignore the world outside. If competitors are generating better candidates, you need to know about it.One company hoping to break the rule that insiders outperform outsiders is Unilever. In 2008, its board selected Paul Polman, a former P&G and Nestlé executive, as its first externally appointed CEO. “We had three outstanding internal candidates. But Paul was better, so he got the job,” says Sandy Ogg, chief human resour­ces officer.The divisions that succession contests create can return to haunt a new leader. If the contest is bruising, there is a strong chance the defeated candidates will leave – followed shortly by their protégés and associates, who may have concluded that their own prospects look gloomy, with their guy out of the picture.P&G acted to forestall such an outcome. Before taking office, Mr McDonald sat down with Mr Nagrath and outgoing CEO A.G. Lafley to draw up a list of high-fliers at risk of leaving that he would get to know as soon as his appointment was announced. “If you don’t know the new leader,” Mr Nagrath says, “it’s only human nature to ask ‘where does that leave me?’”The appointment of a new CEO might solve the immediate problem of who will lead the company. But, if followed by an exodus of tomorrow’s rising stars, the problem won’t stay solved for long."
114;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-10-13T22:44:05Z;CBOE to launch electronic options market;;The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options-trading venue, said on Wednesday it plans to launch a new, all-electronic exchange on October 29. It will be the US’s ninth options exchange.C2, the new exchange, represents the CBOE’s attempt to attract a bigger slice of the high-frequency securities trading market. It will be based in New York, to enable the fastest access for firms based there, and will use “maker-taker” pricing, a model adopted from the equities market in which trading firms get paid rebates for “making” liquidity and customers are charged for “taking” liquidity.“Maker-taker” is markedly different from the “payment for order flow” system used at the CBOE, in which customers trade free, but market-makers pay a fee that is redistributed back through them to pay broker-dealers for providing customer order flow.The new exchange will enter an already crowded and fragmented market in which options exchanges hotly contest every fraction of market share. Since several electronic exchanges already use “maker-taker” fees, some critics charge C2 will bring nothing new to the market.However, the CBOE could significantly grow the electronic options market if it were to introduce trading options on SPX, the S&P 500 index, a hugely popular proprietary product now principally traded on the floor in Chicago.CBOE said C2 would begin on its first day with options on Ford and within the first week would roll out trading on AT&T, Merck, McDonald’s, Texas Instruments, Xerox, and exchange traded funds on the S&P 500 Depositary Receipts, PowerShares QQQ Trust and iShares Russell 2000 index.The exchange said C2 would be “capable” of listing exclusive products such as SPX, and said “plans for those products [are] expected to be announced at a later date”.It said that more than 30 firms had already connected or were in the process of connecting to C2. Market-makers would pay $5,000 a month to access the exchange while regular trading access would cost $1,000 per month.The International Securities Exchange, an all-electronic exchange owned by Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, that is one of the CBOE’s fiercest rivals, has also said it is considering launching a second exchange. Both NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX operate two US options exchanges.The CBOE has filed a petition for a “declaratory judgment” from an Illinois federal court in an attempt to pre-empt litigation from the ISE that could re-ignite a five-year-old case in which the ISE sued the CBOE, claiming the Chicago-based company had infringed on its patent for an automated order-matching system. That case is not yet resolved.The CBOE said on Wednesday that it did not know when a decision would come in its request for a judgment, but that the issue would not delay the launch of C2 as planned.
115;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Summers’ replacement;The idea that Obama needs someone ‘business friendly’ is ridiculous;Rumour has it that Larry Summers, one of sharpest economists of his generation, will be replaced in the job of explaining economics to the President of the United States by someone with a degree in English who once ran a photocopying company (Anne Mulcahy, Xerox). With mid-term elections looming, Mr Obama’s administration supposedly wants to be seen to be more “business friendly”.But what does that even mean? If it means keeping businesses afloat, it is hard to see how any government can be friendlier. Most of the country’s 7,800-odd banks owe their continued existence to the various liquidity facilities, backstops, loans and bail-outs rushed into existence during the financial crisis. By extension, every company reliant on banks for funding should also “friend” Mr Obama on Facebook.“Business friendly” could mean supporting profits. Under Mr Obama’s reign, amid the nastiest downturn in generations, corporate profits after taxes have actually leapt by a third, according to Federal Reserve data. Friendly might mean helping investors. If so, the president and shareholders should be BFF. The near doubling of equity prices which began just seven weeks after his inauguration was one of the steepest in history.Those reckoning Mr Obama hates business cannot agree on the problem. Bailed-out Wall Street complains of tougher regulations. Main Street moans about special treatment for banks. Stimulus spending might crowd out “real” companies, or maybe the government should do do more to save jobs.Perhaps the whining is really about corporate taxes. In the second quarter, they were running at an annualised $442bn rate – the same as at the height of the credit boom in 2007. That possibility is worth debating. Mr Obama’s supposed unfriendliness to juridical persons – and his potential hiring of unqualified natural persons in response – is not.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
116;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-09-23T03:04:13Z;Obama pressed to look at CEOs to replace Summers;;Lawrence Summers’ looming departure as director of the National Economic Council will offer Barack Obama, US president, his biggest opportunity since taking office of reshaping the administration’s approach to economic policy.No sooner had the White House announced Mr Summers’ return to Harvard University on Wednesday night, speculation began swirling around Washington regarding possible candidates to be Mr Obama’s top adviser on the economy.Even though no selection or announcement is expected in the near future – and might not occur until after the midterm elections – White House staffers have for some time been working on a shortlist of possible replacements for Mr Summers as it became clear that the post would be vacant at the end of the year.Amid persistent criticism, particularly from Republicans and business lobbyists, that administration policies have been too harsh on corporate America, Mr Obama could select a top executive as his chief adviser.Some names have already surfaced, from Indra Nooyi, chair and chief executive of PepsiCo, to Anne Mulcahy, former chair and chief executive of Xerox. He might consider Penny Pritzker, a member of the Chicago family that founded the Hyatt hotels empire who backed his campaign for president and was considered for a cabinet post during the transition period.“There is something very legitimate about having run a business and created value and I think the administration could lean in that direction,” said Michael Greenstone, head of the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project, which is close to the Obama White House.But whether a business executive would be suited to the role of NEC director – which involves gathering policy proposals from different branches of the administration and selecting the best for presentation to the president – is a different matter. “It can be tough going from being chief executive to being staff, even if it is high-ranking staff, and not everyone can make that transition,” says Phillip Swagel, a senior Treasury department official during the Bush administration.Tony Fratto, deputy press secretary under Mr Bush, said a CEO as NEC director, would “most likely be a disaster”.“CEOs are used to leading and being followed. The NEC director’s job isn’t to lead. Instead, it’s to be the ‘honest broker’ on behalf of the president,” said Mr Fratto, now at Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington, in a blog for CNBC.One possible, though less high-profile, candidate with private sector and government experience is Diana Farrell, deputy director of the NEC who was instrumental in forging many of the Obama administration’s economic policies, including financial reform legislation. She was previously a top executive at McKinsey, the global consultancy.Other deputies have filled senior roles on the economic team, including Jack Lew, the proposed budget director, and Austan Gools-bee, the new chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. If Mr Obama decides to shy away from a business executive, he might choose Laura Tyson, an economist at Berkeley, or Gene Sperling, a senior Treasury official. Both held the position of NEC director during the Clinton administration.Robert Gibbs, White House press secretary, said the selection process was “ongoing”. “I think the po-tential candidates that the White House will look at will be a broad group of people representing a whole host of backgrounds,” he said.

Verdict: ()

Whenever two men wearing ties walk into a television commercial and the voice-over at the end talks about things like “automating your global invoice process” or “designing and producing direct mail”, there is a serious risk that viewers will reach for their remotes.Xerox largely gets away with it in a new campaign designed to breathe life into a venerable corporate brand. But this effort to reposition itself as a services company, following a big acquisition last year, is only partially successful.The copier company that no longer wants you to think of it as a copier company has hit on a trope favoured by many in the nebulous field of business or technology services: tie your ads to the more tangible success of your customers.The execution is crisp. In one ad, two business types have an encounter with the mascot of the New York Mets baseball team, who has produced a childishly written group sales report. In another, a man battles into a wind tunnel to ask a rider testing a Ducati motorbike to translate the documents he is carrying into Portuguese. Message: leave the back room stuff to Xerox.Ultimately, though, by summoning up its clients’ brand icons, Xerox only serves to highlight its own lack of strong brand definition as it searches for a future beyond copiers – a problem that its tagline, “Ready for real business”, does little to resolve."
118;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-07-12T19:47:29Z;Aon to buy Hewitt in $4.9bn deal;;"Aon, the US insurance broker, on Monday said it would acquire Hewitt Associates, ­bolstering its human resources consulting arm in a cash and stock deal worth $4.9bn, excluding debt.Aon makes most of its revenues in insurance brokerage and combining its HR consulting business with Hewitt’s will create the world’s largest HR
services provider with $4.3bn in revenues, overtaking Mercer.“As we continue to grow our business, this merger will give us a broader portfolio of innovative products and services focused on what we believe are two of the most important topics in the global economy today – risk and people,” said Greg Case, Aon chief executive.Shares in Aon fell 7 per cent to $35.67 after the deal’s announcement, which valued Hewitt at $50 a share, based on Aon’s close last week – a 41 per cent premium to Hewitt’s stock price on Friday. Hewitt investors will receive $25.61 in cash and 0.6362 Aon common stock shares for each Hewitt share they own.Shares in Hewitt, which has a small net cash position, surged by more than 32 per cent to $46.79 by the close in New York.Aon is paying 7.5 times Hewitt’s 2010 forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, in line, or slightly ahead, of where recent
professional services deals have been struck.Shareholders’ unease reflected the amount of Aon stock being used as payment, rather than the price, argued people close to the deal, adding that Aon had been focused on preserving its balance sheet strength and rating as part of the transaction.The market for providing advice to companies on their HR needs has consolidated in recent years. Towers Perrin last year agreed to merge with Watson Wyatt in a $3.5bn deal, while Xerox, through its Affiliated Computer Services unit, in May agreed to buy an employee ­benefits company from Hewlett-Packard.Russ Fradin, Hewitt’s chief executive, who will lead Aon Hewitt, said in a call with analysts that Hewitt had not been seeking a buyer. Mr Case approached his counterpart with a preliminary offer in early June, according to people familiar with the deal.The companies said the deal would generate $355m in annual cost savings by 2013 from reduced back-office operations, public company costs and management duties.Aon’s acquisition of Hewitt marks its second big expansion in the past two years. In 2008, Aon acquired Benfield, a UK reinsurance company that specialised in quantitative risk modelling, for £844m.Credit Suisse advised Aon on the deal, while Citigroup advised Hewitt. The companies expect the deal to close by mid-November."
119;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-07-07T22:33:31Z;Obama sets up export growth panel;;Barack Obama on Wednesday set up a high-level panel of American chief executives in his effort to double US exports over the next five years, even as economists were sceptical of his chances of getting anywhere near that target.The move, which the US president said would help create higher-paying manufacturing jobs, comes amid mounting concern about the persistence of high unemployment in the build-up to November’s midterm elections.Over the past two months the US private sector has created just 116,000 jobs during a period where almost 1m people have withdrawn from the labour force. Mr Obama said on Wednesday that US exports had grown 17 per cent since the start of the year when he first proclaimed his target of doubling them.“Simply put, export growth leads to job growth and economic growth,” said Mr Obama. “This isn’t just about where American jobs are today. This is where American jobs will be tomorrow.” Mr Obama’s new Export Council will be headed by James McNerney, chief executive of Boeing, and Ursula Burns, chief executive of Xerox.The president also announced steps to boost exports, citing a World Trade Organisation ruling against European Union subsidies to Boeing rival Airbus, and China’s recent agreement to gradually revalue its currency.In addition, Mr Obama last month signalled his intention to push through the bilateral trade agreement with South Korea in spite of opposition from trade unions and Democratic lawmakers. But economists say that even if Mr Obama succeeded in getting Congress to ratify the deal, which is seen as unlikely, it would not be enough.There are more than 100 regional and bilateral trade agreements under negotiation around the world but the US is involved in only one, the Trans Pacific Partnership, the WTO says.“There has never been a five-year period where the US has doubled its exports,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, a research group.“If you wanted to achieve this, you would probably have to overhaul the US tax system and have a value added tax as well as engineering a depreciation in the US dollar. This would be a tall order.”Wednesday’s move comes as Democrats are starting to worry that their party will lose control of the House of Representatives in November. Voters cite the economy and jobs as their main concerns. But Mr Obama’s failure to persuade the majority of voters that last year’s $787bn stimulus helped assuage the downturn has led to political paralysis on Capitol Hill.Senate Democratic leaders have repeatedly failed to enact a package to extend unemployment insurance to 1.2m jobless workers and aid to state governments to prevent teacher layoffs.Because of the backlash against spending, Mr Obama has made only token efforts to push the bill. He is caught between the rock of anti-spending sentiment and the hard place of an economy that is seeing a fall in demand.“It looks like President Obama’s political advisers are getting the upper hand in the debate about the need for a second stimulus,” says Brad DeLong, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. “If they talked to political scientists, they would know that in an election year the health of the economy determines the voters’ mood and right now that mood is looking ominous.”
120;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-06-14T20:54:19Z;The age of ‘Indovation’ dawns;;When Armin Bruck, managing director of Siemens in India, set out to convince the board of the German engineering company of the potential of Indian innovation, he gave them the keys to a Tata Nano. He wanted to convey the “smell and feel” of a revolutionary mass market product and to persuade his company that it should improve its pipeline of local inventions aimed at Indian consumers. So, in February, Peter Löscher, the company’s chief executive, and his colleagues Heinrich Heisinger and Joe Kaeser piled into the world’s cheapest car – priced at $2,000 (€1,630, £1,350) – and drove round New Delhi.The test drive fortified Siemens’ effort to reconfigure its strategy for developing its high-quality engineering technology for low-cost emerging markets. After all, if it could be achieved by an Indian company with a car, why couldn’t the same approach be taken by Europe’s biggest engineering company with iron and steel making equipment, electricity generators and rail carriages?The technological race for India and China’s growing markets among multinationals like Siemens and General Electric, and lesser known local companies like Larsen & Toubro, Bharat Heavy Electricals, Delta and Neusoft, is hotting up fast.Within three months of that February visit, Siemens had declared publicly its intention to develop more than 80 “base level” products – targeted at financially constrained mass markets – with an investment of €3bn ($3.7bn, £2.5bn) in India, China, Russia and Brazil over the next three years. The strategy was first agreed five years ago but has gained momentum under Mr Löscher’s leadership. Across a range of products, including wind power generators and medium voltage switchgear, invention and simplification in India is slashing product development costs by as much as 70 per cent.Siemens expects to raise its order book 10-fold in India from these redesigned products during the next decade to €1bn a year. It also foresees double-digit profitability from the low-cost, high-quality strategy – what in India is called “frugal engineering”.Siemens is concentrating its emerging market innovation efforts in India and China, the world’s fastest growing big economies. India alone is receiving a €1bn investment to develop and adapt products for the local market. Siemens’ Mumbai-based subsidiary, which employs 17,000 people, is working on 42 products that in time will be produced and sold in India and exported to other emerging markets.Among the prototypes, most of which remain secret, are solar powered X-ray machines, fetal heart monitors, steam turbines and road traffic management systems.Siemens’ top executives argue that the company has to be more dominant in emerging markets, which already account for a third of group revenues, to head off growing competition from Chinese and Indian rivals.“These products require a different kind of innovation,” says Mr Löscher. “What counts here is simplicity, not sophistication.”Other multinational companies operating in the power and healthcare sectors have drawn the same conclusions. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch fast-moving consumer goods company, was one of the first to adopt a successful localisation strategy in India. Others are now following.John Flannery, president of GE India, describes his company as having to make a 180-degree shift to understand what the local customer wants. GE’s focus is on what he calls “unstoppable industry trends” to address India’s chronic energy shortfall and healthcare, driven by rising consumption and a young demographic.Mr Flannery talks about “migrating processes” from the US so that products are designed and manufactured in India, with a view to introducing them to developed markets in what GE calls “reverse innovation”.In a 2009 paper for the Harvard Business Review, Jeffrey Immelt, GE’s chief executive, and Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, described two products – “a $1,000 handheld electrocardiogram device and a portable, PC-based ultrasound machine that sells for as little as $15,000” – as “revolutionary”. The devices were small and relatively inexpensive and they were originally “developed for markets in emerging economies (the ECG device for rural India and the ultrasound machine for rural China) and are now being sold in the US”.Some analysts warn that the manufacture of cheaper machines in India may eventually prove disruptive in developed markets, but Siemens insists its strategy makes cold-eyed business sense. The company’s strongest growth is among base-level products in fast-growing large economies.At the core of Siemens’ emerging markets strategy are two acknowledgements. First is the recognition that Siemens engineers in Germany are ill-equipped to understand the needs of the developing world consumer. Mr Bruck says that a German train engineer, familiar with the smooth tracks of his home country and the light demands of 1.9bn passengers a year on the Deutsche Bahn, can barely comprehend Indian conditions where tracks are bumpy and at least 20m people travel on the national rail network a day. He tells of how visiting German engineers, for example, have been aghast to discover that Mumbai’s overloaded commuter trains have no doors.Indian executives at Siemens spotted their opportunity, describing high-end European products as “over-engineered”. Hemant Usgaonkar, works manager of the Siemens X-ray plant in Goa, says the challenge for the headquarters in Munich is to get much closer to what is needed in India’s 600,000 villages, and understand how price sensitive that market is. “They don’t understand what the Indian village scenario is,” he says.Second is the cost advantage of engineering products in India, where engineering skills are 10 times cheaper than in Germany. Additional cost reductions are achieved by avoiding hefty import duties and shipping fees, and stripping out expensive materials and features. The result is that an X-ray machine produced for the Indian market is priced at $10,000 where its higher-end model in Germany costs four times that amount.Not everyone, however, is convinced by the appeal of Indian engineering skills. A survey by the Associated Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the business lobby group, shows that Indian manufacturing has a high defect rate and that about 20 per cent of Indian companies are unable to produce quality products. The use of obsolete machinery and equipment has also led to defects in the automobile and power equipment sector.The survey added that while India has the technical ability to achieve a high-level of precision, few manufacturers were able to produce quality products.Such research has not prevented others from declaring that the age of “ Indovation ” has dawned.“Innovation and ‘Indovation’ are really the key to taking us forward,” says Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “Electronics is going to be a really important driver of change. We will be able to produce more from less.”“Indovations” are springing up in solar power, mobile telephony, medical equipment and toilet technology. Indian engineers have also invented a battery-powered, ultra-low cost refrigerator resistant to power cuts, an automatic teller cash machine for rural areas and even a flour mill powered by scooter.Navi Radjou, the executive director of the Centre for India & Global Business at Cambridge University, says a wave of products is coming to market addressing India’s mass market. Describing India as a “living laboratory”, Mr Radjou identifies multinationals like Xerox, the Tata Group and PepsiCo as finding ways to address scarcity and low income on a grand scale.“Multinationals will have to rely on their next generation products and business models coming from emerging markets which deal a lot with scarcity,” he says. “They have to have the ability to source their ideas from India and scale them up globally.”Certainly, India’s needs are great, and market-based solutions not easy.Sahil Rais, who runs a chain of diagnostic medical centres in the Mumbai area, says an affordable X-ray machine able to work through power cuts could make a radical difference in an area that suffers seven hours of power cuts a day.

But when the power is cut, so are the X-rays.“Once [companies] enter the darkness, they will know the importance of the small light,” Dr Rais says of business people seeking profits in India’s wider market. “It will help get private services into a part of the world where no-one wants to enter.”
121;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-05-10T01:15:54Z;Recession work practices are ‘here to stay’;;"Employers will retain the flexible working practices introduced during the recession even when the job market improves, Manpower, one of the world’s biggest staffing agencies, has said.High-profile deals have seen desperate staff signing up for reduced hours or less pay, instead of risking their jobs – although in some cases, as at JCB, the construction equipment maker, layoffs have eventually followed. Employers such as Xerox, the photocopier supplier, pay staff only when they fix machines, while call centres have started to pay workers only for the hours they are logged on to their computers.But if staff believe agreements such as these are temporary, Mark Cahill, managing director of Manpower UK, which has 8,000 corporate clients in Britain, says employers are keen for the new-found labour market flexibility to become permanent even when demand returns.“The private sector has got used to getting a greater return from their workers and they will be reluctant to return to pre-recession conditions when the downturn is over,” he said. “Flexible engagement has worked fantastically well, so has rewarding output rather than attendance.”At nearly 2.5m, unemployment is high – but not nearly as high as it might have been given the length and severity of the downturn during the past two years.Employers have held on to staff by offering unpaid leave or pay cuts, so are able to ratchet up employees’ hours when demand for services or goods improves.This means there is little evidence yet of a big rise in the hiring of temporary workers, typically the first sign the labour market is emerging from recession, says Manpower, which employs more than 20,000 people every day.Manpower, along with rival staffing groups Adecco and Ranstad, have reported an improvement in the jobs market worldwide after a year in which many staffing groups lost 30 of cent of their revenues.But with the new British government pledging to axe state-funded jobs, there are fears that there could be a second wave of unemployment, with the public sector following its private counterpart in shedding staff.Mr Cahill urged the public sector to resist drastic job cuts, arguing it should focus on raising productivity. Neighbouring boroughs could merge human resource departments and share contract staff, for example, rather than duplicating services.In spite of high unemployment there remains a skill shortage in some industries. In engineering, new “green” energy initiatives are expanding the scope of the industry leading to a dearth of experience; there is also a lack of experienced information technology gaming staff."
122;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-05-05T21:48:06Z;Xerox chief sets out the big picture;;Ursula Burns, chief executive of Xerox, has been working overtime to justify an acquisition designed to transform one of the most famous names in corporate America.The $6.4bn purchase last September of ACS, an IT services company, was guaranteed to get Wall Street’s attention. Coming only two months after Ms Burns took over as chief last summer, it signalled a daring attempt to kick-start growth.After more than a decade in which Xerox had halved its employee numbers to barely 50,000, the deal brought it a further 80,000 workers and opened the door to a new services market.But it also sent a message that Wall Street was quick to recognise: that Xerox’s core printing and copying businesses were going nowhere, forcing it into a big and risky bet.“It may be read that way,” Ms Burns concedes. “That’s not the intention.”A mechanical engineer who joined the company as an intern in 1980, Ms Burns, 51, has a reputation as a tough and effective manager and her no-nonsense New York manner adds to the image. Brought up in poverty as the child of a single mother on New York’s lower east side, she is often blunt. She says she worked on adopting a smoother personal style as she was being groomed to succeed Anne Mulcahy, the former chief who will also hand over the title of chairman to Ms Burns later this month.Ms Burns insists there is still growth to be had from selling printing equipment and supplies such as paper, but adds: “We’ve actually played out as much as we can with the business that we have. If you want to leverage more you have to open up the aperture a bit and actually look broader than your core business.”To justify her ACS bet, she will have to prove that combined, the two companies can sell more than they could have done on their own. Such revenue synergies are notoriously hard to achieve from large acquisitions of companies in separate markets, and explains why investors have yet to fully sign up to the plan. Xerox’s shares slumped 20 per cent after the ACS deal was announced, though they have recovered most of the lost ground.Using ACS’s base in IT and business process outsourcing, Xerox hopes to persuade its customers to hand over a bigger slice of their document-related work to the company.With Xerox’s brand and international reach, Ms Burns also hopes to raise sales by expanding the largely US-based ACS into other countries.Facing a Wall Street analyst meeting for the first time this week, Ms Burns revealed early evidence, in the form of new contracts, to justify her strategy. Her fortunes have also been buoyed by signs of a rebound in Xerox’s business in the first quarter of this year.Yet after more than a decade of grappling with the transition to the digital age, Xerox still has a long way to go to overhaul its business model. The bet on services is a belated response to a problem that has beset all hardware companies, and which led a troubled IBM in the early 1990s to supply the new template for how technology companies should be structured: with a heavy reliance on more consistent and faster-growing software and services.Ms Burns is now racing to catch up, and the final outline of the new Xerox has yet to reveal itself. “Right now it’s not obvious that we need to buy software,” she says. But she does not rule it out.
123;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-04-26T11:21:30Z;Japanese M&A;Cash-rich companies should be looking to buy more overseas;Japanese companies should be snapping up acquisitions all over the world. Balance sheets are light on debt and heavy on cash: Canon, which reported strong first-quarter figures on Monday, has $7.7bn in cash and near-cash, more than LG Electronics, Ericsson and Xerox put together. Debt has rarely been cheaper, with higher-rated companies paying just a few dozen basis points over government bond yields. Paying with stock should be no stretch either, as the world’s highest price/earnings ratios give Japanese issuers the world’s lowest cost of equity. Most significantly, there is precious little nominal growth at home, where vested interests – as in the aborted $25bn Kirin/Suntory deal – often get in the way of mergers aimed at making cost savings. The clincher should be the 25 per cent swing in the yen/dollar rate over the past three years, effectively handing bidders a control premium for free.But despite all this, non-Japanese targets have represented just a fifth of all Japanese companies’ M&A transactions since the beginning of 2009, according to Dealogic. That’s little changed on the average 16 per cent share of foreign deals since 2000.Introspection as an excuse for inaction is becoming less and less valid. The Bank of Japan should confirm this Friday, in its semi-annual economic forecast, that the risk of another recession has almost entirely passed. It is true that a combination of cash to burn and desperation to grow can lead to overbidding, as Daiichi Sankyo showed with Ranbaxy of India. But these supportive conditions won’t last. The yen is beginning to flag, down almost 6 per cent against the dollar since early March. Korean and Chinese competitors aren’t standing still. Financial buyers are limbering up too, and seem prepared to write bigger equity cheques to get deals done. And Japan’s airlines and hotels could do with the custom of a few more M&A bankers. For all these reasons and more, outbound deals need to follow, and quickly.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
124;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-04-23T21:20:59Z;Strong macro data trigger Wall St rally;;US stock prices advanced in a late rally Friday as data releases described a sharply improving economic picture, which came against a backdrop of mostly positive corporate earnings.US new home sales surged 27 per cent in March, the most in five decades, though enthusiasm was muted to a degree because an expiring tax break was credited for some of the increase. Homebuilder shares rose 4.4 per cent.Durable goods machinery orders were up 8.6 per cent and inventories up 0.2 per cent, both catalysts for GDP growth. The ECRI also reported that its leading economic indicators index rose to its highest level since May 2008.In spite of a sharp drop at the end of last week after the Goldman Sachs fraud charges were announced, which led many people to predict a correction would follow, US markets have grasped at positive catalysts, such as earnings beating consensus expectations by Goldman and Apple. Eighty per cent of S&P 500 companies reporting for the quarter have beaten earnings expectations, the highest level since 1993, according to Bloomberg data.“The market has absorbed the Goldman news, a surge in Greek yields, the threat of US financial reform,” said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at agency brokerage Instinet. “For the bears, it must feel like trying to hold a beach ball under water with lotion-coated fingers.”At close, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent at 1,217.28, and 2.1 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 per cent to a weekly 1.7 per cent rise, to 11,204.28, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 2,530.15, clipping a five-day jump of 2.0 per cent.Energy shares led Friday’s gains, with Schlumberger, the oilfield services giant, advancing 6.6 per cent, to $72.68, after its chief executive said margins in his industry had bottomed out. El Paso, the pipeline owner, was also up 6.8 per cent, to $12.50.The big focus for traders during the week were tech shares, as top players reported earnings. Apple jumped 9.5 per cent, to $270.83, touching all-time trading highs, after bursting through expectations for the quarter.Xerox saw shares rocket to $11.32 on Friday, a jump of 8.3 per cent. It beat profit expectations and projected an improvement in its printer-services business. The sector rose 1.7 per cent for the five days.Market sentiment was somewhat damped by reduced outlooks from two key tech bellwethers. Shares in Microsoft on Friday fell 1.3 per cent, to $30.99, as it reduced earnings projections for later this year. Amazon.com, the online retailer, fell 4.3 per cent to $143.63 after it also forecasted a decline in second-quarter revenues.“If we’re going to put a cap on financials through regulation, the question is, can tech produce enough incremental earnings surprises to keep the market moving higher?” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at BNY ConvergEx.Financials, for the time being, showed no signs of slowing. They rose 2.3 per cent on the week, led by regional banks’ improving consumer credit results. Huntington Bank was the top advancer, rising 29 per cent for the five days, as it turned a profit for the first time since 2008.Goldman Sachs said it nearly doubled its earnings, to $3.5bn, for the quarter, though shares declined 2.1 per cent on the week to $157.40. On Friday, American Express was up 2.7 per cent, to $48.05, after profits jumped on rising customer spending.Healthcare were the only fallers on the week, off 0.9 per cent on concerns about the impact of healthcare reform. Baxter International, a supplier of medical chemicals, was down 17 per cent as it reduced its full-year expectations. Biotech drugmaker Gilead Sciences dropped 8.8 per cent.
125;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-04-05T15:44:47Z;Strategy consultants need some new ideas;Edge required in a world with little time to plan;"Good news for McKinsey. International Power, the electricity generator, said last week that it was bringing the consultancy in to offer advice as part of its annual strategy review. IP has to decide whether to proceed with a merger, perhaps with GDF Suez of France, or to continue going it alone.Why bother repeating this seemingly unexceptional piece of news? Because it is an example of something that, according to the current conventional wisdom, happens fairly infrequently nowadays: corporate leadership teams committing to extended strategic analysis, with or without the help of consultants.“Strategy is dead” has become a popular cry. In this fast-moving world, who has time to ruminate and plan? “Decisiveness is about timeliness,” the outgoing chairman of Xerox, Anne Mulcahy, says, funnily enough in an interview with the McKinsey Quarterly. “And timeliness trumps perfection. The most damaging decisions are the missed opportunities, the decisions that didn’t get made in time.”If Ms Mulcahy’s point of view were shared by more executive teams, the strategy consultants would be in trouble. It is certainly shared by those consultancies that emphasise the primacy of action over analysis. The head of one told me recently that “long-winded reports that end up unimplemented need to go. Bedazzling clients …needs to stop.”What do management consultants do, really? A recent three-year study led by Andrew Sturdy, professor of organisational behaviour at Warwick Business School, concluded that “consultants are not as innovative or different as is often thought.” Indeed: “Prospective clients were unlikely to welcome consultants if their knowledge was ‘too new’.” Consultants act like “knowledge brokers”: helping management to embed and then implement ideas that have been lent credibility by the endorsement of the consultants themselves.The truth is that, over the past few years, much of the mystique of management consulting has faded. There are not many first-time buyers of their services out there. Clients and consultants have a lot in common. They speak the same business language. Many clients may be former consultants themselves. And procurement teams are beating up consultants on price.The world does not owe consultancies a living. After all, there was a time, not so long ago, when people ran their businesses without the help of strategy consulting firms. This was because they did not yet exist.Some of the most familiar names from the world of management consulting – Bain & Company, Boston Consulting Group – are relatively young organisations (less than 50 years old). Even the longer-established McKinsey did not call itself an adviser on strategy until the late 1970s.This story is told in a new book, The Lords of Strategy, written by Walter Kiechel, formerly editorial director of Harvard business publishing and managing editor of Fortune magazine. He argues that the role of these consultancies in the invention of what we now call strategy has been underappreciated.Planning is what business leaders used to do. Strategy is a more modern term, popularised from the 1960s onwards. But what Mr Kiechel reveals is that strategy is not merely a concept. It is also a product. It was the strategy firms’ ingenuity that helped them to get established. They have been geniuses of marketing as well as of business analysis.A dose of scepticism is thus in order. Mr Kiechel quotes from the opening chapter of In Search of Excellence (1981), the anti-strategy best-seller written by those two McKinsey mavericks, Tom Peters and Robert Waterman. “An organisation chart is not a company, nor a new strategy a complete answer to corporate grief,” they declared. “We all know this; but like as not, when trouble lurks, we call for a new strategy and probably reorganise.” By the mid-1980s both men had left McKinsey.As Chris McKenna showed in his study of management consulting, The World’s Newest Profession, the triumph of the strategy houses was down to their inventiveness and nerve, going back over seven decades to the day when James O. McKinsey and Company rebranded itself as “accountants and engineers” from the less thrilling “certified public accountants”, even though the firm employed no licensed engineers. To survive in the 21st century, strategy consultants may have to reinvent themselves again.stefan.stern@ft.com"
126;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-03-31T19:52:23Z;Apple expands its touchy-feely vision;Richard Waters on this weekend’s US launch of the iPad tablet;This weekend’s launch of Apple’s iPad in the US– with an international debut expected later in the month – will be a polarising moment. The television news will linger on the queues outside Apple stores, and fans will be seen drooling over these latest shiny objects of techno-lust. Doubters, meanwhile, will point out that general purpose tablet-style computers such as this have always bombed before – and if the touch-screen interface is so revolutionary, why is Apple going to sell an old-fashioned keyboard to plug into it?To focus on issues such as these, though, would be to miss the point. This launch is about much more than just another piece of personal technology hardware, no matter how desirable. For the iPad is an extension of the most significant new development in computing since the birth of the personal computer. If it takes off, it would seal Apple’s rebound to the very top of the heap in the computing world. Starting with the iPhone in 2007 and followed by the iPod Touch the same year, Apple has been changing the way people relate to intelligent portable devices. Touch has become the interface and connected “app stores” the new place to find services and content.Between them, the iPhone and the Touch already represent the fastest-growing new computing platform in history, according to Mary Meeker, internet analyst with Morgan Stanley. With the iPad, Apple is now staking out a big piece of extra territory for this platform. General purpose, tablet-style devices have proved a graveyard for technology companies before. But with a model honed on the iPhone, Apple starts with a better chance than others. And even if initial sales are disappointing – as they were for the iPod and iPhone – Apple has at least outlined the shape of a big new potential market for the army of software developers who have hitched their fortunes to its technology.The iPhone/ iPod Touch/ iPad platform is defined by a number of ingredients. Mark Rolston, chief creative officer of Frog Design, a design company with a heavy emphasis on technology products, calls this “casual computing” – a more personal and intuitive way to interact with intelligent devices, and the information and services they make available. Touch, the most obvious aspect of this new paradigm, is more than just an easy and direct way to issue commands. It also brings tactile pleasure: stroking the device to elicit the desired result is an important part of the experience.Another aspect is the ease with which it fits into the flow of daily life. There is no need to boot it up, or even to flip up a lid: just look at the screen and tap a couple of times. The iPad may not have the same extreme portability as the iPhone, but it shares the same heritage.A third important element of this new platform is its end-to-end nature. It draws information from closely connected services over the internet, turning a simple gadget into the delivery mechanism for a carefully designed experience. The venerable combination of iPod and iTunes, now seven years old, supplied the blueprint, but the iPhone and App Store and – this weekend – the iPad and iBook Store have extended the idea.These characteristics are not unique to Apple. Others have been racing to copy it. Amazon, with its Kindle and connected book store, applied some of these lessons to the book world even before Apple. Google, with its heavy investment in online services, poses a particular challenge. It has already demonstrated internet-powered capabilities on Android, its own mobile software platform, that should make Apple blanch: an image recognition service, for example, that identifies a picture of any landmark taken on a handset, or an instant voice translation capability. The Google juggernaut is gathering momentum. It is preparing to launch a second software platform, called Chrome OS, later this year, with the aim of creating a more streamlined way of delivering internet-based services. It took less than a year and a half from the launch of the iPhone for the first smartphone built on Google’s software. A rival to the iPad may take half that.With its mastery of creating end-to-end experiences, however, as well as the big early lead chalked up by the iPhone, Apple is still the company to beat. It is tempting to trace advances in technology by the higher speed, lower price or greater convenience they bring. But the real power of a new platform lies in the new forms of behaviour it makes possible, most of which cannot be anticipated.John Seely Brown, a former head of the Xerox research labs that gave birth to much of the underlying technology of personal computing, credits Apple’s platform with changing everyday life in unexpected ways. He calls the iPhone, for example, a “curiosity amplifier” – any dinner-party conversation is liable to lead to someone pulling out their iPhone to resolve a dispute or check a fact, changing the direction of the discussion. The full impact of a technology that fits into everyday life like this has yet to be understood, he says.It is not immediately clear how the iPad will fit this picture. It comes, at launch, dressed mainly as a media consumption device – a better place than the iPhone to read books, watch video, or flick through new electronic versions of magazines that offer video as well as text and pictures. But, as with the iPhone, the real story will lie in how it is taken up and used – and how quickly other application developers find ways to exploit its unique characteristics to create new experiences. There are certainly reasons for doubt. The larger screen may make it less portable than a smartphone, its lack of a built-in keyboard less useful as an input device than a PC or Mac. But the iPad’s 9.7 inch, high-resolution screen is about to become the virgin territory on which the computer industry’s next dreams will be sketched.The writer is the FT’s San Francisco bureau chief
127;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-03-18T16:30:39Z;Sorting out the printing device ‘zoo’;;"Straight-talking James De Watteville doesn’t mince his words when it comes to describing his company’s sprawling estate of printing devices. ”It’s a zoo,” he says, ”and it needs sorting out.”That “zoo” is populated by around 1,000 printers, serving 8,000 people across 22 different sites in the UK. Some of the devices are ancient, some are unreliable. A complex mesh of maintenance agreements and in-house resources are dedicated to their care and attention. It is far too expensive.Mr De Watteville is chief information officer of insurance company RSA (formerly Royal Sun Alliance), and he describes a situation that will sound familiar to many IT bosses, according to Louella Fernandes, an analyst with IT market research company Quocirca.”Many print environments still have a tangled mix of old and new equipment, both over and underutilised, leading to high costs due to the variety of consumables (both storage and procurement) as well as the financial and environmental costs associated with paper, ink, toner and energy consumption,” she says.”Often, management and procurement of the printing infrastructure is distributed across locations and geographies, with no centralised tracking system to monitor and analyse costs.”The true cost of unmanaged printing can startle businesses, she says. Industry estimates suggest companies spend between 1 and 3 per cent of their annual revenues on maintaining printer estates. Analysts at Gartner, meanwhile, estimate that using managed print services [MPS] can reduce that by between 10 and 30 per cent.”Under MPS, a service provider takes primary responsibility for meeting the customer’s office printing needs, including the printing equipment, the supplies, the service and overall management of the printer fleet,” Gartner’s report explain.”The main components provided are a needs assessment, selective or general replacement of hardware, and the services and supplies needed to operate the new and/or existing hardware.”MPS services also extend to the kinds of high-volume printing requirements typically provided by an internal reprographics department or, alternatively, a third-party printing provider, says Carsten Bruhn, vice president of Ricoh Global Service Europe.In a recent conversation with a large organisation in Finland, he was told that materials such as marketing documents were typically outsourced to a third party, who insisted on minimum print volumes for each project. Now, under that company’s MPS deal with Ricoh, it outsources that requirement to Ricoh, which prints as many – or as few – copies as needed, allowing the company to customise materials for customers in different markets. Mr De Watteville at RSA hopes that a newly signed MSP contract will alleviate many of the headaches he and his team face. During the first quarter of 2010, printer manufacturer Kyocera Mita will begin replacing RSA’s printer estate with 375 multi-function devices, reducing the ratio of printers-to-people from 1:8 to 1:21.Kyocera Mita will also take over the management of the refreshed estate, relieving RSA staff of the burden. Mr De Watteville says that, as a result, the company’s spend on printing over the next five years will shrink from £7.5m to £2.5m. At the same time, the new MPS contract will help RSA meet key environmental targets, says Paul Pritchard, RSA’s UK head of corporate responsibility. ”Fewer printers mean reduced energy consumption – but it will help us drive some important behavioural changes in the area of paper consumption as well.”The company’s efforts to encourage staff to print on both sides of paper have only been partially successful, he explains. Some of the current machines don’t even allow it but the new multi-function devices will have double-sided printing as the default option.According to Gartner, MPS have so far only penetrated between 5 and 20 per cent of the target market. Very large organisations are the ones likely to gain most benefits from MPS, they say, ”because they probably have a widely dispersed printing environment with big potential for print optimisation”. But all can benefit.However, companies appear to struggle to choose the right MPS provider, says Gartner analyst Ken Weilerstein. Definitions of the services on offer vary, he says, and MPS providers’ websites typically provide only vague indications of what the vendors do. ”In part [this is] because MPS tends to be more customised than print hardware.”The problem, he says, is getting worse as new kinds of MPS providers emerge, including most of the printer/copier manufacturers and dealers and even office supplies wholesalers. To emphasise its role in the market, Hewlett-Packard has launched a global business unit called Managed Enterprise Services (MES), with a view to boosting its MPS offering. This will be led by Bruce Dahlgren, an HP senior vice president, and draws heavily on resources acquired in HP’s purchase of EDS.HP has also introduced a “Payback Guarantee” for its MPS customers. Mr Dahlgren explains: ”In conversations with customers, we’re hearing that a lack of visibility means that the big costs associated with printers are not being addressed.“ Under the scheme, any company that does not make the cost savings that HP’s consultants project for them within 12 months will be refunded the shortfall.Other companies make similar offers. Xerox, for example, guarantees total cost of ownership reductions within year one of deployment. Unlike other MPS providers, Xerox does not force a refresh of the printer fleet, but will take over management of other manufacturer’s printers if the customer requests it, according to Andy Jones, director and general manager of Xerox Global Services.US-based manufacturer Ingersoll Rand has recently signed a nine-year MPS contract with Xerox to deal with its complex estate of printers that fall into three different categories, according to John Kalka, vice president of deployment in Ingersoll Rand’s Office of the CIO. Some printers are owned by Ingersoll-Rand; some are leased; and some are already under a MPS contract with Xerox.Under the new Xerox contract, printers in the first and last categories will be replaced only on an as-needed basis, while those that are leased will be decommissioned. ”We needed a strategic partner we could make responsible for both quality and cost in a truly variable cost model based on usage,” says Mr Kalka. By bringing their printer estates under MPS, a further benefit is that no document will appear in a printer tray until the person requiring it is at the printer and has authorised it. At RSA, for example, staff will swipe their employee badge on the printer’s reader. Other companies use Pin codes to achieve the same thing. That kind of service is addressing an issue that many businesses continue to overlook, says Graham Long, vice president of Samsung’s European printing operation. Unsecured printing environments, he claims, pose serious risks for European companies that could result in legal action, lost clients and lost revenue – and yet few business are aware of the reputational and financial risks their printing infrastructure poses.In research recently conducted by the company among 4,500 workers across Europe. More than half of respondents (56 per cent) said that they see confidential company documents, printed by someone else, sitting on the printer at least once a month. One in five claim to see such documents every day. "
128;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-03-12T02:42:39Z;Hopes rise as US trade gap narrows;;Plunging domestic demand for oil and foreign cars unexpectedly narrowed the US trade gap in January, official figures showed on Thursday, lifting hopes for stronger economic growth in the first quarter.The trade deficit fell by 6.5 per cent to $37.3bn (€27.31bn, £24.81bn), clashing with economists’ predictions that the gap would widen.The commerce department data came as Barack Obama, president, unveiled five steps that he said would lead to the doubling of US exports and the creation of 2m jobs within the next five years.Under the “National Export Initiative”, the Obama administration will establish boards to focus on boosting exports, expand export financing and help US exporters in existing and new markets.The Export Promotion Cabinet will comprise the secretaries of state, treasury, agriculture, commerce and labour, while a re-launched president’s export council, which will become the principal national advisory committee on international trade, will be headed by Jim McNerney and Ursula Burns, the chief executives of Boeing and Xerox respectively.In January, both imports and exports declined after months of higher trends. Exports fell by $500m to $142.6bn from the prior month, while imports dropped by $3.1bn to $180bn. The fall in exports was the first since last April.“While we believe the recent rates of increase are unsustainable, especially for imports, trends do not usually change as suddenly as this,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. “We are happy to see the deficit drop in January but it is not representative of the true picture.”Meanwhile, the US trade gap with China, its most politically sensitive trade partner, edged higher, to $18.3bn. However, deficits with the European Union, Japan and Mexico eased.Separately on Thursday, the labour department said that new claims for jobless benefits slipped lower last week, offering a ray of hope that stubbornly high unemployment levels are slowly easing.Weakness in the labour market continues to create anxiety for US workers. Figures showed on Thursday that initial jobless claims fell by 6,000 to 462,000 last week. That was a bigger decline than analysts had expected. However, those continuing to receive benefits grew by 37,000 to 4.56m.Last week, the labour department reported that the US economy shed 36,000 jobs in February, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 9.7 per cent.“We have yet to get a signal from the claims data that employment has begun to expand on a sustainable basis,” said John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, economists at RDQ Economics. “Initial claims need to fall towards the 400,000 mark to signal the emergence of sustained job creation.”
129;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-03-11T16:25:07Z;Obama unveils plans to double US exports;;President Barack Obama on Thursday unveiled five steps that he said would lead to the doubling of US exports and the creation of 2m jobs within the next five years, part of his administration's efforts to strengthen the American economy and foster private sector job growth after the worst recession in generations.Under the “National Export Initiative”, the Obama administration will establish two boards to focus on boosting exports, expand export financing and help US exporters in existing and new markets.The export promotion cabinet will comprise the secretaries of state, treasury, agriculture, commerce and labour, while a re-launched president’s export council, which will become the principal national advisory committee on international trade, will be headed by Jim McNerney and Ursula Burns, the chief executives of Boeing and Xerox respectively.“We have to rebuild our economy on a new, stronger, more balanced foundation for the future – a foundation that will advance the American people’s prosperity at home, and support American leadership in the world,” Mr Obama said in a speech delivered to an Export-Import Bank conference in Washington on Thursday.“We are rebuilding an economy where we generate more American jobs in more American industries by producing and exporting more goods and services to other nations,” he said.Acknowledging that there are sharp differences of opinion between Democrats and Republicans, and between business and unions on trade and globalisation issues, the president said that the US had to enter new markets and new sectors to remain ahead.“In a time when millions of Americans are out of work, boosting our exports is a short-term imperative. Our exports support millions of American jobs,” he said, adding that every $1bn increase in exports supported more than 6,000 additional jobs.“It’s also critical for our long-term prosperity. Ninety-five percent of the world’s customers and the world’s fastest-growing markets are outside our borders,” he said. “If we stand on the sidelines while they go after those customers, we’ll lose out on the chance to create the good jobs our workers need right here in America.”In addition the export promotion cabinet and the president’s export council, the national export initiative will give the Ex-Im Bank a new facility to provide up to $2bn a year for trade finance for small and medium enterprises, and will increase funding for export promotion programs by $134m next year. The Obama administration will also seek to ensure that existing trade agreements are properly enforced, and would press ahead to ratify pending agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia.The initiative also includes new measures to reform the US export control system, which restrict the export of sensitive “dual-use” technologies to countries such as Iran and North Korea.The White House said the reform program would focus on the enforcement of strict controls around the export of the most critical technologies and products, while streamlining the regulations that apply to exporting certain products.Right now, exporters of products with encryption capabilities, such as mobile phones or network storage systems, must apply to the commerce department for a technical review of the product before they can export, a process that can take up to 60 days. The administration will replace this with a more efficient one-time notification-and-ship process that could eliminate up to 85 per cent of technical reviews.Further changes will be detailed by Robert Gates, defense secretary, in the next few weeks, the White House said.

131;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-03-08T02:55:35Z;FSE shows way for local support;;Judging by its impressive client list of US-based multinationals, you might expect Imaginatik and its concept of “collective intelligence” to be a US West Coast phenomenon.However, the company that has developed “crowdsourcing technology” – harnessing the collective brainpower of a company’s workforce to develop ideas – is in fact a fast-growing Hampshire-based business.Imaginatik’s software and processes that engage staff across a company’s workforce in solving problems or innovating new products or systems have proved popular with large clients such as Pfizer, Dow Chemical, Cargill, Whirlpool and Xerox.“It’s like a very sophisticated suggestion box,” says Shawn Taylor, chief finance officer. “How else do you get 10,000 people in a room?About 85 per cent of its business comes from the US but it is now seeking to broaden its client base in Europe and the UK. “It’s a relatively new concept for European companies. The low-hanging fruit is always in the US,” says Mr Taylor.Founded in 1994 by two doctoral researchers, including chief executive Mark Turrell, the company’s software allows business leaders to set their employees and customers challenges that need to be overcome. The technology captures and evaluates the best ideas and enables them to be implemented quickly, the company says.It is the kind of innovative concept that can be difficult to commercialise, but Imaginatik floated on Aim in 2006 with turnover of £1.4m ($2.1m) and revenue has grown to just under £6m, with a £130,000 profit last year.In its early stages, the company struggled to raise finance, a problem felt acutely by many fledgling companies today. So it turned to Finance South East, a public/private fund manager that invests in early-stage companies.Imaginatik used £100,000 of mezzanine funding from FSE at the end of 2005 to increase its staffing at a critical point.“There was no chance of getting the funding from the banks,” says Mr Taylor. “It would have been very difficult to get it from another source. Though it might seem a small amount of money now, it was very welcome.”Though it makes relatively small investments in growing companies from proof of concept to seed stage, an analysis of FSE’s investments has found that its model has stimulated economic growth in the face of the recession.Since 2004, the fund manager, which operates on commercial lines although it is a not-for-profit organisation, has invested more than £18m in south-east companies. A survey of its customers found that 89 per cent said their development would have stalled without the investment, while almost 80 per cent said similar funds were not available from banks or other sources.Sally Goodsell, FSE chief executive, said the organisation’s record proved the case for smaller regional-based funding and could offer a blueprint for early stage funding elsewhere.Research found that FSE funding created or safeguarded about 1,200 jobs, resulting in £7.5m a year in income tax and NI contributions and more than £3.8m in value added tax, while FSE has received just £1.75m in operational funding from the public purse.Ms Goodsell said: “What we have proved is that it’s tax neutral. Our funds might not make money because they are investing at a very early stage, but the funds are sustainable and we are not costing the taxpayer money.“There’s a move towards national programmes because large scale is thought to be lower cost, but this report proves this isn’t always true. Regional schemes have the advantage of understanding local economies so they can deliver the perfect type of support and when managed properly, they are good value.”FSE operates seven funds – from an accelerator fund to a seed fund, commercialisation fund and a fund for established small and medium-sized enterprises – under one roof. “We are more of a one-stop shop than funds in other areas. We are trying to create a funding escalator, starting from proof of concept and moving through the funds under our management, gradually getting bigger amounts of money.”So far Imaginatik is one of three companies backed by FSE that has progressed to an Aim flotation.…………………………………Angel investors swoop for studentsWhen Sue Harrison decided to save money by using a photography student rather than a professional to take shots for her business, she had a lightbulb moment.Abandoning the original business, she set up StudentGems with Joanna Ward, her business partner, to establish an online employment site for students with commercial skills. “We realised students are quite capable of doing more than pulling pints but there was no central place where you could access this talent,” she said.After using their own resources to prove the concept, the pair knew they needed funding to make them ready for investment. A £30,000 loan from Finance South East’s commercialisation fund helped them introduce their business model of charging employers to post jobs.“The commercialisation fund was perfect but more than that, we were able to use it as a platform from which we were able to go out and get angel investors,” Ms Harrison said. The business has attracted £150,000 from eight angel investors.StudentGems now has 20,000 registered students offering more than 1,600 different skills.So far, 4,000 employers are using the site to post one-off jobs and special projects, but some individuals have also begun to use the site. One woman had her wedding dress made by a student, while others have called in help to arrange office parties.Ms Harrison still has a long way to go to achieve her ambition of making the brand a household name, but she agrees that the funding was crucial to giving the business a chance to progress.“Without Finance South East we wouldn’t have been able to develop or attract angel investors. It was a great boost,” she added.

Their departures are the latest steps in a radical makeover to a board criticised for failing to stop Citi from loading up on toxic mortgage assets.Mr Armstrong, the bank’s longest-serving director, was replaced as chairman of the audit and risk management committee and nearly lost his board seat at last year’s annual shareholder meeting.Citi also said on Friday that it paid Vikram Pandit, the bank’s CEO, a salary of $125,001 – or roughly six weeks of wages – Mr Pandit earned before he volunteered to slash his annual base pay to $1 until the company turned a profit. He had told his board he would not accept incentive compensation for a second-straight year.The lender nominated Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico’s president from 1994-2000, to stand for election as a director at this year’s meeting in April.“He will be a great steward for Citi as it continues to grow internationally and build on its unmatched global strengths,” Richard Parson, the bank’s chairman, said yesterday in a statement.Mr Zedillo, 58, is director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalisation and a professor at the US university. His election would mark the eighth new addition to the Citi board since the start of 2009.Mr Armstrong in 1989 joined the board of Primerica, a Citi predecessor Sanford Weill would eventually transform – through a series of bold acquisitions – into Citigroup, once the world’s largest financial-services company.His strong relationship with Mr Weill drew scrutiny earlier this decade when New York attorney-general Eliot Spitzer uncovered e-mails from Jack Grubman, a former star Citi analyst, suggesting that he upgraded his rating on AT&T as a favour to Mr Weill.While Mr Armstrong, 71, remained on Citi’s board after Mr Weill had retired, he barely survived an ouster by shareholders last year.John Deutch, another long-time Citi director who also almost lost his seat last year, agreed to leave the board in January. The former Central Intelligence Agency head had succeeded Mr Armstrong as chairman of the audit and risk management committee.Citi split the group into two separate committees earlier this year. Lawrence Ricciardi, a former IBM executive, chairs the audit committee; Jerry Grundhofer, the retired chairman of US Bancorp, runs risk management and finance.Mr Vikram also received $3,750 in matching retirement-plan contributions.John Gerspach, the bank’s finance chief, received about $5m in cash and shares, Citi said in a regulatory filing. Edward Kelly, vice chairman, was paid $9.9m.John Havens, who runs Citi’s investment bank, earned $11.3m; Manuel Medina-Mora, the head of Latin America who recently assumed responsibility for the company’s North American retail bank, got $10.4m.Alberto Verme, co-CEO of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, earned $7.8m.Gary Crittenden, who resigned as chief financial officer in July, received $317,400.."

134;XRX;Xerox Corp;2010-02-16T20:02:59Z;Hewlett-Packard and Dell;Looking for signs of companies spending again;The stock market is a guessing machine. Chief among imponderables are the strength of the economic recovery and what is factored into share prices. That the S&P 500’s rally has stalled since mid-January while companies report growing profits suggests expectations have met their match in reality. So, with results due from Hewlett-Packard after the close on Wednesday evening, and fellow hardware manufacturer Dell tomorrow, investors should look closely for signs that companies are starting to spend on technology again.At HP the consensus of analysts’ forecasts is for first-quarter sales to be up 4-5 per cent on last year. Within that should be a return to growth for the imaging and printing division, indicating that business activity is picking up. Contributing about a fifth of group revenues, the arm shrank throughout last year, with sales of both hardware and supplies such as ink cartridges down heavily in the fourth quarter.Over at more PC-centric peer Dell, the issue is when businesses will start to replace ageing desktops. Revenues are expected to be up a tepid 3 per cent, with earnings down on last year. Pushed into third place in PC market share by Taiwanese competitor Acer last year, Dell needs customers to upgrade to Microsoft’s new operating system, Windows 7. Launched late last year and popular so far with consumers, widespread corporate adoption is expected later this year but signs of early enthusiasm would be encouraging.As to what is factored into share prices, though, for both the answer is not that much. They join IBM, Xerox and struggling Kodak at the neglected end of the tech universe, on about 11-12 times prospective earnings. The best guess of the crowd appears to be that a strong recovery in business spending does not lie ahead.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
135;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-12-28T19:47:52Z;The year in review;;"On which deals this year will reputations will be made or lost? A few chief executives, most notably Warren Buffett, are prepared to wait years to be proved right. His purchase of Burlington Northern Santa Fe for Berkshire Hathaway will be seen as a masterstroke if a sluggish decade leaves the utility-like returns of a train company as the best available.For others, it is already possible to spot dangerous groupthink without knowing exactly which merger will prove least productive. Several technology companies have spent billions in the past 12 months buying into areas beyond their technical expertise. Software designer Oracle is trying to buy server maker Sun Microsystems, while Xerox and Dell have both made big bets that adding IT services to their hardware businesses will produce a seamlessly integrated, faster-growing whole. Rising competition as companies search for growth means not all these deals can end well.Had miner Rio Tinto sold part of itself to China’s Aluminium Corp (Chinalco) in June, it would have been a clear frontrunner for worst transaction. By default, raising $15bn via a rights issue instead ranks as one of the best decisions of the year. In comparison Ferrovial, the Spanish construction group, was forced to sell Gatwick airport for a loss, another sign that it was foolish to spend £10bn buying airport group BAA back in 2006. US taxpayers might also point out that their stake in General Motors will never be worth the $67bn needed to break even, but that takeover always owed more to political than financial logic.However, the outstanding deal of the year (where performance can already be judged) has to be Santander’s sale of a 16 per cent stake in its Brazil unit, giving Santander Brazil a market capitalisation of $34bn. Santandercreated this in part by paying $12bn for the Brazilian arm of ABN Amro in 2007; its counterparts in dismembering the Dutch bank – Fortis and Royal Bank of Scotland – have since imploded.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially"
136;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-11-26T18:04:50Z;A map of the mind helps gather far-flung ideas;;Capturing thoughts as well as facts has helped Birch Worldwide, a UK-based channel marketing firm, add $1m in extra revenues in the past four months.The company uses MindGenius, a mind-mapping tool, to gather thoughts from its far-flung workforce when planning expansion, making decisions or working with clients.Birch Worldwide’s clients include HP, Xerox, Samsung and Sony: it manages the channel marketing programmes they use to build relationships with resellers and sell more products.With just 57 staff – 42 in the UK, six in Singapore and seven in Petaluma, near San Francisco – Birch Worldwide needs to make good use of technology to manage internal information well.It outsources Human Resources to Croner, an agency that has a web-based tool for managing employee details, holiday and sick leave. For customer relationship management and sales tracking, Birch Worldwide uses Salesforce.com.It also has a series of automation and workflow tools that help with channel-related matters, such as rebates, accreditation and distribution sales analysis, and it manages its accounts in-house using software from Sage.What enables the company to bring all its information together to make intelligent decisions is mind-mapping software, which creates a visual representation of major and minor topics and their relationships to each other. But Tony White, Birch Worldwide’s managing director, does not see mind mapping as just another way of presenting facts.“Mind mapping enables us to add our thoughts to a map, so it’s effectively a collaboration tool,” he says. “I can put together a plan or a meeting agenda in a few minutes, then ask for input from staff around the world. We could do this over the phone but in a global business, this would mean some people having to be on the phone at midnight.“The map can easily be modified in the light of new ideas,” he adds. “Once it is ready, I can export action points to employees’ task lists in [Microsoft] Outlook or convert the map into Microsoft Project and from there into AdeptTracker, the project planning system we use.“Or, if I want to create a written report based on a map, I can export it to Word,” says Mr White. “This will create an overview page and then a series of headings with any additional notes from the map displayed under them. You can substantially reduce the time taken to write a useful, relevant factual document.”Mind maps can also be displayed in web conferences such as Citrix’s GoToMeeting. MindGenius cost Birch Worldwide about £80 for each user and Mr White chose it out of four mapping tools because he preferred it when he tried it.The company is currently using MindGenius to plan its move to 24-hour technical support for clients on a “follow-the-sun” model. This will mean adding support staff in California and Singapore.For example, Mr White can start a new mind map and ask for input from Singapore and California at the end of his working day. By the next working day he will have their thoughts.The 24-hour-support map involves 14 sub-projects, each with 10-15 tasks.The company plans to conduct a week of job interviews in both Singapore and California, hire people on a Friday, then fly them to the UK for two weeks of training on Saturday, then fly them back to their new offices by February 1.Mr White reckons using a structured visual collaboration tool to analyse internal information boosts productivity and enables people to meet shorter deadlines. The company – set up by Mr White 17 years ago – used to have eight people managing 150-200 resellers each and now has 57 people managing up to 1,500 resellers each. He expects profits to be up around 35 per cent this year.“We’ve been able to come up with some wonderful ideas,” he says. “Many of our customers come to us with business problems and we’re able to share ideas and build a picture of what we think the solution is.”
137;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-11-16T22:37:34Z;Open your mind to the idea of innovation;;The three most dangerous words in management? “Not invented here.” Only complacent leaders believe that their way of doing things cannot be improved upon. But that attitude can lead apparently successful businesses astray.As Henry Chesbrough, executive director of the Center for Open Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, has pointed out, senior management teams can fail to spot important innovations because the new business models they rely on do not easily fit in with the way things are being done now.Researching the performance of Xerox, the copier and printer company, between the late 1990s and early 2000s, Prof Chesbrough found that, out of 35 projects that had been rejected as part of a review process, 10 had gone on to become highly successful businesses. Indeed, the combined market capitalisation of these 10 new ventures, even after the “new economy” crash of 2001, was twice that of the former parent itself. He calls these unfortunate rejections a “false negative”: the innovations had looked bad, but that was because senior managers were unable to recognise their virtues.Prof Chesbrough was one of the speakers at last week’s Financial Times innovation conference in London. The good news is that the war on corporate complacency seems to be going quite well. Delegates were keen to hear about examples of successful innovation, and many speakers were able to provide them.Tough times can be the mother of invention. Consider EMI Music. The EMI story, recently at least, has been an unhappy one. Consumers have been rejecting CDs in favour of digitally downloaded music, most of which they are getting for free.Elio Leoni-Sceti, EMI’s new-ish chief executive, gave a presentation which suggested that, very late in the day, the company has started to come to terms with the new world.“You have to leave your baggage behind,” he said. Some EMI artists – Coldplay, for example – have started experimenting by offering free downloads of some tracks with a view to attracting future purchases.More ingeniously, a new service called Abbey Road Live gives music fans a chance to buy a CD recording of the live gig they have just attended. And to think that, in the old world, we had to wait 13 years before EMI had cleaned up its recordings of The Beatles performing live at the Hollywood Bowl for them to be good enough to go on sale.Speaking of the Fab Four, EMI has imaginatively recycled their back catalogue, providing the digitally remastered complete works for £180, or $260 in the US. A USB memory stick version is now also available.The company has joined forces with Viacom to offer a new video game called The Beatles: Rock Band, which allows for rare (and pirate-resistant) digital downloads of Beatles songs – at 99p each.Not all innovations are so glamorous or high-tech. The conference also heard from Brian Dunn, chief executive of Best Buy, the electrical goods retailer. He told a story of how his company had in the past 20 years brought in new ways of doing things again and again, innovations which were usually “born of desperation”, he said.Whether it was abolishing commissions for sales staff, or embracing the internet as a medium for selling, or revamping the company’s approach to customers, or expanding abroad: each time, Best Buy’s leadership agonised over the decision.Each time, there were smart people at the top who resisted change, he said. Necessary innovations are hard to introduce when, as in Best Buy’s case, the business seems to be doing fine.One slightly odd phrase, or a variation of it, cropped up again and again during the conference: “Be where the customer is.” I took this to mean that innovation should not be a question of shoving more, slightly better products out into the market. Rather, as Matt Kingdon of What If?, the consultancy, put it, businesses should ask themselves: “What is the job that customers need doing for them?”Companies still struggle with this. New survey data from the consultancy Accenture reveal deep dissatisfaction among corporate leaders with their efforts to innovate. For some of them, the greatest innovation of all might be waking up to what they have to do to allow innovation to flourish. Try new things, see what works, pursue the ones that do, and then try again.For more on management or to comment, visit www.ft.com/managementblog

139;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-10-06T17:25:06Z;Emerson to acquire Avocent for $1.2bn;;Emerson, the US engineering company, said on Tuesday it had agreed to acquire Avocent, which makes network equipment and software, in a $1.2bn deal intended to widen its services offerings.The all-cash deal is expected to close next January and at $25 a share would give Avocent stock holders a 22 per cent premium from last Friday’s closing share price. Shares of Avocent surged in midday trading by 21.15 per cent to $24.86, while Emerson’s stock was up by 1.96 per cent to $39.44.The St Louis-based Emerson, which said in August that its third-quarter sales were off by 22 per cent, is hoping to gain a foothold managing power data centres and will be able to provide information technology solutions to its customers. The company generated $2.6bn in revenues from its data centre business in 2008.“Combining Avocent’s technologies, relationships and installed base with Emerson’s power and cooling presence allows us to offer a more compelling solution to our data centre customers’ most pressing challenge – energy efficiency,” David Farr, Emerson’s chief executive, said in a statement.The Emerson offer comes amid a flurry of deal activity in recent weeks after companies spent much of the last year holding back on acquisitions during the recession. Last week Xerox agreed to acquire Affiliated Computer Services and Cisco announced a $3bn cash offer for Tandberg, a Norwegian videoconferencing company, while Dell made a bid for Perot Systems the prior week.In the first nine months of the year, however, the global value of deals fell 37 per cent to just $1,620bn, from the same period last year, according to figures from Dealogic.In a conference call with analysts, Mr Farr said that Emerson was “still in the acquisition hunt” and that its balance sheet could handle more deals. He noted that the Avocent acquisition was not about short-term cost synergies but would help the company grow in the longer term.“This is not the end of the game for us,” according to Mr Farr, who said he had been in talks with Avocent for two years about the deal after initially expressing interest.Avocent, which is based in Huntsville, Alabama, reported revenues of $657m last year, half of which came from outside the US. The company has been planning to grow its software sales at a faster pace to make up for slowing sales of servers and will use its technology for monitoring switching devices along with Emerson’s power centres.Mike Borman, Avocent’s chief executive, called the merger a “powerful combination”.
140;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-09-28T20:56:20Z;Xerox shares tumble after $5.7bn ACS deal;;Shares in Xerox tumbled on Monday as Wall Street questioned the logic of the printing group’s $5.7bn cash-and-stock deal to buy Affiliated Computer Services, a leader in back-office outsourcing.After purchase last week of Perot Systems and Hewlett-Packard’s 2008 acquisition of EDS, yesterday’s deal accelerated the move by technology hardware makers into services that offer a steadier source of revenue, particularly in economic downturns.For Xerox, which has struggled with the transition to digital technology, the purchase of ACS will make it nearly as dependent on services as on hardware sales.Shares in the group fell 14.45 per cent in New York trading as investors gave the deal a cool reception.Analysts questioned the rationale for combining the well-known manufacturer of printers, scanners and copiers with a company that handles back-office functions such as accounting and claims-processing. ACS gets much of its business from different branches of the US government.Xerox said that it would issue 4.935 of its own shares and $18.60 a share in cash for each share of ACS, valuing the company at $63.11 a share, or a 34 per cent premium over its closing price on Friday.By the close in New York, that premium had slipped to 15 per cent as Wall Street battered Xerox’s shares, pushing them down to $7.68 and reducing the value of the deal to $56.50 a share.Ursula Burns, who took over as chief executive of Xerox two months ago, said the deal would transform the company into a broad supplier of technology and services. “The reason for this deal is not to sell more copiers and printers and scanners – that was the relatively low end level of the deal,” she said.Many of the business pro-cesses that ACS runs relied on automated documents, which are the heart of Xerox’s business, she added.Chris Whitmore, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, questioned the extent of the overlap between the two companies’ businesses, even if the purchase made sense by helping Xerox to diversify into a new market. Xerox appeared to be signalling a lack of confidence in how strongly its printing and imaging business would bounce back with an economic recovery, he said.Some other analysts argued the deal would buttress Xerox’s existing, relatively small services business and give it a foothold in a new market with far better growth potential. “It’s a great move,” said Craig Le Clair, at Forrester Research.
141;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-09-28T20:29:45Z;Wall Street rallies on deal activity;;Wall Street on Monday recorded its biggest daily gain for over a month after merger deals lifted investor confidence.Abbott Laboratories agreed to pay $6.6bn in cash for the drugs unit of Belgian rival Solvay, bringing to an end a five-month takeover battle and highlighting continued consolidation in the industry.The US drugmaker beat rival bids from Switzerland’s Nycomed and UCB of Belgium and said the deal would add 10 cents to ongoing earnings per share in 2010. Abbott shares gained 2.6 per cent to $48.58.Xerox, the copier and documents company, also announced a cash-and-stock deal to buy Affiliated Computer Services, a business process outsourcing firm, for $6.4bn.The deal will allow the copier company to gain a foothold in technology outsourcing and data management. While Xerox fell 14.5 per cent to $7.68, ACS rose 14 per cent to $53.86.The S&P 500 closed 1.8 per cent higher at 1,062.98, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3 per cent to 9,789.36 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.9 per cent to 2,130.74.But trading volumes were lower than average on Monday due to the Yom Kippur holiday.Last week, Wall Street suffered its biggest weekly loss since July after disappointing data on durable goods and housing sales.“You don’t stand in front of a speeding train,” said Andrew Wilkinson, a senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers.“Everybody is looking for a pull-back but, in the meantime, the market will just continue to go higher …last week’s correction has served as a springboard for investors to push back to the previous week’s highs. Merger activity might hint that corporate financing is available and conditions are positive as we head into the earnings season.”Technology stocks led the market upward on Monday, setting the Nasdaq up for its biggest daily gain since late July.A series of smaller mergers on top of the ACS deal contributed to a broad rally in the sector.GenTek, which makes engine valves and produces chemicals for water treatment, climbed 39.9 per cent to $37.76 after it said it had been acquired by American Securities for about $411m.Platinum Equity agreed to buy Pomeroy IT Solutions, which sells business management software, for $6.50 a share. Pomeroy gained 10.9 per cent to $6.47.Cisco shares rose 4.4 per cent to $23.61 after Barclays raised the stock to “overweight”.Apple announced downloads from its iTunes applications store had passed 2bn. China Unicom also said Apple’s iPhone would be sold in China from October. Apple shares gained 2.1 per cent to $186.15.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Keryx Biopharmaceuticals dropped 6.3 per cent to $2.51 after the drugmaker announced that it would sell 8m shares at $2.50 to institutional investors, raising money to fund drug development.Matrixx Initiatives was up 1.7 per cent to $11 even after a law firm said it had begun filing actions on behalf of patients who had complained of losing their sense of smell after using the company’s remedies for colds.Johnson & Johnson was up 1.1 per cent at $61.27 after it said it had bought an 18 per cent stake in Crucell, the Dutch drugmaker, for €302m ($444m) as part of a flu vaccine development deal.Crucell said the collaboration would allow the companies to develop a universal product to target all influenza A strains, including the H1N1 strains.Aspect Medical, which specialises in brain monitoring technology, soared 55.9 per cent to $11.96 after Covidien agreed to buy the company for about $210m.Covidien said the acquisition would dilute its 2010 earnings per share, mainly due to a one-time restructuring charge.Consumer groups weighed on the market from the opening bell. Ongoing speculation surrounding Kraft’s interest in Cadbury sent the shares down 0.3 per cent to $26.17.Cal-Maine Foods fell 0.6 per cent to $27.62 after posting an unexpected first-quarter loss.The egg supplier said it had suffered from lower demand from restaurants.
142;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-09-28T18:25:19Z;Xerox / ACS;;Irrational exuberance this is not. Xerox investors fled on Monday on news that the copier maker was to make its largest ever acquisition, paying a combination of stock and cash that puts an enterprise value of $7.6bn on outsourcer Affiliated Computer Services. After six months in which Xerox shares have more than doubled from their lows, it is unsurprising that some shareholders decided not to wait around for the uncertain benefits of a deal and a change in strategy. But, although risky, it is hard to fault the financial logic of the combination.After Monday’s 14 per cent plunge, Xerox will be exchanging stock valued at about 14 times prospective earnings for shares valued at just over 13 times, a reasonable rate of exchange. Or to cut it another way, the value of the bid premium to ACS’s undisturbed share price is worth just $940m, far less than the capitalised value of potential cost savings, which are targeted at between $330m and $400m annually. Taking the lower end of that range, equivalent to about 1.5 per cent of the combined cost base, the savings, taxed and capitalised, would be worth $2.1bn. Xerox has therefore held on to the bulk of the deal’s potential benefits. So, although ACS shareholders will be paid mostly in Xerox stock, they should not cheer the deal too loudly.Making the merger work will be far from simple. It is sensible for Xerox to expand its services division beyond simply managing companies’ printing and documentation. The future, while not necessarily paperless, should involve considerably fewer dead trees. But in doing so, Xerox is following a general tech sector charge into services, and integration is more challenging than just giving your foreign sales force something new to flog. Still, if only half the cost savings are found, Xerox has bagged itself a bargain.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
143;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-09-14T22:54:03Z;Siemens in push to highlight US credentials;;Siemens is launching its biggest US marketing campaign in an effort to shed its image as a foreign company as it jostles for lucrative contracts from government stimulus programmes.The German engineering group, which is attempting to draw a line under a damaging bribery scandal, is launching a multimedia campaign on Tuesday to try to persuade federal and municipal authorities and other potential US customers that it has “answers to our nation’s toughest questions”.Having once sought to emphasise its global prowess, Siemens is shifting its message to focus on its role as an employer of 69,000 Americans. “Given some of the opportunities here, we wanted to make sure it was very clear we are a US company,” said Bill Stabile, senior director of brand and marketing communications.“We have more US employees than Microsoft or Xerox,” added Tom Haas, chief marketing officer for the group’s US business. Siemens had invested $20bn in US acquisitions in recent years, he added.While Siemens had bought four times the advertising space and airtime of any previous campaign, it had not increased its marketing spending fourfold, he said. It is reported to spend more than €100m ($146m) on marketing globally.The acceleration of US marketing, backed by chief executive Peter Löscher, has been triggered by stimulus programmes that encourage investment in areas such as electronic patient records, high-speed rail, energy-efficient buildings and the so-called smart power grid.The campaign is targeted at “government audiences”, potential buyers, prospective employees and “influencers” such as analysts, according to Mr Stabile.The campaign will roll out across varied media including ads in newspapers such as the Washington Post and displays inside elevators. Although more than 30 per cent of the budget will be spent online, the campaign also marks a return to television ads for Siemens, which backed away from them on grounds of cost last year.Plunging marketing budgets cut more than $10bn from US media markets in the first six months of 2009, according to Nielsen, which estimated two weeks ago that US advertising spending fell a record 15.4 per cent in the period.However, Mr Stabile said many of Siemens’ competitors had not cut back. US rivals including GE have run high-profile campaigns touting their ability to help meet government objectives in areas such as healthcare and infrastructure.
144;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-07-28T13:44:34Z;Office technology;;"Do more with less. It’s the mantra of the office manager in the downturn – and one that, in theory, should reassure makers of hardware and software designed to improve the way companies work. Investors certainly seem to believe so – technology stocks have outperformed the broader S&P 500 index since markets began to rally in March. Alas, Canon’s 28 per cent drop in second-quarter sales revealed on Tuesday – it makes most of its money from office copiers and printers – suggests the outlook for business technology remains bleak.This is also true for big IT projects, where benefits tend to accrue over three or five years. They continue to be postponed in favour of smaller deals that make the most of existing kit. While sales at Canon and Xerox have shown signs of bottoming out, few expect demand to improve much before next year. Even then, recovery may be modest. IT professionals surveyed recently by Gartner, the market research group, expect average software budgets to increase just 1.5 per cent next year, after sharp falls this year. Hardware budgets are expected to show a similar pattern.The technology sector’s struggles are ironic given its role in providing companies with a window to business performance. This downturn is the first in which business software from the likes of Oracle and SAP – expected to report a 10 per cent drop in sales on Wednesday – have given companies a real-time view of deteriorating business conditions. Companies’ ability to see what is coming at them – and to adjust headcount accordingly – may be one reason US non-farm business productivity rose 1.9 per cent in the first quarter, unlike in previous recessions. In the 1981 downturn, productivity fell 5 per cent as job cuts failed to keep pace with falling demand. Still, it is not all bad news. When conditions improve, real-time monitoring means technology sales should also bounce back faster.Canon eked out a Y15.6bn net profit in the quarter from April to June but said that recovery in the world economy is likely to be slow.“Taking into account such future concerns as climbing unemployment rates in developed countries, considerable time will likely be needed before the global economy realises a turnaround but conditions are likely to gradually ease off toward the end of the year,” the company said.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

145;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-07-07T19:24:31Z;Fuji Xerox finds strength outside Japan;;There have been few signs of recovery in Japan since April but the rest of Asia has been stronger, according to the president of Fuji Xerox, one of Asia’s largest suppliers of printers and photocopiers.Business results were somewhat better in markets such as Singapore, Korea and especially Australia, “but by far the strongest is China”, said Tadahito Yamamoto in an interview with the Financial Times.Mr Yamamoto’s comments show how the recovery in demand for technology equipment is not yet fully established, and varies by area and product.“We mainly deal directly with big businesses in China and they have come back strongly,” Mr Yamamoto said.In Japan, Fuji Xerox is hoping for an improvement in the coming months because companies tend to invest in office equipment only with a three-month lag after their own business improves and “until May industry was almost at a standstill”, he said.Better results from Australia and South Korea are partly due to a strengthening of their currencies, Mr Yamamoto said – a trend that is helping the Japanese technology sector as a whole.A joint venture between Fujifilm of Japan, which now owns 75 per cent, and Xerox of the US, the company jointly develops and manufactures Xerox products and distributes them in the Asia-Pacific region.Mr Yamamoto conceded that the split between the two is becoming an issue because customers are demanding a global service, while Fuji Xerox is also affected by lower exports of its printers because of the recent struggles of Xerox in the US. But he said a merger of the two companies would be “extremely difficult”.Future growth would come from companies outsourcing the management of their printing to Fuji Xerox and from expansion into low-volume production printing of items such as brochures and posters, Mr Yamamoto said.
146;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-06-24T16:17:34Z;A policy worth copying;;When Ursula Burns, pictured above, takes the helm of Xerox on July 1, becoming the first African-American woman to lead a Fortune 500 company, it will be a milestone for people of colour in the US. Unfortunately, it will also highlight just how few hold top executive positions in corporate America.In spite of the much-lauded election of Barack Obama, the first black president, Ms Burns joins just a handful of African-American chief executives of big companies, including Ken Chenault at American Express, Ron Williams at Aetna, the health insurance company, and Roger Ferguson at TIAA-Cref, the asset management firm.Blacks represent 13 per cent of the population in the US, but hold less than 7 per cent of managerial positions, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Their representation on the boards and management of large companies increased rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s, but this trend stalled around 2000.This is in spite of a vast array of corporate programmes aimed at boosting diversity, and a general consensus in business that diversity at the top is desirable.Mellody Hobson is president of Ariel Investments, one of a few minority-owned money management firms, and a prominent African-American executive. “It is something we are very concerned about and talking about a lot to make sure progress doesn’t get stalled,” she says. “There are lots of conversations about the pipeline of people. Why aren’t there more [African-American] people ready to go?”Last year, there were 278 black directors sitting on Fortune 500 company boards, an increase from 255 in 2004. However, they collectively held fewer board seats – 413 compared with 449 in 2004, according to a report by the Executive Leadership Council, a group that works to develop black leadership in the US.Ms Hobson sits on the boards of Starbucks, Dreamworks and Estée Lauder. She is also involved in the Black Corporate Directors’ Conference, an annual event that encourages black leadership.The conference was partly conceived by her boss, John Rogers, who founded Ariel. He is also one of the few corporate leaders who regularly speaks publicly on racism in corporate America, bluntly stating that it is a problem. However, he believes Mr Obama’s election will herald a shift. “I’m hopeful and optimistic that his leadership role will encourage companies to do the right thing,” he says.“There has already been a change. People are talking about diversity more…I am starting to feel and sense that things are moving. There is more conversation than ever before, and the conversation is less uncomfortable.”But, he adds: “It’s going to be slow going. The number of African-American partners in hedge funds, private equity firms is infinitesimal. That is where all the wealth is.”Representation of black women is particularly low. Even as they have been graduating from college in higher numbers than ever, they hold only 1 per cent of corporate management jobs.Ms Burns, 50, would hardly have appeared groomed for executive success. She was raised by a single mother in New York City, who made ends meet by taking in ironing and running a daycare centre at home.Ms Burns joined Xerox in 1981 and was identified as senior executive material early on. She also joined a company that had a strong commitment to diversity. A third of Xerox’s management team are female, and a fifth are members of minority groups. In another first, Ms Burns is taking over from a female chief executive, Anne Mulcahy. (Xerox declined to comment for this article.)Xerox’s experience suggests that an active corporate commitment to diversity is key to enabling talented African-Americans – as well as members of other ethnic minorities – to move ahead.Carl Brooks, executive director of the Executive Leadership Council, another network that promotes African-American business leaders, says it is essential for companies to identify talented minorities and ensure they receive the right challenges, mentoring and advocacy.“Ursula Burns was no accident …Xerox was a front-runner in the early identification of talent, where talented African-Americans were identified and moved around to get the right challenges. It was a model from early on,” he says.Ariel’s Mr Rogers points to the tendency of individuals to stick to their own kind.“People naturally go to their comfort zone, they call up people they know, people from their club,” he says, describing the way many executives are hired.Ancella Livers, head of the Executive Leadership Council’s institute for leadership development, adds that companies need to be more conscious of their hiring processes.“When a company is looking for a slate of candidates, whether for management or board, they need to insist the slate is diverse, and really fully consider all candidates,” she says. “They often think they are doing that, but they often do not.”One black woman who works in a high-level position in financial services, but declined to be named, agrees: “I wouldn’t say that it’s racism. They just, when they are looking to hire, tend to call up people they know, their friends. I’m not saying their friends aren’t good people for the job, and you could say that being able to work in with the culture is part of the job, too. But the result is that they end up with a bunch of white guys …I’d rather work with my friends too, but I don’t know any other black women to call [for these jobs].”Ms Livers believes that the election of President Obama will result in a psychological shift.“We looked at a report which examined the characteristics that people thought leaders had,” she says. “One characteristic was that they were white. When we see an African-American leader in action every day, that helps people to recognise that we can have competence and difference at the same time …am hoping we will see that change.”
147;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-06-23T19:18:17Z;David Hockney, Annely Juda Fine Art, London;;"The painter David Hockney has been a consistently exciting photographer for many years. Not only that. He has been a consistently fascinating theoretician of photography, too. In a lecture he gave at the UK’s National Museum of Photography in Bradford in the mid-1980s, he explained something of the rationale of his “joiners” (collaged multiple photographs in which the perspective perpetually renews itself, challenging the monocular single frame to which we’re accustomed) in terms of keeping the viewer’s eye on a picture longer. The eye, I recall him saying, skids off the shiny surface of a photograph as it does not off a drawing or a painting, and needs help to slow it down. This is an essential idea. The photographic surface is problematic; the joiners were one compelling answer.Another strand of Hockney’s thought has been that photography has a more important place in the history of art than it is usually given. His 2001 book Secret Knowledge hammers home the thought that the camera existed and was in regular use long before any means of chemically fixing its image.Hockney has embraced new technologies for their picture-making possibilities. He had a Xerox period (he insisted that the Xerox was a printing machine in its own right, not merely a copier). He has used faxes and iPhones. The lowly SX-70 Polaroid was a favoured tool for many years.Hockney’s latest excursion is to the very edges of photographic territory. He has found that Photoshop and other imaging software packages are now good enough for him to draw directly within them. At the Annely Juda gallery in London, he shows images drawn using a computer-generated palette, and switching between finishes that look like watercolour, oils, lino-cut or, when he likes, photographs. The show is divided into two parts: portraits, which are at a further remove from photographs; and landscapes, which are closer.In an image such as “Summer Road, Near Kilham, 2008”, we see Hockney’s virtuoso orchestration of his different elements. There is a high plunging view of farmland in which the upper corners are framed by branches in the manner of many rural scenes made at a lesser elevation. Are we in a tree-house?The (computer-)drawn elements are sometimes in the manner of washes, translucent overlays of colour, sometimes more opaque in order to hide distracting detail. The colours have Hockney’s trademark brightness, and include a purple road disappearing into the depth of the picture. The view includes passages of lyrical colour in the rendition of foliage, lots of different greens competing for density and depth.The photographic elements of the piece have seams, exactly like the joiners all those years ago, visible edges where one photograph butts up against another. These remind one that the artifice in photography is just as unnatural as that in draughtsmanship or in paint. A farm in the distance is very photographically legible, more so than many closer elements, which we have to reinvent for ourselves from quick scratchy Hockney marks. The overall effect is entrancing, a real landscape that the painter could have dreamed up. The balance of quotation and fresh thinking is magically right.Another picture rejoices in the title “Twenty-Five Big Trees Between Bridlington School and Morrison’s Supermarket on Bessingby Road, in the Semi-Egyptian Style, Monday 23 February/Thursday 26 February/ Friday 27 February 2009”. It can comfortably carry this unwieldy handle – it’s a vast linear frieze, eight metres long by a metre tall.The trees of the title border playing fields. They are seen over the road that lies close to the lower edge of the picture. In the context of this exhibition, in which many of the other views are of the ordered landscape of English parkland, the steel safety barriers act as parodies of the beautifully understated estate fencing still visible all over the English landscape. The trees, too, look more exotic than the standard English roadside menu, and I wonder if Hockney hasn’t used his Photoshop to import a favourite or two from California.The sky was dull on the days Hockney photographed: he has added “painted” marks that look like the effects of polarising sunglasses: a little more definition in the clouds, a little more contrast between cloud and void. It demands to be read in detail. At one end, a sign denies access to the fields, a Calvinist view of Elysium in Bridlington. Hockney has added a row of 10 or so tiny but classic English decorated church towers in the woody fringe between sky and land. I think (without being sure) that one of the sports pavilions half-visible through the screen of a hedge has cloned itself further along the frieze. Closest to us, where they are most obviously not to be misread, the painterly marks are more visible.Photography years ago eliminated the need for arduous draughtsmanship. Yet here is Hockney elaborately painting by hand the grasses in the foreground, precisely where a photograph could have saved him all the effort. It’s a wonderful picture, a deliberate tango between fact and fiction, playing on our expectations of each with masterly control and leaving us with something beautifully composed between the two."

149;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-06-12T18:49:00Z;Fear stalks Chrysler amid Fiat shake-up;;When Chrysler’s crisis-weary staff gathered in their Michigan headquarters this week to hear an address from their new leader, Fiat’s chain-smoking Sergio Marchionne, the atmosphere was far from ebullient.“Numb” was the word one Chrysler manager used to describe the mood.It was no surprise. Mr Marchionne was speaking the day after the US Supreme Court cleared the way for an alliance between the ambitious Italian group and the bankrupt American carmaker, closing one of the darkest chapters in Chrysler’s history. But it was already clear that he was now launching a cultural shift at Chrysler. In one sign, staff were this week issued with telephone short codes for their new colleagues in Fiat’s Italian head office in Turin.More fundamentally, Fiat’s boss announced a top-to-bottom shake-up of Chrysler’s management, naming 23 executives who will now report directly to him – “literally a Xerox copy”, as one Fiat executive puts it, of a new organisational structure he introduced at Fiat in January.Some of the 23 came from Fiat but others were promoted from within Chrysler, including Peter Fong, who was plucked from Chrysler’s Mid-Atlantic business centre and appointed chief executive of the Chrysler brand.As at Fiat, Mr Marchionne named powerful divisional heads with profit and loss accountabililty to run the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands. Some other Chrysler executives, though, were asked to step aside.More subtle changes have occurred at Chrysler’s headquarters in Auburn Hills, north of Detroit, the second-largest office building in the US after the Pentagon, with corridors so long that staff sometimes use electric carts to get around.Mr Marchionne has made it clear he has no plans to move into Chrysler’s cavernous 15th-floor executive suite, which he described in a recent interview with the FT as a “mausoleum”.Instead, he and his team are working out of Chrysler’s second-floor executive dining room.Chrysler’s employees have some reason to be wary. At Fiat, where Mr Marchionne is both respected and feared, he has shunted aside underperforming managers and expects underlings to join him working nights and weekends.Company veterans have bad memories of Chrysler’s last tie-up, with Germany’s Daimler, which lasted nine years but ended in 2007 amid financial losses and clashes.Mr Marchionne, who moved from Italy to Canada as a teenager and studied business in Windsor – just across the Detroit river – insists this will be different. “I grew up in this place,” he said last month. “I don’t have to translate anything in my head.”
150;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-06-03T19:42:16Z;Good to great to falling down;;"How The Mighty Fall: And Why Some Companies Never Give In
By Jim Collins
Random House Business Books $23.99 / £15.99A new Jim Collins book is an event. This is the author who, with Jerry Porras, explained how the best companies are “built to last”. Then, flying solo – but supported by his research team – Collins tried to show how businesses could go “from good to great”.Now he is tackling “how the mighty fall”. It is a good moment to ask how and why this happens. But Collins productions do not appear overnight. When research started on this project, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Royal Bank of Scotland were all flourishing – or so it seemed.That is the point. “I’ve come to see institutional decline like a staged disease: harder to detect but easier to cure in the early stages, easier to detect but harder to cure in the later stages,” Collins writes. “An institution can look strong on the outside but already be sick on the inside, dangerously on the cusp of a precipitous fall.”Collins and team revisited their rich database to consider several prominent “rise-and-fall” companies (Motorola, Circuit City) but also, by way of comparison, success stories (Wal-Mart) and back-from-the grave recovery stories (Hewlett-Packard, Xerox).Perhaps the subject matter has got to him. Perhaps Collins has matured. , the tone of this book is a little more measured, and the claims slightly more nuanced, than in his previous blockbusters. The text, at only 120-odd pages, is certainly shorter. There are, however, seven appendices and more than 200 footnotes.Contemplating failure is healthy, Collins says. “We learn more by studying why a great company fell into mediocrity (or worse) and comparing it to a company that sustained its success than we do by merely studying a successful enterprise.”Good point. Collins seems to be acknowledging, although he does not mention him by name, that Phil Rosenzweig was right to criticise (in The Halo Effect) the monumental certainty of Good to Great. Now Collins concedes that correlations are not the same as causes, and that it is “impossible to claim cause and effect with 100 per cent certainty”.Today he is only about 98 per cent certain. He describes a five-stage process of how corporates rise and fall, with the following headings: Hubris born of success, Undisciplined pursuit of more, Denial of risk and peril (this may come at the moment of greatest apparent success), followed by Grasping for salvation, and Capitulation to irrelevance or death.His main point is that great companies avoid disaster by rejecting complacency.Best of all is Collins’s description of a leadership team that is heading for problems in the third stage of decline, denying risk and peril. In such teams, he says, people shield those in power from grim facts. Meetings contain too many statements and not enough questions. Members of these top teams acquiesce in a decision but do not work together to make the decision successful or, worse, undermine the decision afterwards. People seek as much credit as possible for themselves yet do not enjoy the confidence and admiration of their peers. They argue in order to look smart or improve their interests rather than to support the overall cause. They conduct “autopsies with blame”.But, Collins adds: “If I were to pick one marker above all others to use as a warning sign, it would be a declining proportion of key seats filled with the right people” – a sure sign of an “undisciplined pursuit of more”.Although short, this is an extremely useful book. It cannot tell the complete story of why businesses fail but there are enough sharp insights to make for a thought-provoking read. Moderate paranoia may be a positive outcome. “The best leaders we’ve studied never presume that they’ve reached ultimate understanding of all the factors that brought them success,” Collins writes. “They retain a somewhat irrational fear that perhaps their success stems from luck.”They stick to what they know: relentless hard work. Turbulence in the outside world is good – that is when you can pull even further ahead. And this above all: never give up. “Success is falling down, and getting up one more time, without end.”"

152;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-05-21T22:46:48Z;Burns to replace Mulcahy at Xerox;;Xerox on Thursday said Ursula Burns would replace Anne Mulcahy as chief executive, becoming the only female African-American chief executive among the Fortune 500’s top 150 companies.Ms Mulcahy, 56, who turned the printing company round after the dotcom bubble burst, will retire on July 1 but remain as chairman. Ms Burns, 50, currently president, is her closest lieutenant. The move had been widely expected.“This has been a long telegraphed move,” said Shannon Cross, an analyst with Cross Research. “It was widely understood that [Ms Burns] was heir-apparent. Ursula has effectively been running the company with Anne as a team.”Ms Burns joined Xerox in 1980 as a mechanical engineering intern and worked her way up through the company. After working in product development, then leading the office colour and fax business teams, she became senior vice-president in 2000, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain operations.In April 2007 Ms Burns became president, with IT, strategy, human resources and marketing reporting to her.In a statement, Ms Burns said: “It is humbling to follow such a great leader and to serve as CEO of such a great company.”Ms Mulcahy became chief executive in 2001, taking over when the company was saddled with more than $18bn in long-term debt. She focused Xerox on colour and laser printers and exited the personal copier business.These moves increased sales and reduced long-term debt to $10.8bn last year. Xerox shares were down 1.2 per cent by close of trading.The transition comes at a delicate time for the world’s largest maker of high-speed colour printers. Enterprise spending on technology is down sharply and shows no signs of picking up, and the company has been hit hard by the downturn.In October, Xerox cut 3,000 jobs or 5 per cent of its workforce and in March, Fitch and Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agencies, lowered their outlooks on the company to negative.While Xerox beat estimates with its first-quarter earnings in April, revenue was down 18 per cent on the year, and the full-year forecast was bleak. Sales of printers and other hardware were down 30 per cent.Nevertheless, Xerox reported net income of $49m for the quarter, its fourth straight quarterly profit.
153;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
154;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-05-13T15:17:34Z;Perspectives: Exotic beauties that are remembered with affection;;Once computers had charm and personality. Today, the hardware, often in the shape of stacks of anonymous “blades”, serves merely to support all those microprocessors churning through ever more powerful and complicated software.It’s progress, of course, but in the process something has been lost. Here, then, is an unashamedly subjective list of computer hardware to remember with affection.I haven’t included any from the pre-electronic days, so neither Babbage’s difference engine nor Zuse’s Z1 electro-mechanical calculator from 1939 are included, but I have to start with the family of Colossus computers developed at Bletchley Park in the 1940s: the world’s first programmable, electronic, digital computing devices.Veiled in secrecy during and after the second world war, their ill-considered destruction on grounds of national security probably cost the UK pole position in the nascent computer industry of the 1950s.The writing was on the wall, when in 1964, under the inspired leadership of Thomas Watson Jr, IBM announced the System 360 family. A giant leap forward from earlier US computers including the Eniac and Edsac, the S/360 shared a common, upwardly compatible operating system. Business customers could be confident of a reliable upgrade path when their needs outgrew their current system.The S/360 was the work of the legendary US designer Gene Amdahl, later to create a range of spectacularly successful mainframes under his own name. Those were the first “plug-compatible” mainframes, capable of running the same software as IBM’s own mainframes.Not that the UK had been standing still. Several of the Colossus pioneers fetched up at Manchester University, where in 1948 they developed the Manchester “Baby”, a computer that used an ingeniously modified cathode ray tube, the Williams/Kilburn tube, for storage. The world’s first stored program computer, it was the forerunner of the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially available general purpose computer.In 1964, English Electric launched the KDF9, a machine much loved by the first generation of academic computer users in the UK. Fully solid-state, it was an early example of timesharing and could run up to four programs simultaneously.English Electric’s computer interests became wrapped into English Electric Leo Marconi, which eventually became International Computers Ltd (ICL). Leo stood for Lyons Electronic Office, a remarkable example of a teashop enterprise building an advanced computer from scratch.At the same time as IBM was announcing the S/360 family, the seven-year-old Digital Equipment Corporation was launching the PDP-8, generally acknowledged as the world’s first minicomputer. The PDP-8 was solid-state, small, cheap and had enough power to run a discrete scientific or engineering application.For the first time, customers were buying a machine for a specific purpose: the high cost of mainframes ensured that they were bought as general purpose systems. Bill Gates, soon to launch Microsoft, learned to write code on a PDP-8.Thirteen years after the launch of the PDP-8, Apple Computer launched the Apple II, not the first commercial microcomputer but the first to show broad appeal. It was used in the home, in the office and in the laboratory. Much of its success in business was its ability to run Visicalc, an early spreadsheet program, in much the same way that a more sophisticated example, Lotus 1-2-3, played a part in the early success of the IBM PC.Then in 1981, Xerox Corporation launched the 8010 Information System, colloquially known as the “Star” (this name really only referred to the ground breaking software the 8010 ran). Incorporating the ideas of several of the top computer scientists of the day, this was the personal computer that pointed the way to today’s machines.It prompted Apple to develop first the Lisa and then the Macintosh family. It featured a bit-mapped display, graphical user interface, screen icons, folders and the now-ubiquitous mouse. It communicated using ethernet and e-mail.At the other end of the scale, supercomputers were getting faster and faster. Seymour Cray, the genius behind the CDC6600, the world’s first commercially available supercomputer, formed Cray Research and built the Cray1, a futuristically designed and phenomenally fast machine which sold well over 100 units at more than $8m a time.Cray, notoriously idiosyncratic, eschewed parallel processing in favour of a single, hugely powerful central processor designed on the back of an envelope. When told Apple Computer had bought a Cray to design the next Macintosh, Cray replied he had bought a Macintosh to design the next Cray.Supercomputers, by virtue of their size, cost and processing power, have intrinsic personality. Especially IBM’s Blue Gene series. Blue Gene L with a processing power of 1.1 petaflops leads the world rankings at present. It will be succeeded in 2012 by the Sequoia, a 20 petaflops machine powered by 1.6m processor chips that will be delivered to the Lawrence Livermore laboratory.We await the arrival of computers using quantum bits to calculate at the speed of light. But no matter how fast, will they be able to match the exotic beauty of the Cray 1?
155;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-05-08T01:05:12Z;A recession quandary: to launch or not to launch?;;Technological change doesn’t slow for a recession, but customers do stop buying.That’s a real headache for any tech company which has the misfortune to be on the verge of a major new product cycle in the depths of this downturn.A case in point is Xerox, whose “solid ink” technology is one of those long-term projects that has been years in development, and which is now ready to yield a significant product breakthrough.The technology involves plugging sticks of solid ink into printers and melting them as needed, a process that yields far cheaper colour copies than the laser technology that currently dominates office printing.There are echoes here of the way Microsoft and Intel attacked the datacentre market: a technology developed to be “good enough” works its way up to the high-performance part of the market. Xerox bought the solid ink technology from Tektronics at the start of the decade and has been working ever since to extend it from consumer devices to the office machines which are the sweet spot of its business.It’s unfortunate for Xerox that it’s ready to do so in a year when most companies have little money to spend. How should it respond?One answer, says Angele Boyd at IDC, has been to massage the marketing message. Most office documents are printed in black and white, and the big hope for Xerox has been that the new ColorQube line of printers will greatly expand the colour market. But in the downturn, Xerox has had to rein in its ambitions: its message has been narrowed to focus far more closely on the cost benefits, rather than the advantages that may come from greater use of colour printing, says Ms Boyd.Ultimately, there’s no getting around the fact that this is a bad year to launch an important product. But as Microsoft has decided with Windows 7, there is only one way to deal with it: press on regardless.Tech cycles cannot be slowed to fit the economic cycle. Any company with a technology edge has no choice but to run fast to maintain its lead. The consolation for Xerox, as Ken Weilerstein at Gartner describes it, is that the lead it is building over rivals like Ricoh and Canon is likely to endure in the long term.The short term picture is less pretty. The best it can hope for is that its new printers will catch the early winds of the next economic upturn and pull it out of the recession faster than the competitors.
156;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-04-11T00:48:49Z;Citi investors urged to oust directors;;"A leading proxy advisory group has recommended that shareholders vote against re-electing half the board of Citigroup, including the bank’s chairman, Richard Parsons, because of the directors’ failure to maintain risk controls and hold the line on executive pay.Glass Lewis advised shareholders to withhold votes from seven of Citigroup’s 14-member board: Michael Armstrong, the former chief executive of AT&T; Alain Belda, the chairman of Alcoa; John Deutch, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of Dow Chemical; Anne Mulcahy, the chief executive of Xerox, and Judith Rodin, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation.RiskMetrics, another proxy adviser, recommended voting against the re-election of four directors: Mr Armstrong, Mr Belda, Mr Deutch and Ms Mulcahy. Proxy groups are influential because many institutional investors, especially index funds, rely on their recommendations in voting.RiskMetrics said: “The [Citigroup] audit committee and board have chronically failed to address the company’s risk management and compliance issues. This poor oversight in conjunction with the company’s continued asset expansion …contributed to its current state, compelling the government to provide the company with four instances of extraordinary government assistance.”Citigroup in recent months appointed Mr Parsons as independent chairman, and replaced four outgoing directors with new ones, after pledging to focus more on risk management.Citigroup said: “Citi’s board of directors has diligently carried out its responsibilities during one of the most severe market downturns in decades. The board also rotated committee chairs and members in July 2008. There is no basis for any recommendations against directors.”However, RiskMetrics said Citigroup’s steps were “reactive” and taken at the behest of regulators, not shareholders. “Given the depth of the company’s problems, the board may require a fresh start to rebuild its credibility with shareholders. Therefore, we recommend shareholders vote against the current and former leaders of the audit committee,” it said.Glass Lewis gave Citigroup an “F” grade for its pay practices. It said: “It paid more than its peers, but performed worse than its peers”. The group also pointed to the bank’s need for capital infusions, saying directors needed to be held accountable.Citigroup’s largest investors are index fund managers, such as State Street, Barclays Global Investors and Vanguard, which cannot sell their stakes even if they disapprove of the company’s actions. However, these funds can vote against the re-election of directors."

The falls on Friday came after several pieces of bad news, including a lack of interest in the latest Federal Reserve lending plan, fears over plans to tax high-earners at bailed out banks 90 per cent, and the news from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that banks had made a heavier loss in the fourth quarter than originally reported.Bank of America was one of the biggest losers, dropping 10.7 per cent to $6.19. Wells Fargo lost 9.3 per cent to $13.99 and Goldman Sachs fell 2 per cent to $97.32.American Express also fell after analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey warned the company may post a loss in 2009 and 2010 and slash its dividend, hurt by rising unemployment and credit card defaults. Its shares lost 6.2 per cent to $12.26.The insurance sector suffered too, with Lincoln National falling after Moody’s downgraded the company’s debt. Its shares lost 9.1 per cent to $7.31.Sentiment towards financial stocks has swung over the week, but experts warned against reading too much into short term moves.“It’s a little early to see what the effect of all the bailout packages is going to be,” said Andre Weisbrod, fund manager at STAAR Financial Advisors. “We’re not going to see what changes the current but we are going to feel it slowly start to change.”Energy stocks contributed to the losses, as the price of oil fell off new highs for the year. Chevron lost 3.6 per cent to $64.71 and ExxonMobil dropped 3.3 per cent to $66.09..General Electric also fell after analysts at several companies cut their earnings estimates for the company following Thursday’s shareholder meeting. The stock lost 5.8 per cent to $9.54.The leading market measures all lost ground after a positive start. The S&P 500 lost 2 per cent to 768.54 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.7 per cent to 7,278.38 points and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.8 per cent to 1,457.27 points.The Nasdaq was helped by a good performance from technology stocks. Palm, the mobilephone maker, rose 2.3 per cent to $7.89 despite third quarter losses, as the company said it was on track to start selling the Pre, its new smartphone designed to compete with the BlackBerry and iPhone, in the first half of the year.Xerox said it would also miss analysts’ estimates with its first-quarter earnings, blaming slow sales. Shares fell 18.7 per cent to $4.34.Several companies have successfully raised cash through bond sales, or are moving to do so as investors turn to corporate bonds as the yield on government debt falls after the Fed’s plan to buy Treasuries. The activity in the debt markets has helped fuel stock price rises too.Philip Morris advanced
3.1 per cent to $38.36 after raising €2bn in bonds. Merck also rose after it said it would issue a $1bn bond ahead of its planned $41bn takeover of rival Schering-Plough. Its shares climbed 2.6 per cent to $26.72.Johnson & Johnson gave further support to the healthcare sector after UBS advised long-term investors to buy its shares. The stock rose 3.2 per cent to $51.67.The three main market measures were set to finish 0.7-1.8 per cent higher for the week, the first time this year that the S&P 500 has put together two consecutive positive weeks this year.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned that the S&P would find it difficult to push past 800. “The market doesn’t usually trade well the week after equity options expire, so we are likely to remain flat,” he said."
158;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-03-20T18:30:17Z;Xerox dims first quarter outlook;;Xerox, the copier and documents company, on Friday lowered its first quarter outlook and said it would look to cut $300m in costs this year as the economic downturn has slowed technology spending.The Connecticut-based company, which is the world’s biggest producer of high-speed colour printers, said it was cutting its profit expectations by nearly 80 per cent to a range of 3-5 cents a share from its earlier forecast of 16-20 cents. Analysts were expecting earnings of 18 cents a share.”While Xerox remains the prominent player in our industry with number-one revenue share, we expect that enterprise spending on technology will continue to decline this year,” Anne Mulcahy, Xerox’s chief executive, said in a statement.The cost reductions announced on Friday are in addition to the previously announced $250m of planned cost cuts . Ms Mulcahy did not explain how the company would reach that goal, but said that she was confident Xerox would continue to grow its market share in spite of the “challenging” environment.Fitch and Standard and Poor’s, the ratings agencies, on Friday lowered their outlooks on Xerox to negative.Last October Xerox cut 3,000 jobs or 5 per cent of its workforce. Carl Langsenkamp, a Xerox spokesman, said that the company was not planning any more job cuts at this time, but that it would freeze hiring and pay increases, suspend matching funds that employees put in their retirement plans and reduce overtime pay to save the additional $300m this year.Revenue in January and February was off by 18 per cent, as sales of equipment and printer-based supplies dwindled, the company said. Slumping performance from Fuji Xerox has cost the company 6 cents a share as the division tries to restructure.”All our decisions are aligned with ensuring we have the financial flexibility to navigate well through these turbulent times while positioning the company for growth when the economy improves,” Ms Mulcahy said.Xerox said it will work to slim its total debt in the first quarter and throughout the year. The company’s performance disappointed last year, as profits plunged by 80 per cent from the year before to $230m, or 26 cents a share, from $1.14 bn, or $1.19 a share.On Friday shares of Xerox fell by 17.60 per cent in mid afternoon trading to $4.40. The company’s shares are off by about 60 per cent from a year ago.
159;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-01-30T23:33:20Z;Companies turn to pensions to cut costs;;Employees in a growing number of defined contribution pension schemes face cuts in the contributions of their employers as companies seek to cut costs in the face of the financial crisis.While final salary pension funds have borne the brunt of corporate efforts to reduce risk in recent years, companies are turning their attention to defined contribution schemes, where employees and employers pay into an individual retirement pot.Some 10 per cent of UK organisations with a defined contribution pensions scheme plan to change it in the next three years to save costs, according to consultants Watson Wyatt.“Cutting contributions or suspending schemes are the main ways they would do this,” said Paul Macro, senior DC consultant at Watson Wyatt. “This would have the most impact and is the most likely to happen.”Aon Consulting says it knows at least one “substantial” UK company that has suspended pension contributions. And US companies, in particular, are seeking to cut contributions after reducing payments into individual retirement savings accounts of their American employees, actuaries and pension fund consultants say.General Motors, which has suspended payments to US employee pensions, is conducting a review of pension provision for its 5,000 UK employees. “There will be changes, but we cannot yet say what they will be,” it said.Xerox will start a consultation with its UK employees concerning potential undisclosed changes for existing pension schemes in February.Morningstar, a Chicago-headquartered financial research company that has 220 employees in the UK, is expected to hold its first meeting with employee representatives next week over a pension plan proposal.Companies in the UK are under no obligation to make contributions to an employee retirement fund, but cannot cease or reduce contributions to existing schemes without consulting staff. The average employer contribution has increased from 6 per cent of an employee’s annual pay in 2005 to 6.5 per cent.“A company with a defined contribution scheme looking to cut costs is likely to save more by suspending pension contributions than abolishing pay increases,” said Paul McGlone, principal at Aon Consulting.A suspension of pension contributions will last no longer than 2012, when pension reforms will require all employers to enrol staff into a retirement fund automatically and pay a minimum contribution of 3 per cent.
160;XRX;Xerox Corp;2009-01-30T20:02:39Z;Company pension contributions put at risk;;Plans by companies to review their payments into defined contribution pension schemes in the UK could have a huge impact for savers.The outcome of consultations between employees and companies, such as Morningstar, Xerox and General Motors Europe, over pension contributions could determine whether more companies seek to cut costs by curtailing their pension contributions, say analysts.“It will be very interesting to see what comes of these consultations,” said Paul Macro, senior defined contribution consultant at Watson Wyatt. “In the US, a number of companies have already frozen their matching contribution schemes, but the attitude towards pension provision is different here. It is seen as a more fundamental part of the employment package.”However, financial advisers say employees may accept cuts to their pensions rather than risk losing their jobs.As the economic situation worsens, more companies are expected to look at reducing or suspending pension contributions. Paul McGlone, principal at Aon Consulting, said some companies would find it easier and more profitable to cut pensions rather than salaries.The introduction of laws that require companies to automatically enrol all employees into a pension in 2012 mean any suspension of pension contributions will be temporary. But the effect of even a three-year hiatus in employer contributions could be significant. According to the Office of National Statistics, employers in the UK contribute an average of 6.5 per cent of an individual’s salary towards money purchase schemes.For a 45-year-old with a salary of £100,000, the loss of three years’ worth of pension contributions of 6.5 per cent from an employer would total £19,500. But the total loss, allowing for compound interest on the investment returns, would exceed this. Losing three years of contributions could translate into a “gap” in the eventual pension pot of more than £62,000, according to Mr Macro.Technically, an employer cannot simply withdraw contributions to a UK defined contribution pension scheme. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, the way in which a scheme is written determines the level of flexibility afforded to employers to make changes. If an employee’s contract states a pension contribution rate, the changes may be difficult to make, and any move will need to be preceded by a consultation.
161;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Democrats force through stimulus bill;;The House of Representatives on Wednesday night approved its version of the proposed US fiscal stimulus with overwhelming Democratic support but, in an early setback for Barack Obama, not a single Republican backed the $825bn plan.The president has spent much of his first week in office reaching out to Republicans in a bid to forge a bipartisan consensus behind the stimulus but the House vote indicated that opposition is hardening.The White House welcomed the 244-188 vote as an “important first step” towards final legislation, which Mr Obama wants to sign into law by mid-February, but the president also made clear he was open to changes as debate shifts to the Senate.“I hope that we can continue to strengthen this plan before it gets to my desk,” Mr Obama said in a statement. “But what we can’t do is drag our feet or allow the same partisan differences to get in our way.”The president on Wednesday rallied support from business leaders for the stimulus in a meeting at the White House with chief executives from 13 large companies, including Eric Schmidt of Google and Sam Palmisano of IBM.Speaking afterwards, Mr Obama said the barrage of heavy job cuts at large US companies this week demonstrated the need for Congress to move quickly, with Boeing and Starbucks the latest to announce thousands of lay offs on Wednesday.“The businesses that are shedding jobs to stay afloat cannot afford inaction or delay,” he said. “They are looking to Washington for action – bold and swift.”Republicans have praised the president for trying to work across party lines but have accused congressional Democrats of ignoring Mr Obama’s calls for ­compromise.Mike Pence, the third-ranking House Republican, complained that the bill ­contained too much wasteful spending and too little tax relief.“What House Democrats have done here is get out a dusty old wish-list of liberal spending priorities, dump it all in a bill, and throw in a few token tax cuts on top of it,” he said. “That’s not going to create jobs.”Mr Obama intervened this week to persuade House Democrats to remove an item that would have provided hundreds of millions of dollars for family planning services, but Republicans on Wednesday seized on other surviving measures, including an anti-smoking programme, as evidence of misplaced priorities.Business leaders who attended Wednesday’s White House meeting – including David Cote of Honeywell, Sam Palmisano of IBM, Greg Brown of Motorola and Anne Mulcahy of Xerox – offered broad support for the stimulus in a joint appearance with Mr Obama afterwards.But business associations have echoed Republican criticism that the House bill contained too few incentives to spur job creation and too much unfocused government spending.“President Obama and Congress are right to take swift and bold action on the stimulus, but it is just as important to get it done right as it is to get it done quickly,” said Bruce Josten, chief lobbyist for the US Chamber of Commerce. “The good news is we expect a number of changes in the Senate version.”The Senate finance and appropriations committees passed their drafts of the bill this week, but Senate rules allow considerable leeway for the bill to be changed.The Senate bill is likely to see another struggle over “Buy American” provisions which restrict federal spending to goods and services produced by US companies.The current version of the Senate bill contains no such restrictions, but senators such as Sherrod Brown from Ohio are pushing for spending to be kept at home.“Buy America provisions will ensure that US taxpayer dollars go toward the creation of US jobs,” Mr Brown said on Wednesday.
162;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-12-17T19:48:08Z;Motorola slashes pension benefits;;Motorola has slashed its employee pension benefits to save cash, adding to a growing list of US companies that have retreated on pension promises as the slumping economy has put pressure on finances.Pension cuts are set to become far more common in the new year unless US companies are given more time to make up for pension shortfalls caused by the recent collapse in stock and bond markets, warned Mark Ugoretz, president of the ERISA industry committee, which represents big employers.The struggling electronics company’s decision on Wednesday to suspend payments to its US employees’ 401(k) pension accounts comes a week after Xerox took a similar step.Both companies described the moves as temporary, although they made no promises about when, or if, they would be able to reinstate the payments.Other companies to drop the pension payments in recent months as the recession has deepened include General Motors, rental car company Dollar and real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.Motorola also announced that it would freeze its US defined-benefit corporate pension plans permanently and that it would only make payments into the plans in future to ensure that existing accrued benefits were maintained.Like many US employers, the company had already closed the defined-benefit plans to new employees at the start of 2005, reflecting a wholesale move away from pensions that are tied to an employee’s final salary.The latest step means that Motorola pensions paid out of these plans will be based only on present salary levels and future retirees will not see any topping up to reflect pay rises during the course of their careers.The rapid erosion of defined-benefit plans has left American workers increasingly reliant on their 401(k) accounts, which are based on the value of their own contributions.The vast majority of companies also make their own matching contributions to these accounts, replacing the contributions they used to make to defined-benefit plans, though most 401(k) rules are written in a way that gives companies the right unilaterally to scrap the payments.Dropping the 401(k) contributions could save Motorola $80m a year, based on its payments in 2007. The company also indicated that some employee benefits outside the US would be cut back.In a gesture by its most senior executives, Motorola said that its co-chief executives, Greg Brown and Sanjay Jha, would take a voluntary 25 per cent cut in base salary next year, along with cuts to bonuses.
163;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-11-19T10:45:30Z;The first IT-literate president;;"President Bush has been widely ridiculed in technology circles for talking about “the internets”. John McCain admitted he does not use e-mail and is only just learning how to get online.And Barack Obama? Through his adept use of online tools such as social networking, he has this year rewritten the textbook on how political campaigns everywhere will be conducted.The starkness of that contrast goes a long way to explaining the powerful sense of hope – even excitement – that has rippled through technology circles since Mr Obama’s historic election win.The prospect of a technologically literate president who believes in the positive impact of digital information and networking, not just on political campaigns and the conduct of government but also on the economy and society at large, has induced a strong sense of expectation for his administration.Beyond the specific technology promises made by the Obama camp – such as a commitment to spend $10bn a year for five years on new healthcare information systems – many of the broader policies of the new administration are widely expected to be tech-friendly.Two areas, in particular, have drawn attention. One involves a commitment to wider access to a high-speed, “open” internet. Mr Obama has already pledged support for “net neutrality”, or the controversial requirement for broadband network companies to ensure that all traffic flowing across their networks is treated equally. This requirement has long had the backing of internet companies but is opposed by telecommunications and cable companies, who claim it would hamper future network investment.A second area of focus involves building the sort of skilled workforce on which the future of the US tech industry, and others, depend. Mr Obama has pledged to boost the number of students with mathematics and science qualifications, and his use of the “bully pulpit” alone could perhaps encourage more young people to follow this path, says Phil Bond, president and chief executive of the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA).This may be one of the rare areas, however, where the interests of the tech industry do not fit easily with those of the next administration. In keeping with his promise to protect American jobs, Mr Obama has so far laid the stress on improving the quality of the home-grown workforce. In the short term, though, US technology companies say that visa restrictions are starving them of the foreign engineering talent they need.As with many of the hopes that surround the president-elect, however, there is a danger of expectations getting ahead of reality. And with the US facing a servere economic downturn, some of the tech-friendly promises made during this year’s election campaign could be in danger.Betsy Mullins, head of government and political affairs at TechNet, an industry trade group, summed up the powerful anticipation that has been stirred up by the Obama campaign’s use of technology: “He embraced it in his campaigning. If you listen to the way he talks, he gets it.”“For the tech industry at large, there is good reason to be optimistic,” adds Mr Bond. “They bring a mindset, and an appreciation of the power of the network and what it means to connect people, that we have never seen in an administration before.”Most directly, the conduct of the Obama campaign has raised expectations about how the internet will be used in future to make the conduct of government more transparent and involve citizens more actively. In a position paper on technology and innovation, Mr Obama promised to “integrate citizens into the actual business of government”, a plan that includes everything from publishing government information in standard formats to inviting public comment on the White House website about pending legislation.The technological astuteness of the election campaign has raised much broader hopes than this, though. Those are embodied most clearly in a new role that Mr Obama has promised to create for his administration: the country’s first chief technology officer.What role a US CTO will play – and what this will do for the industry at large – is now the subject of considerable speculation.Under the plan, as laid out by the Obama campaign, the appointee would act as a chief information officer for the federal government, making sure that “our government and all its agencies have the right infrastructure, policies and services for the 21st century”.Many observers, however, see this as too narrow a job description, and believe that the incoming administration is already prepared to move well beyond it.“It seems to be much more than a ‘CIO of CIOs’,” says Mr Bond of the ITAA. Instead, he suggests, Mr Obama would give a future CTO a voice in the formulation of government policy in a wide range of ways. The new top technologist would have “a seat at the table” to make sure that “major legislation and initiatives will have that tech perspective”, he added.The presence on Mr Obama’s transition team of Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, and Anne Mulcahy, boss of Xerox, has even aroused speculation that a senior corporate figure could be appointed to the post, adding further weight to the role, says Mr Bond. Though he adds that an appointment is more likely to come from Mr Obama’s election campaign staff, with Julius Genachowski, a former executive at internet group IAC and chief counsel at the Federal Communications Commission, a leading candidate.Others see a different role for the CTO. John Doerr, the venture capitalist who has become Silicon Valley’s leading champion of “green technology”, argued this month that the job should be used to promote investment in the sort of basic research on which long-term US competitiveness depends. This is certainly a need that the Obama campaign acknowledged, with a promise to double federal funding of basic research over the next 10 years and create a new programme of university research grants.According to Mr Doerr, figures with heavyweight science backgrounds, such as Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, and Danny Hillis, a pioneer in artificial intelligence, would be ideal for the position.If there is one corner of the technology world where the sense of anticipation about the incoming administration is strongest, meanwhile, it is in “green technology”. Investment in everything from new solar energy technologies to the software needed to control a “smart” electricity grid has become one of the driving forces of the US venture capital industry in recent years.Now, there are high hopes that the next administration’s commitment to stemming climate change and furthering the country’s energy independence will give the sector its next lift.“Those people who have been betting on increased government spending on all of the alternative energy forms will do fine; that has turned out to be a good political bet,” says Mark Anderson, a US technology commentator.Exactly how good a bet it will be is hard to judge. During the campaign, Mr Obama himself promised to spend $150bn over 10 years on “climate-friendly” technologies. But that was before the financial melt-down and the signs of a steep economic downturn that have already become apparent.The green technology industry now finds itself poised between fear and hope.The fear is that the US government’s dire fiscal position next year will force the Obama administration to abandon its earlier promises and cut back its support.At a time when plunging oil and natural gas prices have already reduced the short-term cost-competitiveness of alternative energy technologies – even if this proves to be temporary – the threat of waning government backing could hit hard.The hope, though, is that the economic slump could lead to an acceleration of government spending in this area. With the US economy suffering, greater investment in infrastructure to support a new energy industry could supply a much-needed stimulus.Those hopes were best summed up by Al Gore, who took the stage at the Web 2.0 conference in San Francisco days after the election and called on Mr Obama to set a target for the US to move over fully to renewable sources of energy within 10 years.Even without an over-arching “moon shot” approach of that sort, however, many in the technology industry believe that the economic weakness could lead the next administration to set ambitious goals. For instance, Bob Sutor, an IBM executive, told the same audience that conditions were now ripe for the creation of new public-partnerships to invest in big infrastructure projects to combat climate change."

Dow Chemical, Altria and Eli Lilly were up 10.5 per cent to $24.43, 1.5 per cent to $19.58 and 4.3 per cent to $33.48, respectively, after overshooting analyst estimates.However, the S&P 500 closed up 1.3 per cent to 908.11 points having swung between losses of 4.3 per cent and gains of 2.9 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2 per cent higher at 8,691.25 points but the Nasdaq Composite Index ended 0.7 per cent down at 1,603.91 points.Financials were one of three sectors to drag on the market, down 0.9 per cent. Goldman Sachs tumbled 5.3 per cent to $108.58 after it emerged that the bank was planning to cut 10 per cent of its workforce in response to the deteriorating environment.The sector was also hit by further stress in money markets after signs of improvement this week. The rate at which banks lend to each other over the long-term rose for the first time since the fresh round of government intervention in the banking system this month.General Motors lost 1.5 per cent to $6.10 after it emerged that the group was to begin involuntary lay-offs.The news from Goldman and GM came after first-time unemployment benefit data jumped more than forecast. “There is every reason to expect hiring to drop in the wake of the disaster in the stock markets and the continued tightening of credit,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics.The rise came after the benchmark S&P 500 index fell to a fresh five-year low in the previous session after poor figures from companies such as AT&T and Boeing.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 14 per cent, to 79.43, which continued to signal a heightened level of distress. It had fallen as much as 7.5 per cent in the session.Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that the global financial crisis was a “once-in-a-century credit tsunami” and he foresaw more
lay-offs.Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said that this quarter, companies could no longer “have good earnings and expect that your stock’s going to go higher”.Coca-Cola Enterprises tumbled 18.5 per cent to $9 after the soft-drink bottler and distributor lowered its profit forecast for the year, while the consumer discretionary sector was another key weight on the market, off 0.5 per cent.Homebuilders were among the hardest hit sectors. Pulte Homes dropped 18.5 per cent to $8.11 after posting a larger-than-expected quarterly loss.Online retailers tumbled in sympathy with Amazon, which earlier rose as much as 1.8 per cent to $50.91 after the group lowered guidance for the fourth quarter. It ended the session 0.7 per cent higher at $50.32 while Ebay rose 1.9 per cent to $15.32.Xerox slid 3.4 per cent to $7.71 after the office supplier posted weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.Energy was the biggest winner, up 6.6 per cent overall, helped by oil’s edge towards $70 a barrel as well as positive results in the sector. National Oilwell Varco advanced 9.4 per cent to $26.78 after profit topped forecasts.Chevron and Exxon Mobil jumped 8.2 per cent to $66.77 and 9 per cent to $70.39, respectively. Transportation stocks enjoyed an early boost on the back of well-received earnings.Union Pacific, one of several hard-hit railway stocks, jumped 2.4 per cent to $58.25 after the railway company unveiled better-than-expected results.United Parcel Service gained 3.8 per cent to $48.13 after its drop in profit was not as bad as feared.Amgen climbed 11.8 per cent to $55.55 after the world’s largest biotechnology company forecast optimistic full-year earnings on the back of a fivefold increase in quarterly profit.In technology, Microsoft, which lost 7.8 per cent in the previous session, recovered 3.7 per cent to $22.32 ahead of results due after the bell."

Crude oil fell as much as $8 a barrel before paring early losses.ExxonMobil dropped 3.4 per cent to $77.32 while ConocoPhillips dipped 4.3 per cent to $79. and refiner Tesoro slid 6.9 per cent to $17.28. Coal companies were particularly hard hit. Massey Energy dropped 10 per cent to $59.35, Arch Coal slid 14.8 per cent to $46.19 and Consol Energy lost 8.55 per cent to $61.92. So far this quarter, energy has been the worst performing sector, down 18.7 per cent. The materials sector, down 9.2 per cent over the period, shed another 2.5 per cent on Tuesday.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dipped 7 per cent to $83.05, Monsanto fell 4.3 per cent to $109.34 and US Steel lost 10.3 per cent to $119.39.Airline, automaker and consumer discretionary stocks helped the S&P 500 briefly break through the psychologically important 1,300 mark.However, the broader market gave up early gains. By the close however, the broader index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,277.55.Richard Parker, managing director of institutional equity trading at Stanford Financial said the morning rally “didn’t have an a awful lot of legs to it”.Analysts at JPMorgan’s Private Bank said: “Investors return from their summer holidays facing the same uncertainties as when they left . . . [Still] the current investor caution makes us think that equity prices may already be discounting many of the risks we’ve been concerned about.”Financials lost steam as the day progressed, although most banks held on to some modest gains. Bank of America climbed 3.4 per cent to $32.20 after Goldman Sachs recommended buying the shares on the basis of “long-term earnings power” and near-term capital options which could help it avoid issuing common equity.Lehman Brothers, the embattled investment bank, briefly advanced after reports that Korea Development Bank was in talks to buy a stake in the securities firm. At the close, Lehman shares were up 0.3 per cent to $16.13.Citigroup added 0.6 per cent to $19.11 while JPMorgan rose 1.3 per cent to $38.99 and the S&P 500 financials sector rose 1.8 per cent.Regions Financial also made progress, jumping 19.2 per cent to $11.05. The Alabama-based bank said it had assumed about $900m in total deposits from Integrity Bank, a failed bank.Meanwhile, the weaker-than-expected impact of Hurricane Gustav gave other energy-sensitive stocks a boost. Airline companies UAL, Delta and AMR soared 11.7 per cent to $12.41, 12.8 per cent to $9.17 and 11.3 per cent to $11.50.Automakers General Motors and Ford added 6.5 per cent to $10.65 and 1.12 per cent to $4.51.The broader consumer discretionary sector also made strong gains, led by consumer services and retail stocks as investors bet that falling oil prices would boost spending power.Carnival, the cruise operator, rose 5.6 per cent to $39.13, while Lowe’s added 6.9 per cent to $26.33. The sector as a whole rose 1.8 per cent.That, early positive momentum helped markets to glide past some weak macroeconomic data released in the mid-morning, showing a stagnant manufacturing sector and a further decline in construction spending.Since its low point on July 15, the benchmark S&P 500 index has bounced about
5.2 per cent, partly because of a 24.3 per cent drop in the price of oil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 2.1 per cent in early trading before giving up those gains to close at 11,516.92, down 0.2 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,349.24.In technology, Xerox climbed 3.1 per cent to $14.36 after Citi initiated coverage with a “buy” recommendation and a $20 price target.The office equipment maker had “perhaps the most compelling enterprise services portfolio of any company in the market”, Citi said.News that Google released its own internet browser initially helped the stock advance. But the moves were not enough to keep the sector in the black and it swung to losses of 1.4 per cent. Google shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $465.25."
166;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-08-28T01:05:10Z;Ricoh in $1.62bn move for Ikon;;Ricoh said on Wednesday that it would buy Ikon Office Solutions, which sells and services office equipment, for $1.62bn in cash to win access to Ikon’s large corporate and government customers and build out its North American distribution network.Ricoh, a Japanese manufacturer of office printers, fax machines and copiers, has been a longstanding supplier of equipment to Pennsylvania-based Ikon. Ricoh’s business is largely concentrated in Japan, however, and Ikon is one of the last office equipment companies with a strong North American presence that had not already been acquired in recent years.The deal will allow Ricoh to retain customers even after they initially purchase office machines, by servicing the equipment over the course of its life.Ikon, whose board of directors had been reviewing the company’s options as it slashed costs to address sliding sales and profits, also distributes equipment made by Ricoh’s larger Japanese competitor, Canon.Canon has been hard-hit by consolidation within the US market for office equipment distribution, as competitors including Konica Minolta and Xerox have acquired key distributors and shaved down the network within which it can sell its products.Shares of Ikon traded more than 9 per cent higher at mid-day on Wednesday at $16.99, below Ricoh’s $17.25 per share bid. The companies said Ricoh’s offer represeted a premium of one-third to Ikon’s average stock price over the past 60 days.
167;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-07-01T23:44:59Z;Microsoft deal steps up rivalry with Google;;Microsoft turned up the heat on Tuesday in its technological rivalry with Google as it announced the purchase of a private Silicon Valley company that has developed one of the most promising, and controversial, new internet search tools of recent years.The acquisition of Powerset, reportedly for about $100m, comes in the wake of Microsoft’s failure to challenge Google either by acquiring Yahoo outright or buying its internet search business, although the software company has said that the offer of a partial purchase remains open.Ramez Naam, group programme manager of Live Search at Microsoft, said the Powerset deal had been under review for some time and was unrelated to the failure over Yahoo.Powerset has become one of the most talked-of new search companies of recent years thanks to its ambitious plan to use so-called “natural language” technology to search the Web. Rather than keywords, which search engines such as Google use, natural language technology seeks to “understand” the meaning of a query and the content of Web pages, potentially making it far more effective.However, critics claim that the technology, which has been something of a Holy Grail for search companies, is still years ahead of its time, and even that it raises philosophical questions about the nature of language.Barney Pell, chief technology officer of Powerset, on Tuesday rejected those charges, and claimed that the goal of a full natural-language powered search of the entire Web was “absolutely within reach”. Powerset itself, which has based its service on technology licensed from Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center, recently launched a narrow working test of its service to index the content of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia.Powerset, which had raised $12.5m in venture capital backing, explored the idea of raising the “tens of millions” of dollars more it would have needed to build the technology itself, before deciding instead to sell to Microsoft, Mr Pell said.The companies refused to comment on the purchase price, although VentureBeat and other online news services reported that Microsoft had paid about $100m.
168;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-04-18T23:53:52Z;Xerox legal charge offsets sales gain;;"Xerox on Friday reported a net loss for the first quarter as gains from sales were
offset by a charge related to lawsuits.Shares in the copier and documents company rose 2.3 per cent to $14.83, however, as Xerox became the latest technology group to indicate that it had not suffered as much of an impact from a slowing US economy as some forecasters had feared.Xerox said it made a net loss of 27 cents per share in the first quarter. Profit was hit by a 54-cents-per-share charge related to lawsuits arising from an accounting scandal that hit the company several years ago. Excluding that charge, profit was 27 cents a share, up from 24 cents a share last time.Sales grew 13 per cent to $4.3bn, with 4 per cent of the gain because of currency effects from a weaker dollar.The gains came in spite of earlier warnings that big corporate customers had grown more hesitant about making IT purchases.Gross margins fell 1.3 per cent, however – a trend Xerox attributed to a shift
in customer preferences towards lower cost products and the effect of the dollar’s falling value against the yen, which had an impact on the company’s joint venture with Fuji in Japan.Investments in marketing and sales also contributed to lower margins. “These marketing investments as well as the mix of products sold put pressure on earnings this quarter,” said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive.Xerox also reported progress in its efforts to increase sales of more profitable colour printing products and services."
169;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-03-27T23:32:27Z;Xerox and former auditor to settle lawsuit;;Xerox and accounting firm KPMG are to pay $750m to settle a lawsuit that alleged stockholders were victims of fraudulent accounting practices at the office equipment maker.Xerox said Thursday it had received preliminary court approval to settle a securities lawsuit that dates back to 2000.Carlson v Xerox was a class-action lawsuit on behalf of shareholders holding stock between 1998 and 2002.Xerox’s stock fell from $60 a share in 1999 to less than $5 in 2000 after it became embroiled in a probe into accounting irregularities.In 2002, Xerox paid a record $10m fine to settle Securities and Exchange Commission allegations of fraud and agreed to restate its earnings.The SEC had alleged that Xerox had accelerated the booking of revenues from equipment on long-term leases. This enabled it to cover up earnings shortfalls at a time when its copier business was in decline.Xerox’s problems began in June 2000 when it admitted there had been accounting fraud at its Mexican subsidiary and fired a number of employees.Xerox’s financial position has improved in the intervening years. It generated $1.9bn in operating cash flow last year and repurchased $631m of its own stock.“Our strong financial position gives us the flexibility to resolve this issue while continuing to deliver shareholder value through share repurchase, dividends and acquisitions,” Anne Mulcahy, chief executive, said.As in the SEC case, Xerox is not admitting any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.It said it would take an after-tax charge of $491m in the current quarter and make cash payments totalling $670m in five instalments during the year.KPMG, Xerox’s former outside auditor and a co-defendant, is to pay $80m into the settlement fund.The plaintiffs had alleged conscious misbehaviour or recklessness by KPMG.The accounting firm had maintained it refused to sign off on Xerox’s 2000 annual report because of concerns over Xerox’s practices.An independent report requested by the Justice Department suggested Thursday that KPMG either initiated accounting fraud at New Century Financial or stood idly by as the now-bankrupt subprime mortgage lender committed fraud in 2005 and 2006.KPMG said it strongly disagreed with the allegations.Xerox shares closed 0.4 per cent higher at $15.01 in New York on Thursday.
170;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-03-19T00:29:41Z;Security matters: Printing can be data security’s Achilles Heel;;"Since January 2005, more than 218m records involving sensitive personal information belonging to US citizens have been exposed by security breaches.Drill down into the data, collected by US lobbying group the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, however, and it is clear that it is not only electronic media that are to blame.Last year, more than a dozen serious data protection breaches resulted not from the loss of a laptop, a disk or memory drive but from printed data.Some of the breaches resulted from errors in bulk or commercial printing houses, such as inadvertently printing customers’ social security numbers on envelopes or labels. But others were the result of employees printing sensitive data, which was subsequently lost or stolen – often because the paperwork was in the same bag or case as a laptop targeted by thieves.The true number of cases of data loss from paper documents could be far greater. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse only monitors US cases, and only cases where personal data are exposed. Businesses, though, should be as concerned with the loss of commercially sensitive information, either accidentally or through industrial espionage.According to Pete Basiliere, a research director at Gartner covering printing technologies, several of the more serious cases have involved bulk or contract printing. “CIOs need to keep an eye on print and mail, where there are not as many controls as there are in the office environment,” he points out. “There have been cases where letters have been mis-folded, for example, so that an individual’s social security number was visible through the envelope.”Improved procedures for passing data to contract print houses and monitoring their jobs will go some way to solving such problems. But it is in the office where there is an even greater onus on IT managers, and company security officers, to look at printing arrangements.Organisations need to consider who has the authority to view sensitive data, and whether that authority should automatically bring with it the permission to print files. IT departments should also review how print traffic moves across the network and even how print job data are stored on servers and printers.The move from standalone analogue copiers to digital, multi-function devices has brought some specific security challenges. Almost all high-end copiers and printers now contain hard discs, and security professionals are concerned that such discs – often containing full copies of sensitive documents – might fall into the wrong hands.This has led device manufacturers to build encryption into their devices: Xerox, for example, now encrypts almost all the hard discs in its high-end printers using the AES protocol, and equipment is Common Criteria certified. “These products have evolved from peripherals to platforms providing a lot of functionality,” explains Dave Drabb, security expert at Xerox and a former FBI agent.Building better security measures into printers and muilti-function devices will go a long way to prevent a hacker accessing information held on a printer’s cache disc or use a printer as a back door into a corporate network. But they will not solve some of the more common security problems around printing, such as unauthorised employees printing sensitive data, or staff leaving confidential documents on a printer which then fall into the wrong hands.Samsung is one of a number of manufacturers that hopes to solve this problem by requiring staff to authenticate themselves at the printer in order to pick up a job. At the most basic level, this means entering a PIN; alternatives include swipe cards or near field communications (NFC) contactless smart cards to “pull” the print job to the nearest printer. Such systems have the added advantage, Samsung says, of cutting waste and making it easier to analyse printing costs.Researchers at the company have developed a system that encrypts print jobs on their way from PC to printer. In a recent demonstration, staff from the company showed the ease with which hackers, armed with just a laptop and some easily obtained software, could “sniff” a local area network for printer traffic and then recreate the documents on their own machine.Encrypting the data, using technology based on the PGP protocol, prevents such attacks. Amid growing concerns about identity theft and commercial espionage, such security measures look set to become more widespread.Information security officers are also looking more closely at business applications that store and process sensitive data, to see whether security needs to be improved. Some large businesses and government departments have disabled USB ports or installed software that prevents data being written to memory keys, but such measures will be undermined if staff can still print unauthorised documents.The best way to prevent this, suggests Ken Allan, technology security and risk services partner at Ernst & Young, is to build security into the application. However, this represents a significant challenge for organisations running many applications from a multitude of vendors.Companies also have to balance the need for additional security measures with the inevitable impact on productivity. Often, the simplest way to protect data from unauthorised printing or copying is to set strong policies, and to monitor use, rather than remove functions. Analytics software might alert senior management, for example, if a member of staff accessed more sensitive data than would be expected, based on their usual role.“Restrictions can be designed into applications, or [policing use] can be done as a monitoring activity,” says Mr Allan. “Companies are turning to analytics to monitor what users are downloading, but it is control by detection, rather than by prevention. Really, it is a stop-gap approach.”But, he suggests, such measures – as well as technical innovations such as encrypting printing traffic – will only be successful if they are used in tandem with strong policies.“Rather than focusing on the media, the hard drive, the memory key or paper, companies need a set of policies about data use and awareness to back those policies up,” says Mr Allan."
171;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-03-13T20:18:55Z;Wake up to womenomics;;"Why Women Mean BusinessUnderstanding the emergence of our next economic revolutionBy Avivah Wittenberg-Cox and Alison MaitlandJohn Wiley, £16.99, $34.95This could just be another book about women, the glass ceiling and the usual laments about why women don’t make it to the top. But Avivah Wittenberg-Cox and Alison Maitland clearly want to avoid this dead end.They give a broader picture, take a stand and offer a comprehensive view of women both at work and as consumers as suggested in the punning title.Why Women Mean Business, they explain, is “dedicated to the companies that are waking up to ‘womenomics’,” the economic revolution being created by women’s growing power and potential. To ignore these demographic and commercial developments is bad business.Wittenberg-Cox is a practitioner who founded networks such as the European Professional Women’s Network and is an executive coach who started her own company (20-First) to advise organisations on gender-related matters. Maitland is a former FT journalist, now a writer and a senior visiting fellow in the faculty of management at Cass Business School in London. She brings an academic perspective, having researched and written about women in business for a decade.Not surprisingly, Why Women Mean Business is well documented and summarises leading and recent studies in this field. Thorough and direct, it also abounds in footnoted anecdotes and comments from figures such as Jeremy Isaacs at Lehman Brothers, Niall Fitzgerald of Reuters, and Anne Mulcahy of Xerox, making it both a practical and a lively read. “Business remains a world created by males for males,” admits Isaacs and what alienates women is that “the language people fall into using is sometimes unacceptable”, as Fitzgerald points out. It is clear, authentic, stimulating and sometimes provocative.The authors try to offer a new perspective, taking men’s views into consideration through extensive interviews. They move the debate on when they say that “[womenomics] is a business issue and not solely a women issue”, or when detailing the limitations of diversity management by explaining the differences between gender and diversity. The point is that women are both different and equal and to this end they call for “bilingualism” at work – women and men bring different qualities to work, but of equal value to the company.Meanwhile, “including gender within diversity programmes positions it incorrectly, almost dooming companies to fail in their efforts,” they write.Wittenberg-Cox and Maitland suggest that companies “define the business case and involve executive committee members to debate their analysis. The aim is to align the top management team on why a gender initiative is necessary and win agreement on how to address it.”Further tips: “Let people express resistance”; “make it a business issue not a women’s issue”, and maybe follow the example of Schlumberger, to “have gender initiatives headed by a senior male fast tracker.”They also rightly point out that “gender is not the same topic as work-life balance”. Too many companies associate these issues and/or mix them up with ethnic diversity, which “then becomes too often about making minorities comfortable with the dominant norm”.So if “women are not yet natives of the business world”, as the authors say, and often describe themselves as uncomfortable with workplace politics, why should that be so? And if we understood that, would it help businesses engage and tackle the issue? Here, the authors might have pushed the analysis further. The work of the late David McClelland, professor of psychology at Harvard University, helped our understanding of the problem when he concluded that “power is the great motivator”.Both research and my own experience in women’s networks indicate that motives do not differ between the two genders but the acceptable manifestations of it do.Several interesting concepts have been developed by the authors, such as the three Ws – “weather, women and web” – that are changing our lives and economies, or their thinking on gender-based segmentation, which recognises that women today represent myriad market segments. Women of all ages constitute many sub-segments with still untapped market opportunities. They also reflect the complexity and the many facets of marketing to women.“We have sought to be as accurate as possible,” say the authors. In fact, they have done more than this, and offer a refreshing and constructive view. “I have to admit that women are still an absolute other,” Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of Total, tells the authors at one point. But, as the authors argue, women mean business, and gender sensitivity is not about diversity management.The author is a senior partner at Egon Zehnder International, in charge of diversity.

172;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-02-28T02:22:22Z;Companies to disclose political aid;;Five large US companies, including American Express and Xerox, will bow to shareholder pressure on Thursday and agree to disclose all their political spending.The move by the companies, which also include the financial groups Washington Mutual and Capital One and the technology provider Texas Instruments, could put pressure on the rest of corporate America to make public its political contributions. US companies are not required to disclose details of political payments and, in spite of growing concerns over lobbying by large businesses, only 38 have so far agreed to reveal all their political spending.“This move is very important,” said Bruce Freed of the Center for Political Accountability, which together with unions and socially focused investors is campaigning on the issue. “There is much greater acceptance in the corporate community of political transparency and accountability.”US companies are banned from contributing to congressional and presidential candidates, but in 2002, the last main election cycle, their donations to state and local candidates reached $184m (£92m) – more than a third of all campaign contributions. Campaigners argue that much corporate political spending goes through trade associations and other interest groups that back candidates whose positions often conflict with those of the companies’ shareholders. Interest groups are expected to spend more than $1bn in this presidential election.Like the other 38 companies, American Express, Xerox, Washington Mutual, Capital One and Texas Instruments will reveal details of payments to these groups as well as to candidates. American Express’s 2007 corporate contributions report shows it spent about $135,000 on political donations last year. Recipients included Eliot Spitzer, governor of New York state and former Wall Street scourge, who received $1,000, and Republican and Democratic fundraising committees. “We have always provided a report about our activity on request. We have now posted [it] to our website to make the information even more easily available to those who want it,” the company said.Scott Gaspard at Washington Mutual said: “Good corporate governance dictates transparency, which is why we decided to make our political contributions available.”Texas Instruments said it had decided to disclose its contributions before being pressed by the investors, adding it wanted to “provide shareholders with transparency on the issue they want to know about”.Xerox said it did not use corporate funds to back political officials and would publicise its contributions to trade associations. Capital One was not available for comment.
173;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-01-29T18:58:14Z;Investor fears drag VMware lower;;Shares of VMware, the world’s leading “virtualisation” software company, fell 32.6 per cent on Tuesday, a day after it reported weaker-than-expected revenues and issued a tepid sales forecast for the full year.The slide underscored lingering unease among technology investors amid concerns about a potential economic slowdown in the US.It also reflected an adjustment of investor expectations for a company whose red-hot initial public offering marked a high point for the technology sector last year.Shares of VMware, whose software helps companies save money by improving the efficiency of their computer systems, rose more than fourfold from their offer price following their debut on the stock market in August.But they had fallen by more than a third since hitting a high of $125.25 in October amid concerns about increased competition from established software rivals.Investors unloaded shares on Tuesday in response to VMware’s announcement that it had recorded $412m in sales in the last quarter. The shares were at $55.98 in mid-afternoon trading.The results marked an increase of 80 per cent over last time but were just shy of the $417m that most Wall Street analysts had been expecting.A weaker-than-expected forecast for the full year contributed to the slide.VMware said it expected revenue growth of only 50 per cent this year, down sharply from the 88 per cent growth rate it managed last year.The fall came in spite of news that VMware, which last year became the world’s fastest software company to reach $1bn in annual revenues, had more than doubled its net profit to $218m in the full year from $86m last time.VMware said its weaker- than-expected full-year sales forecast was due to a variety of factors, including the company’s growing size, which is expected to make it more difficult to achieve the high double-digit sales growth to which investors have become accustomed.The company brushed off concerns about a slower economic outlook.“The 50 per cent growth rate that we’re forecasting is largely a function of us becoming a very large software company,” Mark Peek, VMware chief financial officer, added.“When you look at about 50 per cent growth for 2008, that’s essentially doubling the size of the company in five quarters,” he said.Apple, another hot technology stock, last week suffered a steep fall in its share price after it issued a second-quarter forecast that fell short of most analysts’ expectations.Xerox, the copier and documents company, last week said it had seen a slowdown in orders from big US customers in the last quarter.
174;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-01-29T18:04:17Z;Editor’s note: Banks for the 21st century;;It is hard to keep up with technology as it pushes forward on every front – both for suppliers and customers. I admit I feel very 1980s as I sit down at the end of each month to write seven or eight cheques to settle household bills.But I see my banks as being equally 1980s when it comes to the services they offer and how they use IT in dealing with their customers.I have not yet fully embraced internet banking – perhaps editing a section which features a regular column on the horrors of security breakdowns and identity theft increases my caution. On the other hand, none of the financial institutions with which I have accounts has pushed it very hard.In fact, communication between us is minimal: I get far more material from banks I have no relationship with than the ones I do.Yet retail banks hold enormous amounts of priceless information about customers – data that could be used to provide a spectacular range of products akin to the wealth management services already offered to holders of premier accounts.The banks’ cautious approach to dealing with their customers was recently studied by Ian Parkes, of the Coleman Parkes research firm, and was the subject of a round-table debate, hosted by Xerox and organised by The Banker magazine.I was surprised at how reluctant the banks were to be more pro-active in their customer relations. They cited security issues, departmental rivalries and the backlash they fear from imposing charges or monitoring people’s accounts too closely.Afterwards, I spoke to Ian Parkes (and you can listen to his views in our new podcast, at ft.com/dbpodcast). He sympathised, but said banks need to overcome poor segmentation of their customer base and improve communication channels – and when they do, we really will start to see 21st century banking.
175;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-01-25T22:06:13Z;Wall St stocks return to negative territory;;Wall Street endured one of its most volatile weeks in recent memory, and closed out the period having just escaped a brief encounter with a bear market.Although the broad benchmarks closed in negative territory on Friday, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to record their first weekly gain in 2008, and break a string of four weekly declines.The S&P fell 1.6 per cent to close at 1,330.61 points, a gain of 0.4 per cent on the week, clipping its overall loss this month to 9.4 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.5 per cent to 2,326.20, for a loss of 0.6 per cent since Tuesday, pulling it down by 12.3 per cent this month. The Dow slid 1.4 per cent to 12,3207.17, that left bluechips up 0.9 per cent this week, a loss of 8 per cent in 2008.At the worst moment for stocks early on Tuesday, the S&P futures contract was 21 per cent below its October peak, meeting the definition of a bear market. The Nasdaq Composite also briefly traded more than 20 per cent below its 2007 high and on Friday was down just over 18 per cent.All this came after the Federal Reserve had sliced its Fed funds rate to 3.50 per cent, a 75 basis point cut nearly a week before its scheduled January meeting. Another cut of at least 25bp is expected.Market volatility surged to levels seen last August as stocks continued to slide, and sectors exposed to the global economy, such as energy, industrials and technology, were hit hard.The Vix index, which measures S&P 500 option volatility surged past last August’s intra-day peak of 37.50 on Wednesday, before it sharply subsided below 30. Late on Friday, Vix was at 29.08.On a closing price level, the Vix has now settled above 30 three times since August. This type of pattern suggests that the market has established a strong ceiling that should hold unless there is a major shock traders say.Then, came the news of a move to help monoline bond insurers that, in conjunction with what traders said, was an extremely over-sold market, helped stem the waves of selling. A proposal to inject capital into the insurers, and thus potentially avert further writedowns among financials, who had purchased insurance, propelled the market sharply into positive territory late on Wednesday.The mood then improved as details of a $150bn fiscal stimulus package from Washington to stave off a recession emerged. The cream on the rebound came in the form of an upbeat earnings report and outlook from Microsoft on Thursday. The tech giant beat fiscal second quarter earnings estimates and raised guidance. The stock, however faded after making a high of $35 in early trade and closed down 0.9 per cent at $32.94.As the mood turned bearish on Frieday, traders said the market may not have escaped the clutches of a classic bear market. “The next two weeks are very critical and will set the tone for the rest of the quarter and a good part of the second quarter,” William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading, said.He said short covering rather than solid buying had pushed the market higher this week. The cautious tone on Friday also suggested that investors were reserving judgment until next week’s meeting of the Fed and the release of January’s employment report.Mr Strazzullo said that, if the major benchmarks fail to sustain their recent gains, it would mean the market was in the process of moving to much lower levels.He identified 1,150 to 1,350 on the S&P, 10,500 to 12,500 for the Dow and a floor of 1,950 for the Nasdaq as likely new ranges. “If we do not hold in here, there is a risk we see another 10 to 15 per cent washout in the major averages,” he said. This week, Citi lowered its year end target for the S&P to 1,550 from 1,675, and trimmed its outlook for the Dow to 13,950 from 15,100.Among the main S&P sectors, financials led with a rise of 7 per cent this week, and in spite of a 2.5 per cent fall on Friday. The Fed rate cut, with another looming next week, boosted JPMorgan 10.2 per cent to $43.64, while Citi rose 9 per cent to $26.64.Bear Stearns jumped 20 per cent to $87.03. Bank of America said fourth-quarter net income fell to $268m as it reported trading losses of $5.44bn due in part to writedowns of collateralised debt obligations. The stock rose 10.8 per cent to $39.48 this week.Among the bond insurers, MBIA rose 66 per cent to $14.20. Ambac reported a loss of $3.26bn after taking a $5.21bn writedown, but the stock jumped 86 per cent to $11.54, boosted on Friday by talk that investor Wilbur Ross may buy the company.Friday saw the debut of RiskMetrics Group. The provider of risk management and corporate governance products priced at $17.50 and after trading at a high of $24.45, closed at $23.75.In contrast with Microsoft, results from eBay and Apple disappointed investors. Shares in eBay fell 5.3 per cent to $26.83 this week as its 53 per cent rise in profits was accompanied by a 2008 forecast below some estimates.Apple reported a 57 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, but lowered its outlook and fell 19.4 per cent to $130.01.Caterpillar rose 5 per cent this week to $65.93 On Friday the heavy equipment maker said quarterly income rose 11 per cent, buoyed by international growth. But the company expects “recessionary conditions” in parts of the US to persist.Honeywell reported 18 per cent growth in net income, and warned that the global economy would soften. The stock rose 5.3 per cent to $58.25 on the week.In other earnings this week, Hershey said quarterly profit fell almost 65 per cent and the confectionary maker predicted a drop in earnings in 2008. The stock tumbled 7.3 per cent to $34.04.Lockheed Martin said quarterly profits rose 10 per cent and the defence contractor raised its forecast for 2008 earnings. The stock rose 3.5 per cent to $105.49.Ford Motor announced a fourth quarter loss of $2.7bn and a loss of $2.8bn for 2007, as weak US operations overwhelmed stronger international growth. The stock rallied 11.1 per cent to $6.58.Xerox reported a rise in quarterly profit of 79 per cent. While its outlook for the first quarter was partly below Wall Street estimates and the stock rose 9 per cent to $14.46 this week.
176;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-01-25T00:07:26Z;Xerox sales and profits counter slowdown fears;;Xerox shrugged off concerns about a slowing US economy on Thursday by reporting higher sales and profits for the fourth quarter, sending shares in the copier and documents company up by 7.5 per cent.The company also reiterated its outlook for the full year and raised its forecast for full-year cash flow – a sign that it remains confident in its ability to increase sales and generate cash in spite of a slowdown in orders from big corporate customers.Asked during an investor conference call whether Xerox had noted any softness in orders, Anne Mulcahy, chief executive, said: “We had some mixed signals.“We saw perhaps a little bit of a slowdown in some of the corporate environment,” she said. “On the other hand, we were very pleased with our services signings.”Ms Mulcahy said the company’s annuity business – in which companies pay a steady fee over time for Xerox’s copy equipment and services – could blunt the effects of any short-term slowdown.Fully 70 per cent of Xerox’s sales consist of annuity payments, which include financing fees and other “post-sale” revenues such as installation fees, printing supplies, and document services.Ms Mulcahy said international sales and sales to small and medium business has helped to offset weakness among big corporate customers.Xerox reported a net profit of $382m in the three months to December 31, a 79 per cent increase on the fourth quarter of 2006, when a $269m restructuring charge ate into profits. Sales rose 11 per cent to $4.9bn. Earnings per share were 41 cents, up from 22 cents a share in the year-ago period.Ms Mulcahy hailed a strong performance by Xerox’s colour documents business, which has emerged as a key driver of sales and profits growth in recent quarters.The company said it threw off $1bn in cash in the fourth quarter, bringing its total cash flow to $1.9bn for the full year.Xerox expects earnings of 25 to 28 cents a share in the first quarter, and full-year earnings of $1.31 to $1.35 a share.
177;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-01-24T21:31:14Z;Wall St rises in choppy trading;;US stocks rose in choppy trade on Thursday as investors digested an array of mixed earnings and renewed weakness among bond insurers after a ratings downgrade.The S&P 500 index closed up 1 per cent at 1,352.07. The benchmark traded in a range between 1,334.31 (down 0.3 per cent) and 1,355.15 (up 1.2 per cent).Equity volatility as measured by the Vix index fell 4.9 per cent, after a tumble of 7 per cent on Wednesday.Among the leading S&P sectors, the energy sector rose 3.2 per cent, followed by gains of 3 per cent for technology and 2.9 per cent for materials. Utilities, a classic defensive sector, fell 2.8 per cent.The financials sector rose 0.6 per cent, after rising 1.5 per cent in early trade and following a jump of 6.8 per cent on Wednesday.The sector was buffeted by news that a plan to bail out bond insurers would take some time. Meanwhile, a steady rise in Treasury yields and a paring of rate cut expectations when the Federal Reserve meets next week, also took some of the steam out of the rebound.“Financials are the biggest beneficiaries of rate cuts,” said Doug Peta, strategist at J&W Seligman.While investors are hopeful that the broad benchmarks and financials have reached a bottom in price for the time being, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the plan to aid monoline insurers, said traders.Matters were not helped when Fitch Ratings cut the rating of Security Capital Assurance to A from AAA on Thursday and the stock fell 30.6 per cent, to $2.63. Ambac fell 17.3 per cent, to $11.33 and MBIA lost 13.3 per cent to $14.40 as the sector reversed some of Wednesday’s gains.As the broad market rose modestly after its sharp rebound on Wednesday, analysts warned that the worst may not be over for stocks.“Bear market rallies are characteristically brief,” said Mr Peta.The persistent slump in housing that has aroused fears of dragging the broad economy into a recession this year was highlighted on Thursday when existing home sales during December fell more than expected. The median single family home price fell 1.8 per cent in 2007, the first annual decline in four decades of data.The importance of housing prices for the economy and financial markets cannot be understated, said analysts.“As policymakers continue to confront ongoing crises, commercial paper in August, year-end liquidity in November and December, and now the prospects for bond insurers, the core threat to much of the leverage – the housing depression – continues to worsen,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.9 per cent at 2,360.92.In after-hours trade, sentiment for technology was boosted after the latest earnings from Microsoft. The tech giant beat earnings estimates and raised guidance, boosting the stock by 8 per cent in after-hours action after it rose 4.1 per cent to $33.25 in regular trade.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.5 per cent at 12,378.61, after setting a high of 12,399.18 in early trade.A slew of fourth-quarter earnings results on Thursday provided a mixed read.AT&T said quarterly earnings rose nearly 62 per cent, buoyed by the addition of a net 2.7m mobile customers. It also reaffirmed its forecast for further strong growth in 2008. The stock fell 2.6 per cent to $35.75 after trading up at $37.24 in early trade.Hershey said quarterly profit fell almost 65 per cent and the confectionery maker predicted a drop in earnings in 2008. The stock declined 2 per cent to $35.68.Lockheed Martin said quarterly profits rose 10 per cent and the defence contractor raised its forecast for 2008 earnings. The stock rose 4.1 per cent to $105.90.Ford Motor announced a fourth-quarter loss of $2.7bn and a loss of $2.8bn for 2007, as weak US operations overwhelmed stronger international growth. The stock fell 0.6 per cent to $6.26.Xerox reported a rise in quarterly profit of 79 per cent. Although its outlook for the first quarter was partly below Wall Street estimates, the stock gained 8.2 per cent at $14.33.After the closing bell on Wednesday, Ebay reported a 53 per cent rise in profits, but its 2008 forecast disappointed some analysts. Its shares declined 6.1 per cent to $27.18. Meg Whitman, the company’s chief executive, will step down at the end of March.Scott Kessler, internet software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research said they “expect incoming CEO John Donahoe to focus on the customer experience and shareholder value”. At its current stock price, ebay “trades at about 16 time our 2008 earnings per share forecast, a notable discount to historical levels” and he said the company’s valuation is “extremely attractive.”
178;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
179;XRX;Xerox Corp;2008-01-06T18:23:24Z;Xerox warns companies cutting IT spending;;An uncertain economic environment is causing companies to take a more sceptical look at new technology investments, says Anne Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive of Xerox, the US documents company.Her comments, in an interview with the Financial Times, are the latest indication that fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis and concerns about a US economic slowdown could cause companies to rethink spending on big IT projects – a key source of sales growth for technology companies.“The hurdle rate for making investments has gone up in general,” said Ms Mulcahy. “I think what we see in the US is heightened anxiety. We see the financial services industry tightening their belts, and rightfully so, based on the impacts there.”Ms Mulcahy’s comments followed a warning in November by John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems, the world’s biggest networking company, who said it had experienced “softness” in orders from big US customers. He said Cisco had seen a sharp fall-off in orders by financial services firms – traditionally among the biggest purchasers of IT equipment – many of which have been lumbered with big writedowns triggered by the credit squeeze.Technology stocks have slumped in recent weeks amid concerns that the sector could be hit by a drop in tech spending. On Friday, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index fell 3.7 per cent, capping a slide that has seen it shed about 10 per cent since it hit a 12-month high in October.In spite of Ms Mulcahy’s bearish outlook, she stressed that Xerox, which on Monday plans to launch a new corporate logo and brand image, was well positioned to weather any storm.“We used to be a company that served just big customers, but now [we are] very diversified in terms of small and medium-sized customers and government customers,” she said. “We have very little concentrated exposure in any industry segment, including financial services.”Since Xerox’s brush with bankruptcy in the early 2000s, Ms Mulcahy has cut jobs, outsourced manufacturing and reorientated the business around new, more profitable technologies such as colour printing and document management in an attempt to re-invigorate sales.The company announced in November that it would restore its quarterly dividend after a six-year hiatus.
180;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Refco lawyer indicted;;US securities enforcers have been saying for years they intend to hold gatekeepers, such as accountants, bankers and lawyers, responsible when they help clients defraud the investing public. The KPMG partners who audited Xerox and the Merrill Lynch bankers who facilitated Enron’s barge transaction found out the government was serious, much to their regret. But until this week, attorneys – and prominent law firms – had escaped the crackdown, except in those few cases where a lawyer could be shown to have personally inserted his hand in the company cookie jar. No attorney went to jail in connection with either Enron or WorldCom.On Tuesday, Michael Garcia, the US attorney in Manhattan, and the Securities and Exchange Commission appeared keen to change that. They charged Joseph Collins, a partner with Mayer Brown, with fraud for allegedly helping Refco, a now-bankrupt futures broker, conceal that its former chief executive owed the company hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr Collins is charged with drafting false securities-offering documents and his firm drafted the agreements allegedly used for a series of roundtrip loan transactions that hid the debt. He has pleaded not guilty and plans to fight the charges.If the Refco case proves more than a one-off, the effect on US companies could be significant. The case, Mr Collins’s attorney said, “should send a chill down the spine of every transactional lawyer”. It probably will. Law firms are likely to spend longer on due diligence and demand higher fees in exchange for their stamp of approval. For many companies, that is an unnecessary cost. But Refco declared bankruptcy only five months after an initial public offering that valued it at $4bn. Someone should have asked more questions.
181;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-12-06T22:13:45Z;Web founder warns of short-termism;;Internet companies are taking a dangerously short-term view and ignoring big potential risks and opportunities as the online medium becomes a more central part of everyday life, according to the man who invented the worldwide web.Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who now oversees the development of new technology standards for the web as head of the World Wide Web Consortium, also criticised the lack of support for long-term research into these issues, which he said marks a break from the traditional approach technology companies have taken.“I think there’s a lot of concern the web companies are thinking short-term,” Sir Tim said in an interview with the Financial Times while visiting Silicon Valley last week.“They’ve been taught to look short-term by the dot-com bubble, [it] has made everyone very conscious of short-term returns on investment, and this has trickled down to research funding.”He also sounded a sceptical note about Silicon Valley’s latest outbreak of internet euphoria, focused on a rash of so-called “Web 2.0” companies in areas such as social networking and online video.“Because it’s so easy to make a Web 2.0 site you can clone a lot of them very easily, and as a result people are bringing out new sites with a modicum of new polish on them – but they’re not really thinking up the new ideas,” he said.While some internet companies, such as Yahoo, have created their own research labs, these have tended to take a far narrower and more pragmatic approach to the areas they study than the tech industry’s ground-breaking labs of the past, such as those run by AT&T, IBM and Xerox.According to Sir Tim, research on the future of the web needs to draw on experts from a mix of backgrounds, including technologists, economists, psychologists and sociologists. What is lacking are “the people who could be really rethinking a new form of web interaction, a new way of organising society, something to replace the existing forms of democracy”, he said.The analysis needed to back this long-term thinking also requires “a very large amount of computing power and a very large amount of mathematics”, he added.Sir Tim is himself trying to raise up to $100m to back a joint research initiative launched a year ago by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he teaches, and the University of Southampton.While he refused to comment on any individual companies, Sir Tim did not spare Google, the most ambitious of the current crop of internet companies, from his criticism.Responding to a question about the search company, he said: “In general, the attitude a lot of companies have towards research nowadays is [that] they like to see the product in 18 months – rather than, here are some really big problems, go away and think about them, take some risks, come back with some ideas we don’t believe – the sort of things that triggered big advances in the past.”
182;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-10-11T18:11:31Z;It pays to keep your growth targets realistic;;"When Jeffrey Immelt became chairman and chief executive of General Electric, he set a new growth target: “We believe that GE can grow two to three times faster than world gross domestic product, which translates to about 8 per cent sustained sales growth.” Most chief executives feel the need to announce bold revenue growth targets. But how does top management arrive at these targets?When we asked several chief executives and chief financial officers of Fortune Global 500 companies this question, the answers were remarkably similar: none had relied on a formal process. One chief executive of a leading European manufacturing company said: “We certainly listen to analysts and have a look at the targets the competition has announced, but in the end we rely on our expertise and gut feeling to set the right targets.”Setting targets that are too low can have a dramatic impact on a company’s competitive strength and share price. Overambitious targets may drive companies too hard and too fast. But when does fast become too fast?While traditional growth and investment metrics are useful, our analysis suggests that a new measure is needed. We call it the growth corridor – an indication of how much sustainable growth a company can bear before diminishing returns kick in. A company’s growth corridor can be calculated by following three easy steps.First, determine the minimum growth threshold, which is based on the average sales growth of the company’s most relevant competitors. Companies need to grow at least as fast as the competition to avoid losing market share. Thereafter, estimate the company’s maximum growth threshold, which indicates the maximum sales growth a business can achieve without borrowing more money. This “sustainable growth rate” is calculated by multiplying the company’s return on equity by the proportion of the earnings that it retains. Companies that consistently exceed the given rate can face serious financial repercussions, such as bankruptcy. Finally, compare the two growth thresholds to the realised sales growth. Wal-Mart had an average competitive growth rate of 5.2 per cent and a sustainable growth rate of 21.4 per cent between 1997 and 2006. Its average sales growth for the decade was 12.7 per cent – within its growth corridor.By calculating the growth corridors of all the Fortune Global 500 companies over the past decade, we found that companies that grew within their growth corridor limits outperformed their peers that did not. “Smart growers” delivered shareholders an average return of nearly double the rate of either the slower or faster growing companies. Smart growers included companies such as Citigroup, GE, Microsoft, Nestlé, Pfizer and Toyota.Smart growers share three characteristics: they have cultures oriented to the long term; they set and communicate realistic growth targets; and they simultaneously pursue sales and profit growth.Smart growers are the exception rather than the rule. More than 75 per cent of the Fortune Global 500 companies failed to operate within their corridor and paid a price – in rising debt and/or declining profit margins and/or falling share prices. Some, such as Coca-Cola, Eastman Kodak and Xerox, had the financial muscle to grow with the market but failed to realise new growth. In many cases, they saw continuous erosion of their market share. Other companies, such as AES, Vodafone and Tyco, managed to outgrow the market but they grew so rapidly that their financial means were stretched to the limit. In effect, they suffered sharply rising debt loads.Smart growth is not about impressing financial markets with ambitious revenue targets. It is about finding the right corridor. A continued disparity between actual growth and the growth corridor should prompt managers to realign their targets. Chief executives need the courage to withstand pressure for ever-increasing, unrealistic growth rates.The growth corridor shows outsiders that the company has set realistic targets and is fully utilising its resources to generate shareholder value. Long-term, value-oriented investors appreciate reliable growth prospects. In the long run, the best stocks are not the ones with the highest projected growth rates but those that consistently meet or exceed their targets.Georg von Krogh is professor of strategic management and innovation at ETH Zurich.

183;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-10-04T18:14:40Z;Challenging the iPod;;When Apple announces a new addition to its iPod family, devotees camp out overnight to buy one. It is hard to imagine Microsoft’s rival, Zune, causing a similar run on tents. Some 1.2m Zunes have been sold since they went on sale almost a year ago compared with an average of more than 16m iPods per annum since launching in 2001.Maybe that is why Microsoft’s announcement this week of the next generation of Zunes looked so curiously low-key. In an interview, Bill Gates, the company’s chairman, was quoted as saying that consumer satisfaction with the device’s software had been “so-so” but he was sure that things would improve. Compare that with the messianic approach of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive.When your rival has, in the tradition of Xerox and Hoover, come up with a product so popular its brand name is synonymous with the entire genre, there is perhaps little point in pretending otherwise. Microsoft arrived late on the digital music scene. The Zune, worthy enough, looks much like an iPod Nano or Classic and sells at about the same price.The decision to beef up the Zune’s file-sharing and social networking aspects shows that Microsoft is, sensibly, trying to differentiate it. Its Xbox 360 games console shows it can break into competitive consumer markets – although profits have proved more elusive. And even Apple can trip up, as its recent gaffe on iPhone pricing demonstrated.The bigger picture, however, is that Microsoft faces multiple challengers as it looks to life beyond Windows. It has huge resources but the rapid growth of the likes of Apple and Google means rivals can no longer be regarded as mere minnows. Perhaps that offers some consolation: a tiny market share in music players at least gives Microsoft a rare opportunity to play the plucky underdog.
184;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-10-03T07:26:02Z;Grenoble: Big effort to stay one step ahead;;Hervé Fradet is a firm believer in the idea of synergy. As the director of the Agency for Studies and Promotion of Isère, he has seen at first hand how the close interaction between universities, research centres and large multinationals has helped transform Grenoble, a former Alpine garrison town, into a technology hotspot in the heart of the Rhône-Alpes region.The city is home to the highest concentration of engineers in France. More than 50,000 students attend the region’s 10 engineering schools, including the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble and the Université Joseph Fourier. It is also a world-class research centre, with a number of public and private institutes leading cutting-edge research in areas ranging from nanotechnology to solar energy cells.Hewlett-Packard, France Telecom, STMicroelectronics and Xerox are among the heavyweights to have set up research facilities in the city, while Kelkoo, the price comparison website that was snapped up by Yahoo for €475 three-and-a-half years ago and Capgemini, the computer services consultancy, both had their start in Grenoble.If Grenoble and its surrounding areas are synonymous with its research in microtechnology, it has Aristide Berges to thank. Mr Berges invented and installed the world’s first hydro-electric turbine in Grenoble in the late 19th century. The development of hydro-electric energy, followed by the nuclear power put the city at the centre of research and education in energy and electricity production. The close ties that developed between the research centres and universities and private companies would later help give rise to the development of the electronics industry and sustain the city’s current lead in the field of microelectronics.Electronic companies, both local and foreign, are drawn to Grenoble’s technological and scientific environment, and their presence acts as a strong pull on other companies that specialise in computer software and hardware.The creative synergy that can result from being in close proximity to other technology companies is one reason Schneider Electric, the electrical component group, decided to regroup part of its French research centres in Grenoble.“For us to be competitive, innovation is key,” says Bernard Delvallée, senior vice president of quality and programmes at Schneider. “We are obliged to innovate because if we don’t, then our products risk becoming run of the mill quite quickly,” he says.“The advantage of being in Grenoble is that we are in tune with the latest technological developments. The fact that there’s a vast network of specialists here is important. Technology is changing too fast and we can’t pretend that we can do everything ourselves.”The city of Grenoble clearly has many strengths. But as Mr Fradet of the development agency says there is still work to be done.“Our economy is oriented in the right direction but it’s not over yet,” he says. “We are very small compared with wealthier technology clusters in Albany, Silicon Valley and Japan. To compete, we need to keep reinforcing the work we have done so far.”Insecurity over the city’s status was underscored two years ago following reports that Hewlett-Packard was looking to lay off half of its 1,900 staff in Grenoble. The number turned out to be greatly exaggerated. Veronique Bouhafs-Blanchard, director of HPs site in Grenoble, says only 294 people left the company. Of this, 26 per cent left to start their own business. Meanwhile, the company hired 70 new staff members this year.“The universities in Grenoble are very strong in technology and the technology of tomorrow,” she says. “For the type of R&D work that HP is doing in interactive media and security, it is crucial that we stay in Grenoble.”One way the region has sought to ensure its future has been the creation of Minatec. The new €3bn state-of-the-art research centre was built to facilitate research in micro and nanotechnologies by putting students, public and private researchers all under one roof. While it is still too early to expect a significant research breakthrough, the creation of a centre is already drawing in new biotech companies.
185;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-07-25T14:18:35Z;Xerox boosted by colour printing business;;Xerox, the world’s largest manufacturer of office copiers and printers, on Wednesday slightly exceeded analyst expectations for its second-quarter earnings, driven by a boost in colour equipment sales and strong performance in developing markets.The company reported a net second-quarter profit of $266m, or 28 cents per share, a cent more than analysts’ forecasts, according to Reuters Estimates, and a 2 per cent increase from $260m in the same period last year.Anne Mulcahy, Xerox chairman and CEO, said the company’s May acquisition of Global Imaging Systems had increased the company’s reach to small and mid-size businesses and contributed to increased revenue in its office business, which grew by 5 per cent.Xerox, which has traditionally focused on selling to larger companies, paid a large premium to acquire the US equipment distributor in a $1.5bn deal.Xerox machines churned out more than 30bn colour pages in the three months to June, representing a 30 per cent increase. Colour business grew by 12 per cent to comprise 38 per cent of the manufacturer’s total revenue, the Connecticut-based company said.“[O]ur investment in delivering the industry’s broadest portfolio of colour technology is paying off with the annuity from our colour business increasing 16 per cent,” Ms Mulcahy said.Developing markets in Eurasia and central and eastern Europe also contributed to the company’s performance by producing $531m in revenue, an increase of 13 per cent.The bullish results led Xerox to increase its expected full-year earnings range to between $1.16 and $1.18. In the third quarter, the company said it expected 24 to 26 cents in earnings per share.
186;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-07-11T08:43:04Z;What’s new: SMEs offered business intelligence from Oracle;;"Oracle is bringing business intelligence to the masses with Oracle BI Standard Edition One aimed at SMEs and departmental users.Oracle did the same with its flagship database to produce a cut-down version called Oracle 10g Standard Edition One, which this lies at the heart of the new BI offering and includes tools for creating dashboards, ad hoc reporting and publishing. The BI SE One software costs $1,000 for each user, minimum five, maximum 50.Infor, the fast-growing US enterprise software vendor, has unveiled Infor EAM Enterprise Edition, a new version of its enterprise asset management (EAM) solution.The product aims to help businesses in the fleet management, manufacturing, facilities and life sciences industries track their capital assets.Future releases will include more industries. The product was previously known as Infor Datastream and stems from Infor’s 2006 acquisition of Datastream, an EAM specialist.Xerox says its new search technology, FactSpotter, goes beyond the limitations of traditional keyword-based searches.FactSpotter looks not only for keywords in a query but also
the context of the document
containing those words. It
can also handle abstract concepts.Xerox plans to target FactSpotter at the legal and regulatory compliance market and possibly other vertical applications, but there are no plans to compete with the likes of Google in consumer search.Hewlett-Packard offers green storage with a trio of mid-range disc arrays named EVA4100,
6100 and 8100, which improve power efficiency by up to
45 per cent over their
predecessors.HP claims a big data centre with a monthly storage electricity bill of $3,000 could save as much as $18,000 a year in power and cooling costs.IBM’s Lotus software hopes for a new lease of life thanks to social networking technologies such as wikis and blogs.IBM claims Lotus Connections will make it easier for businesses to integrate social networking into their existing IT infrastructures and commonly used applications.Lotus is best known for Notes, once the leading business e-mail application before Microsoft’s Exchange took the top slot. Lotus Connections costs $110 per user.Google has finally released a version of its popular Google Desktop search application for the Linux operating system. The free program is already offered for Windows and Mac OS X users and now there is a Linux version, although in a typical Google move, it is currently only a beta version. The software was developed by Google’s Beijing engineering team. As well as two Chinese languages, it comes in English and eight other tongues."
187;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-06-17T21:10:24Z;Call for end to quarterly guidance;;An unprecedented coalition of large companies, pension funds, and trade unions will on Monday urge corporate America to scrap quarterly earnings guidance in an attempt to curtail the influence of hedge funds and other short-term investors.The move, backed by leading corporate figures such as Jeff Kindler, chief executive of Pfizer, and Anne Mulcahy, his counterpart at Xerox, will increase pressure on companies and fund managers to focus on long-term objectives rather than short-term fixes.The broad-based coalition, whose participants range from the Business Roundtable, which represents 160 leading US chief executives, to the AFL-CIO, the largest union federation, will also call for an overhaul in compensation practices to reward corporate and fund managers for long-term performance.Monday’s publication of the new set of corporate principles – masterminded by the Aspen Institute, an influential not-for-profit group – underlines corporate America’s fear that the focus on quarterly results is hampering US companies’ long-term prospects and the country’s economic competitiveness.“The signing of the Aspen principles by such a diverse group is a milestone in business history,” said Ms Mulcahy. “What is especially significant is the focus on long-term value and opening lines of communication with shareholders.”The principles, which were also backed by PepsiCo, the Council of Institutional Investors and the Center for Audit Quality, which represents 800 accounting firms, call on companies to “avoid both the provision of, and response to, estimates of quarterly earnings and other overly short-term financial targets”.Instead, companies should talk to shareholders about their business strategy and their outlook over a number of years, according to the document, which has been seen by the Financial Times.More than half of US companies offer quarterly earnings guidance and the percentage is higher among larger groups.In private, many US chief executives say they have to provide their own quarterly earnings forecasts because analysts and investors demand them. Some express the fear that ending the practice would hit their companies’ share prices or that analysts would put out inaccurate forecasts.Hedge funds and other short-term investors tend to like guidance because the discrepancies between actual and forecast earnings offers them lucrative trading opportunities.However, corporate leaders and academics argue that the pressure to meet quarterly forecasts prompts companies to forgo long-term investments such as capital expenditure and research and development.The principles say companies should look at a five-year horizon and urge both executives and fund managers to tie their compensation to long-term performance targets.
188;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-06-04T23:15:05Z;Flextronics buys US rival Solectron for $3.6bn;;Consolidation among white-label electronics makers continued Monday as Flextronics, a Singapore-based electronics maker, bought Solectron, a US rival.Flextronics, which makes products ranging from printers sold by Hewlett-Packard to copy machines sold by Xerox, said it would pay $3.6bn for Solectron, which specialises in higher-end telecoms and computer products.The cash and stock deal comes amid a period of turmoil in the industry, as the companies that build computers, mobile phones and other electronics equipment on behalf of name-brand clients grapple with fierce price competition and a glut of overcapacity.Michael McNamara, chief executive of Flextronics, said the purchase of Solectron would allow the company to extend its reach and cut costs.“It made sense to consolidate the industry,” he said. “We have a very strong position right now. We have positive momentum so we are in a position to do something. We viewed Solectron as being very strong operationally with a strong customer base.”The acquisition continues a string of recent transactions by Flextronics. Last year, it bought International DisplayWorks, a maker of liquid crystal displays for mobile phones, for $300m.In March it sold an 85 per cent stake in Flextronics Software Systems, a software subsidiary, to a consortium of private equity groups led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for $900m in cash.The company has also moved jobs to India and Ukraine to cut costs.The deal with Flextronics comes as Solectron hunts for a new chief executive following the departure of Michael Cannon in February. Mr Cannon left to lead a new global supply chain organisation at Dell, the world’s second-biggest personal computer maker.Shares in Solectron jumped 15 per cent Monday to $3.88 on news of the Flextronics deal. Flextronics’ shares dipped 1.3 per cent to $11.55. They had fallen from a high of $12.16 in January.The fall came in spite of strong revenue growth at the company.Flextronics reported sales of $18.9bn last year, an increase of 23 per cent over the year before.
189;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-05-09T16:25:57Z;View from the Top: Anne Mulcahy on women in business;;Chrystia Freeland, Financial Times US managing editor, interviewed Anne Mulcahy of Xerox. In this segment she discusses women in business. This is a transcript of the interview, which you may watch here. You may also read the transcript of the other segment of the interview, in which Ms Mulcahy discusses private equity, the environment, and Citigroup.FT: Thank you for joining us, Ms Mulcahy.ANNE MULCAHY: It’s a pleasure to be here.FT: Why do you think there are so few women CEOs?MS MULCAHY: Sins of the past! You don’t just kind of get there. You have to actually be identified and developed and supported and retained, and that’s a journey. I’d have to say that the reason why there aren’t a representative amount of women as CEOs is because there hasn’t been the kinds of investments in the experience and development of women over the last couple of decades that would have produced certainly a much richer diversity, if you will, of CEO’s. The good news is that I think that’s starting to change now with senior teams of public companies, where you look around the table and there’s just really talented women on senior teams. So my hope is…once again, it’s like a tipping point, where that cadre of talent will now begin to emerge in leadership positions, certainly in the Fortune 500.FT: Is it just a generational thing? If we wait a few more years, will we see this new generation of women emerging?MS MULCAHY: Well, I never adhere to waiting, because I don’t think that that’s what delivers results. This is not a passive sport. You have to actually be focused and active and make sure that it’s being worked and nourished in terms of the pipeline of women who are available for top jobs. There’s lots of places for women to go privately or entrepreneurial kinds of opportunities and therefore if you want women to be retained in big corporations, it takes some work.FT: Have you encountered structural sexist barriers in your career?MS MULCAHY: I think the answer would have to be yes! I grew up with four brothers, so I probably came a little bit better prepared for that than some of my peers perhaps, but I think that part of this is making sure that performance is key and you have to find the right people to provide support. You have to be willing to leave behind any issues, not be looking on the dark side, really kind of stay focused on the possibilities and, as I said, I think Xerox also…and I chose Xerox deliberately because it had a great reputation in terms of focusing on women and minorities, and as a result I’m here 31 years later.FT: The co-founder for private equity groups said to me recently that the reason there were so few women in senior positions in that field - and there are almost none - is women don’t like to fight. They always pull back. Do you think that’s true?MS MULCAHY: No. I think one of the things that irritates me the most is generalisations and I think the minute you make a statement like that, you’re the reason why there’s not a lot of women in private equity, because those kinds of assumptions and statements become predictably fulfilling. I think you’ve got to look harder and work harder at it, and I think that perhaps financial services in general has a way to go and therefore the pipeline potentially leading to some of those jobs isn’t as strong as it may be. But I think whenever you hear a statement like that, you have to stand back and say: absolutely not! I love to fight, hopefully doing it professionally, but finding it to be a requirement for my job. If you don’t like to fight, it’s tough to lead. And I mean that in, I hope, a constructive way, but I don’t think that that’s characteristic of women leaders I know.FT: Is it worth it economically for companies to spend time and money on looking for more diversity? Why should they do it?MS MULCAHY: Because that’s the way you get the best talent. I think that if you’ve got a list of all male candidates, then you’ve eliminated 50% of the population from your candidate list…not probably the best way to find the best talent.FT: I sometimes suspect that the younger generation of women, my generation of women, is a little bit less tough and whines a little bit more than the pioneering generation to which my mother belonged. Do you ever feel that way when you hear young women talking about work/life balance and all these sorts of complaints about how it’s actually quite hard to do these things?MS MULCAHY: I do, but I think it’s something that has to be led from the next generation, so I think there’s a lot of merit not just for women, but for men about suggesting that work/life balance and different ways of working are more than acceptable, that the formula for my generation’s success isn’t necessarily the formula that’s required for equal or greater amounts of success. I’d love to work in a world that actually was more flexible and was focused more on the output of the work than the input or the style.FT: Thank you very much.MS MULCAHY: You’re very welcome.FT: And now we’ll do long/short, where I name people, companies and categories and will ask you, Miss Mulcahy, to say whether you’re long or short on them.

In this segment she discusses private equity, the environment and Citigroup. This is a transcript of the interview, which you may watch here. You may also read the transcript of the other segment of the interview, in which Ms Mulcahy discusses women in business.Financial Times: Thank you for joining us, Ms Mulcahy.ANNE MULCAHY: It’s a pleasure to be here.FT: You have led quite a profound restructuring of your company. Have you ever thought that that would have been easier to do had you been a private company?MS MULCAHY: I do think there’s some benefits for major turnarounds and transitions for the private equity business and it makes some sense if you need to get tough things done during a relatively short period of time, but I have to say I balanced that with my belief in the public company system which says that there should be a degree of discipline and transparency associated. For us, I don’t think that the public setting was inappropriate for what we were doing.FT: As more and more companies go private, do you think there’s a risk that overall there will be a loss of transparency in American business?MS MULCAHY: Yes. I think that there’s an argument made for the fact that maybe we don’t have transparency totally right and that we need to keep working at making it meaningful to investors and not overly bureaucratic for companies. So I don’t necessarily think we’re at the goalpost here in terms of transparency for public companies. But I think that to solve it by suggesting that that’s not a worthwhile mission and that being private and having to avoid transparency is the answer is not appropriate as well.FT: Can you imagine Xerox ever going private?MS MULCAHY: I’m sure I could in the sense, is it possible? Yes. Is it preferable? No.FT: Is it likely?MS MULCAHY: No, I don’t think so. I think in many ways the role of private equity in terms of really trying to create or unleash value - a lot of that heavy lifting’s already been done at Xerox.FT: Are there any types of jobs which are being done in the United States right now which you can see moving offshore completely or more completely, going forward?MS MULCAHY: I think as multinational companies, we really need to be thinking about how we make it a lot more attractive to develop a much larger portion of talent that’s based out of math and science disciplines. So the reality is, yes. The sophistication and capabilities that are available are getting better and better from a global perspective.FT: And maybe salaries are lower?MS MULCAHY: Salaries are lower, but I have to tell you I’m a big believer that that shouldn’t be the driving force here, because that is temporary and if you look at a lot of the offshoring kind of progress and you look at places like Ireland, which was the hot rage ten years ago, or if you look at India today even, where salaries and real estate and infrastructure are all coming upmarket, what you’re really looking for is the best global capabilities that are sustainable over a longer period of time.FT: Some people are still talking about the paperless office. If we ever get there, is that a problem for Xerox?MS MULCAHY: I think it’s an opportunity. I think that a lot of it is what we’re focused on with our services business, and it’s helping our customers go digital. If there’s one thing that we’ve learnt coming through our turnaround, it’s that you had better like change and embrace it because defending the status quo is not a good thing!FT: Could Xerox ever become a target for environmental groups?MS MULCAHY: I think that the fact that certainly our industry is a user of paper says that part of the problem and part of the solution are very much characteristics associated with the industry. A lot of our history, interestingly enough, has been as a leader in environmental concerns. We are one of the first companies to really talk about re-use and re-manufacturing and one of the first companies to target greenhouse gas emission reductions. So our track record is actually one of stepping out and volunteering before it becomes mandatory…a lot more to do! But I think that we’d like to be able to step out and identify solutions as we go along and be a helper and not a hinderer.FT: You’re on the Citigroup board. How much more time do you think Chuck Prince should be given.MS MULCAHY: I think we’ve just talked about Xerox coming through our period of transition. I think Citigroup’s in a period of transition and I’m a big believer that rushes to judgment are not good for companies, that none of us can do what’s expected of us in short windows of time, that a lot of efforts, whether they’re on the governance side or the growth side or the business model side, take longer to deliver, particularly in big complex companies, and that rushes to judgment generally don’t serve shareholders very well.FT: Is it possible that maybe Citigroup is just too big to thrive?MS MULCAHY: There’s two kinds of scale. There’s big for the sake of big and that’s just size and clout. And then there’s big because they’re strategic. So if Citigroup can deliver on what it’s working on, which is synergies between some of the financial services arms of its business, things like the brokerage business and the retail banking business, and if those can become synergistic where there’s growth to be had and better one-stop shopping for clients, then big is terrific.FT: Was Vikram Pandit worth the price?MS MULCAHY: We’ll find out! Certainly I think most of his reviewers would say that he’s a first-class investment for Citigroup and particularly in the area of alternative investments, which is such a strategic part of the Citi business these days. I think most people would say he’s a great asset.FT: Do you think the departure of Todd Thomson was handled properly?MS MULCAHY: I don’t really think that’s an appropriate topic for me to talk about in an interview, so I’m going to decline to answer that.FT: What about the consolidations we’re seeing in the media? Do you think that Rupert Murdoch would make a good owner for Dow Jones?MS MULCAHY: I’m a big believer that newspapers are more than just big profit machines, that there is a role to be thought about and I wouldn’t make a judgment call as to whether or not Rupert Murdoch’s going to be the answer to potentially any challenges Dow Jones has. But I think when you think about that business, you have to think as much about value and positioning and clearly independence…a different business model than other public companies and I’m a believer in that, that time will tell, but I think it’s more than just a traditional ROI kind of model these days.FT: Thank you very much.MS MULCAHY: You’re very welcome.FT: And now we’ll do long/short, where I name people, companies and categories and will ask you, Miss Mulcahy, to say whether you’re long or short on them.

191;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-04-06T16:39:50Z;Wall Street up 2% on week;;Wall Street spent another week repairing the damage inflicted by the late February sell-off. Investors are looking ahead to next week’s start of the first quarter earnings season.According to Thomson Financial, the average rise in profits for the first three months of the year compared with 2006, is forecast at 3.6 per cent. That is down from 8.7 per cent estimated at the start of January and would mark a break from 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth.David Dropsey, senior research analyst at Thomson, said the reduction in expectations reflected “a lack of positive guidance from companies. No one wants to over-promise and under-deliver on earnings.”Although companies may ultimately beat reduced expectations, investors are likely to focus on the outlook for the second quarter and beyond.‘‘Earnings will likely beat sharply reduced expectations, but guidance will dominate and that will be downbeat,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. “I’m not a bear, but the market faces further challenges before it can advance in a sustained way.”Recent data on the economy has revealed a combination of slower growth and elevated inflation that could erode revenues and raise costs for companies.That trend was countered by the unexpectedly strong March employment report released yesterday. The data suggested US economic growth is not slowing as much as some had feared.While the cash equity market was closed, S&P 500 futures rose after the payrolls data was released, suggesting upward pressure on stock prices on Monday.For the Easter-shortened week, the S&P 500 gained 1.6 per cent to 1,443.76 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.05 per cent to 2,471.34. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.65 per cent to 12,560.20 and is back in positive territory for the year to date.Among companies in the spotlight this week, was Altria, which in its first week of trading after spinning off Kraft Foods, rose 7.35 per cent to $70.75. Analysts believe Altria could announce shedding its international business when it releases earnings later this month.One of the week’s poor performers was Monster, whose price slumped 13.8 per cent to $40.85 after the job placement website cut its first-quarter sales outlook below analyst expectations.Poor earnings pressured Micron and it fell 4.7 per cent to $11.51 this week after the maker of flash memory posted a loss for the second quarter.Boosting sentiment for technology was Research In Motion, up 6.8 per cent to $145.77. Goldman raised its earnings estimates for the maker of the BlackBerry hand held personal organiser and maintained a price target of $185 a share.Hewlett-Packard gained 4.1 per cent to $41.80 this week, while another tech heavy-weight, Microsoft, rose 2.4 per cent to $28.55 after Citigroup raised its fiscal third-quarter earnings estimate for the software giant.Financial stocks remained in the spotlight, and the sector is the only major industry group within the S&P that is negative for the year, down 2.9 per cent.This reflects concern over the sector’s exposure to US mortgages, particularly those issued to borrowers with high loan-to-value ratios and sketchy documentation.M&T Bank slid 8.5 per cent to $105.99, after the New York based regional bank said its exposure to risky Alt-A mortgages would reduce first-quarter net income.But, there was a sliver of good news as Accredited Home Lenders closed the week up 4 per cent at $9.64. The big subprime mortgage lender said it had secured a $1.1bn line of credit from two banks.The S&P homebuilders index finally snapped a run of eight days of losses and closed 0.7 per cent higher for the week.Deal activity was led by a $29bn purchase of First Data, the credit card and payment company, by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The private equity firm will pay First Data shareholders $34 a share, a premium that sent the shares 20 per cent higher to $32.29.Xerox said it would purchase Global Imaging Systems for around $1.5bn and sharesits jumped 48 per cent to $28.83.In its first week trading as a combined entity, NYSE Euronext rose 3.2 per cent to $96.74.
192;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-04-03T02:04:35Z;Xerox buys GIS for $1.5bn;;"Xerox, the world’s largest maker of office copiers and printers, has clinched its biggest ever acquisition after buying US equipment distributor Global Imaging Systems for $1.5bn.The large premium paid by Xerox – nearly 50 per cent higher than GIS’s closing share price on Friday – underlines the company’s desire to increase its presence in the fast-growing small-business sector and capture a larger slice of the high-margin after-sales market for copiers and printers.Nasdaq-listed GIS, founded in 1994 by chief executive Tom Johnson, specialises in selling and servicing office equipment from several manufacturers to more than 200,000 small and medium-sized businesses.That market is estimated to be worth $16bn and has grown at an annual average of 15 per cent over the past five years. However, Xerox has traditionally had a small presence in the sector, largely because pricing and design of its product
have been aimed at larger companies.Anne Mulcahy, chief executive, said that acquiring GIS and its 1,400 sales representatives would boost Xerox’s distribution capacity in the small-business sector by more than 50 per cent.“Access to the small and medium business sector is the big deal here,” she said. “It happens to be the segment we have the least penetration in terms of orders. We need to get in there if we want to grow.”Since taking the helm in 2001, Ms Mulcahy has pulled Xerox back from the brink of bankruptcy, slashing jobs and attempting to reduce its reliance on low-margin copiers and printers in favour of more lucrative technology services.The strategy has delivered improved profitability, thanks largely to lower costs, but has yet to produce significant increases in sales. Xerox’s revenues rose just 1 per cent last year to $15.7bn.Ms Mulcahy dismissed concerns that rivals such as Hewlett-Packard, Ricoh and Canon might stop selling their products through GIS for fear they might take second place to Xerox’s products.She argued that customers would decide which products to buy but acknowledged that Xerox was set to become GIS’s “preferred supplier”.Under the deal, shareholders in GIS will receive $29 per share in cash.GIS shares soared more than 46 per cent to $28.64 by the close in New York. Xerox shares were 1 per cent higher at $17.08."
193;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-04-02T21:02:40Z;US stocks eke out modest gains;;Wall Street edged higher on Monday, as a flurry of deal activity offset concerns about financial stocks and the economy ahead of the first-quarter earnings season that kicks off next week.Trading lacked conviction and the mood in stocks softened in morning trade when monthly manufacturing data were weaker than expected and revealed rising prices.The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index for March was 50.9, below an expected reading of 51.1 and down from 52.3 in February. The prices paid component of the ISM rose to 65.5 last month, from 59 in February. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion in activity.The inflation picture damped hopes among some investors that the Federal Reserve would cut rates soon.While losses in stocks were pared yesterday afternoon, the slowing economy has investors wary about quarterly profits, analysts say.“The economy is slowing, but the important element is how that ultimately affects earnings growth,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Investors expect year-on-year growth in corporate profits during the first quarter to fall well below 10 per cent, breaking a run of 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit earnings growth.According to Thomson Financial, the average rise in profits for the first three months of the year is forecast at 4.4 per cent. That is down from a forecast 8.7 per cent made at the start of January and follows an 11.4 per cent rise in profits for the fourth quarter of 2006.“There is some trepidation about earnings, they could come in below already reduced expectations,” said Doug Peta, market strategist at J&W Seligman.Financial stocks have been a big contributor to profit growth in recent quarters, and the sector weighed upon the S&P 500 index on Monday, amid concern over bank exposure to Alt-A mortgages – home loans that are slightly less risky than subprime loans but still involve risks such as high loan-to-value ratios and sketchy documentation.M&T Bank slid 8.7 per cent to $105.75, after the New York based regional bank said its exposure to Alt-A mortgages would reduce first-quarter net income by $7m, or 7 cents a share.Other Alt-A lenders suffered. IndyMac Bancorp fell 4.4 per cent to $30.65 and Countrywide Financial slid 2.7 per cent to $32.73.In spite of selling in financials, utilities and energy stocks boosted the S&P and it closed up 0.25 per cent at 1,424.55.The Nasdaq Composite rebounded from a loss of 0.4 per cent in early trade and closed a fraction firmer at 2,422.26.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,382.30, boosted by a 3.5 per cent rise to $68.22 in Altria as the cigarette maker completed its spin-off of Kraft Foods. Another Dow component, Merck, rallied 1.9 per cent to $45.01 after its diabetes drug won Federal approval.American Express, down 1 per cent to $55.86, and Citigroup, off 0.6 per cent at $51.05, were are a drag on the Dow.Beyond the economy, deal activity continued to boost pockets of the market, led by a $29bn purchase of First Data, the credit card and payment company, by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The private equity firm will pay First Data shareholders $34 a share, a premium price that sent the shares 20.6 per cent higher to $32.45.In other deal news, Tribune media group, which owns the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times and various television stations accepted an $8.2bn buyout offer from Sam Zell, a Chicago based real-estate investor. Shares in Tribune rose 2.2 per cent, to $32.81, and the company had been the subject of twin bids, from Zell and Eli Broad and Ron Burkle, investors based in Los Angeles.Xerox announced it would purchase Global Imaging Systems for around $1.5bn. Shares in Global jumped 46.9 per cent to $28.64, while Xerox gained 1.1 per cent to $17.08.Meanwhile, AirTran Holdings raised its offer for Midwest Air Group to $15 a share, up from an $11.25 price offered last year. Shares in AirTran rose 1.3 per cent to $10.40, while Midwest was 7.3 per cent higher at $14.50.Shares in Starwood Hotels & Resorts rose 4.6 per cent to $67.82, after Steven Heyer, the company’s chief executive, resigned.Earnings season looms after a tough first quarter for the leading benchmarks. Last week, stock indices closed out the first quarter of the year well off their highs – set in mid-February – as sentiment for homebuilders and financials soured amid growing problems in the subprime mortgage market.The Dow’s first quarter was its worst quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2005 and the blue chip barometer is well off its record high of 12,786.64, set on February 20.Leading the laggards in the Dow this year are Johnson & Johnson, off 9 per cent, Home Depot, down 8.4 per cent, and Citigroup, also lower by 8.4 per cent. By contrast, Alcoa with a gain of 13 per cent, AT&T, up 10.4 per cent, and Caterpillar, higher by 8.8 per cent, are the leaders within the Dow.While the Dow suffered a loss for the quarter, transport and utility shares were some of the better performing sectors. The Dow Transportation Average gained 5.6 per cent, and the Dow Utilities Average rose 9.5 per cent during the first quarter.Bonds also prospered during the first quarter. The Lehman Aggregate index, containing Treasuries, corporate bonds, agency and mortgage securities and other securitised products, returned 1.5 per cent during the last three months. It was the best quarterly performance since the third quarter of last year when the index produced a gain of 3.81 per cent.For all of 2006, the Lehman Aggregate index returned 4.33 per cent, while the leading stock benchmarks posted double-digit gains.
194;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-03-27T21:04:34Z;Women on march to top of US companies;;The number of women in charge of large US companies could double in the next five years as more female managers break through corporate America’s glass ceiling, according to Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive.Ms Nooyi, one of only 11 female chief executives among Fortune 500 companies, said a growing number of women had risen to senior corporate positions and could make the leap to a top job over the next few years.“The next five to 10 years I think are very promising …I am meeting more and more fantastic women at what I call almost-CEO levels. There is a lot of hope,” she told the Financial Times in an interview.“Eleven is better than zero, progress has been made and I hope that number doubles quickly”.The comments by Ms Nooyi, who became PepsiCo’s first female CEO last October after 12 years with the consumer goods group, contrast with the widespread fears of a slowdown in women’s rise to the top of corporate America.Last year, women lost ground to men in the share of both board memberships and corporate officer positions, according to Catalyst, an organisation focused on gender and equality issues.The research found that, despite accounting for nearly half of the US workforce, women make up only 15 per cent of directors and 16 per cent of senior officer positions in Fortune 500 companies.“Women candidates for senior positions face greater scrutiny than men,” said Ilene Lang, president of Catalyst.“But women are emerging. As companies look for the leaders of the future they want to play with a full deck, why look at only half of the potential talent?”The ranks of female chief executives of large companies, which include Ebay’s Meg Whitman and Xerox’s Anne Mulcahy, were recently augmented by the appointment of Irene Rosenfeld, a former senior executive at PepsiCo, as chief executive of Kraft.Ms Nooyi, who spent the first 23 years of her life in her native India before winning a place at Yale University in the US, said the lack of women in senior positions was one of the historical reason for their small presence in the boardroom.She said that companies had a responsibility to break any remnants of a glass ceiling by setting up programmes to help women rise to the top.
195;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-02-15T22:23:50Z;Investors query Citigroup board on Prince;;Some of Citigroup’s biggest shareholders have raised questions about the strong public support for Chuck Prince, the chief executive, from the bank’s board.The large number of chief executives from other companies on the board made it “naturally sympathetic to Chuck”, said one of Citigroup’s top 30 investors, who declined to be named.Another portfolio manager who controls more than $1bn (€761m) of stock said some of the directors, including Time Warner’s Dick Parsons, had faced criticism from their own shareholders. “They are hardly going to rock the boat,” he said.Most of Citigroup’s external directors are current or former leaders of big US or European companies. Corporate governance experts suggest this builds in a bias towards supporting the chief executive.Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Dow Chemical and a Citigroup board member, said Mr Prince should be given more time to revive the bank’s stock price. “I’m a fellow CEO. All of us would appreciate a bit of patience,” he said.Anne Mulcahy, a director who is chief executive of Xerox, also called for more time. “There is a lot of change going on and a lot of challenges that Citigroup has in terms of defining its future. I am not sure that there has been enough time to judge the degree of progress.”Alain Belda, chief executive of Alcoa and Citigroup’s lead director, said: “Chuck is executing decisively on a strategy that has the board’s full support, and he’s not afraid of tough choices to keep Citi on the right track.”But Mike Mayo, analyst at Prudential Equity Group, said there was a “disconnect” between board and shareholders. “Many [shareholders] say to us that management needs to take more aggressive action to improve the share price,” he said in a note to investors.In a recent report, The Corporate Library research firm noted that the Citigroup board had an unusually high proportion of chief executives – eight out of 16. On average, CEOs make up fewer than 8 per cent of outside directors on US boards.While having a small number of active corporate leaders could provide hands-on expertise, too many could blunt the board’s edge, said Paul Hodgson of The Corporate Library.“When you have got more than two or three on the board, you feel the board does not have the breadth of attitude to question the CEO,” he said.
196;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-01-25T18:07:53Z;IBM agrees printing deal with Ricoh;;IBM said on Thursday it would fold its printing systems division into a joint venture with Japan’s Ricoh as part of a plan to exits its digital commercial printer business.The Japanese group would then acquire the remaining 49 per cent of the venture – branded InfoPrint Solutions – over the next three years.IBM will receive $725m in cash when the deal closes – expected to take place in the second quarter. The payment will cover the initial 51 per cent stake in the joint venture that Toyko-based Ricoh will acquire together with a prepayment on the remaining stake.The final price tag will be decided at the end of the three-year period though IBM said it expected to recognise a total of between $175m and $275m on the deal.The deal marks the latest step by Samuel Palmisano, IBM’s chief executive, to refine the group’s focus to concentrate on what he sees as IBM’s core strategic businesses. It also represents the biggest divestiture since IBM completed the sale of its PC operations to China’s Lenovo for $1.75bn in May 2005.Nicholas Donofrio, IBM’s executive vice president in charge of innovation and technology, said IBM had been considering the future of the printing systems business, which has annual revenues of about $1bn, over the last three years and said that as growth slowed it had become “more and more obvious that we needed to do something here.”IBM revealed last week that sales in the printing systems division declined 7 per cent last quarter, and its profitability shrank.On Thursday Mr Donofrio emphasised that the digital printing business remained a solid business opportunity but added, “you have to be able to realise when it is time to let old things go”.For Rioch, which has extensive printer operations targeting small- and medium-sized businesses, the deal represents an opportunity to expand into a new area and broaden its range of office equipment products to compete with Xerox and Canon.Sales in the global digital printer market are expected to grow by about 32 per cent to $33bn in 2009, according to InfoTrends, a US research company.
197;XRX;Xerox Corp;2007-01-23T21:56:48Z;Wall Street edges up amid earnings;;US stocks posted modest gains on Tuesday as the latest flurry of earnings attracted buying after recent weakness in the market.In spite of the better tone, investors are mindful that upside earnings surprises have not matched the pace of recent quarters and that guidance for the current quarter looks soft.That could leave the market looking vulnerable, according to analysts.“We are in for a period of choppy trading,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards. “There will be an opportunity to buy stocks at cheaper levels in the near term.”Leading the recovery on Tuesday was the Russell 2000 index, but its gain of 0.9 per cent still left the market for small capitalised stocks in negative territory for the year.In New York, the S&P 500 closed up 0.35 per cent at 1,427.99. Higher oil prices boosted the energy sector by 2.4 per cent while healthcare stocks were off 0.4 per cent.Healthcare has this year been one of the better performing sectors in the S&P, with analysts suggesting that investors had sought refuge in defensive companies amid worries about the economy and profits.Earnings reports continued to arrive on Tuesday and homebuilders were in the spotlight. Shares in DR Horton jumped 4.6 per cent to $28.37 after it unveiled better than expected results and Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy”. The S&P homebuilders index rallied 2.2 per cent and Toll Brothers was up 4.1 per cent at $33.64.Technology shares rallied early in the day and then erased much of their gains. The Nasdaq Composite settled a touch higher at 2,431.41.Boosting the chipmaking sector was Texas Instruments, up 3.5 per cent at $29.60. The company’s earnings were better than expected and sentiment was helped by an upgrade from Merrill Lynch.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.45 per cent to 12,533.80, helped by a 3.2 per cent rise to $66.14 in United Technologies.The company reported a 38 per cent rise in profits and re-affirmed its outlook for this year.Shares in Exxon Mobil rose 2.2 per cent to $74.49.Blue chips were held back by Pfizer, which fell 2.2 per cent to $26.37 after the stock was downgraded by Bear Stearns. Pfizer lost 1 per cent on Monday after its fourth quarter earnings fell.Johnson & Johnson shares lost 1 per cent to $66.50 in spite of beating earnings estimates.DuPont fell 0.9 per cent to $49.67 after the company met earnings expectations.Shares in Xerox fell 1 per cent to $16.53 after its fourth-quarter profit slid amid a restructuring charge.Gap shares fell 3.2 per cent to $19.26 after the company said on Monday that Paul Pressler would step down as president and chief executive.
198;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-11-08T15:27:00Z;Introduction: Playing the tune of shared success;;"The chairman of BMW’s supervisory board, Joachim Milberg, once declared: “Those who work alone can only accumulate, but those who collaborate intelligently can multiply.” The comment was in relation to the development of the company’s X3 sports utility vehicle, which was developed in collaboration with Magna Steyr/SFT.The goal of achieving a result that is greater than the sum of the individual parts, – the “multiplication effect” – has long been recognised in business, and creating win-win relationships with partners is a key driver. This reflects a recognition that business is no longer about competition at all costs, but that organisations are being forced to collaborate and partner with other companies to gain competitive advantage.The term collaboration covers a broad range of different ways organisations can work together. Work by Douglas Lambert at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University with organisations such as McDonalds, Xerox, Ryder, 3M and Whirlpool and their key partners, identified the following types of relationship: arms length relationships, through what are defined as type one, two and three collaborative partnerships; joint ventures; and vertical integration.Type one collaborative partnerships are where companies recognise each other as partners, and co-ordinate and plan activities on a limited basis. The partnership is short-term and involves one division or a limited number of functional areas in each business.Type two collaborative partnerships see partners moving beyond the co-ordination of activities to the integration of them. This relationship has a long-term horizon but is not expected to last for ever. In this case, multiple divisions and functions within each company are involved.Type three collaborative partnerships occur when the companies share significant levels of operational integration. Each organisation views the other as an extension of its own business, an end-date is not usually set and the relationship is seen as permanent.The requirements for maintaining these different types of collaborative relationships differ substantially in terms of planning, contract style, communications and operational controls. For example, it may not be possible to have a type three relationship with every partner, but selecting the appropriate type of collaborative relationship with a business partner is becoming a major source of competitive advantage.Collaboration can also take place between competitors, a form of alliance called “co-opetition”. This can occur when neither company is able to enter a market on its own. For example, beer makers Heineken and Guinness build breweries together in developing markets to produce both products. Carmakers Ford and Volkswagen co-developed and manufactured the original Ford Galaxy, Seat Alhambra and Volkswagen Sharan people carriers. The advantage to those involved in co-opetition is that a category or market can be developed at lower risk to each organisation.Maximising internal collaboration is also critically important. It is often thought that relationships within an organisation are stronger than the relationships with external actors. Conventional thinking says: “If we are all within the same company we should all collaborate together successfully.” But the reality is that internal relationships are often worse than external relationships. What is more, the internal relationships can be treated with contempt with functions trying to gain advantage over each other.In a survey of 500 organisations in the US, published in the International Journal of Logistics, interdepartmental relationships were shown to result in reduced cycle times, better in-stock performance, increased product availability, order-to-delivery time and customer improvements. Those organisations which collaborated well internally had performed better in terms of meeting customer needs, accommodating special customer requests and introducing new products. As a result, customers had a better perception of the organisations which, in turn, led to increased sales and margins.To create a win-win relationship there are two key dimensions that need to develop. The first is what I call “C3 behaviour’: a combination of co-operation, co-ordination and collaboration. C3 behaviour involves working together to achieve effective operations in harmony with the strategies and objectives of both parties.The second dimension is trust. Trust helps companies to integrate micro-level psychological processes and group dynamics with macro-level institutional arrangements. In other words, it entails dispositions, decisions, behaviours, social networks and institutions. Trust enables co-operative behaviour, promotes improved relationships, reduces harmful conflict and allows effective responses to crises.Managers need a new skill set to develop these ideas into collaborative relationships. In addition to technical ability and intelligence, organisations need to embrace the so-called “soft skills”. For example, when building a collaborative relationship, social skills, empathy and motivation are of high value.A survey by the Society of Human Resource Management illustrated the importance of emotional intelligence in achieving competitive advantage. The researchers analysed a series of top companies, selected for profitability, cycle times, volumes and other key performance measures. They found that the companies which had performed best had the following competences in managing their human assets: organisational belief and commitment to basic strategy; open communication and trust building with all internal and external stakeholders; an interest in building relationships inside and outside the organisation where they offered competitive advantage; collaboration, support and the sharing of resources; an environment where innovation, risk taking and learning were promoted; and a passion for competition and continual improvement.Foundations for success and failureI recently conducted a study of more than 60 collaborative relationships and identified a number of factors for success:• innovative commercial practices, tough but achievable incentives and meaningful gain share;• end-to-end, clearly visible performance objectives agreed by all supply chain players including the end-customers;• frequent, interactive, open communications across all levels of the customer/supplier interface especially on performance reviews and continuous improvement of products/services and business processes;• open, no blame culture aimed at customer and relationship satisfaction which depend on personal, trusting relationships;• joint planning and business systems supported by free-flow of information.In contrast, those relationships that were typified by failure exhibited the following types of behaviours and practices:• lack of stable customer funding arrangements, which prevented supplier investment planning;• insufficient investment, which generated long-term costs and prevented performance incentivisation;• lack of investment in good staff, which caused unnaturally high turnover and prevented personal relationship development and efficient business processes;• adversarial, bureaucratic commercial practices and attitudes, which increased costs, caused delays and reduced trust;• lack of culture-matching results in “us and them” attitudes, which resulted in a downward spiral of poor behaviour, reduced benefits and low performance.The key lessons of collaborationFor collaborative relationships to be successful, the following foundations need to be in place:• Both organisations need a common focus, that is a shared commitment to a basic strategy.• An agreed joint process is required. This is often a problem, because for organisations to can have little understanding of their own internal processes. So, agreeing on a joint one can be difficult.• Integration of internal applications is important to ensure good communication and data flow across the relationship.• Flexibility and responsiveness are critical for both organisations to create agility within the relationship.• Agreed joint performance measures. Both parties should be measuring the success of the relationship in a common way using the same metrics. Hard measures will need to be used but “soft” measures for gauging the success of the relationship in terms of levels of trust and personal relationships also need to be included. This point is important because surprisingly few organisations measure the soft relationship issues and continue to focus on hard performance measures which only reveal the symptoms of failure and not the causes. Instead, companies need to ask questions such as: how many business relationships do we have? Why are they important? Which ones are doing well and why? Which ones are not doing well and why? How do we identify hard targets for continuous relationship improvement?ConclusionWhen striving to create win-win relationships, it could be argued that the first question all organisations need to ask is: how will the company or internal function you want to collaborate with benefit from collaborating with you. Ultimately, if there is nothing in it for the other party there is no motivation for collaboration and, therefore, the “multiplication effect” will not occur.Richard Wilding is chair in supply chain risk management at the Cranfield School of Management and specialises in the creation of collaborative supply chain environments

199;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-10-19T16:16:49Z;Effective sourcing for transaction success;;"The growth in trade of global manufactured products is three to four times the overall rate of growth in the GDP of advanced economies, according to figures from the World Trade Organisation’s International Trade Statistics Report 2005. This explosion in long distance sourcing and supply is exposing the limitations of the transactional capabilities of many companies and their providers and, consequently, putting trading performance and shareholder value at risk.Procurement and sourcing is a core strategy for profitability. Our financial modelling shows that a gain of 2 per cent in gross profit through low-cost supply can increase profits by 25-35 per cent. However, the implementation of low-cost sourcing strategies is being used as more than just a profit driver. The well-documented growth of Anglo-French group Kingfisher through its DIY chains, Castorama and B&Q, demonstrates that demand can be stimulated by better consumer value. An analyst’s report posted on the group’s website illustrates the contrast: a B&Q knife was originally sourced for 88p and is now sourced for 40p, while a Castorama wrench was originally sourced for €8.50 and is now sourced for €2. The resulting growth in volume and profitability has been a key driver of shareholder value for many retailers and manufacturers. Few can afford to ignore this aspect of strategy and the need to develop excellence in it.Our work with companies through the Supply Chain Risk Forum at the Cranfield School of Management has identified considerable risks in global sourcing transactions. In a 2005 article published in Management Science, Kevin Hendricks, of the University of Western Ontario, and Vinod Singhal at the Georgia Tech College of Management, quantified the implications of these risks in the US. They studied the impact of companies issuing profits warnings from supply chain ”glitches” such as late delivery, trade restrictions, and quality issues. After analysing 1,000 such “glitches”, they calculated the effect on shareholder value as being an average reduction of nearly 20 per cent in the share prices of the affected companies. On average, for technology companies, the loss of shareholder value is $143m per glitch, $123m for automakers and $76m for consumer products companies. It is clear from this analysis, and case examples on this side of the Atlantic, that failure to master global sourcing transactions in terms of their set up (design), planning and execution can be damaging to business continuity.Best Practice ModelsOur research into formalised best practice models for managing sourcing and transactions has revealed that such practices are not widespread; rather, they are generally ad hoc and informal.The need for a more formal approach has led us to develop a three-stage model for transactional excellence in global sourcing and supply.Stage 1 - Mastering Transaction DesignA company should formally evaluate and resolve the validity of the sourcing decision. Is it right that the product is sourced globally? Does the price advantage cover its full cost of acquisition, all the way to the final customer, taking into account additional inventory and its storage and handling, the full costs of importation, the risk of obsolescence and the implications of responsiveness to market place uncertainty?We have seen companies implementing this by engaging multiple sources to achieve a blend of supply that enables low costs and market place responsiveness. This often involves some or all of: working with suppliers to book capacity without placing long-term firm orders; flying tooling and designs around the world rather than finished product; local assembly to order from globally sourced generic components; and material and specification management to maintain supply.One example is Xerox, which has a formal supply chain design process for the launch and ramp of new products, during which the sourcing location and suppliers change as volume builds and risk profiles change.Stage 2 - Mastering Transaction PlanningIn this stage, the company creates an increasingly integrated view of its entire supply chain from forecasts and actual customer demand to materials and components, and identifies the key decisions that it must take and when the need to be taken. If suppliers or origins are at risk or unreliable, the implications of such supply-side risks should be factored in to detailed planning. There needs to be clear guidelines based on sound analytics, as these will increase transactional excellence. Such processes are commonly grouped together under the term “sales and operations planning”, and they should set the supply chain heartbeat for the business.Excellence in sales and operations planning is seen in some of the major chemical companies, where it is driven by global supply to multiple regional markets and applications that must be reconciled in terms of supply and demand priorities. The retail and consumer sectors often use the term collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment, which is promoted through the Voluntary Inter-industry Commerce Standards group (www.vics.org) who’s mission is to promote the flow of products and information within the retail supply chain. In this area Procter & Gamble is referenced as moving to excellence.Stage 3 - Mastering Transaction ExecutionIn this stage, the company completes the transactions. While it is clearly important that a company uses the design and planning stages to set itself up to execute well, there is much that can go wrong.Internally, excellence in execution starts with data integrity by answering questions such as: are products and suppliers correctly set up on the system? Have realistic lead times been applied? Are products being ordered when required in line with the characteristics of the chain?The order is then passed to the hands of the suppliers and the logistics providers. Supplier compliance programmes are commonplace in motor manufacturing, electronics and the supermarket sector, but are only just becoming standard in other sectors. They are designed to manage the interface between the supplier and customer, and cover delivery scheduling, quality, labelling, advanced notices of changes, engineering and specification revisions, packaging and container loading specifications. The list is extended, and a failure in any one of these can impact on manufacturing lines, or goods on sale at retail. A change in personnel through which local knowledge can be lost is often enough to create a disruption. The opportunity “costs” of such failure measured in line stoppages or lack of availability are always far in excess of the cost of the material or the logistics. These opportunities are about wasting time; as Henry Ford observed, in 1926, “Time waste is more important than material waste in that there is no salvage.”To combat this, and in common with many large-scale manufacturers, Ford has established a giant supplier park next to its plant in Valencia, Spain that sequences materials to the lines with minute-by-minute precision. Supplier failure to maintain the schedule is heavily “fined”.This theme continues in the physical logistics of international trade. It is common for goods to be left behind because there was no room on the ship, they were lost in the corner of an airfreight hanger, or they were incorrectly documented and held by customs for days. On a more prosaic level, shipments can just take too long through clearance because the right procedure was not followed or a person was “away from their desk”.Lucent Technologies, now Agere Systems, was one of the first companies to establish a single global airfreight contract with DHL to provide a global 48-hour, origin-to-destination service. For them, the value in reliability and speed measured in millions of dollars.Finally, execution within the financial chain should not be ignored as a source of both risk and cost. The international terms of trade are the method of apportioning financial risk in the supply chain. However they set an agenda that is about passing the direct risk in the cargo up or down the chain, rather than proactively managing the process to minimise the total risk.In the high-speed world of global trading in products and commodities, our investigations have shown that financial supply chain practices are often arcane and self-serving. The costs of these practices can be as high as the entire cost of the logistics movement as every participant takes his cut and provides another potential fault line for the transaction.We predict the future of global sourcing transactions will be different. The sector will mature, reliability will increase and costs will fall yet further in terms of the end-to-end acquisition of the products. We are seeing financial supply chain services emerge from companies like HSBC, EZD Global and Standard Chartered to improve financial supply chains. Some analysis suggests that this can be worth up to 2 per cent of costs.Foundations of global sourcing and transactionsWe have identified six key features that will become commonplace in global sourcing to mitigate risk in transactions.■ Total Cost Management This is a design capability. Companies need a predictive approach to guide their sourcing decisions in terms of the likely total cost including the associated costs of risk, inventories and transaction management. Cranfield School of Management is currently working with the UK’s Department for Transport to develop a simple public domain model as a template for companies to adopt as a simple guide to good practice. It will also be used to inform public policy.■ One-touch information flow This is an execution capability that will connect the operational and financial supply chains into a single service based on a single data set for the transaction, and to avoid double entry, duplication, mistakes and inconsistency.Accuracy of information is a precondition of active management and the ability to exercise risk mitigation measures. It is critical to have the widest view of the total chain on one information platform with the ability to recognise inconsistencies.■ Total product identification and compliance This is important to ensure the fast, accurate product and handling unit identification that feeds the one touch information requirement without delay. The use of bar codes and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) to the correct standards is the enabling technology; this needs to be quality assured and enforced on the ground across many sites, with failures being fixed where they occur.■ Real-time routing through supply chain transparency The capability to see through the chain, know what is coming and test for events that have not happened as planned; to interpret the implications of failures in an active way and make decisions to minimise their impact. This is the “traffic control” of global supply chain execution; it must be managed transparently and with the co-operation of all the parties in the chain.■ Vendor development - cycle time compression linked to real demand The capability to understand and improve the long-term performance of vendors in terms of cycle times, timeliness, quality and accuracy is central to time compression and risk reduction. Based on historical performance of the end-to-end chain it is possible to identify improvement programmes to develop supplier reliability. The ultimate goal is to issue orders and schedules on shorter lead times, reflecting real demand or more accurate forecasts. Understanding the underlying performance of the vendor, and his category of products in the marketplace is the starting point for this, and it depends on analysing information from across the chain.■ Information platform to provide consistent and timely information The capability to put in place, operate and maintain a full supply chain visibility solution. All of the above capabilities are anchored by the operational skill to secure and maintain the information backbone with the diverse data structures that are needed by each supply chain function.ConclusionGlobal sourcing has been seen as a strategic “silver bullet” for many companies. In spite of the benefits that have been achieved, we estimate that the there is as much as 2 per cent of revenue being wasted in the direct cost of global sourcing transactions and our observations have convinced us that the opportunity costs of failure can be much higher.As the scale of global sourcing is set to grow, a level of corporate recognition is emerging that competition is no longer between individual companies but between the supply chains of which they are a part. Creating consistent transactional excellence along these lines will be the key to sustained competitive advantage and customer value.Richard Wilding is Chair in Supply Chain Risk Management at Cranfield School of Management and hosts the Cranfield Supply Chain Risk ForumAlan Braithwaite is visiting professor in supply chain management at Cranfield School of Management and chairman of LCP Consulting"
200;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-08-24T21:33:38Z;Floating-rate notes;;Floating, not fixed, Mr Bond. Sales of corporate bonds carrying a variable rate of interest are on track to set records in the US, eurozone and UK markets. Based on the year so far, more than half the $900bn of dollar-denominated investment grade corporate bonds projected to be sold in 2006 could be floating-rate notes (FRNs) – up from as little as 25 per cent in 2001. In the larger euro market, the proportion is heading towards 80 per cent, compared with less than 60 per cent five years ago.There is one obvious explanation. When interest rates rise, the value of fixed-rate bonds declines. FRNs are immune to this kind of investment loss, and their popularity accelerated well in advance of rate increases that began in the US in 2004 and in Europe last year. With US rates approaching a peak and strong institutional demand for long-dated fixed income assets – from pension funds, for example – a shift back towards fixed-rate bonds seems likely.But other factors could help keep FRN issuance going. In recent years, insurance companies and other new buyers have emerged and investors have become more international. That should bolster demand, especially for dollar-denominated paper in which European investors, who have greater appetite for floaters, are more and more active. In addition, although financial groups traditionally dominate floating issuance, non-financials are now including FRNs in financing packages to help attract the widest possible range of buyers. Xerox, for instance, this month added $150m in floating-rate paper to a fixed-rate bond sale. Issuers can easily and cheaply swap a floating-rate liability for a fixed one.Another twist comes courtesy of the increasingly influential credit derivatives market. To sniff out relative value between bonds and credit default swaps, sophisticated investors and traders have to find an apples-to-apples comparison. That means analysing bond returns against Libor, the floating-rate benchmark, rather than against government bond yields. Over time, this growing Libor-savviness could mean more floating-rate notes in the market mix.
201;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-08-18T18:25:45Z;Take it easy when your Pod is Googled;;"What’s in a name? Whatever it is, it had better not be “pod”. Apple Computer is getting tetchy about other companies using the word in their names. Profit Pod and the maker of TightPods have received stern “cease and desist” orders as the maker of the iPod music player seeks to assert its copyright.But leafing through a dictionary, I made a startling discovery. In fact, “pod” is not a derivation of iPod after all, but a 17th-century word in its own right, originally meaning a “seed vessel, especially a dry and dehiscent one”.Technological giants such as Apple really ought to bash smaller fry only when their brands are in real danger; not when other companies make use of a word that – despite the iPod’s ubiquity – predates it by quite some time.Google is a menace to the language in a slightly different way. What greater mark of respect can be given to a brand than a place in the dictionary? But far from expressing delight at this latest sign of recognition, the search engine company writes to those who use it as a verb and tells them to stop.Unsurprisingly, people then write things such as this on the internet: “Google’s just another big fat company with lawyers now. They’re losing touch.”Those lawyers are worried about “genericide” – brands being subsumed into the lexicon such as has happened to Jacuzzi, Hoover and Xerox. The Shepherd Group, a UK construction company, has had a protracted, public and unedifying fight with Private Eye magazine over the use of the word Portaloo, its portable lavatory. In this case, a company has become embroiled in a battle with a satirical magazine when a graceful silence would have served it better. If Google and Apple want to safeguard the goodwill that goes with their brand, they might be better off avoiding public attempts to protect them – unless it really threatens the bottom line.Some cases do seem to demand action. Goldman Sachs has taken on goldmansex.com to protect its brand. But protect it from what? How many business people think the site that provides (some of) them with sexual relief is run by the same outfit that provides them with investment banking?Others seem even more fatuous than Apple. Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, owner of easyGroup, the company that gave us easyJet, the no-frills airline, has assigned a legal team to take action against any company that uses the word “easy” without permission.“No use should be made of the name ‘easy’ (or anything similar to it) without our consent,” warns a footnote to all the company’s e-mails, making no concession to the word’s 700-year existence in the English language.But Easypizza, a pizza chain established in north London in 1997, way before easyGroup set up its easyPizza business in 2004, fought easyGroup’s edict and the giant backed down. It’s not easy to monopolise words and in most cases it’s not worth it either.The writer is an FT reporter"
202;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-08-08T17:26:20Z;Bland image of a latter-day business saint;;"Joe Wilson and the Creation of Xerox
By Charles D. Ellis
John Wiley and Sons Inc. $27.95Joe Wilson joined the family firm, a small photographic paper company based in Rochester, New York, during the early years of the Depression and oversaw its transformation into the mighty Xerox Corporation. It was one of the
most spectacular industrial ac­complishments of the twentieth century.One might therefore ex­pect to find him in the pantheon of US business greats. Today, though, he is all but forgotten.“By the end of the century, students at the University of Rochester’s business school would not, when asked, even recognise the name Joe Wilson,” Charles Ellis writes in this messy, lugubrious book.Even during Wilson’s tenure, the late Sol Linowitz, his “best friend”, Xerox chairman and general counsel, was able to use his communications skills to persuade The New York Times and Life magazine that he, Linowitz, actually ran the company and was rewarded with substantial personal coverage. The intensely ambitious Linowitz eventually left Xerox for Washington where he achieved distinction as a diplomat during the Carter presidency.The self-effacing Wilson, who died in 1971 of a heart attack, remains an enigma which Charles Ellis does little to unpick. The book is hagiography, pure and ­simple. For page after page ­Wilson is painted as a latter-day saint among ­businessmen.He is concerned for his workers’ welfare. He values his customers. He worries about the position of women and ethnic minorities in the workforce. He speed reads, holds the company’s financial records in his head and comes out top when the senior Xerox executives take personality and leadership tests. Unlike Linowitz, he also spreads the credit for Xerox’s success around.Now, there is nothing wrong with any of this: would we had more business leaders with these qualities.But this is a man who led by example, who listened to criticism and advice, who was cautious and logical in his business dealings, yet hand-picked a successor who seemingly had none of these attributes. Peter McColough, who took over from Wilson in 1968, plunged Xerox into a series of ill-judged acquisitions and other adventures which cost the company billions of dollars as well as its reputation for sound management. It has taken years to recover.The Xerox story is, nevertheless, a classic of business entrepreneurship and technology. Chester Carlson, a physicist and lawyer, be­came fascinated by the problem of creating copies of documents quickly and cleanly, in contrast to the time-consuming “wet” photographic methods of the time.He invented “electrophotography” – later to be known as “xerography” – in which the image of the material to be copied was traced out in an electrostatic pattern to which oppositely charged toner particles were attracted and fused by heat.It was an invention of such sheer originality that no large company could be persuaded to invest in the hugely expensive business of bringing xerography to market. At last, the Battelle Memorial Institute, a re­search organisation, agreed to invest in the technology.Ellis quotes Battelle’s Harold E. Clark: “I’m as amazed by his discovery now as when I first heard
of it. As an invention it
was magnificent. The only ­trouble was that as a ­product it wasn’t any good”.The chance paved the way for the entry of Wilson. By now head of Haloid, the family firm, he was looking for a new technology to save it from slow death as the photographic paper business crumbled away. Terms were agreed in 1947 and the two organisations began work on the machine that would 13 years later reach the market as the Xerox 914, one of the most successful products of all time and the springboard for Xerox’s rapid growth. In 1960, net income was $2.6m: by 1963, it was $22.6m.With hindsight, it is clear that had the participants understood the nature of the technological and financial challenges facing them as they tried to bring the 914 to market, they would have given up immediately. As it was, the conviction of ­Wilson and Carlson that they were nurturing a ­winner was enough to see the project through to ­completion.For all its excellent qualities, Wilson’s character does not seem strong or interesting enough to sustain a book of more than 350 pages. The challenges the Haloid team faced in creating the 914 would have made fascinating (and not too technical) reading, but Ellis sidesteps most of this.Ellis’s technique of dealing with discrete topics in separate chapters also destroys any sense of continuity as the nascent Xerox matures. Wilson and Xerox deserve a great biography. But this is not it."
203;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-06-04T21:04:47Z;US groups fail to understand customer needs;;"US companies are failing to respond to fast-changing markets because they are unable to understand and adjust to what their customers want, according to a study to be published today.The report, by the Business Performance Management Forum, an industry organisation, suggests US businesses were struggling to meet the demands of increasingly competitive international markets and sophisticated clients.“Looking at the business from a rear view mirror is still very much the vantage point of most companies,” the study, based on interviews with executives from more than 300 US-based companies, concludes.The findings of the report are a warning to US companies that their recent run of record profits could come under threat unless they become more nimble and more responsive to their customers’ needs.More than 60 per cent of the companies polled, which include Pfizer, a drug group; Xerox, a copier maker; and Deloitte, a professional services firm, said they were ill-equipped to respond to changes in the market.Among larger companies with yearly sales of more than $500m, only one in four executives said they were satisfied with their company’s ability to be ahead of markets and competitors.The majority of executives interviewed by the BPM Forum, whose members come from more than 1,000 companies, blamed the lack of good information technology systems for their failure to “read” their markets. Fewer than one in three executives said they were able to get real-time views of their businesses’ operations and customers’ expectations – a surprising result considering most companies’ stated focus on logistics, supply chain and customer service.Nearly half of all large companies polled, which made up one fourth of the total, admitted that their IT departments had “significant problems” or could “not keep up at all”.They named budget constraints and a lack of understanding of the business as the main reasons for the IT specialists’ failure to help the organisation.Companies said their top priorities were getting more accurate information about their customers’ needs and better intelligence on their competitors as well as developing more effective ways of measuring their own performance.The increasing internalisation of many sectors and the threats posed by low-cost rivals from developing countries only deepened companies’ desire to be more in tune with their markets, according to the report."
204;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
205;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-06-04T17:34:47Z;HP has high hopes for high-end moves;;Seated at a conference table in San Diego, California, Vyomesh “VJ” Joshi can barely conceal his excitement as he picks up a computer mouse to demonstrate Hewlett-Packard’s latest piece of high-tech gadgetry.“This is the first time we’ve done a live interview with this thing,” says Mr Joshi, head of HP’s imaging and printing group, the $80bn computer company’s most profitable business.Although he is sitting 500 miles away, the images and sounds projecting from the screens embedded in the wall of the “Halo” room in HP’s Silicon Valley headquarters are so sharp and lifelike that Mr Joshi might as well be sitting across the table.Halo, HP’s new high-end video conferencing system, is one of a series of innovations that Mr Joshi’s engineers have brought to market this year as part of an ongoing attempt to transform HP’s imaging and printing group. Companies such as General Electric, PepsiCo, and BHP Billiton pay HP a hefty one-time installation fee and service charges to run Halo over a custom-built internet backbone.Along with Halo, Mr Joshi this year introduced a line of in-store photo kiosks to boost the company’s photo printing offerings, which include at-home photo printers and Snapfish, an online photo storage and printing service HP bought last year.Last week, at a conference in San Francisco, Mr Joshi outlined plans for HP to begin offering printing services to cater for the huge increase in user-generated content online.The company is also launching a direct challenge to Xerox and other companies in the office copier market by marketing networked, multi-function laser printers that can also copy documents.All this is a long way from the inkjets and laser printers that make up the core of HP’s imaging and printing business, and that is how Mr Joshi likes it.“We want to take our technologies and go after completely new businesses,” he says.Two years ago Mr Joshi launched a restructuring of the company’s imaging and printing group, which last quarter accounted for almost 30 per cent of HP’s $22bn in total sales. In 2004, HP’s vaunted “razor and blades” printer strategy – in which the company sold printing hardware in order to profit from sales of high-margin ink – was beginning to come under pressure from rivals such as Dell, Lexmark and makers of generic printer ink.Now, says Mr Joshi, the imaging and printing group is well on its way towards its goal of 5 per cent revenue growth this year, with profit margins of 13-15 per cent.Peter Grant, an analyst at Gartner, says that combining HP’s traditional strength in hardware with innovative services such as in-store photo printing, networked multifunction printers, and Halo, should allow HP to find new growth by bringing more of its technologies to bear on solving customer problems.In the enterprise market, says Mr Grant, “more businesses are interested not so much in owning the equipment but linking up with a partner or having HP manage it directly”.HP is also pursuing a services-based approach in its push to offer printing services to amateur photographers and other creators of user-generated digital content.Mr Joshi last week outlined a broad vision of how HP plans to use the internet to connect people to different kinds of printing services.Snapfish, the company’s online photo site, already allows people to print photos at home or order prints online from a retailer.Soon, Mr Joshi says, a family back from holiday could be able to get directly in touch with a professional printer to turn hundreds of vacation photos into a hard-bound coffee table book, using the internet as a portal.HP has plans to offer small businesses a similar service. By using the internet as a portal, small companies could soon be able to connect with professional printing shops to place orders for homemade marketing materials, such as brochures and posters.For the time being, Mr Joshi is coy about what kind of online services portal he has in mind.“Stay tuned,” he says.
206;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-05-11T21:05:09Z;PwC reassures clients on Japan shock;;Samuel DiPiazza, global chief executive of PwC, has rushed to contain the shockwaves emerging from the firm’s Japan business by urging partners around the world to “reach out” to affected clients.In an e-mail sent hours after Chuo Aoyama PwC was hit with shock sanctions, Mr DiPiazza said partners should move quickly to tell international audit clients that the penalty in Japan would have a minimal impact outside the country.The two-month suspension of Chuo Aoyama PwC has presented PwC, the world’s largest accountancy firm, with significant reputational and logistical problems.The firm pledged to support Chuo Aoyoma PwC and added it would set up a new, independent audit firm under fresh management in Japan. So far it has released few details of its plans.“What it actually means and how it can possibly work in practice is very difficult to know,” said a finance executive at one UK PwC client with operations in Japan. “We are still feeling our way through this.”Mr DiPiazza’s e-mail emphasises that the prohibition on auditing does not apply to work done in Japan to meet the overseas reporting requirements of foreign clients. “Partners, it is crucial that we all reach out to clients with interests in Japan and to our own people who serve those clients to inform them of these developments,” it says.PwC global clients with operations in Japan include Ford and Xerox of the US, Reuters and Unilever from the UK, and Axa of France.Mr DiPiazza also encouraged partners to talk to regulators and government officials. They are likely to be monitoring the effect of the Chuo Aoyama PwC suspension on the publication of financial statements and market confidence.The conclusions of the Japanese regulator are likely to raise questions about PwC’s ability to deliver a consistent service globally. The Financial Services Agency blamed the firm’s failure to detect accounting fraud at Kanebo, a large client, on inadequate checks and controls.PwC and other large accountancy firms promise international audit clients a seamless service. But under their partnership structures national businesses exist as separate legal entities.The sanctions against Chuo Aoyama PwC have also highlighted the problem of concentration in the audit market, where most large companies rely heavily on just four firms.
207;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-05-11T17:57:06Z;Xerox takes sharper strategy on research;;Founded in 1970 before the dawn of personal computing, Palo Alto Research Center (Parc) has a venerable role in the annals of Silicon Valley. A research centre of US copier maker Xerox, Parc is credited with inventing the mouse, Ethernet, the laser printer and other landmark technology.Those milestones are proudly chronicled on a wall exhibit within Parc’s offices in Palo Alto in the hills near Stanford University.Yet the exhibit, complete with timeline and mounted gadgets, also reflects a track record of missed business opportunities.Parc has been criticised for failing to commercialise its innovations, letting them flounder or fizzle. Much to Parc’s chagrin, others have gone on to create wildly successful businesses based on similar technology a few years later.The now extinct “ParcTab” predated the Palm Pilot by eight years. Apple Macintosh’s graphical user interface, which marked a sea change for personal computers, was heavily inspired by Parc’s innovations.Now Parc is trying to prove it can launch technology that can thrive outside its walls and not just hang decoratively on them.“In the past, creating new knowledge was enough,” said Mark Bernstein, president and director of Parc. “Now, it’s ‘How can my work matter to the business?’”Parc began overlaying a sharper business strategy on to research when Xerox spun off the centre as a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2002.Now Parc is generating revenue by forming partnerships with corporate sponsors, government and research institutions, as well as incubating businesses and leveraging intellectual property.The move is part of Xerox’s larger push to expand beyond the boxes – printers and copiers – that its brand is synonymous with as it pushes into technology services.The corporate overhaul also applied to Parc, which has cast a wider net for innovative research. New partnerships includes a collaboration with biomedical centre Scripps Research Institute in San Diego to develop ways to identify cancer cells using laser scanning technology similar to that found in Xerox printers.This year Parc teamed up with with SolFocus, maker of low-cost solar energy systems. SolFocus is a start-up with just a handful of employees, but the alliance harnesses resources for research in the hot area of energy efficiency.Parc has cultivated government partnerships, such as a subcontract with US space agency NASA to develop robots for space exploration. It has also signed multi-year contracts with research sponsors such as Japanese IT company Fujitsu to develop “ubiquitous computing” sensors for use in retail, health care and transportation.Parc’s shift was spurred by Anne Mulcahy, who became chief executive of Xerox in 2001.Ms Mulcahy has pulled Xerox back from the brink of bankruptcy, slashed jobs and restructured operations to return Xerox to profitability. A revamp of Parc was part of the company’s turnround plan.Parc’s revenues from sponsor contracts were virtually non-existent a few years ago but now generate about $30m annually.Parc’s new partnerships offer a chance to innovate beyond Xerox’s traditional realm of office equipment, but ties to its parent remain firm.Although Xerox has aggressively cut costs as part of its turnaround, it spends about $940m annually on research, or about 6 per cent of total revenue, in several global development centres. More than $50m of Parc’s budget comes from Xerox.Parc contends that Xerox’s legacy of understanding how technology is used by customers differentiates it from academic research centres.Critics say that in the past, Parc spun off businesses prematurely without fully understanding the markets they entered.Now Parc is in discussions with venture capitalists about how to push projects forward. Sometimes “venturing is the most efficient way to get technology into the world”, says Mr Bernstein.
208;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-05-10T19:03:47Z;The malignant side of corporate voting culture;;"This is the season for corporate voting. Shareholders of major companies throughout the world, from Astrazeneca last month to Xerox this month, are attending annual meetings to cast ballots for and against mergers, election of directors and other initiatives. Some shareholders will skip the meetings but submit proxies that instruct a representative how to vote their shares. As shareholders perform this annual voting ritual, a dirty secret is spreading through the markets: corporate voting does not work.It will seem incredible to many investors but shareholder voting in developed countries is more tainted than political voting in undeveloped ones. Some shareholders’ votes are counted; others are not. Many investors are permitted to vote even though they have no such right. Sophisticated parties manipulate the voting system to their own advantage. And the total number of votes cast is often greater than the total number of shares.For example, in February, the New York Stock Exchange fined Deutsche Bank Securities $1m for submitting more proxy votes than it was entitled to cast in 23 of 27 cases. In one instance, the company submitted 8.5m proxies when it was eligible to vote only 4.2m shares. US and Hong Kong regulators are investigating hedge funds that allegedly have manipulated voting on corporate mergers. There undoubtedly will be more examples as shareholders cast their votes this season. The problem is serious. For democracy to function properly, voting must function properly. That is as true for companies as it is for countries.The trouble with corporate voting stems from the borrowing and lending of shares. When an investor buys a share from a broker, he or she does not receive an actual share. Instead, each share remains in a centralised depository, which keeps tabs on how many shares are allotted to each broker. The investor’s brokerage account includes an entry showing ownership of a share, but neither the investor nor the broker holds an actual share. Instead, both parties deal in a kind of virtual security, a share that is said to be held in “street name”.Even though brokers do not own actual shares, they are permitted to lend their clients’ virtual shares to short sellers, who then sell the virtual shares to other investors. The brokers for those other investors also are permitted to lend their clients’ virtual shares to yet more short sellers, who sell to yet more investors, and so on. This lending daisy chain can continue, in theory, forever. In the US alone, at any one point there are roughly 10bn shares on loan to short sellers.Each investor in this chain believes he or she has a claim to the share that is listed on his or her account. However, because there is only one actual share at the central depository, only the last purchaser in the chain actually has a right to that share. In other words, the earlier purchasers do not really own a share. Instead, they have a derivative claim against their broker for the economic rights of the share. For example, if the company pays a dividend, only the last purchaser receives any cash from the company. The earlier purchasers receive the value of the dividend, not from the company but from their brokers, who in turn receive the value of the dividend from the short sellers at each link in the chain.This Dickensian system generates serious problems for corporate voting. Because only the last shareholder in the chain has a legal claim on the share held at the central depository, only that last shareholder has a vote. Everyone else’s vote is extinguished when the broker lends the share. Moreover, because shareholders do not know whether a broker has lent out their shares, they also do not even know if they have the right to vote. Of course, shareholders would howl in protest if their proxies were not counted when they submitted votes. Brokers avoid this quandary by submitting the proxies anyway – hence, overvoting.Overvoting has become more prevalent for two reasons. First, more shareholders vote. It is easy to submit proxies electronically and institutions, which own roughly half all shares, are taking voting more seriously. Second, trading volume has skyrocketed and share lending has increased five times faster than volume. The results are dramatic: a 2005 study cited by Bloomberg Magazine found overvoting in 341 of 341 corporate elections.Defenders of the current system admit that corporate voting practices are not pretty but say they do not matter. Close votes are rare, they argue. And overvotes might be in the same proportion as other votes.But even if share lending does not change the results of every vote, it certainly affects close contests. Until the 2004 US presidential election, few people cared about the flaws in political voting procedures. Imagine how that election might have been resolved if officials had discovered millions of ballots submitted by people who were not legally entitled to vote.Until recently, few people cared, or even knew about, the flaws in corporate voting. Yet this year, with heated battles over director re-election, merger deals and corporate defensive tactics, there will be many more close corporate contests than usual. When those votes occur, the losing parties should know enough to examine details of the process. What they find might change the result. Loaned shares are more than merely the hanging chads of financial markets.The writer is an author and law professor at the University of San Diego; his research on corporate voting is available at http://papers.ssrn.com."
209;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-04-25T07:51:55Z;Tokyo shares rise on gains of domestic sectors;;Tokyo stocks on Tuesday managed to put a floor under the previous day’s sharp fall, edging up slightly as rises in domestic-oriented stocks offset falls in many exporters.Concerns about a rising yen continued to loom large after Monday’s rout, when a weakening dollar sent the Nikkei tumbling nearly 500 points, the largest daily point loss this year.Sadakazu Tanigaki, finance minister, acknowledged there had been some “rough movements” on the foreign exchange markets. The finance ministry has been nervous about the increasingly likely prospect of a central bank rate rise before autumn, which could trigger an appreciation of the yen.The Nikkei 225 stock average nevertheless closed up 55.89 points, or 0.33 per cent, to Y16,970.29. Trading was volatile with both the Nikkei and the broader Topix index veering in and out of positive territory before rising at the end of the trading day.The Topix index closed slightly more strongly, ending up 8.97 points, or 0.52 per cent, at Y1,719.73.Consumer finance companies rose as investors looked for bargains after sharp falls provoked by government talk of capping the interest rate lenders can charge. These are currently set at 29.2 per cent against 15-20 per cent for other lenders.Aiful, which has been sanctioned for overly zealous debt collection, rose 6.17 per cent to Y6,710, while Aicom and Promise, other prominent finance consumer groups, rose 5.7 and 3.2 per cent respectively. Promise said it expected to return to profit in the next financial year.Japan’s economy minister, Kaoru Yosano, told the FT this week that he supported capping interest rates. However, some market observers wonder whether the government is willing to take on powerful industry lobbyists and risk the possible negative impact of a squeeze on consumer borrowing.Banks also did well, as investors sought refuge in domestic-oriented stocks considered better placed to profit from Japan’s robust recovery and a steady rise in medium- and long-term interest rates.Mitsubishi UFJ, the largest bank in the world by assets, rose 1.7 per cent to Y1.83m, while Mizuho, Japan’s second-biggest bank, closed up 0.8 per cent, at Y984,000.Exporters fell as the yen rose to a fresh three-month high against the dollar of about Y114. Canon, which makes copiers and cameras, much for sale outside Japan, fell Y250, or 2.9 per cent, to Y8,400, partly because US rival Xerox missed consensus profit estimates.Advantest, which makes equipment to test memory chips, also fell nearly 2 per cent to Y13,240.Carmakers also came under pressure. Honda, Japan’s third largest, fell 1 per cent to Y7,740. Nissan fell 2.1 per cent to Y1,443.After the market closed, Nissan reported a 3.4 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profits and lower-than expected estimates of profits for the rest of the year.
210;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-04-24T18:51:36Z;US stocks fall despite strong earnings;;US stocks fell at the start of another heavy week of first-quarter earnings news as investors digested mixed results from companies including American Express, Xerox and Cendant while crude oil prices fell lower.By the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Index was 6 points, or 0.1 per cent, lower at 11,341.45, and the S&P 500 Index was down 3.5 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 1,307.80. The Nasdaq was also down 7.7 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 2,335.16.This week marks the peak of the earnings season, with 171 companies in the S&P 500 reporting results.“It has been a pretty strong season for earnings,” said John Butters from Thomson Financial. He said that about 69 per cent of companies that announced first quarter results had reported earnings above estimates. Nineteen per cent were in line with forecasts with 12 per cent below estimates.“Those numbers are better than the long term averages when 59 per cent of companies report above expectations, 21 per cent report in line with expectations and 20 per cent fall below analyst expectations,” he said.The S&P constituents are now forecast to deliver a better-than-expected 12.6 per cent earnings growth for the first quarter. That would mark the eleventh straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth.Consumer services company Cendant was an early gainer on Wall Street, rising 3.7 per cent to $17.47. The company said it was considering selling its two travel divisions, Orbitz and Cheaptickets.com, to pay down debt. Cendant is spinning off Realogy Corp, its real estate services division, and Wyndham Worldwide, its hotels unit.Deal news was also in focus after Washington Mutual said on Sunday that it had reached an agreement to buy Commercial Capital for $983m in a deal that aims to extend WaMu’s presence in California.Shares in Commercial Capital jumped 10.6 per cent to $15.65, while Washington Mutual traded slightly lower at $44.39, down 1.4 per cent.The fall in crude prices gave a lift to airline stocks on Monday. With Nymex crude for May delivery falling 1.7 per cent to $73.90 a barrel, Contintental Airlines, US Airways and Southwest were among the beneficiaries.Continental Airlines jumped 7.7 per cent to $25.76, whilst US Airways rose 8.8 per cent to $41.03. Dallas-based Southwest also rose, up 3 per cent to $16.48.Stocks that came under pressure included Xerox after it reported first quarter earnings short of analysts’ expectations. The maker of printers and photocopiers said first quarter profits fell 4.8 per cent due to sluggish sales. Its shares dropped 5.5 per cent to $13.99.American Express slipped 0.9 per cent to $51.77 in spite of reporting an 18 per cent rise in first quarter profits, and 1.5m new cardholders.
211;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-04-24T17:42:44Z;Lower margins hit Xerox data;;Lower margins due to higher labour costs dented Xerox’s first-quarter earnings, offsetting growth in sales from colour printers and copiers.Gross profit margins for the quarter fell to 40.2 per cent from 41.8 per cent last year as Xerox increased spending on contract workers and employee training.“I am disappointed in our gross profit decline,” said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive. “This was largely due to increased costs and had a direct impact on our first-quarter earnings.”The news sent shares in Xerox down more than 5 per cent to $13.97 in midday trade on Monday. But Xerox said that gross profit margins would rise next quarter as it scaled back on a “flexible workforce” of contract workers to control costs.Expectations for full-year earnings remain on track and the company estimates second-quarter earnings in the range of 22-24 cents per share. Ms Mulcahy has slashed jobs and restructured operations at the group since becoming chief executive and chairwoman five years ago, bringing Xerox back from the brink of bankruptcy.Xerox’s total revenues fell 2 per cent in the first quarter as it continued to be hit by unfavourable currency effects. In constant dollars, total revenue remained flat.While equipment sales declined 4 per cent, Xerox’s post-sale revenue – or revenue derived from ink and paper – edged up 1 per cent on a constant currency basis. Xerox has recently seen a slower-than-expected ramp-up of its lucrative post-sale business.First-quarter net income reached $200m, compared with $210m last year. Total revenue fell 2 per cent to $3.7bn, down from $3.78bn a year ago. Revenue from colour technology grew 11 per cent. Xerox has touted colour equipment as key to its growth strategy because it is more profitable than black-and-white equipment.It also announced a 25 per cent increase in consulting contracts or “document management services”.
212;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-04-24T17:08:33Z;US stocks fall despite strong earnings;;US stocks fell at the start of another heavy week of first-quarter earnings news as investors digested mixed results from companies including American Express, Xerox and Caterpillar.At midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Index was 15.93 points or 0.1 per cent lower at 11331.52, and the S&P 500 Index was down 0.4 per cent or 5.15 points to 1306.13. The Nasdaq was also down 0.5 per cent or 11.8 points to 2331.13.This week marks the peak of earnings season, with 171 companies in the S&P 500 reporting results.“It has been a pretty strong season for earnings,” said John Butters from Thomson Financial. He said that about 69 per cent of companies that announced first quarter results had reported earnings above estimates. Nineteen per cent were in line in forecasts with only 13 per cent were below estimates.“Those numbers are better than the long term averages when 59 per cent of companies report above expectations, 21 per cent report in line with expectations and 20 per cent fall below analyst expectations,” he said. Several companies have also offered positive guidance for the future.The S&P constituents are now forecast to deliver a better-than-expected 12.6 per cent earnings growth for the first quarter. That would mark the 11th straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth.Consumer services company Cendant was an early gainer on Wall Street, rising 4.1 per cent to $17.54. The company said it was considering selling its two travel divisions, Orbitz and Cheaptickets.com, to pay down debt. Cendant is spinning off Realogy Corp, its real estate services division, and Wyndham Worldwide, its hotels unit.Deal news was also in focus after Washington Mutual said on Sunday that it had reached an agreement to buy Commercial Capital for $983m in a deal that aims to extend WaMu’s presence in California.Shares in Commercial Capital jumped 10.7 per cent to $15.67, while Washington Mutual traded slightly lower at $44.31, down 1.6 per cent.Caterpillar gained on Monday after the company reported a 48 per cent increase in first quarter earnings, beating analysts’ expectations.The maker of diggers and construction equipment lifted net income to $840m, up from $581m the previous year. Its shares rose 1.6 per cent to $79.12 in early trading.Stocks that came under pressure included Xerox after it reported first quarter earnings short of analysts’ expectations. The maker of printers and photocopiers said first quarter profits fell 4.8 per cent due to sluggish sales. Its shares dropped 5.5 per cent to $13.99.American Express slipped 1.2 per cent to $51.60 in spite of reporting an 18 per cent rise in first quarter profits, and 1.5m new cardholders.
213;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-04-11T17:49:02Z;E-mail - is it out of control?;;"E-mail was never designed for most of today’s purposes, yet it is the internet’s most enduring “killer application”. We can’t live without it, but we can’t manage it either. What are the alternatives, and why aren’t we using them yet?In 2003 researchers at Xerox PARC observed staff in three organisations and noticed it had become the “habitat” of choice for most knowledge workers, who used it as their main tool for scheduling, collaborating, and transferring files. They concluded it was so overloaded and so widely co-opted for inappropriate uses that “serial-killer application” would be a better description.It is hard to believe, but it is almost 40 years old. Unsurprisingly it has shortcomings: spam, security, archiving and asynchronicity being just a few. Yet it is still the tool most people use to communicate and collaborate at work. For its billion or more users, part of its enduring attraction is its flexibility and informality, says Nikos Drakos, a research director at Gartner, the IT research group. “People can use e-mail to reach anyone. When they’re making it available, they have a degree of control that says ‘I will only make it available to you and you’ – it’s a kind of access control mechanism. And it’s semi-private.”But the advantages have also led to over-use. Most people use it for tasks for which it was never intended – filing, planning, collaborating and sharing knowledge. The prediliction for using e-mail in this way has led to concerns about knowledge being “trapped in e-mail”.Few would claim it is the perfect tool for communications. But although the over-use phenomenon was first noticed at least 10 years ago, attempts to improve it, or develop alternatives – and, importantly, to get people to use them – have proved difficult.Arduous legal and regulatory record-keeping requirements have made it inevitable that archiving has been one of the big growth areas in e-mail management. Spam and viruses have also been a significant distraction but the consensus is that filtering technologies are now effective enough for most organisations to protect their staff from excessive spam.And although its use is growing unabated (IDC estimated 22,000bn messages will be sent this year, compared with 19,000bn last year) growth in spam as a proportion of the total is slowing. Instead, it is “occupational spam” – legitimate messages that are unnecessary, unclear, or too widely circulated – that has become the scourge of knowledge workers.Individual habits can go some way towards reducing occupational spam. On the recipient’s side, filters can be used to direct certain types of messages automatically – such as those that are meant for someone else and only copied – into specific mailboxes. A popular list of tactics for both recipients and senders, written by Stever Robbins, a Harvard Business School graduate, makes suggestions such as writing detailed subject lines; judicious forwarding and limiting the checking of e-mail to several times a day.But people are slow to change their habits. Nicolas Ducheneaut and Victoria Bellotti, two Xerox PARC researchers, found that even filters and search functions – features that have long been included in widely-used programs such as Microsoft Outlook – were used by only a minority because many people simply did not understand how they worked.Similarly, the longer people used it, the more likely they were to organise e-mails into folders, despite this being a fairly inefficient measure.Mr Drakos recommends the use of filters and good etiquette, but says the scope for solving overload is limited. “The main thing is to stop using e-mail for things it’s not meant for,” he says.The recent history of collaboration software is littered with examples of large, sophisticated and often expensive tools that seek to sideline e-mail and address “knowledge management” or “content management”. Mr Drakos says some of these have been less useful than hoped because staff simply continue to use e-mail for its informality and relative privacy (although he adds that the alternative tools can still often prove useful for record management and legislative compliance).Michael Muller, a scientist with IBM’s Watson Research Center, has been involved in numerous projects to design and test ways of collaborating. Mr Muller, an expert in “participatory design” with a PhD in cognitive psychology, recalls an early attempt at a replacement called the Coordinator.“The idea was to allow people to negotiate commitments: who would do what, and when,” he says.But it didn’t work, partly because it only provided for the formalised: “will you do this?”; “yes I will”; etc. It did not allow people to say “how are your children?” or “it’s a nice day today”.More recently, he was also involved in testing ActivityExplorer, an IBM product that supports collaboration linked to different messages, files and other objects, and attempts to offer a user-friendly alternative.The programme was envisaged as supporting projects lasting a week, but a group of 33 interns who used it over 15 weeks surprised Mr Muller and his colleagues.“By usage, they showed us things we never imagined. In part, in addition to these week-long projects there were also lunch dates, but also huge long threads of complex things that lasted for months…some were social and some of them were very work-related.”One development in e-mail’s recent history has been the huge popularity of mobile “push” e-mail, to which hordes of BlackBerry-addicted executives can attest. The phenomenon is so great that Microsoft is looking at software to support similar devices.This mobile migration also puts e-mail on a platform where it is competing with two very well-known alternatives – voice and instant messaging, the latter of which has already become a popular alternative on the desktop in many organisations.In fact, as people become contacted more frequently wherever they are – via mobile phones, BlackBerries and instant messaging – some researchers have concluded that the accompanying disruptions are reducing efficiency and increasing stress.Other researchers believe, on the other hand, that younger people are less bothered by this. IDC found e-mail is still more widely used than instant messaging (IM), but teenagers and young people in fast-paced work environments use IM more than e-mail. This could point to a trend towards younger staff pushing the adoption of communication and collaboration technologies inside the enterprise.“You get the new generation coming in and saying ‘I can be so productive with this’,” says Jane Gately, chief information officer at Ernst & Young.Ms Gately says this began with the mobile phone, but lately the BlackBerry has been one of the biggest examples. “BlackBerry is so much more – a consumer product that has hit the heart of the organisation, that has made a difference. The BlackBerry showed us that this trend exists, and to get comfortable with it.”While email being squeezed by newer communications technologies such as IM, there is another more powerful shift taking place in collaboration technology that could be the turning point for e-mail use as we know it – and one that might, finally, address the gap between the informality of e-mail and the formality of high-end knowledge management and collaboration suites.For example, wikis (websites that anyone can edit) are becoming a popular tool for collaborating on documents, while more executives are blogging to improve relations with staff and customers. Social networking tools, similar to those used in MySpace and Friendster, are being used to map “communities of practice” and identify areas of expertise within organisations.Samuel Aparicio, director of product management at Angel.com, a call centre systems provider, says the switch to wikis helps managers and executives keep in touch with projects “without being CC-ed to death” on every minute detail or change. Instant messaging, he says, also takes the load off e-mail. “IM allows for the more ethereal conversations to happen, from the trivial “Are you free for lunch?” to the urgent “Is anybody experiencing difficulties accessing this system?”The two biggest workplace e-mail vendors, IBM/Lotus and Microsoft, are moving quickly to develop new collaborative tools or, where necessary, adopt approaches such as wikis.Microsoft in late 2003 hired Ward Cunningham, the inventor of wikis, for a two-year stint and is expecting to introduce some wiki functionality in Office 2007, due for release in this year. IBM is also researching technologies such as wikis and social bookmarking, alongside its own functions such as ActivityExplorer, the software tested by Mr Muller and his colleagues.But far from turning their back on e-mail, many are looking at ways of enhancing it and using it more intelligently. Microsoft is developing tools that can monitor usage to determine whether each message is important enough to interrupt the recipient with an alert, and some smaller vendors have developed software to extract information from observing patterns of use, such as Morphix in the UK, whose software maps areas of expertise and interest among staff.Socialtext, which sells the wiki software used by Angel.com and is one of the more successful companies developing social, web-based tools for enterprise use, consistently reduces e-mail volumes by about a third, says Ross Mayfield, chief executive. At the same time, one of the selling points of Socialtext’s wiki software is that it can capture content within messages and store them within a wiki.“Over time, it will probably reduce e-mail traffic because people will have discussion groups in different types of software, or they’ll use IM,” says Chris Harris, a principal analyst at Ovum. “But the amount of communication is going to carry on rising.”"
214;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-04-10T19:24:46Z;Lex: Corporate fines;;"Regulators hope that fines act as deterrents. Companies squeal politely when they are imposed, but usually view them as a cost of business. The squeals, however, are getting louder. On Monday Swisscom was fined $376m, or 2 per cent of its equity value, for an alleged pricing misdemeanour. It will appeal, but joins a select group of companies subjected to nine-figure penalties. The European Union’s record fine of $600m was levied on Microsoft in 2004. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s highest ever fine was $750m against WorldCom.Relative to the companies’ equity value the charges are not life threatening, but there is a clear upward trend. Total payments to the SEC last year of $3.1bn were just
1 per cent of aggregate S&P 500 profits, but were 10 times larger than two years earlier. In 2002, for example, the SEC acused Xerox of persistently inflating its earnings by about a quarter. The size of the then record payment? Just $10m. Three years later, Adelphia, accused of systematic fraud, got clobbered with a $715m payment.What explains this trend? It seems unlikely that company behaviour has suddenly become worse, although the millennium bubble did leave a hangover. In the EU, regulators may simply feel more confident. In the US, however, penalty inflation partly reflects the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which allows some proceeds to go to the victims of fraud, rather than the government.That sounds fair, but is complicated in practice: should current owners pay for misdemeanours committed before they owned any shares? It also intrudes on the turf of America’s ferocious legal compensation industry. The WorldCom class action settlement paid out $6.1bn to claimants, or eight times more than the SEC’s fine. America’s regulators may have become tougher, but they are pussycats compared with its lawyers.- Click here to add your comments

215;XRX;Xerox Corp;2006-01-25T13:59:45Z;Xerox in $500m share buyback as earnings rise;;Xerox, known best as a maker of copiers and printers, on Wednesday reported an 18 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings as it announced plans to extend its share buyback programme.The company launched its first share buy-back programme for eight years in October after unveiling a drop in third-quarter earnings as part of its ongoing restructuring.But on Wednesday the company said its strong financial position allowed to buy-back a further $500m of its own shares.Overall, fourth quarter net income rose from $240m, 27 cents a share, to $282m, 24 cents a share on revenues of $4.3bn, down 2 per cent - in the middle of the company’s own guidance.Adverse currency movements and demand for lower priced products were responsible for the fall in revenues, the company said.“Equipment sales were impacted by a more significant shift in product mix with stronger sales of lower-priced systems,” said Anne Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive.But she was more upbeat about the year ahead. She said the company would meet the higher end of its target range for 2006 earnings per share of $1 - $1.07. First-quarter earnings would be in the 20-23 cents range, she added.Ms Mulcahy has slashed jobs and restructured operations at the Stamford Connecticut-based company since taking up the office of chief executive and chairman 5 years ago and brought back from the brink of bankruptcy.She has led the transformation of the group into a digitally-led company. It has invested heavily in new technology such as colour equipment with the aim of yielding higher margins in “post-sale revenue”, or business from toner, paper and services.Xerox shares were indicated to open higher when trading opens in New York.
216;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-12-28T00:38:18Z;Computer visionary John Diebold dies;;John Diebold, one of the early advocates of using electronic computing to automate office and factory life, died on Monday at the age of 79.Diebold was still a student at Harvard Business School when he first proposed using the new technology to automate the operations of factories. According to the business school’s website, the wider potential of computing had first struck him when he encountered rudimentary anti-aircraft controls while serving as a midshipman in the merchant marine during the second world war.In 1952, a year after leaving Harvard, Diebold set out his ideas in a book that anticipated much of his life’s work. In Automation: the Advent of the Automatic Factory, he spelt out the types of functions in offices and factories that might be susceptible to being handled by machines. The book appeared two years before General Electric brought the corporate world into the information technology age with the first use of a computer in business.During the 1950s and 1960s, as electronic computing began to make its appearance in a wider area of human activity, Diebold’s was an influential voice in how the new technology was applied. Working as a management consultant, he advised companies like AT&T, IBM and Xerox. Through the Diebold Institute, set up in 1968, he also sought to stimulate wider discussion about the impact of computing on modern life.He was not related to the Charles Diebold, a 19th century entrepreneur whose company, named Diebold, has gone on to become a leading maker of automated teller machines and voting machines.
217;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-12-13T18:48:15Z;Simon London: Dust off those dancing shoes;;Market leaders should have all the advantages: resources, relationships, market power. So why do they rarely outperform for more than a few years? There is no more pressing strategic issue in the corridors of corporate America.Just ask senior executives at International Business Machines, Microsoft, Cisco, Dell, Wal-Mart, General Electric or General Motors – market leaders whose stock prices are lower today than they were at the start of the decade.To be sure, it is not a new question. Almost as soon as Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy hit the shelves in 1980, it became clear that the Harvard Business School Wunderkind did not have all the answers. Market-leading companies such as Xerox, Digital Equipment Corporation and Texas Instruments – which looked impregnable when judged against Prof Porter’s “five forces” framework – were already struggling. Often they were embarrassed by competitors with fewer resources, inferior technology and less market power.Attempts to explain what was going on spawned such excellent books as Richard Foster’s Innovation: The Attacker’s Advantage (1986), Richard Tanner Pascale’s Managing on the Edge (1989), Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad’s Competing for the Future (1994) and Clayton Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma (1997). From this decade or more of field work and theorising emerged two main themes.First, sustained corporate success is the exception. Very few companies return to growth once they have lost the momentum that propelled them to the top. Prof Christensen has since estimated that only about one in 10 large companies outperform the equity market over a decade or more, confirming that market leadership is less of a competitive advantage than you might think.Second, the few companies that defy the odds seem to do so by overcoming the laws of economics and human nature that drive managers to repeat whatever worked for them in the past. These organisations have a knack for developing new technologies, business models and organisational skills – even when such innovations undermine the business on which their success was built.Take Toyota: the Japanese car giant first gained an edge over its US and European rivals by institutionalising lean production and attention to quality. As GM, Ford, Volkswagen and others began to ape its manufacturing practices, Toyota worked to develop its vehicle design and marketing skills. The results can be seen in the success of the upmarket Lexus and youth-oriented Scion brands. With its competitors again making headway, Toyota is moving the goalposts once more: its hybrid power technology, used first in the Prius family car but now being rolled-out across the range, looks poised to become a source of significant competitive advantage.The language coined by Prof Hamel and Prof Prahalad in Competing for the Future remains apt. Toyota has used “stretch goals” (although its long-held ambition to become the world’s largest carmaker is no longer such a stretch: it is likely to overtake GM within two years) and has had the “foresight” to “develop competences far in advance of products”. Exhibit A: its long-term investment in hybrid technology when conventional automotive wisdom was that vehicles with both internal combustion and electric motors could never be sold at a profit.What prevents other big companies from acting with such vision? Every market-leading company is bursting with ideas about how customers can be better served, products improved and working practices made more efficient. Where managers seem to fall short is in their ability to select the right ideas and turn them into successful businesses.Prof Christensen sees microeconomics at work: market leaders are reluctant to invest in low-tech, low-margin products aimed at new customers when better returns are available from high-tech refinements of products aimed at existing customers. Thus big companies often retreat upmarket, leaving upstart competitors with seemingly inferior products to attack them from below. Such is the dynamic of “disruptive innovation”.Mr Pascale, in contrast, found fault in conceptions of what management entails. “The ultimate and largely ignored task of management is one of creating and breaking paradigms,” he wrote. “The problem is that we devote 99 per cent of energy to squeezing more out of existing paradigms.”Prof Hamel elaborated on this idea. His prescription for finding new paradigms involves implementing processes, metrics and reward systems to harness the untapped creative potential of organisations. His manifesto, fully articulated in Leading the Revolution (2000), is to take the mystery out of innovation.Management gurus continue to offer variations on these themes. In Making Innovation Work, Tony Davila, Marc Epstein and Rob Shelton offer their own step-by-step process for turning ideas into new businesses within large companies. Next month sees the publication of Dealing with Darwin, in which Geoff Moore, a Silicon Valley-based consultant, venture capitalist and confidant of John Chambers, Cisco CEO, offers a taxonomy of 14 different types of innovation and a guide to redirecting resources towards “core” activities.Will these frameworks and theories act like organisational Viagra, helping middle-aged market leaders (Cisco included) to recapture the vigour of their youth? Or will we be treated to the unsavoury spectacle of bloated bureaucracies trying and failing to act like virile start-ups? The next two to three years will be a fascinating test of how much we really know about innovation, scale and strategy.
218;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-10-21T12:41:03Z;Xerox profits slump on exceptional charges;;Xerox as expected on Friday revealed a slump in profits because of the costs associated with earlier legal settlements and Hurricane Katrina but launched its first share buyback in eight years.The company, best known as a maker of office photocopiers, has instigated a $500m share buy-back programme to improve its earnings per share, which fell to 5 cents in the third quarter from 18 cents a share the year before.After stripping out the exceptional costs, earnings per share were the same as last year and in line with analysts’ expectations.Overall, net income fell by $100m to $163m in the third quarter on revenues of $3.8bn, up just $100m from last year.Earlier this month, Xerox said accounting changes and an insurance charge related to Hurricane Katrina cut profit by $114m, or 12 cents a share, in the third quarter.The group said there would be additional restructuring charges in the fourth quarter equal to 5 cents a share. Earnings for the current quarter are expected to be between 25 and 29 cents, the company said.The group announced 2,600 job cuts in the last quarter as it grapples with new digital technologies and aims to generate more revenue from consultancy rather than its traditional photocopy machines.Anne Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive, suggested that this transition was progressing: ““Xerox’s third-quarter results reflect the strength of our digital portfolio, especially in colour where our industry-leading technology delivered 22 per cent revenue growth,”Gross margins improved from the second quarter but were down 1 percentage point at 41.3 per cent, compared to the same period last year.Group debt fell by $700m in the quarter and by $3.3bn in the year to the end of the third quarter.Xerox shares, which have fallen 15 per cent in the last year, were indicated to rise nearly 5 per cent when markets open in New York.
219;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-10-02T15:59:31Z;Ingrained success breeds failure;;"Management gurus exhort companies to go from good to great. Regrettably, most move in the opposite direction. Sainsbury’s, Parmalat and Lego are recent examples. Evento name just a few prominent examples. Microsoft, for years the gold standard of corporate excellence, stands accused of slipping into mediocrity. A few of these fallen stars – IBM or Ericsson – regain their stride, but most – such as Xerox, KMart or Laura Ashley – hobble on as pale shadows of their former glory, or like NatWest and Andersen – disappear altogether.Why do good companies go bad? Managers usually take the blame. Common explanations include executives who are too ignorant to notice big changes in their market, freeze like deer in the headlights of an oncoming car when the market shifts, or simply plunder the corporate coffers. All plausible explanations.Unfortunately, none of these explanations fits the facts. Over the past decade, I have studied dozens of successful companies that have gone bad (as well as comparable firms companies that responded effectively to the vicissitudes of the market). In the majority of failures, senior executives saw market changes coming and responded aggressively. They were capable managers – indeed many led the companies to the top – trying to do the right thing.If these familiar explanations do not account for corporate failure, what does? My research suggests that companies fall prey to “active inertia” – responding to even the most disruptive market shifts by accelerating activities that succeeded in the past.When the world changes, organisations trapped in active inertia do more of the same. A little faster perhaps or tweaked at the margin, but basically the same old same old. Managers often equate inertia with inaction, like the tendency of a billiard ball at rest to remain immobile. They unleash a flurry of initiatives – indeed they typically work more frenetically than their counterparts at competitors which adapt more effectively. They resemble a car with its back wheels stuck in a rut. Managers step on the gasaccelerator. But rather than escape the rut, they only dig themselves in deeper.Companies get in the rut in the first place because of What locks companies in a rut? The surprising answer is the very commitments that enabled a company’s initial success. Everyone knows that success often breeds complacency and arrogance. But there is a more fundamental link between early success and subsequent failure. Clear commitments are required for initial success, but these commitments harden with time and ultimately constrain a company’s ability to adapt when its competitive environment shifts. This dynamic can lead good firms companies to go bad, even when executives avoid arrogance and complacency.To win in the market, executives must make a set of commitments that together constitute the organisation’s success formula. A distinctive success formula focuses employees, confers efficiency, attracts resources and differentiates the company from rivals.Although commitments are essential for initial success, they tend to harden over time. Initial success reinforces management’s belief that they should fortify their success formula. With time and repetition, People stop considering alternatives to their commitments, and take them for granted. The individual components of the success formula grow less flexible: strategic frames become blinkers, resources harden into millstones hanging around a company’s neck, processes settle into routines, relationships become shackles and values ossify into become dogmas.An ossified ingrained success formula is just fine, as long as the context remains stable. When the environment shifts, however, a gap can grow between what the market demands and what the company does. Managers see the gap, often at an early stage, and respond aggressively to close it. But their hardened commitments channel their responses into well-worn ruts. The harder they work, the wider the gap becomes. The result is active inertia(see figure “active inertia”). Frames Become Blinders Five categories of commitments are particularly prone to this problem.comprise the success formula.First, strategic frames: what we see when we look at the world, including definition of industry, relevant competitors and how to create value.Strategic frames provide focus and fit new information into a broader pattern. By continually focusing on the same aspects, frames can constrict managers’ peripheral vision, blinding them to novel opportunities and threats. As their strategic frames grow more rigid, managers often shoe-horn surprising information into existing frames or ignore it altogether.Consider NatWest Bank.(National Westminster until 1995). At its foundation, executives at National Westminster Bank committed to a clear set of strategic frames – retail banking was stagnant and the UK was suffering irreversible de­cline. The bank diversified into the US, Europe, Asia and the Soviet Union and expanded into new financial services. When the Big Bang deregulation heightened competition, rivals such as Lloyds TSB refocused on their domestic retail business. NatWest, in contrast, responded by accelerating geographic and product diversification. Critics blasted the bank throughout the 1990s for waiting too long to divest money-losing distractions until RBSthe Royal Bank of Scotland acquired NatWest in 2000.Second, processes: what formal and informal routines are put in place to get things done. how we do things around here entailing both informal and formal routines.Established processes confer efficiency and facilitate co-ordination across functional and geographic units. Over time, these routines resist block change: With repetition, processes become second nature, people stop thinking of them as a means to an end, if they think of them at all. When the environment shifts, managers’ commitments to existing processes trigger active inertia.Consider Compaq, which grew to sales of $3.6bn in its first eight years based on processes that consistently produced high quality products. Manufacturing routines made quality the first priorityand cost a distant fifth)while the product development process , sacrificing speed and thrift to get the product specifications 100 per cent right. every time. Compaq’s quality-at-any-price processes served the company well in the early days of the PC industry when customers worried about the product’s usability and low-cost alternatives were rare. As PCs became commodities and nimble rivals like Dell rose to the fore, competition shifted to value for money. Compaq relied on its well-honed processes to churn out gold-plated products priced to gather dust on dealers’ shelves.Third, resources: tangible and intangible assets that we control which thatand which help us compete, such as brand, technology, property and expertise.Specialised resources build competitive advantage that rivals cannot easily replicate. Shifts in the competitive environment, however, can devalue established resources. MajorLarge airlines historically competed on the strength of their hub-and-spoke systems in which the carriers controlled valuable real estate at hub airports and a fleet optimised for this business model. The rise of low-cost upstarts such as Southwest and Ryanair depressed industry pricing and poached customers. Traditional carriers could not easily redeploy their hubs and planes to compete
cost-effectively against new entrants.Fourth, relationships: es­tablished links with external stakeholders, including investors, technology partners or distributors.Managers commit to external relationships by investing in specialised facilities to serve a key customer, for example, or writing long-term service contracts. These relationships can make or break a company – think of Microsoft and Intel or Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble. Over time, however, established relationships can turn into shackles that limit flexibility.Recall At its peak, the Daewoo Group which at its peak approached made almost $20bn in revenues, employed two hundred thousand 200,000 people worldwide and was active in 110 countries, ranging from construction operations in Libya and Iran to car factories in Uzbekistan and Ukraine.before falling into bankruptcy.. Daewoo owed much of its growth to cosy relationships with South Korea’s General Park, who ruled the country with an iron fist for nearly two decades. Gen Park supported Daewoo and other favoured conglomerates through financing and tariffs.In exchange, Daewoo invested in industries targeted for expansion. When subsequent governments ended such policies, that favoured the conglomerates, Kim Woo-choong, Daewoo’s chairman, tightened links with remaining friendly Korean politicians and forged bonds with politicians in emerging markets such as Vietnam, the Sudan and Uzbekistanto replicate cosy relationships at home. But Daewoo’s reckless expansion that precipitated one of the world’s biggest bankruptcies could not be smoothed by schmoozing a political old guard. Daewoo became one of the world’s biggest bankruptcies.Finally, values: beliefs that inspire, unify and­ identify us.rocesses Lapse into RoutineResources Harden into Millstones Relationships Become Shackles Values Ossify into DogmasStrong values can elicit fierce loyalty from employees, strengthen the bonds between a company and its customers, attract like-minded partners, and hold together a company’s far-flung operations. As companies mature, however, their values often harden into outdated dogmas, that oppress rather than inspire.Consider Laura Ashley, who founded her eponymous company to defend traditional values under siege from miniskirts. Frilly frocks embodying Laura Ashley’sher commitment to traditional values of modesty initially appealed to many womencustomers but lost their attraction as more women entered the workforce. Sales plummeted and the brand was significantly weakened. The company, however, continued to pursue the outdated designs that embodied an ossified inflexible view of its core values.Managers can avoid active inertia by regularly reviewing their company’s strategic frames, processes, relationships, routines and values to identify hardened commitments and help them adapt to market changes. Success need not breed failure if executives actively manage the organisation’s various commitments.THE RISK OF ACTIVE INERTIA: HOW COMPANIES CAN SPOT THE DANGER SIGNS■ Your chief executive appears on the cover of a leading business magazine. Praise from the business press reinforces attachment to the success formula. By the time a company has attracted acclaim, managers should be rethinking their success formula.■ Management gurus praise your company. Few companies survive guru praise for long. Consider the fall of most companies praised in In Search of Excellence. The problem is not sloppy research. Rather, guru praise reinforces confidence in the success formula.■ Your CEO writes a book on the secret of your company’s success. A book publicly links a CEO to a success formula, making it harder for him to later change those commitments.■ You build a grand new headquarters. Managers often build grand monuments to commemorate their triumph. They are rarely in the state of mind to question the commitments that led to victory. (It gets worse if there are indoor waterfalls, heliports or architectural awards).■ Your top executives are clones. Homogenous top executives generally rose through the ranks by reinforcing a success formula and know little else.■ You name a stadium. CEOs sometimes name rather than build monuments, as did Enron, CMGI, American Airlines, PSINet, Compaq and Conseco. Not every company falls prey – take Pepsi or Staples – but it is another red flag.■ Your competitors share your postal code. Detroit’s carmakers, Sheffield’s steelmakers and Route 128 microcomputer companies all went bad. Clustered competitors often make similar commitments and reinforce each others’ success formula.Donald N. Sull, associate professor of management practice at London Business School, is author ofHe recently published “Why good companies go bad and how great managers remake them” (Harvard Business School Press, 2005)"
220;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-09-22T18:18:42Z;Xerox runs off a new blueprint;;"In the four years since she was appointed chief executive of Xerox, Anne Mulcahy has cut costs, closed business units, repaired the balance sheet, settled an accounting investigation, outsourced operations, refreshed product lines and rethought strategy, writes Simon London. Now comes the hard part.“They can’t ease up on the cost cutting, but what they have really got to do now is grow the top line,” says Jack Kelly, analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York.It is a measure of Ms Mulcahy’s achievement so far that growth is even on the agenda. In 2001 and 2002, against a background of mounting debt, falling sales and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the question was whether Xerox would survive.It is a measurealso a measure of her down-to-earth directness that the growth question is tackled head-on: “We’ve got to show that we can get deliver on the top line as well as the bottom line,” she says. “This is a defining moment for the company.”The consensus among Wall Street analysts is that strategy mapped out by Ms Mulcahy and her team could, in principle, deliver all the growth required. This three-pronged approach involves hasteningspeeding up the shift from black and white to colour copying; pushing hard into the graphics and printing industries with a new breed of high-end
digital presses; and persuading big corporate customers to buy not only copiers and printers but also software and services.The unanswered question is whether Xerox can pull it off. The crisis of 2001 and 2002 was in many ways the culmination of a comedy of errors. Investors still wince at the memory of the botched sales force reorganisation that hastened the exit of then-CEO Rick Thoman. Don’t even mention the dysfunctional billing and debt collection system that, in late 2001, exacerbated an already precarious financial position.The good news is that Ms Mulcahy knows the troubled history as well as anyone. She joined Xerox in 1975 as a sales rep and worked her way up through the managerial ranks. Her husband is a retired Xerox employee. Her; her older brother is part of the senior executive team.She also knows – and has set out to change – the bureaucratic corporate culture that allowed problems to fester until it was too late for anything but drastic action.Ms Mulcahy’s direct personal style is itself a force for change. Her elevation to the top job was a signal that Xerox would have to shed its lingering stuffiness if it was to survive. The new CEO soon found a weapon that would ram the point home: Six Sigma, the process improvement technique pioneered by Motorola and popularised by General Electric (see below).She explains: “I went after Six Sigma because I wanted to embed productivity improvement in the company in a way that would prevent problems building up over time. If you really get it going in your company it massively reduces the chance that you will discover problems that require dramatic restructuring.”So far, it appears to be working. Thanks in part to productivity improvements yielded by Six Sigma, Xerox has been able to regain market share while also maintaining its investment in research and keeping earnings on a rising trend. Neither has the company slipped on any serious operational banana skins.But Ms Mulcahy and her team know they are entering a crucial – and potentially dangerous – phase. The growth strategy demands organisational changes of the type that Xerox has stumbled upon in the past. Importantly, the services strategy will make new demands on a sales force that, until now, has focused on selling mostly hardware.Xerox is hardly the first big company to make the transition from products to “solutions”. General Electric and International Business Machines, its near neighbours north of New York City, in the 1990s made similar journeys in the 1990s. More than half of IBM’s revenue comes from IT-related services.But the fact that it has been done before does not make it any easier. The immediate task of making it happen at Xerox falls to Jim Firestone, former strategy chief and now head of the North American business.“We need to integrate services into the discussion from day one with our biggest clients,” he says.At first glance, the management issue seems trivial. Xerox’s small services sales team, numbering 200-300, must be integrated into the larger 2,500-strong army of account managers and product specialists. Crucial to this process are the “major account managers” who look after relationships with Xerox’s 300 largest corporate customers. They must be educated in the art and science of selling services: everything from analysis of document flow through organisations to outsourcing of document imaging, archiving and retrieval. This is a very different proposition to selling copiers and printers.But while the number of people is tiny as a proportion of the total workforce (Xerox employs 58,000 worldwide), on their shoulders rests many of the company’s most important client relationships. Ineffective – or disaffected – account managers could cause more than a blip in quarterly revenues and earnings.“When we did this in the past we did this in a way that caused a lot of disruption for the customer. This time we don’t anticipate that many account managers will change roles. The emphasis is on stable account relationships,” says Mr Firestone, whose style is as measured as Ms Mulcahy’s is direct.Yet Judging the pace of change correctly is crucial. Move too quickly and relationships are jeopardized. Proceed too slowly and competitors move in. Hewlett-Packard is counting on its printing and imaging division to drive growth and already boasts a large services division. Ikon Office Systems, which distributes Canon, Ricoh and HP equipment, is another formidable competitor – and, incidentally, another proponent of Six Sigma.“The services-solutions arena is getting more crowded,” observes Mr Kelly at Goldman Sachs.Against this background, Xerox has reached the
point where it must press ahead with organisational changes and trust to careful planning. Even the cautious Mr Firestone concedes:
“This set of changes is in many ways the most fundamental we have made in changing the nature of Xerox.”ADVENTURES IN SIX SIGMA: HOW THE TECHNIQUE HELPED XEROXLike many other US companies, Xerox was introduced to Six Sigma through its interactions with General Electric. The financial services to biotechnology conglomerate adopted the metrics-mad process improvement technique in the mid-1990s. Thanks to its size and influence, it has served as an effective missionary.Anne Mulcahy’s conversion came as she was negotiating the outsourcing of Xerox’s troubled billing and collections operation to GE Capital. She recalls: “I remember sitting there and watching the discipline with which [the GE team] defined the problem, scoped the problem and attacked it from a Six Sigma perspective. I remember feeling for the first time that the problem would be fixed.”The precise definition of Six Sigma quality is an error rate of 3.4 per million. More important than the exact number, however, is an approach to problem solving that emphasizes small teams, measurement and economic return.Quality improvement techniques were by no means new to Xerox. In the 1980s, it was one of the first US companies to adopt Total Quality Management (TQM) as it fought to turn back the tide of Japanese competition.As an up-and-coming manager, Ms Mulcahy experienced TQM first hand. “The financial metrics were not as precise with TQM,” she recalls. “Six Sigma is very rigid and very disciplined by comparison. Every project is managed with economic profit metrics. There is none of the squishy stuff.”The “squishy stuff” is the emphasis in TQM on consensus building that, while part of an earnest desire to replicate the best of Japanese management, did not always play well at US companies.Ms Mulcahy is also at pains to point out that Xerox practises Lean Six Sigma, a variation that asks managers to think not only how processes can be improved but also how waste can be reduced: “Lean is an important nuance. The leaning process begins with taking out waste, working out where value gets added and where it does not. For big companies, this is very important.”While companies generally adopt Six Sigma to improve efficiency, converts insist that there are other benefits. The introduction of a company-wide approach to project management is reckoned to break down barriers between departments, and make it easier to work with suppliers and customers. Ms Mulcahy says: “The reality of our business is that in order to compete you have to find ways to deliver 8, 9, 10 per cent productivity improvements every single year. You only get there if you have a systemic approach.”"
221;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-09-16T20:01:03Z;Canon to expand into medical technology;;Canon of Japan has laid ambitious plans to extend its reach beyond cameras and office equipment by investing heavily in new applications for its core digital technology in areas such as medical technology, commercial printing and high-grade TV screens.The global leader in digital cameras and copiers is poised to make acquisitions next year to bring it head to head in the US with GE Healthcare, Xerox and Sony and Samsung.Fierce competition has put prices under pressure and hurt margins for Canon’s key consumer products, spurring it to invest in high-growth areas.Canon is betting that the shift to broadband networking will drive demand in all aspects of digital imaging, from digital TV, photography and printing to instant transmission of X-rays.At its big trade show in New York, Canon previewed new products including high-volume commercial printers, colour printing technology and software partnerships with Microsoft and Adobe, as well as a $20m advertising campaign that kicks off on Monday.Last month Canon agreed to buy subsidiaries of NEC of Japan for an undisclosed sum. It plans to make more acquisitions to bolster research and production of new surface-emitting display (SED) screens that would compete with plasma and liquid crystal display (LCD) screens.In collaboration with Toshiba, Canon plans to produce 3m SED panels annually by 2010. SED screens offer better picture quality and consume less power than plasma and LCD screens, but they are manufacturing-intensive and costly.Canon already makes sensors for digital radiography, but it intends to acquire medical companies that make devices such as X-ray generators in order to offer a “total solution” to hospitals.Medical technology currently generates about $100m in sales for Canon, but it hopes to boost revenue to $500m in the next five years.Canon has earmarked medical technology as a high-growth area because 70 per cent of hospitals in the US still rely on film for X-rays.It estimates at least another 15 years until the market for digital radiography becomes saturated, unlike digital consumer products that quickly flood the market in just a few years.The company has focused mainly on consumer printers and copiers but now plans to launch high-volume digital production printers next year. The devices make invoices, brochures and posters, as well as mass mailings. and posters.The company It has devoted a large part of its R&D budget to commercial printing to rival Xerox and Eastman Kodak, which has recently spent more than $2bn to buy commercial print companies as part of its radical digital makeover.Canon also plans to ramp up its R&D budget from $2.5bn last year to $4.5bn annually as it sets the stage for exploring biotechnology, nanotechnology and the life sciences between 2010 and 2020, said Fujio Mitarai, chief executive, in a keynote address this week.The company aims to generate $50bn in revenues by 2010. Canon last year generated $33bn in revenue, with US sales totalling about $10bn.
222;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-08-23T17:54:31Z;Anthropologists get to the bottom of customer needs;;"“There is a notion in the US that parents should buy a computer for their children in the early stages of development, according to anthropologist Genevieve Bell. “The earlier you expose the child to computing, the better that would be for said child,” she says.But, she adds, this is a culturally-specific approach. ideaIn China, parents believe the opposite. They want their children to learn Mandarin, and a PC is regarded as a big distraction, because it provides uncontrollable access to the internet.This is one of the manyinsights Ms Bell has gained in a recent two-and-a-half-year study of Asian families. Accompanied by local anthropologists, she visited the homes of 100 families in seven Asian countries, and asked them questions about their lives and values.Yet when Ms Bell presented her findings, her audience was not an academic conference ofit was not to fellow anthropologists but to colleagues at the chip-making giant Intel, where she heads a small team of social scientists who look at the different ways technology is used around the world.The idea of using social scientists to find out more about potential customers is not new – in 1979, for example, Xerox hired anthropologist Lucy Suchman at its Palo Alto Research Center, for instance. But the idea has resurfaced undergone a resurgence in recent years as big technology companies have come to believe anthropologists can deliver insights that simply remain undiscovered by traditional quantitative research methods. These days, Xerox researchers
today use a sociological technique known as ethnomethodology, which involves going intovisiting workplaces to observeand observing working practices without preconceptions.Peter Tolmie, the area manager of Xerox’s work practice technology group in France, says: “Standard marketing research and statistical data is often frustratingly shallow when you want to move towards designing technology.”The advantage of using anthropologists is that they can bring a fresh perspective to a subject, says Ms Bell: “I’m always looking for the ethnographic story that totally turns your world on its ear, the thing that challenges some really basic core assumption you have made.” One such moment for her came when she interviewed a Malaysian man about his mobile phone, and discovered he was using its GPS functionality every day to find Mecca. – a use unanticipated by the phone’s designers: “Here’s a piece of technology that is being held up as the quintessential symbol of modernity being used to support a set of cultural practices that have 1,700 years of time depth,” says Ms Bell.Such use of qualitative research marks a change in approach to xxxxx: Instead of creating a clever new product before trying to sell it to customers, the anthropological approach requires companies to look at the customer perspective first and feed that information back to developers and designers. “We are in a service society where it is not enough for companies to look at their own belly button – they have to look outwards to the customer,” says Carsten Sorensen, senior lecturer in information systems at the London School of Economics.Microsoft is one of the companiesanother company trying hard to understand the customer perspective. Shannon Banks, a UK-based product planner who heads a global team looking at the needs of information workers, describes the initial part of the process assays that initial “really “broad exploratory research” to understand customer requirements, includingmay uncover “pain points and unarticulated customer needs that they do not even recognise”.As part of a project to understand the needs ofon the needs of remote workers, a Microsoft team member spent a day travelling in a police car, observing how thepolice officer worked – noting, for example, that a scene-of-crime report that took 30 minutes to write by hand had later to be typed into a computer at the police station. This kind of detailedobservational material is fed back to developers, and is scheduled to be reflected in a forthcoming version of MS Office.Ms Bell’s findings about the Chinese parents’ attitude to computers enabledled the Intel designers to launch this year a PC aimed at the Chinese home educational market. The PCIt has a touch-sensitive screen that allows users to write in Mandarin, tracing the order in which the character is being written (correct stroke order is an important part of the learning process).writing Mandarin). When it came to finding a way of blocking internet access, Ms Bell pointed out to designers the significance prevalence of cultural metaphors in China aboutof locks and keys as manifestations of authority. As a result, Instead of installing a software-based key on the PC, Intel included a physical locking mechanism, visible from elsewhere in the room,that can be seen from elsewhere in the roomthat was and popular with parents.Technological development and anthropology don’t seem like natural allies. bedfellows. One is about fast-paced innovation while and the need to make a profit; the other is people-centric and requires reserves of time and patience. But it seems anthropology can help if it means technology companies are forced to think carefully about the real needs of their customers. , then surely it is a relationship that will bear fruit."
223;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-07-27T07:28:26Z;Results mixed for Japan’s printer makers;;Canon Inc. said on Wednesday its quarterly net profit rose 7.5 percent on strong sales of digital cameras and office equipment, while rival Seiko Epson Corp. posted a quarterly loss on sliding prices of small displays.Canon, the world’s largest maker of copiers and digital cameras, stuck to its full-year outlook for group net profit to rise 7 percent to a record 367 billion yen.Canon’s net profit was 82.21 billion yen in the second quarter ended June compared with 76.5 billion yen in the same period last year.The result fell slightly short of the market consensus for a profit of 83.3 billion yen, according to five forecasts compiled by Reuters Estimates. But it beat than Canon’s own profit forecast of 81.9 billion yen.It also compared favourably with earnings earlier this week from Xerox Corp., which disappointed investors with surprisingly weak profit as a shift in sales to lower-priced printers squeezed its margins.Seiko Epson Corp., whose business year begins on April 1, also reported sluggish earnings. Canon’s archrival in the ink jet printer market posted an operating loss of 5.04 billion yen in the latest quarter due to sharp price falls on LCD panels for mobile phones.Seiko Epson has been dogged by sliding prices of small LCD panels used in mobile phones amid intense price competition with rivals Sharp Corp., Toshiba Matsushita Display and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. The company’s LCD business, which primarily supplies panels to Nokia and other cellphone makers, is handled by Sanyo Epson Imaging Devices, a joint venture owned 55 percent by Seiko Epson and 45 percent by Sanyo Electric Co.Prior to the announcement, shares of Canon closed down 0.67 percent at 5,940 yen, underperforming Tokyo’s electric machinery index IELEC, which rose 0.68 percent.Shares of Canon rose 1.6 percent in April-June, slightly outperforming the sub-index, which was flat.
224;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-07-25T17:06:09Z;Xerox details job cuts as margins stay slim;;"Xerox yesterday joined a number of US companies that are cutting jobs when it gave details of about 2,600 lay-offs as it moves aggressively to counter weaker margins in sales of office equipment.The company best-known for making copiers and printers said second quarter net income more than doubled to $423m compared with $208m last year after a gain from a tax settlement.But second quarter gross margins of 39 per cent were in the low end of expectations because of weaker sales of high-margin large office equipment compared with lower-margin desktop devices.Shares in Xerox fell more than 6 per cent to $13.20 at the close of trade on Monday.Most of Xerox’s lay-offs will be in technical support services and manufacturing supply chains in Europe and North America. The restructuring will result in total charges this year of $200m after tax, as announced in an SEC filing last month.About 1,800 jobs were cut in the second quarter and another 800 will be shed this year.IT hardware maker Hewlett-Packard; photography group Kodak; and Kimberly-Clark, maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, last week announced job cuts totalling more than 30,000.Weaker margins have plagued Xerox in the last several quarters as the company shifts its mix of products and rolls out new digital technology.Larry Zimmerman, chief financial officer, said there was a slower than expected start to some key products such as the Nuvera, a black-and-white digital photocopier.“But it’s a long-term product. It shouldn’t be judged by three months, but over a long time. We want to get it right as we install this,” he said.Anne Mulcahy, chief executive, said: “These equipment sales will drive future post-sale gains, and, at the same time, we’re adjusting our business model to respond to the resulting pressure on margins.”Xerox said total revenue increased 2 per cent to $3.9bn, but would have remained flat if not for a boost from favourable exchange rates. Colour was one of its bright spots, with revenue from those products 17 per cent higher in the second quarter.The company launched 24 new office products last month as it competes fiercely with rivals such as Canon, HP and Ricoh.Xerox said total revenue increased 2 per cent to $3.9bn, but would have remained flat if not for a boost from favourable exchange rates. Revenue from colour products grew 17 per cent in the second quarter.Xerox warned of potentially weaker results in third quarter, but said it expected improvement in fourth quarter as new products take off and it begins to see the benefits of restructuring.”This performance will keep us within the range of our full-year guidance, most likely in the low end of the range,” said Ms Mulcahy.The latest news is a stumbling block in Xerox’s recovery since it pulled back from the brink of bankruptcy in 2000. From 2001, Ms Mulcahy oversaw a sweeping two-year restructuring that called for nearly 30,000 lay-offs, an aggressive transition to digital while phasing out old analogue technology, and focus on high-growth areas such as colour technology."
225;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-07-25T13:52:56Z;Xerox earnings rise on tax benefit;;Xerox, the US photocopier maker, said on Monday that earnings per share doubled thanks in part to a one-off tax benefit and turnover was up 2 per cent in the second quarter.Earnings rose from $187m, or 21 cents a share, in the same period last year to $408m, or 40 cents. However, the figures were distorted by a revaluation of a tax bill in the late 1990s on one hand and a 13 cent-a-share restructuring charge on the other.Underlying earlings were broadly flat at 20 cents a share but missed the analyst consensus figure of 23 cents causing shares to fall 6.3 per cent to $13.25 in early trading.Equipment sales rose 4 per cent compared to last year and the company said that revenues from new digital systems were offsetting the decline in older light-lens technology.“These equipment sales will drive future post-sale gains, and, at the same time, we’re adjusting our business model to respond to the resulting pressure on margins,” said Anne Mulcahy, chief executive.“We remain confident that these actions and increased sales of new technology - 25 new products launched in the second quarter - coupled with growth from Xerox global services provide the marketplace momentum for strong second-half performance.”The gross margin of 39 per cent was lower than expected and a slight decline on the 41.3 per cent gross margin in the equivalent period last year.Ms Mulcahy cut expectations for the current quarter saying she expected earnings of between 16-18 cents a share, including expected restructuring charges of 1 cent a share. Analysts were expecting earnings closer to 23 cents.
226;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-07-25T13:44:22Z;Dow unable to make headway;;Investors on Wall Street on Monday struggled to find upward momentum amid a raft of mixed earnings reports and mergers and acquisitions news.With little on the economic calendar until later in the week, earnings provided the focus for investors in trading Monday.But mixed second quarter reports from some US blue-chips left some investors concerned, with earnings reports thus far showing slower earnings growth compared with last quarter.By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent at 10,596.48. The S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent at 1,229.03, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.6 per cent at 2,166.74.The broader market’s flat performance followed a week of modest gains by the S&P 500, which hit a four-year high in spite of increased security fears following the failed bomb attacks in London last week.“I would certainly characterise earnings as more good news that bad news,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries Co, but Mr Hogan said overall earnings this season had showed slowing earnings growth, with the basket of companies increasing only 8 per cent from last year compared to 10 per cent in the previous quarter.“the aggregate is significantly below first quarter and that is beginningto creep into the market’s psyche”.Still, Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, hailed an improvement in sales figures this quarter. “Margins are still wide, and in some cases widening. It looks like a much more sustainable earnings cycle when it’s driven by top-line growth,” he said.Xerox, the copier and printer maker, fell 6 per cent to $13.20 after it reported disappointing earnings and issued cautious third quarter guidance.A huge one-off tax gain doubled the group’s net income for the quarter, but underlying earnings failed to match expectations.Shares in financial services and credit card provider American Express were flat at $54.56 after the group said profits rose 16 per cent in the second quarter.BellSouth, the third largest telecommunications company, was up 0.3 per cent to $26.81. Second-quarter earnings fell 20 per cent because of costs associated with the acquisition of AT&T Wireless by its Cingular joint venture. Excluding those costs, and including its 40 per cent share of Cingular, the group earned 46 cents a share, compared with expectations of 43 cents a share.Two of the biggest US appliance makers received a boost after Maytag said it would consider a sweetened takeover bid from Whirlpool.The new $18-a-share bid topped Whirlpool’s earlier offer of $17 a share, which Maytag had rejected in favour of a $14-a-share offer from Ripplewood Holdings, the buyout group.Maytag shares climbed 4.9 per cent to $17.00, while Whirlpool gained 7.1 per cent to $82.68.In other merger and acquisitions news, Teva Pharmaceutical, the Israeli generic drugs manufacturer, said it was in advanced talks to buy Ivax, a maker of asthma treatments, in a deal worth about $7.4bn. The news sent shares in Ivax up 10 per cent to $25.17.Energy shares led gainers on the S&P, with Halliburton, the oilfield contractor, up 2.9 per cent to $54.86.McDonald’s, the fast food chain, was the biggest laggard on the Dow, with shares down 1.0 per cent.Texas Instruments, the maker of analog computer chips, slipped 0.2 per cent to $30.71 ahead of its quarterly earnings report, due out after the closing bell.
227;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-06-29T10:33:48Z;Rob Glaser, CEO Real Networks;;"What’s in your pocket? Typically I would have two devices with me; a BlackBerry for e-mail and my phone. I recently moved to the 7100 and it’s the first one of the BlackBerry family that’s good enough to be the primary phone. I haven’t decided if I’m going to stop carrying my phone which is a PalmOne. It’s a bit big, but it has my calendar, schedule and everything on it. So I’m a two device guy, except when I’m carrying music then I’m a three device guy. I’d like to get back to being a two device guy.First crush? At High School I got a programmable calculator, a TI 58, it had 214 sections and the biggest choice because it was expensive – at the time it was probably $200 which for me in 1976/77 was a lot of money. I had to choose between the version that had a memory card for $100 more or the printer. Love is a strong word, and that was the time I was discovering girls, so I wouldn’t use the word love, but that was the first technology that captivated me.True love? I wish there was a single answer. I remember when I first saw the Xerox Star in 1983, I thought this is the future of computers. It was beautiful, but it was slow and not really a commercial product And then in 1993 I downloaded the first web router. The Mosaic browser was the first that did graphics and was the one that fuelled the network effect. What I loved was seeing the future and seeing how hypertext and the infrastructure of the web was going to create a transformational experience that would be at the heart of the subsequent 12 years of my professional life.Latest squeeze? This BlackBerry 7100. One of the problems in a converged phone/organising device is combining number and text entry. Rather than having the normal three letter ABC, DEF etc on top of the numbers, they’ve done something called short type, where each key has just two letters on it and the numbers, largest. This means instead of having only nine or 12 elements on a keyboard you have about 20 with the numbered ones at the centre.And because you’re dealing with the first two letters for each word, it gets it right first try 95 per cent of the time.If money was no object? I think a portable music device that allows you to take all your music with you to share it with your friends by literally pushing a button and you would have a song that you liked, and I could get songs from friends and you’d be able to connect. I think that would be very cool.PC or Mac? PCLinux or Windows? Windows on the desktop, Linux on the server and the set top box.Google or not? Yes, Google. Best product, best consumer experience.How wrong have you been? I feel good about my ability to see the seminal moments of the future – the role that PC’s would play in all of our lives. In 1981 I worked for IBM and decided I wanted to spend the next 10 years sat around the PC and I thought Microsoft was a great place to do that. In 1993 when I was with Microsoft and downloaded the web browser, I decided that was where I wanted to spend the next chapter of my life and 12 years later I’m still in to that chapter. So my experience is when you get the big ones right, you can get some of the little ones wrong."
228;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-04-24T19:37:01Z;KPMG offers deal on accounts;;KPMG's US business has offered to publish annual accounts if lawmakers provide auditors with protection against potentially catastrophic negligence claims.Eugene O'Kelly, chief executive of KPMG's US business, told the Financial Times he was considering the case for issuing annual accounts, adding that action by lawmakers to limit auditors' liability could make the move possible.Accounting businesses in the US have been privately criticised by regulators for not being more transparent about their finances.They only give details of their annual revenues, while their sister accounting businesses in the UK, for example, publish accounts.KPMG's US business went further than rivals last year by releasing details of private conclusions reached by regulators who scrutinised its audit work.In January, KPMG revealed some limited information about US partners' incomes. “I would be prepared to take it from that [information on partners' income] to a full set of accounts, if that was the gate to achieve the goal [of liability reform],” he said.Mr O'Kelly believes liability reform is necessary to prevent the destruction of another big accounting firm after Andersen's demise in the Enron scandal.He has proved to be a reforming leader of KPMG's US business since he became chief executive in April 2002, against a backdrop of investigations by regulators into its audit and tax work.Last week KPMG reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the accounting firm's audits of Xerox, the copier company, between 1997 and 2000.KPMG agreed to pay $22m to resolve SEC allegations that it aided and abetted Xerox's accounting fraud, which resulted in inflated revenues.The SEC alleged that after KPMG's lead partner on the Xerox audits questioned the company's reporting practices in 1999, the firm removed him from the assignment. KPMG did not admit or deny the regulator's allegations, but the settlement involves undertakings by KPMG to change its working practices.A senior partner will review any instances where a lead audit partner is moved off an assignment and the firm will strengthen whistleblower procedures.But just as the Xerox affair is concluded, KPMG's audit work is coming under fresh scrutiny elsewhere.The SEC said in December that Fannie Mae, the giant housing finance company, had violated complex US accounting rules on derivatives, known as FASB Statement 133.The prospect of a $9bn earnings restatement led to the ousting of Fannie's chief executive and the company also severed ties with KPMG, its auditor since 1969. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the auditors' regulator, opened an investigation into KPMG's work.Mr O'Kelly said KPMG would strongly defend itself before the PCAOB.Meanwhile, the Department of Justice continues to investigate KPMG's sales of tax avoidance schemes.In February a report by the Senate permanent sub-committee on investigations found that KPMG sold some potentially abusive tax shelters between 1998 and 2003, although it acknowledged the accounting firm had since stopped such practices.“I have a tremendous personal amount of regret about the whole matter,” said Mr O'Kelly.He is upbeat, however, about KPMG's prospects. He highlighted a report by the PCAOB from last August which said: “The [PCAOB] is encouraged by indications that [KPMG] understands that the [Sarbanes Oxley law] calls for a renewed and heightened focus on audit quality.”Mr O'Kelly said: “I feel very good about our processes and procedures compared to the competition. We have had a strategy to resolve our matters quickly [with the regulators] and I would not trade our portfolio for that of my competitors.”
229;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-04-21T12:18:19Z;Xerox reports tougher business environment;;Xerox, raised fresh fears of faltering economic confidence on Thursday by reporting difficulty closing contracts from large customers during the first quarter.The US copier maker said revenue fell 1 per cent to $3.8bn although profits from continuing operations rose 27 per cent to $210m, excluding gains from an asset sale last year.Earnings per share of 20 cents were roughly in line with analyst forecasts, but investors were unnerved by the sales performance and Xerox shares fell 2 per cent in morning trading.Anne Mulcahy, chief executive, said: “Equipment sales were flat and fell short of our expectations.”She also blamed a shortage of supply in the multi-function colour copiers the company launched last October.No one geographic region suffered most, but larger corporate customers were said to have postponed some big orders.Sales were weakest in January but grew in both February and March. Last week International Business Machines triggered a sharp fall in stock markets by pointing to difficulty in closing orders towards the end of its quarter.Lawrence Zimmerman, Xerox finance director, said he saw no evidence that wider economic uncertainty would be a problem going forward.“Some of the orders will have just been pushed into the next quarter,” he added. “We remain confident because our people in the field are confident.”Xerox said that it still expected equipment sales to grow by “mid-to-high single digits” for the year as a whole.“Colour technology and expertise in document-related consulting services continued to be the key drivers of the company’s growth initiatives,” added Ms Mulcahy. “Despite a quarter when market conditions slowed overall equipment sales,we grew colour revenue by 15 per cent and delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue from Xerox Global Services,” she said.
230;XRX;Xerox Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
231;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-03-11T20:38:37Z;The real scandal at Boeing is not sex;;"Granted, we do not know the full salacious details. But you have to wonder whether Boeing's board of directors overstepped the mark by firing flirtatious former chief executive Harry Stonecipher. The corridors of corporate America would be half-deserted if every office romance met with such a harsh response.Economics tells us that it is the duty of managers to maximise value for shareholders while remaining within the law. What they get up to in their private lives should be of no concern - as long as it is legal and does not interfere with their work.Since the tryst with a female Boeing executive that led to Mr Stonecipher's departure was by all accounts consensual, there is no question of harassment or other legal nasties. And since Boeing stock has soared since he took the controls in 2003, shareholders cannot complain.Ah, but what of the potential for conflict of interest? Again, it is hard to find grounds for dismissal. We know the CEO did not try to influence the career or remuneration of his lover.Besides, big companies are riddled with actual and potential conflicts. Barely an eyelid was batted this week when Qualcomm, the wireless technology company, anointed the son of Irwin Jacobs, founder and current CEO, to follow in his father's footsteps. And what of Xerox, where Tom Dolan, president of the copier company's services business, reports to his sister, Anne Mulcahy, the chief executive?Shocking as it seems, these situations can be managed. No, l'affaire Stonecipher was about morals. The CEO lost his job because he is a married man, a father, a grandfather and, to cap it all, nearing the end of his seventh decade. Rather than leaving it to Mr and Mrs Stonecipher to debate rights and wrongs behind closed doors, Boeing's board felt compelled to pass judgment.You do not need to be a louche libertarian to worry about companies imposing their moral standards on individuals. The detailed rules and regulations that govern interaction between the sexes in the American workplace were designed ostensibly to protect women from harassment. But Vicki Schultz, a feminist legal scholar at Yale, sees a broader attempt to sanitise the workplace - to scrub offices and factories clean of sexuality.This makes her uneasy for three reasons. First, it is unrealistic. Sex, like work, is part of life. Second, it smacks of Taylorism, the doctrine of ""scientific management"" that tends to view workers as somewhat imperfect machines. Third, and perhaps most seriously, focus on the sexual misconduct of individuals has diverted attention from the systematic discrimination that continues to exclude women from large swaths of the economy.Who cares that Boeing's male CEO slept with a colleague and used the company e-mail system to express his ardour? The real scandal is that, after four decades of struggle for equal rights, only two of the company's 12 executive officers are women and 95 per cent of its aircraft are flown by men.The writer covers US management issues for the FT"

ContentGuard has about 30 employees.Microsoft owns almost 49 per cent of ContentGuard's voting shares and more than 60 per cent of its equity. Time Warner has a 49 per cent voting stake as well. Thomson, the French electronics maker, last year agreed to take a 33 per cent stake in ContentGuard, but that deal awaits European regulatory approval.Xerox, the copier maker that spun off ContentGuard in 2000, remains a minority stakeholder and is also named in the suit.ContentGuard's main rival InterTrust, was acquired by Sony and Philips last year.
233;XRX;Xerox Corp;2005-01-25T13:24:56Z;Demand for colour drives Xerox profits;;Xerox, the document technology company known for copiers, on Tuesday said better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings were driven by high-growth businesses, including digital technology, colour products and consulting.Quarterly revenue from those targeted growth areas grew 5 per cent over the previous year and now represents about 76 per cent of Xerox's total revenue.Xerox aims to return to investment-grade status as it forges ahead with a turnround that brought the company back from the verge of bankruptcy just a few years ago.Larry Zimmerman, chief financial officer, said Xerox has a focused plan to drive cash flow and reduce debt. Mr Zimmerman added that “expectations are high” after Moody's raised Xerox's ratings two notches last year.Xerox last year reduced debt more than $1bn to $10.1bn.Fourth quarter net income rose to $226m, or 24 cents a share, from $197m, or 22 cents a share, the previous year.Revenue rose 1 per cent to $4.33bn, including a benefit of three percentage points from the effects of currency.The company expects earnings per share in the range of 17-20 cents for first quarter.Xerox last year launched 40 new products and is set to launch new high-end production publishing machines in North America next month. Equipment sales translate into important revenue streams from paper and toner that are expected to pick up in the later half of the year.Revenue from colour devices and technology grew 21 per cent in fourth quarter and represents 27 per cent of total revenue.Xerox said full-year 2004 net income reached $859m, or 86 cents per share.Total revenue for the year remained flat at $15.7bn, including a three percentage point currency benefit.
234;XRX;Xerox Corp;2004-11-30T18:53:52Z;Bound for big things in the short run;;"With its glossy cover and colour illustrations, the edition of The Jungle Book looks like one you might find in the local bookshop. But inside there is no listing for a New York or London publishing house. Instead, the first few pages explain how the book was made with Xerox printers.The US technology company whose name is synonymous with photocopiers published this ""special edition"" to show how it can print books digitally to the same standards as those made on traditional presses.Recent progress in digital printing technology means that these books have not only improved in quality - they have also come down in price. This could eventually change the way publishers select, print and sell books.The market has big potential. The Book Industry Study Group, an industry research firm, says 500bn book pages were produced this year. According to Xerox estimates, 80bn of those could hypothetically be printed digitally.New machines, such as Xerox's iGen3, print with high-grade toner rather than ink. The text of a 300-page book can be made in minutes, then bound using component machines. Text is stored in a database where it can easily be accessed for reprinting. The process is far less labour-intensive than offset printing, where plates made of metal, film or paper are manufactured for each book page.Offset printing will not vanish. It will still be more economical for publishers to use traditional offset presses for large batches of books - 5,000 to 1m copies or more. But Peter Perine, vice-president of Xerox's publishing group, says digital technology is ideal for printing short runs of books. Books can even be printed ""on demand"", or one at a time when an order is received.Several book manufacturers and publishers are finding a niche market in digital printing, catering especially to university presses and education publishers. Antony Rowe, a small UK publisher specialising in short-run titles, says that revenue has grown from £5m in 1996 to £16m this year.Digital printing also helps publishers control their supply of books by allowing them to test the market with smaller print runs. In this way they can make significant savings on the remaindered stock and storage that build up when books go unsold.Magdalena Chavez of ENDpapers, a small UK publishing house, says: ""Print-on-demand has transformed our business. As a small publisher it affords us the chance to bring a book to the market for a risk smaller than an ad in our local paper. We can now float 10 times the number of titles.""Digital printing ""allows a book to be in print forever"", said John Fidler of XLibris, a Pennsylvania-based publisher specialising in digital printing. Mr Fidler said that only one of 5,000 manuscripts will be taken up by a traditional publishing house. Smaller runs can allow a wider range of titles and authors to enter the market.The internet also makes it easier for consumers to find and buy small-run books that lack the exposure of a big marketing campaign. As online booksellers make it easier for customers to pre-order books, publishers' estimates of future sales and print runs are becoming less risky.""Publishers have always gone by making the book and then selling it,"" says Mr Perine. ""Now they can sell it and then make it.""Publishers are also touting their new-found ability to customise book content. Don Kilburn, president of Pearson Education's custom printing group, says digital printing allows teachers to bundle original, online and third-party material in a single text. (Pearson Education is owned by Pearson Inc, which also owns the Financial Times.) Mr Kilburn says a professor could publish as few as 800 copies of a custom book, which would compare with a college text in terms of quality and cost.Pat Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, believes that university presses are just the start. The larger impact is yet to come.""The technology keeps getting better and better,"" says Ms Schroeder. ""We can't bring it on fast enough."""
235;XRX;Xerox Corp;2004-10-26T22:26:10Z;Broadcom names McGregor as chief;;Broadcom, one of the biggest producers of the chips used in communications equipment, on Tuesday named the head of Philips Semiconductors as its new chief executive.The appointment of Scott McGregor, 48, brings an executive whose unusually broad range of tech industry experience reflects the changing demands of the semiconductor business, said Henry Samueli, Broadcom's chairman.As a researcher at Xerox's renowned Palo Alto research centre, Mr McGregor was among the engineers credited with the development of the graphical user interface, which was adopted by first Apple and later Microsoft as the basis for ?point-and-click? navigation.While still in his 20s, Mr McGregor went on to head the software team that developed the first version of Microsoft's Windows operating system.He joined Philips in 1998 and, since 2001, has been credited with a return to profitability at its semiconductor business.The combination of software and semiconductor experience makes Mr McGregor suited to the chip business at a time when more of the functions in computer systems are being embedded into silicon, said Mr Samueli.Broadcom has been hunting for a CEO since Henry Nicholas, who co-founded the company with Mr Samueli, left early last year. At the time, Mr Nicholas said he was leaving to take ?much-needed time off to attend to serious family matters.?Alan Ross, who has served as interim CEO since, said Mr McGregor had been Broadcom's first choice when it began its search for a new head, but he had not been available at the time. Mr McGregor recently announced his intention to leave Philips at the end of this year and is due to start at Broadcom in January.
236;XRX;Xerox Corp;2004-10-25T17:40:57Z;A highly calculated recovery act;;"If disco was the soundtrack to the 1970s, Texas Instruments was the brand. We wore TI digital watches, used TI calculators, learned to read with TI Speak'n Spell machines and cut our teeth on TI home computers.But like other aristocrats of US technology - Xerox, International Business Machines, Motorola - the Dallas-based company found the 1980s and 1990s much harder going. In watches, it was no match for nimble Japanese competitors such as Casio. In computers it lost out to the likes of Atari, Commodore and Apple. In microprocessors, Intel was the overwhelming victor. In computer memory, Japan Inc again took the spoils.Every few years, pundits would declare TI ready for a comeback. But somehow the comeback never came. The company that employed 100,000 at the peak of its power now has a workforce of 30,000. The TI logo is found mainly on silicon chips buried deep inside products from companies such as Nokia and Sony.Rich Templeton, TI's intense young chief executive, is too focused on the present to dwell on the past. But the 45-year-old engineer saw history unfold at first hand. In 1980, when he joined TI as a graduate sales rep, the company was at its zenith. Now he is out to prove that it is on the way back up. ""Customers like Nokia can place big bets on us because they know we will deliver. We know about cost and quality. We are tenacious,"" he says.On Wall Street, investors and analysts are starting to agree. TI is widely regarded as well-placed to benefit from growth in sales of mobile phones, digital music players, digital cameras and other electronic gadgets. ""Our meeting with Texas Instruments last week confirmed excellent long-term growth prospects,"" wrote Andrew Root, semiconductor industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, following a visit to the company in August.Charlie Galvin at Needham & Co concurred: ""It is hard to believe that a well-run company the size of Texas Instruments could be overlooked, but that is precisely what we believe has happened.""Sure enough, TI shares have roundly outperformed Intel's since those reports were written. Last week, TI announced third-quarter revenues of $3.2bn (£1.7bn), up 28 per cent over last year. At Intel, growth was just 8 per cent.Yet TI's turnround did not take place over a couple of quarters or even a couple of years. The renaissance began in 1996 with the appointment of Tom Engibous as chief executive, a job he held until May.The Engibous era began in tragic fashion with the sudden death of Jerry Junkins, a well-liked TI insider who had held the top job since 1985. Mr Junkins took TI out of consumer electronics and home computers, but stayed in other non-core businesses such as defence electronics.Within the chip business, he decided that TI should remain in the D-Ram computer memory business just as other US chipmakers - including Intel - were giving up on an increasingly volatile market.The gamble did not pay off. It was left to Mr Engibous, former head of the semiconductor business and now elevated to the top job, to pull the plug. From 1996 to 1998, he sold the D-Ram and defence electronics businesses, unwound an elaborate tangle of joint ventures and cut costs. What remained was a smaller semiconductor business selling chips mainly to consumer electronics and telecoms companies.To many lay people, silicon chips are synonymous with microprocessors, the number-crunching ""brains"" of computers. But microprocessors are in fact just one slice of a much bigger market for chips that store data (memory), amplify signals (op-amps), turn analogue inputs into digital outputs and vice-versa (analogue), process streams of digital data (DSP) and much more.Mr Engibous and Mr Templeton, promoted at the age of 37 to run the semiconductor side, identified digital signal processing and analogue as TI's main strengths in terms of engineering skill, market position and growth.""The potential for DSP and analogue was incredibly obvious to us,"" recalls Mr Templeton. ""This does not mean that TI wins. But it does mean that TI is now in the right markets.""It took a few years for investors to catch on. Veteran TI watchers had heard it all before. In the 1970s, consumer electronics was heralded as the engine of growth. When that didn't happen, the mantle passed to home computers. In the late 1980s and early 1990s came Mr Junkins' big play in D-Ram. Why should this time be any different?The simple answer is that TI has a stronger competitive position in DSP and analogue chips than ever it had in D-Ram or consumer electronics. In terms of market share, economies of scale and customer relationships, it is the market leader.TI should generate about $900m of revenues this year from sales of digital light processing (DLP) chips used in a new generation of big-screen televisions. The technology - which uses up to 1m tilting, microscopic mirrors on the surface of a chip to create a moving image - emerged from the corporate lab in 1987. Since the first DLP-based TVs were launched two years ago, it has taken more than 10 per cent of the US market for TVs of 40 inches or more.Another rapidly-growing business is high performance analogue, which makes specialised chips used by electronic engineers in everything from hi-fi amplifiers to electronic test equipment.This is an arcane business. TI's HPA catalogue includes 15,000 components and the business has no fewer than 30,000 customers - most of them buying in small quantities. ""This is a business where you've got to get excited about a $27,000 order. A customer that orders $1m a year from us would be exceptionally large,"" says Gregg Lowe, senior vice-president for the division.Arcane and complex, yes. But also high growth. The HPA business grew by 25 per cent last year and should deliver revenues of about $1bn in 2004. This is impressive stuff - especially coming from a company whose core business requires staying on the right side of mega-customers such as Nokia, which last year purchased $1.4bn of chips from TI.So what is the secret behind this late flowering of innovation and entrepreneurship? Decentralisation, says Mr Templeton.In contrast to the old plan-driven approach, these days only tax, manufacturing and some aspects of marketing are handled centrally. Operating groups are free to make their own choices about technologies and products: ""DSP and analogue have a lot of growth potential. At the corporate level we just have to get resources to the line guys and get out of their way.""As every practising manager knows, however, this is more easily said than done.In 1980, the year Mr Templeton joined TI, Peter Drucker published Managing In Turbulent Times. The great sage of management warned the quickening pace of change would put a new premium on innovation: ""[Innovation] means, first, the systematic sloughing off of yesterday. It means, next, the systematic search for opportunities . . . It means a willingness to organise for entrepreneurship, to aim at creating new businesses rather than new products or modifications of old products. It means, finally, the willingness to set up the innovative venture separately, outside the existing managerial structure.""More than two decades on, Texas Instruments shows what can be achieved when the theory is put into practice. If only the message had got through earlier.REBIRTH OF A FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT CORPORATE MACHINEBack in the era of Speak’n Spell, Texas Instrument’s reputation in management circles was second to none. With its matrices and strategic planning processes, its carefully balanced portfolio of “rising stars” and “cash cows”, TI was the very model of a diversified US corporation.The downside was a slowness to respond to new opportunities or threats. Management was bureaucratic. Priorities were set according to the requirements of TI, not the needs of customers.Thus, when TI launched its first home computer in 1979, the model TI99/4 was priced at $1,150, a hefty premium to competing products. Dealers bemoaned the company’s unwillingness to back a decent product with attractive pricing and a strong promotional campaign.TI managers of the time recognised the shortcoming. Marketers were recruited from outside to shake things up. Advertising budgets were raised. Fred Bucy, then company president, used the 1982 annual shareholders’ meeting to concede that TI had become too unwieldy and out of touch.Only recently, after successful bets on specialised microchips - the digital light processors behind a new type of large-screen television and analogue chips, which control technical engineering equipment - has the company turned the corner. The secret, says Rich Templeton, TI chief executive, is decentralisation: giving engineering units the freedom to pursue innovation."
237;XRX;Xerox Corp;2004-10-20T17:40:03Z;Book review: From playing games to real work;;"GOT GAME
How the Gamer Generation is Reshaping Business Forever By John Beck and Mitchell Wade
Harvard Business School Press, $27.50, £16.99Generation gaps are nothing new. But if John Beck and Mitchell Wade are right, those under the age of 34 think, learn and feel differently from everyone else. The root of this cognitive divide? Video games, since the 1980s a primary form of home entertainment for impressionable teens.If this sounds far-fetched, consider that Americans now spend more on video games each year than going to the movies. Sony's Play-Station games console alone has a place in 25 per cent of US households. In 2003, the games sector notched up global sales of $28bn.Got Game is not the first book to argue that there is a generational digital divide. John Seely Brown, former head of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (Parc), has researched the gulf between students who grew up with the internet and professors reared on books. He found the former have a talent for digital bricolage - combining music, images and other digital artifacts - that their elders will never master.Beck and Wade, researchers and management consultants, believe that the defining experience for today's teens is not the internet but gaming - a form of entertainment quite different from the cocktail of television, pop music and sport on which most baby boomers were raised.In video games the player is the hero, not just a passive observer or team member. Success demands not only digital dexterity but also a “trial and error” approach to learning.How does this affect the outlook of the gamer generation? The question is important across all industries. Many of today's young employees will have spent their formative years annihilating virtual aliens. It won't be long before your boss is more familiar with the success strategies required to win at Halo than with the oeuvres of Alfred Hitchcock or Woody Allen.The authors carried out research into the attitudes, expectations and abilities of 2,500 US business professionals of all ages, gamers and non-gamers. They conclude that: “Growing up is simply different for gamers. They have replaced whatever traditional experiences they might have had as supporting players with a dramatic increase in experiencing the hero role; they've had more experience with repeated failure that builds towards success, but probably less experience with activities at which they'll never be the best or even average.”Perhaps surprisingly, they found no evidence of short attention spans among gamers. Far from it. Avid gamers have the ability to spend hours, days or even weeks in the single-minded pursuit of an objective.Nor did they find violent tendencies. They argue that behind the hyperviolent veneer, most video games are actually sophisticated simulations that rewardperseverance and learning by doing.The result is a generation that can seem like “arrogant slackers” at first but are in fact highly motivated - if given the opportunity to develop and play a starring role in their own projects. Managers who want to get the most from their underlings need to understand the psyche.This is not to say that the gaming experience is wholly positive. The authors worry that the simple, structured and competitive relationships of video games are not necessarily good preparation for the subtleties of real life. Much more research is needed.Institutions of higher education are already dealing with the practical implications as gamers move from home to college. The University of Southern California (where both Beck and Seely Brown spend a chunk of their time) is at the forefront of moves to adapt its curriculum to a more interactive, iterative learning style.Businesses are also starting to adapt. Today's management orthodoxy emphasises small teams, experimentation and rapid prototyping - a much more gamer-friendly approach than bureaucratic planning. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the technology industry, where young managers shaped by gaming experience are already in senior roles.The worry must be that the dotcom bubble, fuelled by the determination and narcissism of the gaming generation, is a taste of things to come for the economy as a whole. Beck and Wade urge us not to fret.Gamers will make fine business leaders, they argue, in a world where uncertainty and constant change are the norm.Will this next generation of CEOs read business books? Beck and Wade do not address this question. But Got Game deserves credit for drawing attention to an issue that few managers of any age have started to think about. That it does so in 200 bright and breezy pages is another plus.In the meantime, the authors advise baby boomers who grew up in a world dominated by TV to take Game Boys on business trips, or recruit gamers into their teams to learn what makes them tick. If nothing else, you will be able to impress the kids by knowing your Metal Gear Solid from your Civilization."
238;XRX;Xerox Corp;2004-08-16T08:03:51Z;Kodak expands European digital printing business;;Eastman Kodak extended its move into digital technology on Monday as its unit NexPress, a maker of digital colour systems, agreed to buy sales and service assets from Buhrmann, the Dutch office supply group.Kodak said it was buying Buhrmann Graphic Systems? sales and service units for digital production colour presses and digital production systems in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and in Italian cities, although the terms of the deal were not released.?This agreement with Buhrmann expands NexPress? direct coverage in major European markets. It enhances our market position in Europe and demonstrates NexPress? commitment to…grow the digital printing business,? said Venkat Purushotham, Nexpress chief executive.The move, which extends Kodak?s European digital footprint to encompass front-end operations, is the latest stage in the US photography group?s dramatic change in strategy to shift from traditional film products to digital technology. It unveiled the shift last year and said it planned to spend up to $3bn by 2006 in its digital expansion.Kodak is strengthening its position in digital commercial printing, which includes products such as direct mail marketing, high-end reports for corporations and billing statements, a market currently dominated by Xerox and Hewlett-Packard.In April, Kodak bought out its partner in NexPress, German maker of printing machines Heidelberg Druckmaschinen, while also buying Heidelberg Digital, a maker of black-and-white printers.However, Kodak has said that it would focus on integrating acquisitions this year, with purchases for 2004 ?significantly lower than the approximately $1bn of total actions announced in 2003?.Buhrmann, which is the authorised distributor for Heidelberg in several European countries, described Monday?s agreement as ?a logical step? following Heidelberg?s decision to divest its digital print operations and focus on its core business.However, said it would continue to sell and service Kodak?s Digimaster digital production system in countries where Kodak does not have a sales or service organisation.
