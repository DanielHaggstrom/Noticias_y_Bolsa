0;NOV;National-Oilwell;2016-04-11T20:41:15Z;NOV shares slide amid dividend cut setback;US stocks decline on sell-off in last hour of trading;National Oilwell Varco cut its dividend by almost 90 per cent on Monday as the collapse in energy sector capital spending weighed heavily on the company.The US oilfield equipment maker reduced its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share from 46 cents, citing “market conditions which continued to deteriorate through the first quarter of 2016”.It is the lowest payout since the company began offering regular dividends in 2009, according to Bloomberg data.The Houston-based company also said it expected its first-quarter revenues to decline 20 per cent from the fourth quarter to $2.2bn compared with estimates of $2.4bn.Energy groups have dramatically cut back on investment amid the sharp decline in the price of crude oil.Indeed, fixed-capital expenditures of the S&P 500 energy sector slid 41.2 per cent in the fourth quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to data from FactSet.The sector accounted for just 21 per cent of S&P 500 (ex-financials) capex, down from a third in the fourth quarter of 2014.NOV shares fell 6.2 per cent on Monday to $27.32, extending their 12-month decline to nearly 49 per cent.Valero, an oil refiner, also came under pressure after Credit Suisse cut its rating on the stock from “outperform” to “neutral”.The investment bank said the stock’s valuation relative to its peers was no longer as appealing, noting, however, that it could rally into the summer.Refiners have outperformed recently as they have benefited from the low price of oil, their main input, as well as robust consumer demand for gasoline.However, Credit Suisse believes “the bottom of the oil market is behind us”, barring a recession.Valero fell 3.7 per cent to $60.74, extending their 2016 decline to 14.1 per cent.ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest publicly traded energy company, crept up 0.2 per cent to $83.35. Williams Companies, an energy infrastructure operator, jumped 5.2 per cent to $17.06. However, exploration and production group Marathon Oil slipped 0.9 per cent to $11.67.Elsewhere, Norfolk Southern fell 2.7 per cent to $79.28 after Canadian Pacific said it would end its months-long pursuit of the US railway operator.CP said that with “no clear path to a friendly merger at this time, we will turn all of our focus and energy to serving our customers and creating long-term value for CP shareholders”.A turbulent last hour of trade led to the S&P 500 closing 0.3 per cent lower at 2,042, the Dow Jones Industrial Average giving up 0.1 per cent to 17,556 and the Nasdaq Composite slipping 0.4 per cent to 4,833.Many analysts took a cautious stance as the first-quarter earnings season got under way this week.S&P 500 earnings are forecast to have declined 8.1 per cent on a year-on-year basis, the biggest drop since the financial crisis, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
1;NOV;National-Oilwell;2014-04-28T21:24:06Z;National Oilwell Varco falls on demand fears;;Shares in National Oilwell Varco, the US oilfield services equipment maker, fell at their steepest pace in more than two years after executives forecast a moderation in demand for offshore rigs as pricing pressures rise.On a call with analysts, the company said its order backlog would fall to a range of $14bn to $15bn after hitting a company record of $16.4bn in the first quarter.“We believe the second quarter will be in the range of one to one book-to-bill,” chief executive Clay Williams said on a call with analysts.“And at the third and fourth quarters, we’ll gradually drift down, leaving us with an ending backlog probably in the low teens.”The comments were made along with the company’s first-quarter results. National Oilwell Varco reported a 9 per cent rise in sales from a year earlier to $5.8bn.Profits climbed 17 per cent to $589m, or $1.37 per share. When adjusting for certain transaction costs, the company said it earned $1.40 a share, ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Shares fell 7.4 per cent to $77.31.Shares in Bank of America slumped 6.3 per cent to $14.95 after the company said it would return less capital to shareholders than previously announced after finding an error in the way it accounted for structured notes.Bank of America had previously announced plans for a $4bn share buyback and an increase of its dividend to 5 cents a share from one cent.The accounting mistake relates to the bank’s treatment of structured notes issued by Merrill Lynch, the bank it acquired at the height of the financial crisis in 2008.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the market reaction was “overdone” with the mistake dimming estimated 2015 earnings by 1.3 per cent.“Market seems to be pricing in elimination of stock buybacks through 2016,” Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said. “We feel this is too punitive given Bank of America’s high level of capital from which they’re starting from . . . and the fact that they self-reported this mistake.”The failure, at least at this moment, of two mergers has put pressure on shares of Newmont Mining and Mylan, even as large-scale deal activity continues at a heady pace.On Monday, Barrick Gold said it had been informed by Newmont Mining that talks between the two producers about a possible merger were done.“Although Barrick believes the interests of shareholders are best served through the completion of this business combination, Newmont’s board has determined that the interests of Newmont’s shareholders are best served by remaining independent,” the company said in a statement.With the price of the yellow metal tumbling, producers are eyeing combinations to cut costs.Last week, Canadian producer Osisko Mining was taken over in a $2.9bn deal by competitors Yamana Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines.After reaching a post-crisis high of $1,900 an ounce in September 2011, the gold price has fallen steadily as the twin threats of deflation and spiralling inflation have eased.Newmont Mining shares fell 6.7 per cent to $24.67 while Barrick declined 3 per cent to $17.33.Mylan, the US drug company which increased its bid for Swedish drugmaker Meda last week, was rebuffed for a second time on Monday, sending its shares lower.Shares in Mylan declined 2.7 per cent to $50.67 while Meda shares trading in Stockholm fell 8 per cent to SKr118.50.Overall, US equity markets began a busy week on a shaky footing.While pending home sales and a regional report on manufacturing showed underlying improvements in economic activity, investors remained on the side ahead of earnings reports from a fifth of S&P 500 companies and the monthly non-farm payrolls report.The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.32 per cent at 1,869.43 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.53 per cent to 16,448.74. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite nudged down to 4,074.40.
2;NOV;National-Oilwell;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Oil shale boom boosts US jobs market;;The boom in shale oil and gas production has created one bright spot in the otherwise grim US labour market, as manufacturing growth in oilfield services equipment leads to big jumps in profit and calls for new staff to cope with demand for everything from rigs to pipes to pumps.Companies ranging from Halliburton to National Oilwell Varco reported massive earnings growth in the third quarter. This has underpinned a 10.3 per cent jump, year on year, in September job growth in the mining and oil and gas field machinery sector.“The rate of job growth is noteworthy,” said Brian Davidson, an economist with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiled the statistics. He noted, in comparison, that total non-farm employment rose just 1.2 per cent in September, reflecting still sluggish growth across other sectors.Halliburton alone said it is hiring 11,000 people in North America this year. It invested $18m in the third quarter in projects to strengthen its North America service delivery and reposition its manufacturing infrastructure to support projected international growth. NOV will also hire about 5,000 people in the US this year.Some producers, such as Chesapeake Energy, have diversified into manufacturing to meet their own demands. Chesapeake established a subsidiary, Compass Manufacturing, in 2007 when the US's shale boom hit its stride.An audit of the energy system of the US, and assessments of the leading companies and the most powerful policy makers that will shape that future“Chesapeake was buying all its equipment from outside vendors and still faced a shortfall,” said Don Mosher, Compass' director of operations. Through Compass, it began building gas compression packages and related equipment to make up the shortfall.“Compass can't keep up and build all of it,” he said.The jobs growth is a consequence of new technology which has enabled companies to economically extract gas from tightly packed shale rock that had only several years ago been ignored as too expensive to bother with.The US has had significant growth in the amount of gas that can be recovered domestically because of shale, making it now the largest producer of natural gas in the world.PFC Energy, the consultants, said last week that dramatic growth from shale sources meant that the US will become the top producer of oil and gas on a barrel of energy basis, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia, by 2020.This month, Compass opened a new 40,000 square foot assembly facility in Oklahoma City and will double its staff, hiring 75 people through the middle of next year, to triple its production in the first quarter of 2012.Chesapeake, through other ventures, makes everything from valves to hosing to control systems. Earlier this year, it called on its subsidiary, Nomac Drilling, to build new rigs and retrofit existing ones to run on natural gas.“Nomac is a great proxy for what shale has done to the market,'' said Steve W Miller, Chesapeake's senior vice-president of drilling. “Nomac didn't exist 10 years ago and has gone from a startup in 2001 to more than 130 rigs now.'' Nomac plans to ramp up to 150 rigs next year, with a staff of 3,500.“For every well drilled in the US – and there are tens of thousands drilled each year – up to 200 people come and go across that well,” said James Minmier, president of Nomac Drilling. “All are high-paying jobs that infuse dollars into local communities.''Chesapeake is trying to fill 700 jobs across the company.Mr Mosher says Compass’s backlog of orders for compression equipment will take years to clear.“It's incredible,” he said. “I've never been any place where you could look down the road and demand was going to grow exponentially.”James West, oil field services analyst at Barclays Capital, said 3.5m of horsepower in pressure pumping equipment will be added to the US market in 2011, and the same amount is likely in 2012.Each $1,000 per horsepower translates to $3.5bn of economic activity added to increase the US’s pressure pumping fleet. On top of that, 200 land rigs are being added, at up to $18m a rig, to what already is the largest land drilling market in the world.“The US is adding $8-$10bn in economic activity just to build equipment to produce shale,” Mr West said.NOV, the world's biggest manufacturer of drilling machinery, pipe and downhole drilling motors, reported more than doubling its equipment backlog for drilling rigs and related equipment in the third quarter. That added up to $10.3bn, a steep rise from $4.9bn in the third quarter last year.“We have high demand across all categories,” said Clay Williams, NOV's chief financial officer. “We've seen substantial growth in demand for all tools and hardware that go into shale drilling.”
3;NOV;National-Oilwell;2011-09-01T19:12:21Z;Small caps: Namakwa Diamonds plunges;;Namakwa Diamonds plunged by 61.3 per cent to 10½p after delivering a radical strategic review, parting company with its senior management and warning that it no longer had access to a US$30 million credit facility announced in June.The miner said chief executive Nico Kruger had stepped down and would be replaced by chief finance officer Richard Collocott, a former Norilsk Nickel executive who joined the company in July.Hans Smith, the group’s chairman, and Dirk van Staden, head of its audit committee, resigned by mutual consent.Namakwa also said it was winding up all diamond trading joint ventures and was in advanced talks to sell its business in the Democratic Republic of Congo to local management.The moves were intended to refocus Namakwa around its Kao kimberlite mine in Lesotho.RBC analyst Des Kilalea said any refinancing of Namakwa might require new equity.“The overdue decision to clear cash-burning operations is welcome but, in our view, the difficult task facing new management is to rebuild the investment story such that new funds can be raised,” he said.Hamworthy edged up 0.9 per cent to 550p after Evolution Securities speculated that the oilfield engineer might be a takeover target for National Oilwell Varco.Varco has $1bn to spend on acquisitions this year and is looking mainly at companies outside the US, with an apparent focus on offshore production equipment, Evolution said.Hamworthy would be a plausible target given its valuation of £250m and its position as global leader in offshore fluid handling systems, said the broker.Plexus Holdings, the Aim-listed oil and gas services company, gained 9.2 per cent to 68½p after securing a $1m contract with Vantage Drilling of Malaysia to supply wellhead systems.Lochard Energy was up 23.6 per cent to 16¼p after the North Sea oil explorer admitted shortly after delivering full-year results that it had received a takeover approach.The company, known as Rheochem before the sale of its drilling fluids business earlier this year, owns a 10 per cent interest in the Athena development, which is due to deliver first oil in the fourth quarter of 2011.House broker FinnCap recently estimated a net asset value of 47½p per share for Lochard.San Leon Energy rose 12.2 per cent to 20¾p after it revealed that drilling was ready to begin at its Belvedere-1 exploration well in Poland.Solo Oil was marked lower by 4 per cent to 0.95p after an update from its Ausable oilfield in Canada, operated by joint venture partner Reef Resources, where the companies had been trying to address problems with foaming.SimiGon, a flight simulator maker, rose 7.9 per cent to 5.1p after the US Air Force chose it as prime contractor for a scheme to teach undergraduate students how to fly remotely piloted aircraft.SimiGon said it would be paid $2.6m for the successful delivery of the software.
4;NOV;National-Oilwell;2011-07-05T21:00:41Z;Wall St flat after strong rally;;Shares in Southern Union jumped as the bidding war for the pipeline operator escalated while the wider markets remained relatively flat as investors paused for breath following the strongest rally for two years last week.Shares in Southern Union were up 4.3 per cent to $42.10 after Energy Transfer Equity agreed to take over the Texas-based group in an $8.9bn deal – significantly more than the $7.9bn that it had agreed on last month.The higher offer follows a bid two weeks ago by Williams, another natural gas group, designed to break up the already agreed deal.Shares in Williams were down 0.2 per cent to $30.68 while ETE added 0.6 per cent to $44.93.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Zion Oil & Gas tumbled 17.6 per cent to $4.86 after the oil-and-gas exploration company said on Friday that there was little chance a well in northern Israel contained commercially viable hydrocarbons.But overall, the sector was up 0.5 per cent, one of the few to gain in a generally caution session, helped by a rise in the oil prices. Marathon Oil was up 3.4 per cent to $34.06 while Peabody Energy added 2.2 per cent to $60.69.But this failed to prevent the S&P 500 edging lower, losing 0.1 per cent to 1,337.88 as investors worried about which direction the markets would now turn after the 5.6 per cent jump in the S&P last week – the best week of gains in the index for two years.The index is now just 1.9 per cent away from a three- year high and is well above its 100-day moving average.Financial stocks were some of the worst hit by these nerves, also hurt by news that Portugal’s credit rating had been cut to “junk” and that Citigroup had cut its price target on a number of regional banks.Morgan Stanley was down 2.6 per cent to $23.15 while Comerica, a regional lender, lost 3 per cent to $34.32. The S&P financial index was down 0.8 per cent, paring some of the 5.9 per cent gains seen last week. The KBW banking index fell 1.2 per cent.The industrial sector was the next worst performing in the session, not helped by news that factory orders had risen by less than expected in May.Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters, led the losses, falling 5 per cent to $22.74 while Cummins declined 1.6 per cent to $105.69.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, paring some of the 6.4 per cent gains last week.But most of the remaining sectors on the S&P saw little movement and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,569.34. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent to 2,825.77.This pause follows the best weekly gains in two years on both these indices last week.The upswing came as the indices bounced up off their 200-day moving average and investors cheered a perceived improvement in the Greece situation.The markets were also looking ahead to the earnings season, which starts next week and is expected to be relatively strong.Analysts are expecting a healthy 11.9 per cent rise in earnings from the previous year for S&P 500 companies, according to data complied by Bloomberg. This would mark the seventh straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the index.But despite an assumption that second-quarter earnings would be healthy, there is some concern that guidances for the full year will be lowered due to the “soft patch” in the US economy over the past two months.Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, argued that the S&P 500 will reach a ceiling at 1,350 before running back down to 1,250 again in the coming months, thanks partly to lower guidances.But he goes on to argue that there will be a late rally towards the end of the year, which will see the S&P finish between 1,370 and 1,400. “In the end, the market wants to go up,” he reassured.In other company news Ameron surged 28.3 per cent to $85.05 after National Oilwell Varco said it would buy the fibreglass pipe manufacturer in a deal valued at $772m. National Oilwell Varco was up 2.2 per cent to $80.02.Netflix led the gains on the S&P 500, jumping 8.1 per cent to $289.63 after saying that it was expanding its video streaming service to 43 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.Immucor, the biotechnology company, added 30.2 per cent to $26.99 after agreeing to be bought by private equity group TPG Capital for a fully diluted equity value of $1.97bn.Baidu, the US-listed Chinese search engine, was up 1.8 per cent to $145.87 on news that it will team up with Microsoft to create an English-language search.
5;NOV;National-Oilwell;2011-06-24T21:15:54Z;Oiling the wheels;Forget the glamour of exploration – the surer route to profits is in the hardware;The risers and fallers in our annual list of the world’s biggest companiesJohn D. Rockefeller became the most powerful oilman America has ever seen – and, relatively speaking, the richest man in its history – without finding a single barrel. His Standard Oil achieved supremacy in the US by owning refineries and controlling pipelines and rail routes. On his death in 1937, Rockefeller’s $1.4bn fortune was about 1/65 of US GDP, equivalent to about $230bn today.Standard Oil’s successors, ExxonMobil and Chevron, are two of the world’s four largest private sector oil groups, and make up a large part of another, BP. But the hundreds of thousands of small oil explorers who created the US industry in Pennsylvania have left little trace, living on only in the history books.Rockefeller’s career is a reminder that the least glamorous side of the energy business can often be the most profitable. Stories about oil tend to focus on the thrill of the quest, but the record shows that providing products and services that the explorers need is generally a better route to long-term success. At a time of rising global energy demand, as over the past 12 months, it is no surprise to see oil and gas service companies such as Schlumberger and Baker Hughes moving up the FT500 rankings.When the price of oil goes up, as it did in 2010-2011, demand for rigs, drills, lubricating fluids, pumps and measurement tools rises too. That demand has grown faster than suppliers can keep pace with, so prices for those products and services have risen, too. Companies that have been lucky or far-sighted enough to possess capabilities in those market niches have prospered, just as the largest beneficiaries of the California gold rush were suppliers of pickaxes and overalls.The prosaic image of the oil services business does not mean it is boringly stable. Capital spending can quickly be dialled up and down, and as the oil price plunged in the second half of 2008, the exploration and production companies, from the largest “supermajors” to the smallest independents, cut their spending plans sharply, by an estimated 22 per cent for 2009, according to IHS Herold, the consultancy. Although not as harrowing as the period a decade ago that followed the fall in the oil price to around $10, the past three years have still been a roller-coaster time for many oil services groups.When the price of oil goes up, demand for rigs, drills, lubricating fluids, pumps and tools rises tooNational Oilwell Varco, a manufacturer of drills and other equipment for oil and gas wells, is the biggest riser on this year’s FT500 list, in part because it is bouncing back after a troubled time. The shares, which were about $70 as this magazine went to press, fell below $20 late in 2008. The company has, however, positioned itself strategically when it comes to the current demands of the energy industry: for instance, with the extraction of shale gas and oil from rocks that were previously not commercially viable, but have been opened up by modern techniques.The process of hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” – injecting water mixed with sand and chemicals underground at high pressure to crack the rock and allow the gas and oil to flow out – was described by Pete Miller, NOV’s chief executive, as “shock and awe” for the energy business. In that campaign, he provides some of the crucial hardware.Another revealing aspect of the oil services sector in the FT500 is the performance of the companies linked to BP’s Macondo well disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year. Transocean, the world’s largest offshore drilling contractor, which owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded on April 20, saw one of the steepest declines of the year, falling 90 places to 363 from 273 last year. Transocean is locked in a legal dispute with BP over responsibility for the accident that killed 11 men and created the largest ever accidental offshore oil spill, and may also face action from the US authorities.However, Halliburton, which provides a range of services to oil companies and worked on the Macondo well, was one of the year’s steepest risers, up 103 places from last year’s 279 to 176. Although it has been criticised for its alleged contribution to the disaster, it was involved in only one part of the project, as BP’s cementing contractor.The other important trend in the sector has been the comeback of the emerging market companies. In 2007 PetroChina, the listed arm of the China National Petroleum Corporation, became notionally the world’s largest company by market capitalisation, helped by a thin float of shares available to investors. It has lost that title to ExxonMobil, but the return of some confidence to financial markets, and the clear signs of outperformance by emerging economies, meant that energy companies from outside the developed world were some of the biggest risers on the list.The champion of those was Novatek, the independent Russian gas company, which rose 194 places, recovering from its time in the sick patch in 2008-2009. For a while it looked as though it would be squeezed out by Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian gas export monopoly, which had a 19 per cent stake, now 10 per cent. But Novatek has thrived, recently signing a strategic partnership with Total of France, which will take a 12 per cent stake.Ed Crooks is the FT’s US industry and energy editor
6;NOV;National-Oilwell;2011-05-09T21:50:25Z;Wall St gains muted by eurozone debt fears;;Dollar Thrifty Automotive surged after Hertz Global offered to buy the car rental company, while the wider markets advanced after deal activity and a rise in commodities outweighed concerns over the financial health of the eurozone.Dollar Thrifty bounced 13.8 per cent to $79.27 after Hertz made a $2.2bn offer for its smaller rival.The offer is a 24 per cent premium over a rival offer made by Avis Budget last September, and is 17 per cent higher than the 60-day average share price.The move comes eight months after Hertz supposedly bowed out of a battle to buy Dollar Thrifty, saying it would not seek to match a higher offer by Avis. Shares in Hertz were down 1 per cent to $16.68 while Avis gained 0.3 per cent to $18.47.In other deal action, Alkermes said it would merge with a drug technology unit of Elan, the Irish drugmaker, in a cash and stock deal valued at $960m. Shares in Alkermes rose 5 per cent to $15.19.This assorted deal activity helped encourage sentiment across Wall Street, but the biggest gains came from the energy and material sectors as commodity prices rebounded.In the energy sector, Baker Hughes rose 3.4 per cent to $71.65 while Marathon Oil added 5.3 per cent to $52.19. The S&P energy index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 7 per cent losses seen on the index last week.The S&P material sector was up 1.6 per cent, with US Steel adding 2.3 per cent to $46.67 and Newmont Mining rising 1.8 per cent to $54.69.This follows sharp losses for both of these sectors in the middle of last week as commodity prices fell sharply. On Thursday, oil prices fell more than $10 a barrel in the biggest one-day correction since the financial crisis, while other commodities such as silver and copper also lost ground.The gains in the session left the S&P 500 index up 0.5 per cent to 1,346.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 12,684.83 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,843.25.The positive impact on Wall Street was limited by concerns over peripheral eurozone finances after Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating again. It comes as European officials acknowledged that Greece’s €110bn ($157bn) rescue package a year ago was insufficient and further help would be needed.On Friday the US markets were sent lower after rumours that Greece was in talks to exit the single currency. “Lingering sovereign debt concerns” could cause “additional volatility as the week progresses”, said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The downgrade news worried the financial sector, and the S&P financial index lost 0.2 per cent – the worst performing sector on Wall Street.Bank of America was down 1.1 per cent to $12.18 while Fifth Third Bancorp lost 1.5 per cent to $12.80.Elsewhere in the sector, Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent to $44.16 after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.Citigroup is the most actively traded stock in the US and the move helped bring about a relatively low-volume session.Elsewhere on Wall Street, homebuilding stocks were weighed down by worrying data showing that in the last few months US house prices suffered their largest drop in over two yearsAccording to figures from Zillow.com, the real estate website, home values fell 3 per cent in the first three months of 2011 from the previous quarter, and 1.1 per cent in March from the previous month. Prices have fallen for 57 consecutive months, according to Zillow.The news, a further sign that the US housing market is a long way from recovery, left shares in Lennar down 1.4 per cent to $18.28. Elsewhere in the homebuilding sector, DR Hortonwas 1 per cent lower at $11.81 while PulteGroupfell 2.1 per cent to $7.79.The S&P homebuilders index was down 1.5 per cent. The sector is 80 per cent lower than its pre-crisis peak.In other news, McDonald’s advanced 0.8 per cent to $79.31 after reporting that its same-store sales had risen 6 per cent in April, the biggest monthly increase since October.Tyson Foods was down 5.9 per cent to $17.77 after the world’s largest meat producer reported flat second-quarter earnings, as higher feed costs offset improving demand and higher meat prices.
7;NOV;National-Oilwell;2011-05-04T21:51:22Z;Energy leads further Wall Street retreat;;"US indices retreated further from multiyear highs achieved last week after disappointing economic data, softer commodity prices and a number of lacklustre earnings reports.The sharpest falls came from the energy sector, with National Oilwell Varco, the oilfield services company, falling 3.4 per cent to $69.92 and Cameron International losing 4.1 per cent to $48.70.ExxonMobil, the largest company in the world by market capitalisation, was down 0.9 per cent to $84.81 as the oil price fell back. The S&P energy index was off 1.6 per cent.“The fall in commodity prices should eventually be a good thing for the markets but in the meantime it is weighing heavily on the energy and material sectors,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.Energy stocks had led the rally in US equities over the past six months.Since the end of September, the S&P energy index has risen 49 per cent while the broader S&P 500 index is up 28.5 per cent.But this pattern has started to change in the past few weeks, with April the first month in almost a year where energy stocks did not outperform the benchmark S&P 500 index.The S&P energy index is down 1.2 per cent this month.Material stocks also lost ground in the session. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, fell 3.9 per cent to $51.14 while Cliff Natural Resources lost 4.1 per cent to $87.55. The S&P materials sector was down 1.7 per cent.These losses left the S&P 500 index down 0.7 per cent to 1,347.32 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.7 per cent softer at 12,723.12, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,828.23.Weak economic data weighed on sentiment across the wider markets, leaving all of the major S&P sectoral indices trading lower.The biggest disappointment was over the ISM non-manufacturing composite index, which plunged to 52.8 in April from 57.3 the previous month in a worrying sign of the rate of growth in the US services sector. However, a reading above 50 still indicates expansion.Separately, employment data from Automatic Data Processing estimated that the private sector had added 179,000 jobs in April, below the 200,000 economists had expected. The ADP data is significant as it is the first in a slew of crucial employment numbers to be released this week.The big event will be on Friday, when the official, monthly non-farm payroll numbers are set to be released, but before that there are the weekly numbers on Thursday.Some weak earnings results also kept market sentiment lower. Las Vegas Sands fell 7.4 per cent to $42.50 after the casino resort operator missed analysts’ earnings and revenue forecasts.Elsewhere, Kellogg, the cereal company, reported a 12 per cent drop in earnings and slimmer gross margins for the first quarter, sending its shares down 1.2 per cent to $56.78. Investors reacted negatively to the news as the maker of Rice Krispies and Pop-Tarts became the latest in a long line of companies to feel rising commodity costs.Last week, Procter & Gamble said it had underestimated commodity inflation in “a very difficult operating environment”.Kimberly-Clark and Nike have also reported weaker results this season thanks to higher commodity prices.In deal news, Applied Materials, the US semiconductor equipment maker, announced plans to buy rival Varian Semiconductor in a $4.9bn cash deal.

8;NOV;National-Oilwell;2011-04-27T20:56:04Z;US markets cheer Fed decision;;Amazon led the gains on Wall Street after investors responded positively to its first-quarter earnings, while in the wider markets the Nasdaq Composite index hit a 10-year high after the Federal Reserve’s latest statement on monetary policy and the subsequent press briefing by Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed.Shares in the world’s largest online retailer jumped 7.9 per cent to $169.63, an all-time high, after the company reported a 38 per cent jump in sales.This increase in revenues, however, was accompanies by a 33 per cent fall in net income for the quarter as new investments in data storage and distribution eclipsed the rise in sales.But investors had already braced themselves for a drop in earnings and some analysts appeared to be convinced by a letter from Jeff Bezos, the chief executive officer, justifying the revenue focused strategy.This helped the S&P retail sector add 1.6 per cent and helped boost the Nasdaq Composite up 0.8 per cent to 2,869.88, a 10-year high.The S&P 500 was flat for much of the day, but jumped higher after the statements by Mr Bernanke and the Fed. The benchmark index closed up 0.6 at 1,355.66, a multi-year high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8 per cent at 12,690.96.The Fed held rates steady at 0 to 0.25 per cent but tweaked its statement on growth, reducing its outlook from a “firmer footing” for the recovery to a “moderate” pace of growth. The central bank also said that it would end its $600bn “QE2” quantitative easing programme and Mr Bernanke suggested that the pace of stimulus might slow.Sentiment in the wider markets was also helped by data showing that US durable goods orders had jumped last month, with orders rising 2.5 per cent in March after a revised 0.7 per cent rise in February.In the previous session, the S&P 500 reached its highest level since June 2008, indicating that the markets have now recovered from sharp losses following the turmoil in the Middle East and north Africa and the natural disaster in Japan.Much of the recent gains in the S&P have been driven by a strong start to the earnings season. Of the 197 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 77 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, said that momentum in the markets would continue to tick higher from here over the year, but there was likely to be more volatility.Boeing’s profits in the first quarter exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, and the stock advanced 0.8 per cent to $76.12. The world’s second-biggest aircraft maker by revenue made a net profit of $586m, or 78 cents per share, up from $519m, or 70 cents per share, in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about 72 cents per share.Northrop Grummanreported a 21 per cent rise in earnings, beating estimates, while also raising its full-year guidance. Stock in the defence and aerospace group put on 0.7 per cent to $62.90.Rockwell Automation, the maker of factory automation equipment and software, saw one of the sharpest losses of the session, falling 8.7 per cent to $89.33 after reporting only a modest profit and a small increase to its 2011 earnings forecast.Elsewhere in the sector Parker Hannifin, another industrial supplier, also disappointed with its earnings and the stock declined 5.1 per cent to $93.48.Disappointing earnings reports from ConocoPhillips and National Oilwell Varco weighed on the energy sector.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest US oil company, reported a 43 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings, but missed its production and refining targets, leaving the stock down 1.7 per cent at $79.83.The decline in production was due to civil unrest in Libya, a supply vessel collision with a company platform, natural field decline and the temporary shutdown of the trans-Alaska pipeline system.Elsewhere in the sector, National Oilwell fell 4.6 per cent to $76.88 after the US oilfield equipment maker reported a 4 per cent drop in quarterly profit amid restructuring charges and Libya-related writedowns.
9;NOV;National-Oilwell;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
10;NOV;National-Oilwell;2011-02-07T22:25:22Z;Deal news boosts Wall Street;;"US equities rose to fresh 30-month highs as a string of deal announcements lifted sentiment and sparked hopes that more merger activity would follow.In the biggest deal of the session, Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn in a move that would create the world’s second-largest offshore drilling company.The combined company will have 74 rigs round the world. Pride International jumped 15.7 per cent to $39.80 on the news after Ensco said it would pay $41.60 a share, a 21 per cent premium on Pride’s closing price on Friday.US shares in Ensco were down 4.2 per cent to $52.13 but, nevertheless, the news helped to lift the sector.Schlumberger, the largest oil services group in the world, was up 0.6 per cent to $89.83 while National
Oilwell Varco gained 1.7 per cent to $77.71, also helped by high energy prices as oil continued to hover around $100 a barrel.In a slightly smaller deal, Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn.This sent shares in Danaher up 2.2 per cent to $49.03, while Beckman Coulter rose 10 per cent to $82.65.Danaher will pay $83.50 a share in a tender offer for Beckman’s shares, an 11
per cent premium on Beckman’s closing price on
Friday and 45 per cent above the company’s stock price before rumours of the deal surfaced in early December.The mergers and acquisitions activity helped the S&P 500 close 0.6 per cent higher to 1,319.05.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent to 2,783.99 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 12,161.63.Sentiment in the markets continued to rise following strong economic data and earnings results last week that pushed the S&P
and the Dow indices up above the 1,300 and 12,000 levels respectively for the first time since 2008.“US markets experienced some encouraging economic data in the form of ISM non-manufacturing services, ADP employment and initial jobless claims,” said David Buik, of BGC Partners.“Plus [there was] better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from the likes of ExxonMobil, Pfizer, Marathon Oil, Time Warner, Visa, Dow Chemical,
Kellogg, MasterCard and Viacom.“Not even Friday’s employment data, badly affected by the snow, failed to quell enthusiasm,” he added.Financial stocks saw some of the strongest gains in the session, led by CNA Financial, a commercial insurer, which rose 8.8 per cent to $30.19 after posting earnings up 23 per cent and reinstating its dividend.Bank of America added 2.7 per cent to $14.67 while American Express gained 2.3 per cent to $44.82. American International Group, the insurer, was up 5.4 per cent to $42.18. The S&P financials index advanced 1.5 per cent to 226.93.Materials stocks rose in the session as copper, considered a bellwether of economic activity because of its industrial and construction use, hit a record above $10,100 a tonne.Alcoa, the world’s largest producer of aluminium, gained 1.1 per cent to $17.32 while the S&P materials index added 0.5 per cent to 247.57.In other deal news, AOL lost ground after announcing it was buying theHuffington Post, the news website, for $315m. AOL has recently been building a network of specialist websites including TechCrunch, Endgadget and Patch,
but this is the biggest acquisition yet. Its shares were down 3.4 per cent to $21.19.Under the terms of the deal, Arianna Huffington, who founded the website, will run a new AOL division that will integrate all AOL and Huffington Post
content.Investors were also awaiting the announcement of a takeover of Genzyme, the US pharmaceuticals company, by its French competitor Sanofi-Aventis.The two parties held talks at the weekend but as yet no announcement has been made.According to reports in the Financial Times, the two parties are in the process of finalising the terms of a modest cash increase to Sanofi-Aventis’ proposed $69-a-share bid. Genzyme shares gained 0.8 per cent to $74.02.Chesapeake Energy ad-vanced 4 per cent to $31.27 after the company said it would sell natural gas concerns and two energy companies for about $5bn."
11;NOV;National-Oilwell;2010-12-13T22:53:08Z;Deal flurry not enough to inspire US stocks;;A flurry of deals including purchases by General Electric and Dell, combined with relief that China did not raise interest rates, failed to inspire US stocks to break out of their recent trading range.But General Electric dipped 0.6 per cent to $17.62 after it said it would buy Wellstream, a British oilfields services company for about £ 800m as part of its expansion into energy services.Wellstream supplies flexible pipes for the oil and gas sector, with manufacturing bases in both the UK and Brazil. One of the main attractions is its exposure to the Latin American country, which is investing heavily in exploration.The price of 786p a share is at a 29.1 per cent premium to Wellstream’s closing price on September 20, the last trading day before the UK company announced it had received a number of preliminary approaches.Shares in other oil services companies were among the biggest risers in the S&P 500 with Baker Hughesadvancing 2.1 per cent to $55.05 and National-Oilwell Varcoclimbing 2.1 per cent to $63.99.Dell fell 3.9 per cent to $13.36 after it said it would acquire data storage company Compellent Technologies for about $960m in cash as it tries to catch up with rival Hewlett-Packard. HP beat Dell in a bidding war for cloud computing company 3Par earlier in the year.Shares in Compellent, which have risen about 46 per cent since the possibility of a deal was first reported, also fell, slipping 2.5 per cent to $27.98.Dell suffered after analysts at Goldman Sachs rated the company a “sell” because of the competition its products face from tablet computers.Thermo Fisher added 4.8 per cent to $55.56 after the scientific instruments maker said it would buy Dionex for $2.1bn.At $118.50 a share Thermo Fisher is paying a 21 per cent premium over Friday’s closing price for the company which specialises in chromatography systems that separate components of a mixture for analysis. Shares in Dionex soared 20 per cent to $117.83.The S&P 500 closed flat at 1,240.46, its highest level since September 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to 11,428.56 but the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent lower at 2,637.21.The energy and materials sectors led the risers, with energy up 0.8 per cent and materials gaining 0.5 per cent, as investors were relieved that China decided not to raise its interest rates to combat inflation.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, warned that a busy week for US economic data and events in Europe could see stocks slip from their recent highs.“The markets blew off the November employment report and the ISM [Institute of supply management’s index of manufacturing activity] was also kind of iffy so if [this] week’s data are more mixed and isn’t as good as people expect, it might wake people up to the uneven data,” he said.“Confidence is near multi-year highs so that could be a real shock.”Elsewhere in deals news, Sanofi-Aventis’ battle for Genzyme rumbled on. The French pharmaceutical company extended its $18.5bn or $690-a-share offer by six weeks until January 21. Genzyme shares gained 0.7 per cent to $70.30 and US-listed shares in Sanofi added 0.5 per cent to $32.87.Sanofi-Aventis has said it will not raise the offer unless Genzyme’s board is willing to talk. It was reported that Sanofi-Aventis could be interested in contingent value rights where Sanofi would pay Genzyme investors more if its key experimental multiple sclerosis drug, Campath, proves to be the success that Genzyme expects.Airgas added 0.6 per cent to $63.50 after the company, which is fending off a hostile takeover bid from Air Products & Chemicals, said its directors disagreed over the minimum price they would accept. Shares in Air Products & Chemicals nudged down 0.2 per cent to $88.68.In ratings upgrades, Goldman Sachs resumed coverage of Apple, putting the technology company on its “conviction buy” list with a price target of $430. Apple added 0.4 per cent to $321.67.
12;NOV;National-Oilwell;2010-12-13T13:14:08Z;GE agrees £800m Wellstream acquisition;;General Electric has agreed to buy Wellstream, the UK oil and gas services group, for approximately £800m as part of an aggressive expansion into energy services.GE, which has twice been rebuffed by Wellstream, confirmed on Monday it will pay 786p a share, including a special 6p a share dividend, for the UK group.GE’s previous offer of 750p, valuing Wellstream at £755m, had been rejected as too low by the board of the UK company. GE confirmed it had made that offer in October and said it was “disappointed’ it had been rejected.The agreed deal will end months of pursuit by GE of Wellstream which announced in September it had been the subject of several bid approaches. National Oilwell Varco was among GE’s rival suitors.The offer price represents a 29.1 per cent to Wellstream’s closing share price of 609p on September 20, the last business day prior to the UK group’s announcement that it had received a number of preliminary approaches.The price also represents a premium of 53 per cent to Wellstream’s average closing price of 514p over the three months to September 20 and is 5.2 per cent above Friday’s closing price of 747p.Wellstream shares jumped 40p or more than 5 per cent to 787p on Monday.Wellstream has manufacturing bases in the UK and Brazil and is one of the world’s largest suppliers of flexible pipes for the oil and gas sector. One of its main attractions to potential bidders is its exposure to Brazil, which is investing heavily in exploration. Petrobras, the Brazilian energy group, accounts for a substantial part of Wellstream’s income.For GE, the deal will mark its second substantial acquisition in the energy sector in two months and will bring together two former sister companies. Wellstream was owned by Dresser 15 years ago. The Texan maker of gas engines for the energy sector, was bought by GE in October for $3bn. The two are seen as complementary.John Krenicki, president of GE Energy, said at the time that the Dresser deal was just the latest in a series of acquisitions in the sector. As a result of the purchases, the US conglomerate has doubled its energy revenues in the past five years to about $30.2bn in 2009.Energy is GE’s largest industrial unit and analysts expect it to generate about $31bn of revenues in 2010. Its performance has been sluggish of late as power companies have delayed ordering equipment.Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, has identified infrastructure products as an area to focus on as it scales down its financial services arm and returns to its industrial roots.GE’s share price has failed to follow the recovery in the S&P 500 since the financial crisis. Mr Immelt said GE would increase its quarterly dividend by 17 per cent to 14 cents a share, last week.
13;NOV;National-Oilwell;2010-10-06T23:03:19Z;GE buys Dresser in $3bn push on energy;;General Electric has struck a $3bn deal to buy Dresser, a Texas-based maker of gas engines used to power oil and natural gas production, marking its first big acquisition since the global financial crisis began.The deal came after GE confirmed it had made a £755m ($1.2bn) offer for Wellstream, a UK maker of flexible pipeline products for oil and gas companies, but had been rebuffed.GE, which was badly hit by the downturn, has said it will probably have about $25bn to spend on acquisitions, share buy-backs and increased dividends by the end of the year.John Krenicki, president of GE Energy, said the Dresser deal was the latest in a series of acquisitions in the sector that have helped the US conglomerate to double its energy revenues in the past five years to about $30.2bn in 2009.Jeff Immelt, GE’s chief executive, has identified infrastructure products as an area to focus on as it reduces its financial services arm, which hobbled the company during the credit crisis, and returns to its industrial roots.GE said in a statement that it had offered 750p a share for Wellstream, valuing the company at £755m.It said the offer had been subject to due diligence and could have been reduced, noting it was “disappointed” Wellstream had not accepted the proposal.Other potential bidders for Wellstream include National Oilwell Varco and Saipem.Industry analysts noted that Dresser owned Wellstream 15 years ago, but they were separated after Dresser was bought by Halliburton in 1998. The two are seen as complementary.Dresser generates 60 per cent of its $2bn revenues from outside North America. In 2009, operating profits reached $318m and the all-cash deal values the company at about 9.5 times 2010 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.To cover that healthy multiple, GE plans to expand Dresser’s presence in emerging markets such as Latin America and the Middle East, where the company has limited exposure, but where growth prospects are significant.“GE has been fairly vocal in announcing its return to the M&A markets, but this is its first significant foray since the onset of the financial crisis,” said Nigel Coe of Deutsche Bank.“We view this as a very solid return to the acquisition markets.”The Dresser acquisition will require approval from US and European regulators and possibly from other countries, but analysts said the deal would probably gain consent.Energy is GE’s largest industrial unit and analysts expect it to generate about $31bn of revenues in 2010. Its performance has been sluggish of late as power companies have delayed ordering equipment.Separately, GE said it had bought $1.6bn of retail credit assets from Citigroup for an undisclosed sum. The portfolios consist of loans to consumers for products, such as furniture, bought on extended credit terms.GE shares rose by 2.4 per cent to $16.90. Wellstream shares fell 19p to 761p. Barclays Capital advised GE on the Dresser purchase.
14;NOV;National-Oilwell;2010-10-06T22:22:16Z;GE’s £755m bid for Wellstream is turned down;;Shares in Wellstream dipped after General Electric, the US conglomerate, confirmed it had made an offer for the oil services company, but that it had been rejected.GE said on Wednesday that it had offered 750p a share, valuing Wellstream at £755m. It said the offer was subject to due diligence and could be reduced, noting that it was “disappointed” Wellstream had not accepted the proposal.“GE is disciplined in its acquisitions and, as such, there can be no certainty that it will take any further action,” it added.The company’s statement came after speculation that GE was the mystery suitor for Wellstream. GE, which is being advised by Goldman Sachs, made its approach through Vetco-Gray, its Aberdeen-based oil services arm.“GE’s approach looks a tad cheeky in our view and its rejection may flush out another approach. Another suitor may break cover now that GE has laid its cards on the table and indicating that 750p is the upper end of its price range,” said Keith Morris, analyst at Evolution Securities.“With both its plants working close to capacity we see Wellstream as capable of making about 80p of earnings. Therefore an 800p takeout price would only amount to about 10 times potential earnings – hardly a stretch with the sector forward price/earnings ratio of 15 times.”Other potential bidders for Wellstream are National Oilwell Varco and Saipem, which is part-owned by Italy’s Eni.Newcastle-based Wellstream announced last month that it was the subject of several bid approaches. The company has manufacturing bases in the UK and Brazil and is the world’s second-largest supplier of flexible pipelines for the oil and gas sector.One of its main attractions to potential bidders is its exposure to Brazil, which is investing heavily in exploration. Petrobras, the Brazilian energy group, raised $70bn (£44bn) in September to fund the development of offshore fields.Takeover speculation has swirled around Wellstream for several months. In July, the company issued a profits warning, followed in August by the announcement of a drop in first-half pre-tax profits from £25.7m to £10.6m.While market conditions in the first six months of 2010 had been “subdued” outside Brazil, it said that the outlook for the subsea sector was excellent.Wellstream declined to comment. The company is being advised by NM Rothshild and Credit Suisse.Wellstream shares fell 16p to 764p.
15;NOV;National-Oilwell;2010-09-10T20:49:27Z;S&P 500 climbs but gains are muted;;US stocks edged higher after a sharp rise in wholesale inventories boosted consumer discretionary stocks and the energy sector benefited from a higher oil price.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,109.56 on Friday and was higher by 0.5 per cent over the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.5 per cent, at 10,462.84, and was higher by 0.1 per cent on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 per cent to 2,232.17, nudging up 0.4 per cent over the week.The rise over the week was hampered by low trading volumes due to Labor Day and the Jewish new year.But Brad Thompson, managing director and fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors, said low volumes were not just a problem this week.“Low volumes have been a systemic fact for the whole market in the entire year,” he said. “You have to look at how robust the breadth and depth of the rally and declines are, and weak volume shows there is not a lot of conviction.”On Friday, data showed US wholesale inventories jumped by 1.3 per cent, more than three times the average analyst estimate.The surge, which was the largest rise for two years, shows companies were confident enough to order more stock earlier in the summer. The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index rose 0.9 per cent with Sears, the department store, up 2.9 per cent to $66.80 and homeware retailer Bed Bath & Beyond adding 2.2 per cent to $40.35.Energy shares benefited from the rising price of crude oil after a forced shutdown of the biggest pipeline supplying Canadian oil to Midwest refineries and to a key storage hub in Oklahoma.Chevron advanced 1.9 per cent to $78.82, Halliburton gained 2.2 per cent to $30.88 and National-Oilwell Varco rose 3 per cent to $41.10.But the utilities and information technology sectors weighed on the index.Utilities shares fell 0.8 per cent after PG&E, the owner of California’s largest electricity provider, dropped 8.4 per cent to $44.21.A natural gas explosion on one of PG&E’s lines just outside San Francisco started a fire that reportedly killed four people and destroyed dozens of homes.Some technology shares also fell after chipmakers National Semiconductor Corpand Texas Instruments issued disappointing forecasts and said there was weak demand for personal computers and other devices that used microchips. The semiconductor sector fell 1.4 per cent but the overall S&P 500 information technology index was flat.National Semiconductor Corp, which makes chips that control power in electronic devices, forecast sales in the second quarter of up to $415m, below the average estimate. Its shares sank 6.4 per cent to $12.08.Texas Instruments fell 0.6 per cent to $23.70 after it lowered the upper end of its forecast for third-quarter profit and sales to be in line with analysts’ expectations.Earnings are now projected to be between 66 cents and 72 cents per share on revenues of $3.62bn- $3.78bn.Both Dell and Adobe Systemssuffered from downgrades by Morgan Stanley. Dell dropped 2.6 per cent to $12.06 after it was cut from “overweight” to “underweight” because of weak demand for PCs after the rise of the tablet computer.Adobe Systems, which soared on Thursday after Apple said it would relax restrictions on iPhone application developers, retreated 2 per cent to $32.20 after the maker of graphic design programs was cut to “equal weight” from “overweight” by Morgan Stanley.US-listed shares of Nokia advanced 1.8 per cent to $9.94 after it hired a new chief executive from Microsoft.

It closed at its highest for 10 weeks, above its 200-day moving average.Investors welcomed the news that growth in the the US manufacturing sector slowed less than expected in July.The Institute of Supply Management’s index of factory activity fell for the third month running, from 56.2 in June to 55.5 last month, slightly better than analysts’ average forecast of 54.1.But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said that while the headline figures were fine, new orders – a leading indicator – dropped sharply from 58.5 to 53.5.Government spending on construction made up for a decline in private projects and led to an unexpected 0.1 per cent rise in total construction spending. The markets also shrugged off cautious comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, that high unemployment and a weak housing market were weighing on consumers.The S&P 500 Financials index rose 2.6 per cent after the positive results from European banks, with Citigroup up 2.2 per cent to $4.19, Bank of America advancing 2.9 per cent to $14.44 and AIG rising 4.1 per cent to $40.04.The S&P 500 energy index was up 3.6 per cent after oil hit its highest level in nearly three months, topping $81 a barrel.

17;NOV;National-Oilwell;2010-06-07T20:43:43Z;Wall Street at November low as selling accelerates late on;;"US stocks closed at their lowest level since last November on Monday as Friday’s sell-off continued, and accelerated in the last hour of the session.A range of factors continued to dampen investor risk appetite, including geopolitical pressures in Europe and Asia, uncertainty regarding financial reform legislation and the economic impact of the oil spill in the Gulf of MexicoRyan Detrick, senior technical analyst with Schaeffer’s Investment Research said: “Today we saw another late-in-the-day sell-off. It shows there is very little confidence and people don’t want to hold stocks overnight.”At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.4 per cent to 1,050.47, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.2 per cent to 9,816.49 and the Nasdaq Composite had dropped 2 per cent to 2,173.90.US-listed shares in BP were 1.1 per cent lower at $36.76.The stock was cut from “buy” to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs, which said that the oil group was not only facing heavy legal and clean-up costs but would have its ability to do business and compete as an operator in the region affected.BP said it was capturing about 10,500 barrels per day of crude oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico from a damaged rig and expected to increase that over the next few days.Transocean, a deep-water driller and owner of the oil rig, was down 2.1 per cent to $49.17, and Halliburton, a contractor on the rig, pulled back 1.3 per cent to $22.80.National Oilwell Varco rallied 1 per cent to $35 as the maker of oil and gas drilling equipment was upgraded from “neutral” to “outperform” at Credit Suisse with a target price of $49 per share. The broker said the stock was “a more defensive name for the current environment with lower near-term earnings exposure to the Gulf of Mexico and [the] valuation has become more attractive on the group sell-off”.AIG lost 1.9 per cent to $34.08 on reports that AIA, its Asian insurance business, may be worth only $25bn rather than the $36bn it had been seeking.The sale of the business to London listed-Prudential collapsed last week. Prudential denied weekend media reports that it was considering a renewed attempt to buy AIA.Insurance broker Marsh & McLennan dropped 2 per cent to $20.57 after the company said it planned to sell its Kroll unit, a security consulting business, for $1.13bn to Altegrity, a buy-out group. “Our long-term strategy is to focus on the risk and insurance services and consulting businesses,” the company said.Apple fell 2 per cent to $250.94 on the day it launched its fourth-generation iPhone at an investors’ conference in San Francisco.Talecris Biotherapeutics, a maker of protein therapies, jumped 25.7 per cent to $20.01 after Grifols, Europe’s largest maker of blood plasma products, agreed to buy it for $4bn.The deal will help Grifols expand its share to almost a third of the US market.Bristol-Myers Squibb was among the session’s best performers as it rose 6.3 per cent to $23.86 after the New York drugmaker was upgraded from “neutral” to “buy” at Goldman Sachs.Drugstore chain CVS Caremark was among the session’s biggest fallers as it dropped 8.1 per cent to $31.04 after Walgreen, the largest US drugstore chain, said it would stop its participation in new prescription drug plans awarded to CVS.New participants in such plans will no longer be able to get prescriptions filled at Walgreen stores.

18;NOV;National-Oilwell;2008-12-18T21:50:25Z;Wall St slips lower on struggling oil stocks;;General Electric sparked a sharp afternoon sell-off on Thursday as Standard & Poor’s negative credit rating outlook led investors to question which other companies could be vulnerable.Several big financial and industrial names came under heavy selling pressure in the wake of the move, which extended a commodities-led retreat.“If a titan like GE is susceptible in the current environment, it makes you wonder who else is,” said Steve Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investments.Shares in GE, one of the few companies in the world to retain a triple A credit rating, fell 8.2 per cent to $15.96.S&P, the credit rating agency, affirmed the rating but said there was a one in three chance it could cut it in the next two years.The move helped drag the benchmark S&P 500 index back beneath its 50 day moving average, a key technical level that was surpassed earlier in the week for the first time since shortly after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.The S&P finished down 2.1 per cent to 885.34, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.5 per cent to 8,604.99 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.7 per cent to 1,552.37.The energy sector led the declines as crude oil fell below $36 a barrel for the first time since July 2004 in spite of the Opec oil cartel’s record 2.2m barrel-a-day production cut.Massey Energy and National Oilwell Varco were among the biggest losers, off 11.4 per cent to $13.83 and 12.4 per cent to $22.86, respectively.Materials also staged a retreat as base metals fell. ArcelorMittal shed 4.7 per cent to $25.04 after Barclays downgraded its view of the stock to “equal weight”.“In our bear case scenario, we note the possibility that ArcelorMittal violates its debt covenant,” said Dana Guido, Barcalys analyst. “We stress that we find it highly unlikely that ArcelorMittal would actually breach its debt covenants . . . but, in our opinion, balance sheet concerns are likely to prevent significant outperformance in the months ahead.”Industrials also came under pressure from the latest profit warnings in the sector, this time from Ingersoll-Rand and Pentair. The manufacturers lost 4.7 per cent to $15.59 and 4.6 per cent to $23.75, respectively.The latter disclosed plans to cut about 1,600 jobs and close facilities as it prepares for a 15 per cent drop in profit next year.FedEx fell 2.1 per cent to $62.60 even after the delivery group disclosed second-quarter earnings that were broadly in line with expectations lowered by a profit warning last week, when the shares tumbled 16.8 per cent. The shipping company said it would cut executive salaries and freeze hiring in 2009.Among the big names to come under pressure, Caterpillar lost 5.6 per cent to $42.16 after unveiling plans to cut hundreds of workers.Semiconductors also did badly. Intellost 6.6 per cent to $14.26 after Jefferies cut its recommendation on the stock to “underperform”.Elsewhere in technology, Take-Two Interactive Software disclosed an an unexpected fourth-quarter loss and warned profit next year would be lower than forecast. Shares in the Grand Theft Auto video game publisher sank 26.2 per cent to $8.91.Although the leading indices posted big declines, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index – known as Wall Street’s fear gauge – fell 5 per cent to 47.34, its lowest level since October.Despite the losses elsewhere, defensive stocks held out after more largely downbeat economic data on unemployment and manufacturing provided fresh insight into the depth of the recession.Investors dipped their toes into the healthcare, utility and consumer staple sectors, all of which found positive territory.Soft drink bottlers were among the best performing defensive names after Coca-Cola Enterprisesraised its earnings outlook and unveiled a well-received restructuring plan.Its shares rallied 8.3 per cent to $11.58 while peer Pepsi Bottling Group jumped 7.7 per cent $21.01.Conagra Foods advanced 1.9 per cent to $16.55 after Citigroup named the stock as its favourite in the large cap branded food sector, highlighting that it traded at a 23 per cent discount to peers on an earnings basis.
19;NOV;National-Oilwell;2008-10-23T23:30:10Z;Wall St volatile on mixed earnings and jobs news;;"US stocks were mixed after another highly erratic session on Thursday as investors considered whether relatively upbeat corporate earnings showed the global economic slowdown may not be as grim as the market’s brutal sell-off has implied.The session began in upbeat fashion. Dow Chemical, Altria and Eli Lilly were up 10.5 per cent to $24.43, 1.5 per cent to $19.58 and 4.3 per cent to $33.48, respectively, after overshooting analyst estimates.However, the S&P 500 closed up 1.3 per cent to 908.11 points having swung between losses of 4.3 per cent and gains of 2.9 per cent.

Goldman Sachs tumbled 5.3 per cent to $108.58 after it emerged that the bank was planning to cut 10 per cent of its workforce in response to the deteriorating environment.The sector was also hit by further stress in money markets after signs of improvement this week. The rate at which banks lend to each other over the long-term rose for the first time since the fresh round of government intervention in the banking system this month.General Motors lost 1.5 per cent to $6.10 after it emerged that the group was to begin involuntary lay-offs.The news from Goldman and GM came after first-time unemployment benefit data jumped more than forecast. “There is every reason to expect hiring to drop in the wake of the disaster in the stock markets and the continued tightening of credit,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics.The rise came after the benchmark S&P 500 index fell to a fresh five-year low in the previous session after poor figures from companies such as AT&T and Boeing.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 14 per cent, to 79.43, which continued to signal a heightened level of distress.

lay-offs.Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said that this quarter, companies could no longer “have good earnings and expect that your stock’s going to go higher”.Coca-Cola Enterprises tumbled 18.5 per cent to $9 after the soft-drink bottler and distributor lowered its profit forecast for the year, while the consumer discretionary sector was another key weight on the market, off 0.5 per cent.Homebuilders were among the hardest hit sectors.

It ended the session 0.7 per cent higher at $50.32 while Ebay rose 1.9 per cent to $15.32.Xerox slid 3.4 per cent to $7.71 after the office supplier posted weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.Energy was the biggest winner, up 6.6 per cent overall, helped by oil’s edge towards $70 a barrel as well as positive results in the sector.

20;NOV;National-Oilwell;2008-10-20T20:47:40Z;Bernanke comments give lift to Wall St;;An easing of the strain in money markets coupled with the prospect of a fresh economic stimulus package helped Wall Street begin the week with a strong rally.The market was cheered by comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, who said he backed more government spending to help stave off a protracted slowdown.After a sharp afternoon rally, the S&P 500 closed up 4.8 per cent at 985.40 while the Nasdaq Composite index was up 3.4 per cent at 1,770.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent to 9,265.43.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 24.3 per cent although, at 53.22, it continued to indicate heightened distress. Last week, the index shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history.The energy sector led the rally, up 11.2 per cent overall. Halliburton jumped 13.9 per cent to $20.80 after the energy services group beat Wall Street’s expectations for third-quarter earnings.Weatherford International, which also posted better-than-expected results, gained 15.5 per cent to $16.96. National Oilwell Varco gained 22.2 per cent to $31.26.Oppenheimer upgraded several energy stocks, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, which rose 10.2 per cent to $74.99 and 11.6 per cent to $69.61 respectively. The sector also received a boost from oil prices, which rallied above $74 a barrel.At least 139 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report third-quarter results this week.JPMorgan said that, as of last week, investors’ attention had “seemed to shift to the realisation that the economy is slowing…We are into the throes of earnings season. And on that front the news has not been so hearty.”The bank said that, so far, third-quarter earnings had fallen 35.4 per cent year-on-year, although they had increased 10.5 per cent excluding financials.Early on Monday, financials were the only sector not to find positive territory. They later rallied to stand 2.8 per cent higher, although underperformed the market.Peter Cardillo, market economist at Avalon Partners, said the equities market had a “brighter outlook” now that historic levels of stress in money markets had begun to ease following a series of vast interventions from authorities around the globe.Still, insurers Prudential and Metlife came under renewed pressure after Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on the pair due to the possible need for writedowns. Prudential lost 1.5 per cent to $41.15 although Metlife, down earlier in the session, rallied to stand 6.1 per cent higher at $33.03.General Growth Properties was among the biggest drags on the S&P, down 8.7 per cent to $5.59, on reports that the real estate investment trust was trying to sell up to $2bn in preferred shares to lower its debt.Credit card stocks posted modest gains ahead of results from American Express, which added 4.4 per cent to $24.35, due after the market closed.

Rival Hasbro dipped 4.2 per cent to $28.87 even though its figures topped expectations.The consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors were up 3.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.Technology, meanwhile, stood 3.3 per cent higher.

21;NOV;National-Oilwell;2008-10-06T20:46:27Z;Wall St plummets to four-year lows;;A sharp sell-off in US equities pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 10,000 as concerns heightened that banking crises would deepen and further hurt the global economy.The Dow’s tumble took it to levels not seen since October 2004 in spite of plans from the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity into the credit and commercial paper markets.“This is unbelievable,” said Thomas Wilson of Brinker Capital, when the S&P 500 had fallen as much as 8.3 per cent. “You’re seeing panic selling. Folks have just had enough and they want to get out.”But stocks rallied from their lows late in the session. Some analysts said hedge fund redemptions – which have driven stocks sharply lower in recent sessions – were less than anticipated. The S&P 500 closed down 3.9 per cent at 1,056.87 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.3 per cent at 1,862.96 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.6 per cent to 9,955.50.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, surged as much as 29 per cent above 50 for the first time in its 18-year history.

In third-quarter earnings released two weeks earlier than planned, the bank reported a 68 per cent drop in net profit and halved its dividend.Down 6.6 per cent to $32.22 at the close, the shares lost another 9.1 per cent in after hours trading.Financials fell as much as 8.7 per cent as money markets remained in paralysis but stood 4.2 per cent lower by the close.Hartford Financial, hard hit in recent sessions, was one of only seven stocks to find positive territory in the S&P 500. The insurer gained 12.8 per cent to $30.90 after it said Allianz would invest $2.5bn.Citigroup, whose bid for Wachovia was last week scuppered by Wells Fargo, fell another 5.1 per cent at $17.41.

Google was down 4.1 per cent at $371.21. Ebay fell 5.5 per cent to $17.89 even after the online auctioneer announced plans to cut about 10 per cent of its workforce. The group warned third-quarter revenue would be at the lower end of its previous forecast.The Fed’s move to increase the size of its lending facility was the latest in a series of measures by authorities to shore up confidence in the financial system.With banks across the world affected by the liquidity crisis, there are increasing calls for a co-ordinated response from regulators and central banks. Other measures has so far included a temporary ban on shorting financial stocks. “If you can’t short financials you end up shorting the S&P 500,” said Marc Groz, chief executive of Topos, a hedge fund.
22;NOV;National-Oilwell;2008-09-09T21:53:44Z;S&P 500 plunges in worst day this year;;American International Group led the fall-out from deepening uncertainty over Lehman Brothers’ ability to strengthen its balance sheet, amid fears it too could struggle to raise fresh capital if so required.The world’s biggest insurer, which has heavy exposure to the mortgage markets, suffered more than $12bn in writedowns and credit losses in the last quarter. The shares dropped 19.3 per cent to $18.37.The financial sector dragged the S&P 500 to its biggest loss for the year as concerns grew over asset sales ahead of banks’ third-quarter earnings season.Washington Mutual – also exposed to the mortgage market – sank 19.9 per cent to $3.30, a day after the bank was put under special regulatory supervision and ousted its chief executive. Excluding Lehman, it was the biggest laggard on the S&P 500.Wachovia, among the biggest gainers in the previous session, tumbled 14.5 per cent to $16.24 on Tuesday after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “underperform” and its price target from $18 to $16, due in part to expected higher credit losses.Goldman Sachs slid 4.8 per cent to $161.67 after analysts at Ladenburg Thalmann cut their profit forecast.Visa which along with Chinatrust Financial will replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the Dow Jones Financial Services Titans index, lost 3.7 per cent at $67.49.The wider market reversed Monday’s gains as initial relief faded over the government bail-out of the mortgage guarantors.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index – a measure of investor anxiety of future volatility – reached its highest level since the credit facility for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was announced and oil reached its peak in mid-July.By the close, the S&P 500 had fallen 3.4 per cent to 1,224.51, within sight of the closing low for the year hit in mid-July, led by an overall financial sector decline of 6.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4 per cent to 11,230.73. The Nasdaq was 2.6 per cent lower at 2,209.81.A steeper-than-expected drop in pending home sales also weighed on sentiment, prompting growing worries of a worsening housing slump.The National Association of Realtors index of pending home resales fell 3.2 per cent in July after rising 5.8 per cent the previous month.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse downgraded four homebuilders – Toll Brothers, Pulte Homes, DR Horton and KB Home – from “outperform” to “neutral”. The shares fell 8.4 per cent to $24.26, 8.9 per cent to $14.77, 9.1 per cent to $12.83 and 9 per cent to $21.42, respectively.Another fall in oil prices hit the energy sector as US crude fell more than $3 a barrel after Opec’s meeting in Vienna.The declines were led by Massey Energy, Noble Energy, Valero Energy and National Oilwell Varco, which fell 19.4 per cent at $38.90, 12 per cent at $57.14, 11.8 per cent at $30.51 and 11.5 per cent at $52.92.Material companies also suffered, hit by wider commodity price declines. Nucor and US Steel dropped 9.7 per cent at $42.15, and 13 per cent at $93.69, respectively. AK Steel dropped 16.2 per cent to $33.72 after hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners, its largest shareholder, offloaded 3.1m shares.Amid the gloom, there was the odd bright spot. Oil’s continued retreat afforded at least some comfort to consumer stocks. Sears and Fortune Brands, for example, put on 0.9 per cent to $92.72 and 0.7 per cent to $61.65, respectively.McDonald’s rose 1.2 per cent at $63.19 after a positive August sales update from the fast-food chain.Hewlett-Packard edged up 0.6 per cent to $46.01 after Sanford C. Bernstein raised its recommendation on the world’s largest PC manufacturer from “market perform” to “outperform”.However, that failed to lift technology stocks more generally – which have been badly hit in recent sessions – into positive territory. Dell fell 4.3 per cent to $19.30 even after it emerged that founder Michael Dell bought $100m of stock in the computer manufacturer last week.Meanwhile, UAL, parent of United Airlines, continued to suffer losses after a false report surfaced on the internet on Tuesday that the carrier had returned to bankruptcy. Its shares fell 2.9 per cent to $10.60.
23;NOV;National-Oilwell;2008-07-20T19:01:38Z;Oil service groups enjoy ‘boom time’;;The big winners of high oil prices are not the international oil companies being criticised by politicians for their enormous profits, but rather the oil services companies that the majors rely on for equipment and labour.Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultants, say that over the past three years, large oil service company revenues have on average tripled, with net margins rising even higher, outperforming the far better known majors, ranging from ExxonMobil to BP.And analysts expect this to be another solid year for companies such as Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Transocean, given the rush to develop oil and gas assets amid record energy prices. Quarterly results are supporting that analysis.On Friday, industry leader Schlumberger reported revenues of $6.75bn for the second quarter, up from $6.29bn in the previous quarter and $5.64bn in the second quarter of 2007. Other results are scheduled to trickle out over the next few weeks.“There is a huge demand for equipment and services and many areas are pretty much at maximum capacity,” says Colin Lothian, senior cost analyst at Wood Mackenzie. That has enabled the industry to push up prices. The surge in demand for oilfield services started with the rise in oil and natural gas prices several years ago and the string of record energy prices in recent months looks set to increase this demand still further.“Certainly this is a services sector boom time,’’ says Mr Lothian. But he notes that the service companies are also experiencing a substantial rise in base costs, which is affecting margins.Barclays Capital says in a recent report that offshore drillers remain the most lucrative nook in the services arena.It notes that 120 new jack-up and semi-submersible rigs are reported to be on order, with about 40 scheduled for delivery in 2008, which may affect the balance between supply and demand.Yet even if more supply comes on line, signs are that demand will continue to grow. Barclays says the tide in North American land drilling weakness has begun to turn, with several companies stating activity will improve because of the run-up in natural gas prices.Natural gas still represents about 80 per cent of US drilling activity and all signs are that that activity will continue to grow.Barclays says the active natural gas rig count rose to 1,530 in the last week of June, the highest since gas-specific record-keeping began in 1987.Yet analysts say the oilfield services companies poised for the biggest profits are those with an international presence, given that the national oil companies that control more than 80 per cent of the world’s oil reserves have begun shutting out the middleman – the big international oil companies – to do some oil and gas development themselves. However, they still need the equipment and talent held by the services sector and are hiring them directly.Barclays says that oilfield services are “at a premium”, with international opportunities driving growth. Schlumberger, which it calls the “giant of oilfield services”, has products covering the gamut of oilfield services, and is diversified, with North America accounting for only 22 per cent of its total operating income.Barclays notes that Halliburton, the other giant in the sector, is shifting its relatively high exposure to North America to international markets, having relocated its corporate offices to Dubai in 2007.Of the contract drillers, Barclays says that Trans-ocean has less than 12 per cent of its rig fleet in the US and that Noble is also internationally diversified, with only nine of its 62 rigs situated in the US Gulf of Mexico.“Demand for oilfield services continues to accelerate in both established and new geographic markets,” says Robin Shoemaker in Citi Investment Research’s latest report on the sector. “We believe that the industry upturn is still in its early to middle stages.”Citi has “buy” ratings on Schlumberger, Halliburton, Cameron International and National Oilwell Varco, whose earnings growth it expects to be above-average because of innovative technologies, focused acquisition strategies and targeted expansion into new geographic markets.Citi notes that the Oil Services Index rose 267 per cent from January 1 2004 until June 20 2008, while the S&P 500 advanced by only 19 per cent.“A spotlight has been shining on the oil services stocks for four and a half years, and some investors are wondering if the attention continues to be warranted,” Citi says in its report. “Our view is that as investors see more evidence of strong market conditions through 2010 and beyond, they will conclude that the shares of many oil services companies are undervalued.”
24;NOV;National-Oilwell;2008-07-14T20:57:34Z;Wall Street falls on fears over financials;;Stocks fell on Monday as US government measures to shore up confidence in mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failed to impress equity investors, and regional banks came under pressure.The government sponsored enterprises, which buy or finance almost half of the $12,000bn US mortgage market and have long been seen to have an implicit guarantee from the US government, have been a drag on equity markets.Speculation that they needed more capital but would be unable to raise it had sent their share prices tumbling and again raised the spectre of systemic financial collapse.Barclays Capital said: “While we believe that this removal of short-term systemic risk is likely to improve sentiment and support GSE credit and equity in the short term, in the longer term we believe that GSE capital requirements will likely increase as credit losses are likely to be sizeable.” Fannie Mae fell 5.1 per cent to $9.73 while Freddie Mac lost 8.3 per cent to $7.11.By the close, eight of the 10 leading industry groups were in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,228.29 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.4 per cent to 11,055.19 points and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.2 per cent to 2,212.87 points.US stock markets ended last week in bear market territory. The S&P 500 posted its sixth successive weekly decline as investors rushed to sell Fannie and Freddie on speculation that a government bail-out could wipe out shareholders while oil prices spiked above $147, pummelling consumer-facing stocks.With the former threat off the table, financial stocks were expected to rally strongly. But the reverse happened as regional banks came under heavy selling pressure after the collapse of IndyMac Bancorp last week.Analysts noted that while the GSEs were more or less explicitly backed by the government, smaller banks were not “too big to fail”.Goldman Sachs added Zions Bancorp to its “conviction sell” list and predicted that a number of other regional banks might cut their dividends.M&T Bank said its second-quarter profit fell 25 per cent due to credit losses related to residential real estate.Zions fell 23.2 per cent to $19.73, M&T Bank dropped 15.6 per cent to $58.82 while trading in National City shares was temporarily halted. The shares closed down 14.7 per cent to $3.43.Washington Mutual was the biggest faller, down 34.7 per cent to $3.23. The larger banks and brokerages came under fire. Citigroup fell 6 per cent to $15.22, JPMorgan lost 4.4 per cent to $31.69 and Bank of America dropped 7 per cent to $20.15.Lehman Brothers, the whipping boy in the current round of the credit crisis, came under renewed attack in spite of a cautiously positive report from Bernstein Research that argued that thanks to Fed support and deleveraging “the firm should be able to survive any confidence crisis ahead”.Investors were less sure and shares in Lehman Brothers fell 14.1 per cent to $12.40.The sector as a whole slumped 6.1 per cent while the KBW banking index fell to its lowest level since October 1996.There were some bright spots and outside the financials only the utilities sector was down more than 1 per cent. InBev said it would buy Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser beer, for $52bn. Anheuser-Busch shares rose 0.6 per cent to $66.87.Waste Management, the largest US waste disposal company, said it would bid $34 a share to buy Republic Services in a deal valued at $6.19bn. Waste Management lost 5.8 per cent to $34.49 while Republic jumped 13.8 per cent to $31.76. Positive earnings forecasts helped boost a handful of stocks. Allegheny Technologies surged 9.7 per cent to $55.21 after the specialty metals producer said second-quarter profit would be higher than previously forecast.Energy and consumer staples stocks were the only gainers, boosted by elevated oil prices and some analysts upgrades respectively.Schlumberger rose 2.7 per cent to $101.79 and National Oilwell Varco rose 5.4 per cent to $87.59. Dean Foods climbed 2.6 per cent to $18.45 while Molson Coors added 2.2 per cent to $55.42.
25;NOV;National-Oilwell;2008-01-16T21:45:00Z;Tech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off;;Wall Street stocks retreated again on Wednesday during a volatile session in which Intel’s earnings figures prompted another bout of selling in the technology sector.Materials and energy companies also came under pressure as crude oil briefly dipped below $90 a barrel and traders bet that a weakened US economy would cause demand for commodities to slump.The market was split with financial stocks enjoying a bounce after JPMorgan cheered the investors by avoiding severe subprime-related losses. However, Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, fell sharply after it slashed its dividend to shore up capital reserves.Retail names also rallied as traders went bargain hunting in discount and department store names. Meanwhile, traders also rushed to cover short positions in the beaten-down homebuilder sector.A late sell-off left the S&P 500 down 0.6 per cent at 1,373.20, its lowest close since November 2006. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,394.59 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 12,466.16.However the Russell 2000 small-cap index advanced 0.4 per cent to 699.91 but remains 18 per cent below its July peak.Large-cap technology stocks sold off in early trading after Intel‘s quarterly profits lagged Wall Street’s expectations and its fiscal first quarter revenue outlook disappointed analysts. The shares fell 12.4 per cent to $19.88 as brokerages cut price targets on the stock.Expectations of bumper earnings growth made tech a stand-out sector in 2007 but the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 9.7 per cent this year with the PHLX semiconductor sector index down 12.7 per cent.Fourth quarter earnings are expected to hold up well, averaging gains of more than 20 per cent. But Todd Salamone, vice-president of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, warned that the bulls could set the sector up for a fall.He said: “The tech sector is expected to have strong earnings growth so it may have more trouble beating estimates.”BEA Systems was a bright spot, soaring 18.5 per cent to $18.46 after Oracle agreed to buy the business software company for $8.5bn. Oracle’s shares rose 2.9 per cent to $21.92.The financial sector rebounded after JPMorgan’s results revealed much less exposure to subprime damage than some of its rivals. Fourth quarter earnings fell 34 per cent to $2.97bn, worse than expected, as the bank took a $1.3bn writedown on mortgage investments.However JPMorgan’s problems were small compared with the $18.1bn in writedowns that Citigroup revealed on Tuesday. Citi reported a $9.8bn fourth quarter loss and revealed a sharp rise in consumer credit costs. JPMorgan’s shares rose 5.8 per cent to $41.43 but Citi fell 2.6 per cent to $26.24. Merrill Lynch, expected to reveal heavy losses on Thursday, rose 3.9 per cent to $55.09.Also reporting on Wednesday, Wells Fargo, up 3.3 per cent at $27.37, said fourth quarter profit fell 38 per cent, in line with expectations.Shares in Ambac Financialplunged 38.7 per cent to $12.97 after the bond insurer said it would raise $1bn in new capital and slash its dividend to help preserve its triple-A rating. Ambac also said it expects to take a $5.4bn pre-tax writedown for the fourth quarter. MBIA, a rival, fell 16.5 per cent to $13.40.Investors took profits in the agribusiness sector, which escaped the worst of the new year sell-off on hopes that the global food price boom would offset a slowing US economy. Monsanto fell 8.6 per cent to $112.70 and Mosaiclost 9.4 per cent to $91.71.Energy and materials were the worst performing of the S&P 10 leading sectors as traders priced in waning US demand. National Oilwell Varco gave up 6.1 per cent to $64.14 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold fell 6.6 per cent to $88.63. However falling crude prices were a boon for the struggling transport sector, with truckers and airlines receiving a boost.A comparatively modest increase in consumer price inflation in December, which rose 0.3 per cent compared to expectations of a 0.2 per cent uptick, may leave the door open for the Fed to cut interest rates aggressively, as the futures market now expects.David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley, said: “The Fed is now clearly downplaying the emphasis on inflation while raising their focus on the downside risks”.The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book regional survey showed the US economy continued to grow at the end of last year, but at a slower pace, providing some comfort to investors fearing a recession.
26;NOV;National-Oilwell;2007-12-18T04:00:59Z;Dealmaking does little to dispel gloom;;A spate of deal-making failed to dispel the gloom on Wall Street on Monday as fears of an economic slowdown and rising prices sapped confidence from investors.The US Federal Reserve began a $20bn term loan auction in an attempt to ease liquidity bottlenecks in financial markets, but stocks extended last week’s losses amid concerns it may not be enough to end the credit squeeze.The S&P 500 closed 1.5 per cent lower at 1,445.91 points, for a fall of 4.6 per cent in the past week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 13,167.20. The Nasdaq Composite index declined 2.3 per cent to 2,574.46, a three-week low, after Internet and software stocks felt heavy selling pressure. Baidu.com, the Chinese search engine, fell 9.4 per cent to $356.Roger Volz, chief technical strategist at Swiss American Securities, said that as the end of the year approached hedge funds were “looking to push the button and lock in profits”.Shares in energy and mining groups fell after commodity prices waned but transport stocks outperformed as crude oil prices slipped. “We have been in a trading range market for five months – a tug of war between ‘recession’ and ‘no recession’,” Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said.Mergers and acquisitions returned to the agenda, led by Ingersoll-Rand, the diversified manufacturer, which agreed to acquire Trane, the heating and air conditioning systems company in a deal valued at $10.1bn. Ingersoll’s shares fell 11.4 per cent to $43.60 and Trane’s stock soared 21.6 per cent to $45.24.National Oilwell Varco agreed to buy Grant Prideco, the drill pipe supplier, for about $7.4bn in cash and stock. Grant’s shares rose 13.6 per cent to $53.91 but its buyer fell 8.6 per cent to $70.69.Bristol-Myers Squibb, down 1 per cent at $27.81, said it would sell a medical imaging unit to Avista Capital Partners, a private equity group, while Plains Exploration & Production, up 1.6 per cent at $55.17, said it would sell some oil and gas properties for $1.75bn.Loews, the US conglomerate, approved a spin-off of its interest in Lorillard, owner of the Newport and Kent brands, to form a separate publicly traded company.Loews’ shares rose 2.4 per cent to $47.94.A slowdown in merger and acquisition activity, particularly in private equity, has helped to depress the share prices of smaller companies by slashing takeover premiums. The Russell 2000 small-cap index, down 2 per cent at 745.11, has fallen 6.2 per cent this year.Although buyout firms have been hit by the tightening in credit markets, many companies remain flush with cash, as the popularity of share buybacks illustrates.Shares in Harley Davidson rose 1.5 per cent to $45.62, after the motorcycle group approved the repurchase of up to 20m shares.Investors were keeping an eye on the leading investment banks amid fears of further writedowns.Goldman Sachs, down 1 per cent at $208.63, reports quarterly results on Tuesday while Morgan Stanley, down 1.5 per cent at $49.53, releases fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow with Bear Stearns, 1.3 per cent weaker at $94.07, set to follow on Thursday.Citigroup on Monday downgraded a range of consumer finance companies, including Capital One Financial, the credit card provider. The shares fell 3.3 per cent to $45.66.“We expect consumer lenders/insurers to face further credit challenges as home prices decline 3 per cent to 5 per cent in each of the next two years, mortgage rates reset and the macro-economy slows,” said Bradley Ball, a Citi analyst.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, rebounded 16.9 per cent to $26.66 after Moody’s affirmed its AAA rating.In the industrial sector, Caterpillar fell 3 per cent to $71.16 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the heavy equipment maker. llinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, fell 6.1 per cent to $52.49 after it lowered its fourth quarter earnings guidance.Mr Volz said markets could expect further big price moves prior to Friday’s so-called quadruple witching, the quarterly expiration of contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures: “It bodes for a lot more volatility than normal.”
27;NOV;National-Oilwell;2007-12-18T00:26:18Z;Huge deals fail to impress Wall Street;;US mergers and acquisitions activity sprang back to life on Monday but two multi-billion dollar deals were greeted with scepticism on Wall Street, suggesting that many investors doubt the wisdom of big acquisitions in such an uncertain market.Shares in Ingersoll-Rand, an industrial group that agreed to buy Trane, the climate control company, for $10.1bn, tumbled 11.4 per cent to $43.60 by the end of trading. Meanwhile, National Oilwell Varco saw its shares fall 8.6 per cent to $70.69 after it agreed to pay $7.5bn for Grant Prideco, a rival oil services group.“This is not a good sign,” said one senior M&A banker in New York. “It shows that institutional investors are not yet ready to buy into large deals, even where they create value.”One of the big hopes among investment bankers has been that strategic buyers such as Ingersoll and National Oilwell would step in and fill the dealmaking void left by private equity groups, which rely on cheap financing for their transactions and have been unable to strike big takeovers amid the credit squeeze.But the disappointing market reaction could deter chief executives from trying to make similar moves while the turmoil in the credit markets persists and the economic outlook remains uncertain. Ingersoll and National Oilwell paid for their deals with a mix of cash and stock.Dealogic said $23.2bn worth of deals were announced in the US on Monday, making it the busiest Monday for takeovers since July 23. Most banks are predicting deal volumes will decrease at least 20 per cent in 2008 compared with this year’s expected record figure.Martin Lipton, one of New York’s top deal lawyers, sent a note to clients in which he said he was “not optimistic” about M&A activity in 2008 and predicted a 25 per cent drop in volumes.
28;NOV;National-Oilwell;2007-12-17T20:30:52Z;Ingersoll-Rand deal;;Merger Mondays aren’t nearly as dramatic as they used to be. But Ingersoll-Rand’s $10bn deal to buy air-conditioning company Trane shows the market for big acquisitions is not frozen, especially for corporate buyers with plenty of cash.Ingersoll jumped at an opportune time. Private equity buyers who might have driven Trane’s asking price higher remain perched on the sidelines, waiting for credit conditions to ease. A deal with Trane could have presented significant antitrust hurdles for other air-conditioning manufacturers, including United Technologies and Johnson Controls. And Fred Poses, Trane’s chief executive, who is 65, is to retire on December 31, a factor that helped encourage the company to find a buyer before the end of the year.Those pressures helped keep Trane’s price within Ingersoll’s range, at about 10 times estimated 2008 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. Ingersoll, generally seen as an industrial conglomerate, will gain enough heft in cooling and refrigeration to be considered a leader in the segment. But much of the deal’s value lies abroad. Demand for truck refrigeration and air conditioning is booming in China, India and other rapidly urbanising countries. A raft of companies around the world are expected to retrofit their infrastructure to meet higher energy and efficiency standards.Ingersoll announced its move on the same day National Oilwell Varco said it would buy Grant Prideco in a separate cash-and-stock deal worth $7.5bn. The opportunistic acquisitions are likely to be followed by others, as companies that face slowing organic growth use their strong balance sheets and solid share prices to snap up targets. But the opportunity may not last long. Buy-out firms will eventually find their way back into the game as competitors. But more likely in the near term, further turmoil in equity markets could make deals with significant stock considerations tougher to pull off.
29;NOV;National-Oilwell;2007-12-17T18:35:34Z;National Oilwell to buy Grant Prideco;;National Oilwell Varco on Monday agreed to buy Grant Prideco for $7.5bn in cash and stock, in a deal that unites the two Houston-based oil services companies amid a wave of consolidation in the sector driven by high oil prices.National Oilwell is paying $58 per share for Grant Prideco, composed of $23.20 in cash and the rest in shares, valuing the group at a 22 per cent premium over its closing price of $47.46 on Friday.The combined group will have a market capitalisation of about $32bn, supplying technology and equipment such as pipes for oil and gas drilling to the world’s largest energy groups.The deal comes on the heels of the $18bn merger announced in July of GlobalSantaFe and Transocean, two of the oil services sector’s largest companies, which raised pressure on rivals to respond.“We are delighted with the way this transaction advances our strategic goal of providing more products and services to our customers. We believe Grant Prideco’s product range will add new growing market segments to National Oilwell Varco and benefit our customers’ needs worldwide,” said Pete Miller, National Oilwell chief executive.The companies said that the deal would add to National Oilwell’s earnings and cash flow in 2008, assuming cost-savings of $40m.But investors appeared unconvinced by the deal, sending National Oilwell shares down 6.5 per cent to $72.38 in morning trading. National Oilwell merged with Varco in a $2.5bn deal in 2004 and has seen the value of its shares more than treble since then.While the deal is a sign that mergers and acquisitions activity by strategic buyers remains possible despite the credit squeeze, the market reaction suggests that shareholders could be sceptical about companies spending on acquisitions in an environment of tight lending and uncertainty over the economy.Also in the US energy industry, Plains Exploration & Production agreed to sell a portfolio of assets in the Permian Basin, Texas, and New Mexico to rivals Occidental Petroleum and XTO Energy for $1.75bn.Although high oil prices have driven consolidation among suppliers to the large US energy groups, there has been relatively little deal activity among the large US oil groups.Goldman Sachs advised National Oilwell and Credit Suisse advised Grant Prideco.
30;NOV;National-Oilwell;2007-11-27T21:34:11Z;Bargain hunters lead Wall Street rebound;;"US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after a sharp sell-off in the previous session left major indices reeling 10 per cent below their recent peak.Citigroup’s announcement of a new capital injection from Abu Dhabi appeared to cheer the market, however traders said bargain-hunting drove much of the uptick after selling became exaggerated the day before.Stocks rallied even as investors were faced with a fresh batch of depressing economic data. An index of house prices recorded a sharp decline while a measure of consumer confidence hit a two-year low.The S&P 500 closed 1.5 per cent higher at 1,428.23. The move marked a rebound from the previous day’s rout which saw the index briefly turn negative for the year and fall more than 10 per cent from its record high in October – a technical “correction” in stock-market parlance.“I think it’s a technical bounce from a very oversold market condition,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist Avalon Partners, said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7 per cent to 12,958.44 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6 per cent to 2,580.80.Financials, healthcare and industrials led gains while energy stocks were weakest as the price of crude oil retreated. Hess fell 2.9 per cent to $66.39 while National Oilwell Varco declined 3.4 per cent to $64.61.A $7.5bn investment in Citigroup from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority dominated market chatter on Tuesday, underscoring the bank’s efforts to shore up its overstretched balance sheet.“The move represents part of the solution applying excess global liquidity to buy depressed and or illiquid assets although it does not represent a silver bullet for Citi let alone the heavily damaged financial intermediation pipeline,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Citi’s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $30.32 but still underperformed many of the other leading banks, However volatility in the trading of Citi options fell, as risk perception declined.A range of banking and other financial stocks posted much stronger gains as traders went bargain-hunting in the heavily shorted sector. Lehman Brothers rose 4.3 cent to $59.90 while Morgan Stanley gained 3.9 per cent to $49.80.However, MBIA, the bond insurer, fell 7.9 per cent to $30.46 after it said it was winding down a structured investment vehicle.The financial sector of the S&P has fallen 22.4 per cent so far this year and as the largest group on the index its demise has weighed on the broader market.In contrast, consumer staples, considered a recession-proof sector, have risen
10.3 per cent in 2007.Goldman Sachs on Tuesday lowered its ratings on several sectors of the US stock market, including software, automobiles and airlines. Goldman said the chances of a US recession had increased to 40-45 per cent from 30 per cent a few months ago.Goldman also said it expected the Fed funds rate to bottom out at 3 per cent in the next six to nine months, revised from a previous forecast of 4 per cent.The futures market continued to price in a December quarter-point easing, even as Charles Plosser, Philadelphia Federal Reserve president, played down the odds of another cut.In economic news, the Case-Shiller index of home prices fell a record 4.5 per cent nationally in the third quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier.The S&P homebuilder index fell 1.3 per cent to 291.55 after plummeting 7.2 per cent the previous day. Pulte Homes declined 0.9 per cent to $9.08 in spite of reaffirming its fourth-quarter outlook.A gauge of consumer confidence fell to its lowest level for two years. Stocks dipped briefly after the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index dropped to 87.3 this month, from a revised 95.2 in October, substantially worse than expected.Semiconductor stocks were broadly higher on Tuesday but shares in Advanced Micro Devices hit a four-year low, falling 1.2 per cent to $10.15, after an analyst downgraded the stock. Intel rose 3 per cent to $25.11 after JPMorgan raised its earnings estimates.In earnings news, Talbots, the clothing retailer, swung to a $9.4m loss in the third quarter but the results were better than anticipated and the shares rose 6.4 per cent to $14.02."
31;NOV;National-Oilwell;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
32;NOV;National-Oilwell;2007-10-31T20:33:09Z;Wall Street buoyed by Fed rate decision;;US shares surged higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point.The Federal Open Market Committee’s decision to cut both the fed funds rate and the discount rate by 25 basis appeared to satisfy the market. Shares fell into negative territory immediately after the decision but then soared above previous highs for the day as traders received the news most had expected.Stocks surged even as the language used in the statement accompanying the FOMC’s decision seemed to play down the likelihood of another rate cut.The FOMC said it judged that ”the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth.” One member of the Federal Open Market Committee dissented, voting to keep the fed funds rate on hold at 4.75 per cent.However, the statement also cautioned that “economic expansion will likely slow in the near-term.”Thomas Nyheim, vice president and portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust said: “I think it’s pretty much what was expected. But the language of the Fed’s statement looks like this might be the last cut.”Before the publication of the FOMC decision the S&P 500 was trading as much as 0.8 per cent higher. Shares wobbled after the decision, but then rebounded.The S&P 500 closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1549.36.

But excluding the gain, Kraft beat estimates. The shares rose 2.5 per cent at $33.41.Alcatel-Lucent, the telecoms equipment maker, reported a loss of some $373m for the third quarter, slightly larger than analysts’ expectations. But news of 4,000 more job cuts lifted the stock 3.2 per cent to $9.69.Weyerhaeuser was also higher in spite of a 55 per cent fall in net income as the US housing slump hit demand for its timber products. The shares were up 2.2 per cent to $75.91.Third-quarter profit at Newmont Mining doubled to $397m. The shares gained 9.6 cent to $50.90 Its results provided support to the S&P materials index, which closed 2.5 per cent higher at 271.42Energy stocks also made strong gains as crude oil surged to a new record close of $94.30 a barrel. The S&P energy index rose 1.9 per cent at 585.43.ExxonMobil, due to report third-quarter results on Thursday, gained 0.9 per cent to $91.93. Chevron, which reports quarterly results on Friday, rose 1.6 per cent to $91.51. National Oilwell Varco rose 4.5 per cent to $73.24.Technology stocks once again attracted buyers. Google closed at a new all-time high of $707 on reports of partnership talks between the company and Verizon Wireless. Microsoft hit a six-year high, gaining 3.5 per cent at $36.81.But Garmin declined 10.9 per cent at $107.40. The navigation device maker made an unsolicited $3.3bn bid for Tele Atlas, the digital map company, which has already agreed to be acquired by TomTom, Garmin’s rival.Investors were earlier cheered by some positive employment news. ADP Employer Services estimated companies hired 106,000 employees in October, well above economists’ forecast gain of 58,000.Meanwhile gross domestic product rose 3.9 per cent during the third quarter, more than an expected rise of 3.1 per cent. It was the strongest quarter for growth since the economy expanded by 4.8 per cent during the first quarter of 2006.There was mixed news on the inflation front, as the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose 1.7 per cent in the third quarter after a rise of 4.3 per cent in the preceding quarter.

Although inflation concerns linger, these will likely have to take a backseat to more immediate concerns,” analysts at Credit Suisse said.Chastened by concerns about the health of the US economy, investors have continued to buy large-cap stocks which generate a large proportion of their sales overseas. McDonald’s, up 1.2 per cent at $59.18, and IBM up 0.9 per cent at $114.80, were among the biggest risers on the Dow on Monday.“Large-cap companies with higher international exposure and secular growth drivers should continue to lead [earnings per share] growth and outperform,” analysts at UBS Investment Research said.But Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, had some cautionary words.“In theory, this [strategy] takes advantage of faster economic growth outside the US, with additional translation gains from a weaker dollar,” he said. “Yet, the ‘bite’ of higher interest rates in Europe and a strong currency may be causing leading indicators to roll over across the pond, increasing the potential for 2008 earnings misses.”In earnings news, third-quarter profit at Verizon Communications declined compared with a year ago, but beat expectations. Revenues increased 5.8 per cent to $23.8bn. The stock gained 0.9 per cent at $45.99.Humana, the health insurer, reported a 90 per cent jump in quarterly earnings to $302.4m and boosted its 2007 and 2008 earnings guidance.

JPMorgan cut its rating from “overweight” to “neutral”.US crude’s new high of $93.80 a barrel lifted energy stocks. Exxon Mobil gained 1.5 per cent to $93.61 after the Supreme Court said it would hear an appeal against a demand for $2.5bn in punitive damages for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.Chevron gained 1.3 per cent at $92.88 while National Oilwell Varco rose 2.7 per cent to $74.48.However, oil prices again hit transport stocks.

34;NOV;National-Oilwell;2007-09-28T21:50:17Z;Wall St weaker amid economic data;;Wall Street was weaker on Friday amid some mixed economic data and as traders marked their report cards for the third quarter.The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1526.75. The Dow was down 0.1 per cent at 13,895.63 while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2701.50.Major indices have shown a large variance in performance over the quarter.

Apple was up 27.1 per cent over the quarter to $153.47, and Google up 8.1 per cent to $567.27.Cisco has also performed well, up 18.9 per cent to $33.13. But Microsoft, 1.6 per cent lower at $29.46, has disappointed.The S&P 500 hit a record level in mid-July, only to tumble nearly 10 per cent as credit concerns intensified in August. It rose 1.4 per cent for the quarter but is still 1.7 per cent below its mid-July record close of 1,553.08.The preference for large-caps has favoured the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 3.5 per cent on the quarter.In contrast the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks is down 4 per cent on the quarter at 805.43 – its worst performance in a year. Equity values have been hit as private equity takeovers have dried up.Four sectors – energy, information technology, industrials and materials – have consistently delivered the best returns, riding out the turmoil wrought by credit markets in August and catalysed by the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point cut in interest rates last week.Analysts say a weaker dollar – down about 5 per cent against a basket of currencies over the quarter – and stronger economic growth outside the US, mean investors are favouring large international-orientated companies in these sectors.“In the past, the financials and consumer discretionary sectors have joined the information technology sector in outperforming the market when the Fed has trimmed rates,” Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said. “But investors now also seem to be favouring other high-beta groups, such as energy and materials, which are perceived as beneficiaries of global economic growth, especially in rapidly expanding developing economies.”He added: “It is far from clear that rate cuts are helpful to these sectors, especially if they signal pending economic weakness.”Companies in the commodities sector have enjoyed rising stock values as crude oil and gold prices have soared to records. Gold rose to $750.0 an ounce, its highest level since January 1980. Crude oil futures were down $1.22 per cent at $81.66 on Friday afternoon – around 17 per cent higher on the quarter.

The S&P homebuilder index is down 37.4 per cent on the quarter to 409.52, its worst ever performance. Lennar is down 39 per cent at $22.65 while Pulte Homes is 39.7 per cent lower at $13.61.Countrywide Financial has declined 47.6 per cent to $19.01 in the last three months.

35;NOV;National-Oilwell;2007-09-06T21:17:19Z;Oil services;;Oil services is an unfailingly cyclical industry. The OSX index of leading operators is yoked to Brent crude prices: when big oil companies are flush with cash, they spend it. But there are cycles within the cycle.The next subsector primed for an upswing could be the refinery refurbishment specialists. Recent gains in the OSX – up about 45 per cent so far this year – have been driven mostly by big investments in upstream areas such as drilling and oilfield services, where US specialists such as National Oilwell Varco (up 114 per cent), Global Industries (up 86 per cent) and Smith International (up 65 per cent) have benefited. While upstream spending should stay strong, there are signs that the focus for capital expenditure is moving down the production stream to refineries. BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, among others, have indicated that they will be looking to squeeze more capacity out of existing facilities.Refinery upgrades in the US, in particular, are long overdue. Many of the country’s 149 refineries have not had heavy investment since the mid-1970s, when the oil majors upped capacity to take advantage of cheap Mexican and Venezuelan crude. Improvements since then have been largely ad hoc, replacing the odd component, or as a response to regulatory pressure to cut emissions. And as for building all-new refineries, forget it: nimbyism makes that next to impossible in Western markets.It’s a tough field, dominated by integrated engineering, procurement and construction outfits such as Bechtel, Jacobs, Foster Wheeler and Holland’s CB&I. But for the medium term, there is enough slack in the system to suggest oil services specialists with above-average exposure to refinery upgrades – among them Technip of France, the UK’s Petrofac and Wood Group, and Matrix of the US – are in a sweet spot all of their own.

Industrial products group Honeywell gained 3.4 per cent to $42.31.Coffee chain Starbucks jumped 12.8 per cent to $38.41 – its best week in six years – after it said September same-store sales had risen 6 per cent, almost double analysts’ estimates.

The National Association of Purchasing Management’s index of Chicago business hit a two-year low in May.Mr Paulsen said the stock market slide could also be a sign that investors are reassessing their stance on the euro and the European Union following France’s rejection of the EU constitution at the weekend.“There’s a bit of a flight to quality,” said Mr Paulsen. “You’ve got a run on Treasuries and the dollar and a flight from stocks, particularly cyclicals.”Cyclicals, such as materials groups and technology companies, were the biggest losers of the day as investors sold in favour of more stable assets.Apple Computer, the computer maker whose shares have risen more than 17 per cent from a low of $34.13 on May 12, fell 2 per cent to $39.76.

Wal-Mart said unusually cold spring weather and high oil prices were partly to blame for tepid sales.Target, Wal-Mart’s chief US rival, rose 1.2 per cent after it reported higher earnings. The Minnesota-based group reported earnings of 55 cents a share, slightly ahead of estimates.An undertow of economic uncertainty continued on Thursday after data showing a shrinking trade deficit pushed the leading indices modestly higher on Wednesday.Jitters over the potential impacts on hedge funds of last week’s unexpected moves in the share and bond prices of General Motors and Ford, the struggling US automakers, led stocks to fall sharply on Tuesday. On Thursday, a report showed that the number of people filing for initial unemployment benefits rose last week.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the lack of direction in the stock market was surprising given the generally upbeat tone of economic and corporate news this earnings season. “This is still a market that is looking for what can go wrong rather than what’s going to go right,” he said.Walt Disney, the entertainment group, rose 0.3 per cent to $26.75 after it reported profits up 30 per cent for the quarter, driven by strong DVD sales.Shares in UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, edged 1 per cent to $1.00 a day after the company reported a $1.1bn quarterly loss.

Delta Air Lines rose 1.1 per cent while AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 0.8 per cent. Investors were keeping a close eye on developments at United, the bankrupt US carrier. A court earlier this week relieved United’s parent, UAL, of billions of dollars in pension obligations.
