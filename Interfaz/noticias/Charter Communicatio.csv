They spent $56.9bn in 2018, compared with $57.1bn the previous year and $56.1bn in 2016.The findings call into question one of the main arguments the industry used in its successful campaign to have the Federal Communications Commission overturn the Obama-era net neutrality regulations — a move that sparked anger among internet companies, activists and Democratic politicians. “Despite enormous tax benefits from the GOP tax scam [the tax cuts enacted by President Donald Trump], and the elimination of net neutrality rules, many of the largest ISPs invested less in broadband than in previous years,” Frank Pallone, the Democratic chairman of the House commerce committee, said on Thursday.House Democrats are keen to make this a big issue over the next two years, to support their claims that Mr Trump’s deregulation drive has hurt consumers. In a congressional hearing on Thursday, Tom Wheeler, the former chairman of the FCC, criticised the abolition of the net neutrality protections, saying: “No matter how technology develops, the essential networks must be open, just and reasonable.”Companies such as AT&T and Verizon had argued for years against net neutrality rules that forced them to treat all internet traffic equally. The companies said that without such restrictions, they would be able to charge companies more for delivering their internet traffic faster, bringing in money they could use to invest in their networks.In late 2017 Ajit Pai, the Trump-appointed FCC chairman, announced his organisation would repeal the rules, in one of the most significant pieces of deregulation undertaken by the Trump administration.Mr Pai said at the time the previous rules had “depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation”.[Net neutrality rules] depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovationHowever, the 2018 figures suggest that the change has not led to an immediate investment boom. Following the introduction of the net neutrality rules in 2015, the big four telecoms companies increased overall capital spending in both 2016 and 2017. Last year, however, investment slipped by 0.4 per cent.AT&T and Verizon, the biggest two telecoms companies in terms of customer numbers, both spent less on capital projects in 2018 than in 2017. AT&T’s investment slipped from $21.6bn to $21.3bn, while Verizon’s fell from $17.2bn to $16.7bn. Verizon said its capital spending reduction was “due to the availability of 5G equipment and the company’s more efficient capital management processes”.Comcast, which said in 2017 it would invest “well in excess” of $50bn over the next five years as a result of both the Trump tax cuts and the net neutrality changes, made $9.8bn in capital spending last year, adjusting for its acquisition of British broadcaster Sky. This was up very slightly from the $9.6bn it spent in 2017. The company’s spending just on networks increased a more sizeable 8 per cent, however.One company that did increase capital spending significantly was Sprint, which is smaller than its largest four rivals. It raised capital investment in its networks from $2.5bn in 2017 to $3.8bn last year. The company told the Financial Times that the rise “has nothing to do with net neutrality” and was instead based on a longer-term plan to invest in its networks, including a 5G mobile network.There is little expectation that capital spending will rise dramatically in 2019.Craig Moffett, a telecoms analyst and founding partner at MoffettNathanson, said: “You have to ask whether any sane person would make long-term investments based on a change in FCC policy, especially one that is subject to so much legal and political volatility.”Mr Moffett estimates the industry will increase its capital spending by 3.3 per cent this year, something he called “relatively restrained” given the favourable tax and regulatory regime the Trump administration has tried to put in place.US Telecom, the telecoms industry body, argued the effects of the FCC’s changes would be felt in the longer term. A spokesperson said: “The question is not what happens to broadband investment from one period to the next, but what long-term investment would look like under a different regulatory regime.”The FCC also defended the deregulation in a statement. “Fibre (fibreoptic internet) was made available to more new homes in 2018 than any year ever, and fixed broadband speeds increased by over 35 per cent — meaning more and more Americans are getting access to high-speed broadband. “The commission’s policies are working,” it added.The capital spending figures will add weight to the claims of internet companies such as Google and Facebook, which argued vociferously against dropping the net neutrality protections. The web browser company Mozilla has been leading a legal case against the FCC’s decision, the hearings for which began in Washington this month.Meanwhile, Democratic politicians are also keen to push the issue. Mike Doyle, a Democratic representative and member of the House commerce committee, recently told an industry conference that the repeal of the net neutrality rules had been a “massive, well-funded attack on our democratic process”, and should be investigated.
1;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2018-07-31T15:26:27Z;Charter Communications surfs higher on subscriber gains;;Shares of Charter Communications, the second-largest US cable company, are headed for their biggest one-day gain since 2017 after it signed up more internet subscribers than analysts had expected in the second quarter.The Connecticut-based company’s shares were up about 5.5 per cent to $310.14, putting them on track for their best percentage advance since July 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data.The move higher comes after a solid set of results released earlier on Tuesday for the three months to June 30. During the quarter, Charter added 218,000 internet subscribers, about 5 per cent less than the same quarter last year but comfortably above the 185,000 analysts surveyed by Factset had expected.Charter also lost 73,000 video subscribers — as more consumers opt to cut the cord in favour of streaming content — which is a nearly 20 per cent improvement year-on-year and better than the 108,000 subscriber loss that had been forecast.Financial results were also better than analysts’ predictions, with revenue rising 4.8 per cent year-on-year to $10.9bn, and net income attributable to shareholders coming in at $273m, or $1.15 per diluted share. Analysts had been looking for revenue of $10.83bn and earnings per share of 99 cents, according to estimates collated byThomson Reuters.The results helped put Charter to among the top gainers on the S&P 500 on Tuesday morning, giving it a welcome boost as it and rivals try to adjust to the rise of the likes of Netflix and other streaming-content services that bypass traditional cable video providers.After gaining 16.7 per cent last year, Charter shares are down 7.36 per cent so far in 2018.
2;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2018-02-02T13:31:54Z;Charter profits surge on $9.3bn US tax gain;;Growth in video and internet subscribers lifted fourth-quarter revenue at Charter Communications, the US’s second-largest cable operator, which also reported a big profit boost from US tax cuts.Net income attributable to Charter shareholders surged to $9.6bn, or $34.56 a share, from $454m, or $1.67 a share, in the same quarter a year ago, thanks to a $9.3bn benefit from the recent US tax overhaul.Revenue rose 3.2 per cent to $10.6bn, in line with Wall Street’s expectations, as growth in residential and commercial sales offset a drop in advertising revenue in a non-election year.In the quarter, Charter added 2,000 residential pay-television subscribers, compared with a 91,000 drop a year ago. Overall video revenue rose 3 per cent to $4.2bn.The company added 263,000 residential internet customers, down from 303,000 in 2017, and internet revenue increased 9.8 per cent to $3.6bn.Charter added 22,000 residential voice subscribers, but voice revenue fell 18 per cent to $587m as pricing pressures offset customer growth.
3;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2017-11-22T18:55:57Z;Partisan passions cloud debate on US net neutrality;Broadband and media markets remain resilient even as FCC moves to scrap 2015 regulations;For an issue that provokes such strong partisan support in Washington and competitive rivalry in the tech, media and communications industries, it is remarkably hard to trace the real-world effects of net neutrality.The arcane rules of network management — how broadband companies handle different types of traffic on their networks — have always been impenetrable to non-engineers. Add in the passions stirred up by grass roots campaigns in Silicon Valley and beyond, the reality has been hard to separate from the ideologically opposed positions.“It’s a wildly popular topic — it has always generated millions of comments,” says Chris Lewis, vice-president of Public Knowledge, one of the advocacy groups that has pushed for rules they say are needed to make sure the internet remains “open”.After the latest outpouring, the Federal Communications Commission moved a step closer this week to a decisive action, with a promise to scrap neutrality regulations that were set in 2015. That would free US broadband companies to favour some bits that flow through their networks over others, provided they are open about their practices and do not breach antitrust rules.More than 22m submissions poured into the agency during a public comment period on the proposal this year. But many, it turns out, were faked.According to FCC officials, some 7.5m comments came in the same standard letter, sent from just 45,000 email addresses. Most of these were anonymised, having been processed through a website called fakemailgenerator.com.In response, the FCC said it had disregarded the tidal wave of submissions, both fake and real, and made “quality rather than quantity” its yardstick.That brought complaints from opponents, who saw this as a convenient way for the agency to disregard a wave of public opposition. Organisations like Public Knowledge have been part of highly successful grassroots campaigns in the past to generate support for neutrality, raising suggestions that the fake comments were designed to neutralise a groundswell of real opposition to the FCC.Eric Schneiderman, New York’s Democratic attorney-general, appeared to hold the same suspicion this week, complaining that his own attempt to get to the bottom of the issue had been blocked by the Republican-controlled FCC. A spokesman for Mr Schneiderman said the fake comments tended to support the FCC’s position.Brushing aside the weight of public commentary, the FCC said it had narrowed in on what it considered the real issue: that the neutrality rules, by preventing network companies from charging for different levels of services, had discouraged investment in broadband networks. According to officials, at least one big cable company, Charter, had scrapped a plan for a new wireless network purely because of net neutrality rules.However, its detailed analysis of the decision, released on Wednesday, provided only slight support for this position. Broadband investment “appears to have declined in 2015”, when neutrality rules were adopted, it said, before falling just 3 per cent the next year.Officials also said that forcing companies to treat all bits flowing over their networks equally had held back innovation. As one example, they said that data flowing in real time to autonomous vehicles will require greater reliability than movies on Netflix.According to critics, allowing companies to charge more for different levels of service like this — setting up what critics call “internet fast lanes” — would lead to an inevitable deterioration for anyone not able to pay the toll. And while rich companies like Netflix and Google might not be affected, new internet upstarts would be hampered. Etsy, the website for craft goods that has been one of the strongest opponents of the FCC’s position, summed up the opposition this week: “Strong net neutrality rules are necessary to preserve an even playing field online, democratising entrepreneurship and allowing internet-enabled microbusinesses from nearly every county across the US to thrive.”The almost theological certainty on both sides, however, is belied by the reaction of Wall Street, which seems to have concluded that the outcome of the net neutrality wars will have little impact on real-world broadband and media markets.In the past three years, the regulatory climate in Washington has swung between extremes — from a court throwing out FCC-backed neutrality rules, to the imposition of a far more stringent set of regulations, and back to a laissez-faire approach. But in that time, the share prices of cable, telecoms and media companies have barely reacted to this whipsawing.The Brookings Institution mapped share prices in the sector against regulatory actions, concluding that only the three big cable companies at the time — Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter — were affected by President Barack Obama’s 2014 promise to regulate the sector more stringently. But telecoms companies were unaffected, leading the researchers to suggest that it was worry about a bar on more consolidation in the cable sector, rather than net neutrality rules themselves, that had unnerved investors.Meanwhile, shares in Netflix, which is often held up as the company most directly at risk from the end of net neutrality, have been on a tear since last year’s presidential election. Netflix agreed to pay Comcast higher traffic costs three years ago. The companies last year buried the hatchet completely, with a deal to make the streaming movie service available directly over Comcast’s set top boxes. Partisan passions aside, that suggests the effects of the FCC’s latest action may be less dramatic than widely expected.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in Washington
4;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2017-11-16T16:20:46Z;Viacom shares slide after warning on fee income;US distributors are paying less for its channels, which include MTV and Nickelodeon;Viacom shares fell as much as 9 per cent on Thursday morning after the owner of MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount warned of a drop in fees from the cable companies and satellite TV providers that pay to carry its channels.Concerns over affiliate fees, which have become a staple revenue source for US TV network owners at a time when advertising is under pressure, dominated an otherwise mixed set of third-quarter earnings for Viacom.Bob Bakish, chief executive, told analysts on a conference call that the company expected affiliate fees from US distributors to decline in the high-single digit percentage range in the first half of 2018 and by mid-single digits for the full year.The company was seeing steeper cable subscriber declines than the industry average of 3.5 per cent because Charter Communications, the US’s second-largest cable provider, moved Viacom’s channels to its higher-priced subscription tiers earlier this year, he said.Viacom struck a renewal deal with Charter this week that will move its networks back to the cable distributor’s most popular basic tier, but Mr Bakish said the impact from the earlier move would continue to be felt in the fourth quarter and beginning of 2018.*Mr Bakish has focused on improving relationships with distributors as part of a sweeping restructuring plan that aims to to stem the loss of audiences and advertisers from Viacom’s networks.“In the past year, deals representing nearly 50 per cent of our subscriber base have been renewed or extended, and we now have no significant renewals until well into 2019,” he said.Viacom shares had been trading higher immediately after the earnings release, but the comments on affiliate fees sent them down sharply.Overall revenues grew 3 per cent from a year ago to $3.32bn, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $3.23bn, boosted by overseas advertising and filmed entertainment.Revenues at the Paramount film studio rose 2 per cent to $789m, driven by growth in licensing revenues and partially offset by lower revenues from cinema screenings, which faced a difficult comparison following the strength of Star Trek Beyond in the the quarter the year before.Advertising revenues rose 6 per cent to $1.22bn. Ad sales were flat in the US at $936m but rose 36 per cent overseas driven by the acquisition of Telefe, the Argentine television station, and growth in Europe.Domestic affiliate revenues fell 3 per cent to $948m, worse than the 1.8 per cent drop analysts had expected, as a decline in cable subscribers and lower sales from streaming video subscriptions dragged on results. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom rose to $674m, or $1.67 a share, in the three months ended in September, compared with $252m, or 63 cents a share, in the year-ago period. That reflected a gain on an asset sale and a restructuring charge in the quarter the year before.Adjusting for one-time items, the company reported earnings of 77 cents a share, shy of analysts’ estimates of 86 cents. The miss reflected a $59m charge related to Paramount’s scrapping of a $1bn three-year film financing deal with China’s Huahua Media, disclosed last week.* An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated how long the impact of the Charter move would be felt. It has been amended.

6;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Trump and jobs: the tweets and the facts;The results have not always matched the president’s rhetoric on corporate investment;Donald Trump became US president by promising to create American jobs, and his political future could depend on whether his base thinks he succeeded in doing so. However, an analysis of the new jobs he has tweeted about since his election show that most were already in the works long before he became president, and many companies merely repackaged earlier announcements.Mr Trump has used his bully pulpit to berate US and overseas corporations that build factories in Mexico, often threatening them with punitive tariffs unless they hire more American workers. He has used Twitter as a potent tool in that battle. But there has often been a gap between the rhetoric of his tweets and the reality of job creation since his election victory.In July, the US economy added 209,000 jobs, with unemployment sliding to 4.3 per cent from 4.4 per cent in June, to match a 16-year low struck in May. Mr Trump took credit on Twitter, saying “Excellent Jobs Numbers just released — and I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!”Economists say the average job creation numbers since he was inaugurated are about the same as those for last year, before he took office.His supporters appear to believe he is responsible for rising job numbers, however. A recent Rasmussen Reports poll found that 73 per cent of Republicans rate Mr Trump’s handling of job creation as good or excellent.Political experts say that perception was as important as reality in Mr Trump’s victory last November, and the same could be true if he decides to run again in 2020: he may successfully claim credit for creating jobs, even if he — like most presidents — has little true impact on the number.Many autoworkers — whose defection from the Democratic party to vote for Trump was a major factor in giving him a win in crucial swing states last November — continue to support him. But jobs in auto manufacturing were 7 per cent lower last month than a year ago, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.“President Trump has taken credit for creating jobs in the auto industry. However, many of the job announcements made by automakers and their suppliers have been in the works for some time. And it is unlikely we will see a gain in auto jobs right now” with US vehicle sales this year expected to fall for the first time since the global financial crisis, says Michelle Krebs of Autotrader.com.Donald Trump praised Merck in July when the drugmaker said it would invest $4bn to create as many as 4,000 jobs, along with Pfizer and Corning. But less than a month later, Mr Trump returned to the Twittersphere to attack Merck for shipping jobs overseas.The only thing that changed in the meantime was that chief executive Kenneth Frazier quit the president’s manufacturing council in protest at Mr Trump’s failure to distance himself from white supremacist violence. Mr Frazier’s departure triggered an exodus of CEOs that forced Mr Trump to disband two advisory councils and led to a breach between the White House and business.Shortly before he took office, Mr Trump threatened Toyota with tariffs over its plans to build a new factory in Mexico. Eight months later, Toyota said it would build a $1.6bn new US plant with Mazda, creating 4,000 new jobs.Toyota said the decision was “not related” to the tweeted presidential threat and the new plant had been under consideration for some time. Corolla production, previously planned for Mexico, will be shifted to the new US joint venture plant.Wisconsin has had to offer Foxconn up to $3bn in state aid to build the plant, which would initially involve only 3,000 jobs. And the Taiwanese electronics supplier has a history of failing to follow through with similar investment promises, including a $30m plant announced in 2013 for Pennsylvania.Foxconn says that plant fell through because state incentives were inadequate. Mr Trump helped steer the $10bn pledge in Wisconsin, to an area that could be pivotal to his re-election campaign in 2020. So he has a lot riding on this one.Mr Trump relentlessly attacked Ford from the stump for producing cars in Mexico instead of the US. So he was triumphant when the Detroit carmaker cancelled construction of a $1.6bn Mexican plant in January, saying it would create 700 new jobs in the US.In March the company said it would invest $1.2bn in three Michigan plants, creating a further 130 new jobs. But Ford said it scrapped the Mexico plant due to a slump in demand for the small cars built there, and the jobs announced in March were part of a 2015 deal with the UAW. Ford later announced it was cutting 1,400 salaried jobs in North America and Asia and said it would move production of the Ford Focus, from Mexico to China — not the US.Overall, jobs in the US automotive manufacturing sector were 7 per cent lower six months after Mr Trump took office, than six months before, according to seasonally adjusted figures from BLS statistics.The 20,000 jobs are not new: Charter’s chief executive Tom Rutledge said in 2015 that the company would hire 20,000 more workers if its merger with Time Warner Cable and acquisition of Bright House Networks went through.Charter now says that though it had mentioned adding these jobs before, it has now made a firm commitment to do so within four years. Charter’s commitment to invest $25bn in broadband infrastructure and technology was new.The jobs are part of an Exxon project called Growing the Gulf, launched in 2013. It was not clear how many of those 45,000 jobs had already been planned or created before Mr Trump became president.The new computer chip factory that Trump celebrated in his February tweet will create about 3,000 jobs at its peak and will support more than 10,000 related jobs. But Intel had previously announced a $5bn investment in the same factory with former President Barack Obama in 2011.The chipmaker says the $7bn investment will come on top of money already spent building the plant — but it will not say how much of the original $5bn commitment was already spent. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich was one of the first CEOs to jump ship from Mr Trump’s manufacturing council.Just before Mr Trump’s inauguration, Walmart said it would add 10,000 jobs in the US this year, but these were already in the works before the election. General Motors said in January that it would invest at least $1bn in US factories, and create or retain about 7,000 jobs.The company said the plans “had been in the works for some time” though, and denied any link with Mr Trump. Before Trump’s business advisory council was disbanded, GM chief executive Mary Barra said she would remain on the council as other CEOs were announcing their resignation.Shortly before the inauguration, Amazon loudly announced plans to create more than 100,000 US jobs within 18 months — an unusual move for a secretive company. Mr Trump claimed credit for playing a role in that decision, through his press secretary.However closer inspection shows that Amazon’s planned hiring in the US, which will mostly be warehouse jobs, is in line with its global headcount growth — and not a departure from the trend. Last year Amazon’s headcount grew more than 40 per cent. These were jobs that, most likely, would have been added anyway. But despite that, Mr Trump is now attacking Amazon for hurting employment in traditional retailers.The investment was part of a previously announced plan. Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat Chrysler, said the decision had nothing to do with Mr Trump. “I wish I could give him credit for this,” Mr Marchionne said: “But the thinking was in place beforehand.” FCA said the investment would lead to creation of 3.700 new jobs by 2020 — but that has nothing to do with Mr Trump.SoftBank’s promise of $50bn of investment and 50,000 jobs stemmed from a decision made before the election. SoftBank had already announced a $100bn global technology investment fund, and directing half of that to the US was not a surprise.Most of the money will go into buying existing businesses, raising a question about how many of the jobs will be new ones — though SoftBank has already announced one investment in Florida with a promise to create 3,000 positions.The first time President-elect Trump claimed to have saved or boosted American jobs was when, shortly after his election victory, he claimed to have saved 1,100 jobs at Carrier in Indiana that were due to move to Mexico. In fact, only 800 of those jobs were scheduled to move, Carrier said.Additional reporting by Richard Waters and Leslie Hook in San Francisco and Ed Crooks, Shannon Bond, Anna Nicolaou, and David Crow in New York
7;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2017-08-10T18:51:11Z;Drahi stretches cable ambitions to limit with Charter interest;Billionaire’s Altice is lining up bid it may struggle to fund for US cable operator;Patrick Drahi was running a small French cable company in 1999 when his business came to the attention of John Malone, the world’s most famous cable industry investor, who was in the process of gobbling up European assets.Mr Malone acquired Mr Drahi’s business that year, bringing on the Franco-Israeli upstart as an executive at UPC — now part of Liberty Global — where the entrepreneur got a first-hand glimpse of the wrangling methods and manoeuvres that earned the American mogul the nickname of “cable cowboy”.Little could Mr Malone have known at the time that, less than two decades later, Mr Drahi would be constantly nipping at his mentor’s heels in his own backyard, to climb the ranks of the most influential cable owners in the US.Mr Drahi’s Altice, the sprawling global telecoms group that has turned him into a billionaire, is lining up a bid that would be worth more than $185bn, including $62.5bn in debt, to acquire Charter Communications, the second-biggest US cable provider, where Mr Malone is the largest shareholder with nearly 21 per cent.Altice’s desire to buy Charter is a response to technological and consumer changes that are forcing the leading US telecoms and media companies to consider consolidation, in order to stay ahead in the race to offer internet, television and online video.Altice, which had focused mainly on Europe, moved into the US by acquiring a pair of regional US cable companies over the past two years. The group remains a sub-scale rival to Comcast and Charter, having lost out to the latter in the $78.7bn battle for Time Warner Cable in 2015.Charter’s emergence as a provider that can reach 26m customers across 41 states has made it an attractive target for wireless companies Verizon and Sprint, which is controlled by Japan’s SoftBank and whose billionaire founder Masayoshi Son is eager to consolidate US telecoms.Missing out on the Charter deal is an opportunity that Altice cannot afford, according to bankers and analysts, leaving the company with little room to acquire new customers in the US, where there are few alternative prospects.“It would be a big mistake to underestimate Drahi’s determination to carry out a deal,” said one person who worked closely with Altice on its previous dealmaking. “He didn’t expect SoftBank to go after a Charter merger, but once that [news] came out Altice had to work on a counter proposal.”The Altice plan is not without serious complications, testing to what extent Mr Drahi has truly mastered the complex financing structures that Mr Malone has utilised to fuel his expansion.Charter is now valued at $122bn after its shares climbed nearly 20 per cent in the past month on speculation. Adding in net debt, the company has an enterprise value of about $185bn, which Altice would presumably need to top with any offer.In comparison, Altice’s Dutch-listed parent company is worth just €31bn, even though it holds controlling stakes in a number of subsidiaries, including two listed vehicles: Altice USA and France’s SFR Group. The Altice Group has around €50bn of debt overall, split across these already highly leveraged funding entities, or “silos” as the company dubs them.The strategy has worked so far, allowing the group to expand in places including France, Israel, Portugal and most recently the US. It is a model cribbed directly from Mr Malone’s Liberty Global, and Altice’s chief financial officer was even brought over from Liberty to mimic the model.Multiple bankers told the FT that they had questioned Mr Drahi’s ability to fund a bid for Charter. “The guys at Altice are brilliant financial engineers but this one would be a stretch to complete,” said one adviser not directly involved in the bid planning.Others expressed scepticism at the high-yield bond market’s capacity to fund such a large acquisition, given Charter’s size. “It seems very big,” said one senior corporate finance banker. “The Verizon deal was $50bn and that was investment grade,” referring to the largest corporate bond that was used to back a deal for Verizon to buy full control of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone.Even if Altice can find a structure to fund a bid, another obstacle will be winning over Mr Malone, who is known for a stark preference for tax-efficient proposals to gain his backing. Greg Maffei, one of Mr Malone’s lieutenants and chief executive of Liberty Media, seemingly poured cold water on hopes that Charter would be open to accepting a deal that included a large portion in shares.He said: “The idea that we would take equities that we don’t want is probably unlikely. A lot of it seems like levering up Charter, and if we want to lever up Charter, we have that opportunity, so any deal that would be appealing for us and other Charter shareholders I think would have to add real value and show real capabilities that are beyond what we think is a very well-positioned company.”Moreover, Charter chief executive Tom Rutledge has a large chunk of stock options that vest if the company’s stock reaches $564 a share, a steep premium to the $400 level where it currently sits.Track trends in tech, media and telecomsBut this would not be the first time Mr Drahi has defied the odds. When Altice first entered the US market with pricey deals for regional groups, incumbents saw him as an unknown quantity, whose plan to slash costs rapidly could disrupt the market by damaging service levels.“Drahi’s modus operandi is to go into a duopoly market and run lean,” said Paul Moran, head of research at Northern Trust Securities.“Their experience in the US has given them confidence. Larger cable companies face the same challenges and they can apply their formula to a bigger footprint, which ultimately would make more money. That’s what motivates billionaires after all.”By Arash Massoudi, James Fontanella-Khan, Robert Smith, Shannon Bond, Nic Fildes and Harriet AgnewCharter Communications’ rise from regional operator to the US’s second-largest provider of cable and broadband dates back to 1998, when Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen paid $4.5bn including debt for the company, which had been founded five years earlier in St Louis, writes Shannon Bond.At the time, Mr Allen was rolling up a number of cable and media assets in what he called his “Wired World” strategy. Charter quickly made 10 acquisitions of smaller cable companies and, in November 1999, listed on the Nasdaq. However, it took on heavy debt to fund its deals and was unable to turn a profit as a public company.Charter filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, eliminating $8bn of its $21bn debt load. In its reorganisation, private equity firms Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners took control by swapping debt for equity.John Malone entered the picture in 2013 when his Liberty Media bought out Apollo and most of the other private equity stakes to become the largest shareholder.Charter has since followed Mr Malone’s acquisition playbook, edging out Altice in the race to buy Time Warner Cable in 2015. The deal was a typically complex, tax-driven structure that saw Charter take over not only Time Warner Cable, but also Bright House, a smaller operator, and transforming Charter overnight into a legitimate rival to Comcast.Charter now serves about 26m subscribers in big markets including New York and Los Angeles, and has been eyeing a move into the wireless business as it looks to build new revenue streams to offset declining appetite for cable television.Analysts say that for companies looking to expand in cable in the US, there are few other promising deal partners with significant scale. The third-largest provider, Cox Communications, is privately held. Comcast, with a market cap near $200bn, is simply too large.Among the companies tipped to participate in the newest round of industry consolidation, “Charter has the brightest fundamentals and M&A prospects”, wrote Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Capital, this week.
8;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

Altice, a product of several global acquisitions, is contemplating its most audacious takeover yet: Charter Communications, the US cable and broadband internet juggernaut cobbled together by the “cable cowboy” himself, John Malone.Altice boss Patrick Drahi has been depicted as a Malone acolyte, carefully assembling his own stable of pay-TV assets. What exactly a combination between the two would look like is debatable. Altice’s enterprise value of €88bn is a little more than half Charter’s, even before accounting for any acquisition premium.Altice’s previous buying spree has also created a heavy debt load. Even as it has delivered, its gearing remains a constraint. Total debt is more than five times larger than earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. Altice, to its credit, has not yet crumbled under the weight. Quite the contrary, it has delivered much of the cost savings and operational improvements it had pledged, particularly at its listed unit in the US that represents the $30bn of acquisitions of Suddenlink and Cablevision.The financial wizards can make the numbers work. Debt remains cheap, the big banks are happy to lend and the equity markets just keep rising. Yet it is not clear why Charter would choose to go to the trouble of joining forces with Altice. Charter shares are up more than 10 times in the past five years and there are endless other possible partners (just last week it brushed off a preliminary offer from Sprint and SoftBank to the irritation of SoftBank patron Masayoshi Son). It knows that it is a kingmaker in the convergence between wireless, broadband and pay-TV. There is no need to rush into a tie-up.Altice is an also-ran in pay TV and wireless. In the US it lags well behind Comcast, Charter, AT&T and Verizon in scale. It needs to strike first to catch up. In the consolidated US pay-TV industry, competition for remaining quality targets will be intense. Mr Drahi should hitch his wagon to more than one possible deal to increase his chances of success in the impending land rush.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox?

10;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2017-08-09T19:31:06Z;Altice lines up $185bn pitch for cable group Charter;Acquisitive European group could be set for latest round of US media consolidation;Altice, the deal-hungry cable and telecoms group controlled by Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, is lining up a potential $185bn bid for Charter Communications, the second-largest US cable company with over 26m subscribers.Interest in a deal by Mr Drahi’s Altice, which has grown ferociously through debt-laden acquisitions in recent years in France, Portugal and the US, is the latest in a series of consolidation moves among US telecom, cable and media providers.It pits Mr Drahi against SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son in a battle for the hand of Charter, in which John Malone, the billionaire so-called cable cowboy, owns a 21 per cent stake.Altice has not formally made an approach and may not proceed, according to multiple people close to the Netherlands-listed group. One complication will be whether the group and its advisers can amass the huge amount of debt financing needed to support a bid for its much larger rival.These people also cautioned that Charter, which beat out Altice in a battle to acquire Time Warner Cable in a $78.7bn deal that closed just last year, has not expressed interest in a possible combination.Charter shares rose 2.9 per cent to close at $400.90 in New York, giving it a market value of roughly $121bn. The company has net debt of $62.5bn, meaning a deal including debt could easily surpass an enterprise value of more than $185bn.Altice only recently listed its US cable subsidiary in New York to position itself for more dealmaking in America, but has managed to win support from shareholders thanks to the speed with which it has delivered operational improvement at Cablevision and Suddenlink. It acquired those regional operators for $17.7bn and $9.1bn in the past two years and then bundled them into Altice USA.Shares in Altice USA, which has a market value $23bn and a net debt of $22.6bn, were flat following the news of a potential bid, which was first reported by CNBC. However, shares in its parent company Altice NV dropped 5.2 per cent to €19.65 in Amsterdam trading.Charter has emerged as an attractive target for smaller US telecoms and cable providers because of its footprint, which extends to 41 states and puts its behind only Comcast for subscribers. Earlier this year Charter and Verizon, the largest US wireless telecoms operator, explored a potential combination but the two companies decided not to pursue a deal.Shares in the company have leapt in recent weeks as it has become the focal point of interest, particularly from Japan’s SoftBank, which is searching for a partner to connect with Sprint, the fourth-largest US mobile phone operator which it controls.Charter has been cool on interest from Mr Son, the billionaire founder behind SoftBank, saying it had no interest in acquiring Sprint. However, it has not commented on potential takeover interest from either SoftBank or Altice.Analysts said that Mr Malone is another factor in a potential takeover attempt of Charter. Mr Malone is the largest shareholder in Charter and has significant sway over the industry given his range of holdings that span US and international cable and media.Greg Maffei, chief executive of Mr Malone’s Liberty Media, through which he holds a stake in Charter, said on Wednesday that Liberty and Charter would “listen to all and any offers that come in and judge them on their merit and appeal”.However, he said: “The idea that we would take equity that we don’t want is probably unlikely . . . Any deal that would be appealing for us and other Charter shareholders would have to add real value and show real capabilities that are beyond what we think is a very well-positioned company with a very strong management team.”Dexter Goei, a former Morgan Stanley banker and the chief executive of Altice USA, has not been shy about the French group’s ambition to grow its US footprint through acquisitions.At the time of the listing of Altice USA in June, Mr Goei said that the IPO was “all about being ready if there is an opportunity to partner up with someone . . . to put ourselves on the map and to have a currency” for future acquisitions.Charter and Altice have both expanded by rolling up regional operators. Other distributors are looking to gain control of content. AT&T’s $84.5bn bid for Time Warner, the owner of HBO and Warner Bros, is being reviewed by regulators and is expected to close at the end of the year, creating the world’s largest vertically integrated content and distribution company. Verizon has snapped up Yahoo and AOL.
11;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2017-08-01T12:00:12Z;Sprint posts first quarterly profit in three years;;Sprint posted a quarterly profit for the first time in three years as it cut costs amid escalating competition in the US wireless phone business.The company swung to net income of $206m, or 5 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter, from a net loss of $302m, or 8 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 1.8 per cent to $8.16m.Analysts expected a loss of 1 cents a share on revenue of $8.14bn, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Shares rose more than 3 per cent in pre-market trading in New York.Sprint, controlled by Softbank, the telecoms empire of Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, trimmed $370m in costs from a year ago, for a total of nearly $4bn in the last nine quarters. It is targeting an additional $1.3bn to $1.5bn in cost reductions this fiscal year.The company lost a net 39,000 “postpaid” subscribers, viewed as the most lucrative customers. That moderated from the 118,000 loss in the first quarter.“This represents the progress of a turnaround journey that has delivered improvements in postpaid phone and prepaid customer growth, a return to top-line growth, and a significantly transformed cost structure,” said Marcelo Claure, Sprint chief executive.Wireless providers have been stepping up competition for customers. In June, Sprint rolled out a promotion offering a free year of unlimited data to customers who switched from Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile.Mr Son has been trying to come up with various ways to consolidate the US telecoms and cable market via Sprint. Among the options he has tried is to propose a combination with Charter Communications, the US’s second-largest cable provider, whereby SoftBank would be become the largest shareholder.However, Charter has said it is not interested in such a deal. This week news reports linked SoftBank to plans for a potential bid for Charter, which has a market cap of $120bn.
12;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2017-07-31T13:27:52Z;Charter rallies on report Softbank plots takeover offer;;Charter Communications shares raced higher on Monday after a report that Japan’s Softbank was considering an offer to buy the US cable and internet provider.Softbank, the Japanese tech to telecoms conglomerate, could make an offer to buy Stamford, Connecticut-based Charter as early as this week, Bloomberg reported.The pact for Charter, which had a market value of $101bn as of the close of trading on Friday, would dramatically alter the telecoms and cable landscape in the US and deepen Softbank chief Masayoshi Son’s foray into the American market. Softbank already controls almost 85 per cent Sprint, a $32bn mobile carrier.A combination with Sprint would create an industry heavyweight that could offer wireless and land-line services across the US. The group would also compete more vigorously with AT&T and Verizon Communication.Softbank had already floated the prospect of Charter buying Sprint, but Mr Son was denied. “We understand why a deal is attractive for Softbank, but Charter has no interest in acquiring Sprint,” said a Charter spokesperson. The spokesperson added that Charter already intends to “launch wireless services to cable customers next year.”Charter shares zoomed higher by 6.2 per cent in pre-market trading in New York, while Sprint was little changed. Softbank slipped 2.3 per cent in Tokyo trading.
13;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2017-07-27T19:21:44Z;US cable TV: discordant;Mid-tier network companies need to find a survival strategy;Look no further than Thursday’s strong results at Charter Communications and Comcast Corp to understand why the Scripps family might feel threatened and want out. The pay TV network business the family controls, Scripps Networks Interactive, supplies them with such lifestyle stations as the Food Network and HGTV. A bidding war for Scripps is reaching its climax with rival Discovery Communications close to prevailing over Viacom.For years, Scripps and Discovery could bully cable groups such as Charter and Comcast into paying more and more to carry shows such as Cupcake Wars. But Americans are happy to watch their programmes on mobile devices. It is increasingly profitable for distributors to facilitate that shift.Collectively, Charter and Comcast shed nearly 150,000 residential video subscribers in the past quarter. No matter, revenues at the pair jumped 4 and 10 per cent, respectively. Revenues at Comcast’s film studio division, including NBCUniversal, rose nearly a fifth following the latest in its interminable Fast and Furious series.Both companies are prospering from the demand for high-speed internet for which they are steadily increasing prices. And the slate for internet customers has a lot of blanks. Charter has noted that it “passes” 50m households but so far only 26m are subscribing to Charter’s service. Comcast said on Thursday that its penetration is just 45 per cent.With the minds of distributors focused on selling broadband, the mid-tier network groups like Scripps, Discovery, Viacom and AMC Networks need to join forces quickly. One survival strategy would be to create a so-called skinny bundle of 20 or less channels, without sports, that can be subscribed to over broadband.Scripps, by selling first, looks like it will get at least a 30 per cent premium. More importantly, it leaves the tricky job of figuring out how the broadband-first world works to others.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

14;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2017-07-27T12:53:26Z;Charter profits slump as cable subscribers cut cord;;Charter Communications reported a slide in net income in the second quarter, missing Wall Street’s estimates.The US’s second-largest cable operator acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in May 2016. On a pro forma basis, as if the acquisitions had been fully included in the year-ago quarter, net income fell 44 per cent to $139m, or 52 cents a share, from $248m, or 91 cents a share, a year ago.Revenue rose 3.9 per cent on a pro forma basis to $10.36bn, boosted by growth in subscribers to Charter’s internet service.Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 76 cents on $10.38bn in revenue, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.The company said the drop in net income was the result of a pension curtailment gain in the year-ago quarter and an increase in depreciation and amortization this year.In the quarter, Charter shed 90,000 residential pay-television subscribers, compared with a 152,000 drop a year ago. Video revenue was flat from a year ago at $4.1bn.The company added 231,000 residential internet customers and internet revenue rose 12.1 per cent to $3.5bn on a pro forma basis.Charter added 14,000 residential voice subscribers, but voice revenue fell 10.9 per cent to $650m due to aggressive promotions and “value-based pricing”.The second quarter is typically weak for pay-TV providers, due to seasonal factors like college students leaving campus and “snowbirds” moving to their summer homes. But this year may be be particularly tough as viewers have more options from new, cheaper online TV services such as Dish’s Sling TV, Sony’s PlayStation Vue and Google’s YouTube TV. Analysts estimate that US pay-TV providers may have lost more than 1m subscribers in total, up from 800,000 in the first quarter.Comcast said on Thursday it lost 34,000 video subscribers in the second quarter, up from 4,000 a year ago.Earlier this week, AT&T posted a record loss of 351,000 traditional video customers in the quarter, which was only somewhat offset by gains by DirecTV Now, its online TV service.
15;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2017-06-15T12:10:46Z;Liberty Media shows how to win deals and influence companies;US media group’s investments from radio to Formula 1 reveal unconventional strategy;It was early 2009 and the depths of the financial crisis when Greg Maffei, chief executive of cable magnate John Malone’s Liberty Media, struck what would become one of the most eye-popping deals of recent times.SiriusXM, the satellite radio operator that is home to the original “shock jock” Howard Stern, was desperate for cash and close to filing for bankruptcy protection. With no lenders willing to help, Liberty stepped in. It offered to lend Sirius up to $400m, provided it sold preferred shares to Liberty that would convert into 40 per cent of the struggling company — for just $12,500.Sirius agreed, but with markets in meltdown, loaning it anything was a big risk. “My treasurer at the time said either the world’s going to end or we’re going to make a lot of money,” Mr Maffei recalls. But Sirius was good for its loan, borrowing $400m and paying it back with interest. Over the years, the 40 per cent stake that Liberty negotiated grew to about 67 per cent thanks to various Sirius stock buybacks. Fast forward to 2017 and a holding that cost Liberty the equivalent of a second-hand car is now worth more than $16bn.It is unlikely to strike as lucrative a deal any time soon, but the complexity of the Sirius trade is emblematic of Liberty’s approach under Mr Maffei, Mr Malone’s top US executive. He is the architect of a strategy that has seen Liberty assemble a broad portfolio of media, sports and cable assets — from baseball’s Atlanta Braves and Formula 1 motor racing to the QVC shopping channel — that rival those of players such as 21st Century Fox and Time Warner. The method has been control and influence by using leverage, board presence and complex, tax-driven dealmaking, rather than having outright ownership.Last week, he orchestrated Liberty’s latest deal when Sirius invested $480m in Pandora, the internet radio operator. Sirius is buying preferred stock in Pandora that will eventually convert into a 16 per cent stake. As part of the deal, Sirius will name three people to Pandora’s board of directors, with one of these appointees becoming chairman.The deal is classic Liberty in that it gets clout in a company that it will not control. “Control is a relative word,” says Mr Maffei. “We need to have influence. If you have influence, if you have board seats, you have a better chance to drive your exit in an attractive manner.”The combination of Sirius’s satellite radio business, which is mainly sold in cars, with Pandora’s internet radio operation comes as streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music are duking it out in paid-for subscription music. “We’ve always thought part of the [music] market will be free,” says Mr Maffei, adding that the combined company will target the US radio ad market, which is worth about $17bn.Analysts said the Pandora investment would help Sirius diversify away from its reliance on in-car systems and boost other music-related businesses in the Liberty portfolio — such as LiveNation Entertainment, the world’s largest concert booking and ticketing groupLiveNation owns Ticketmaster, the event ticketing operator. “Pandora can help Ticketmaster and LiveNation’s promotion arm sell more tickets,” Brandon Ross, analyst with BTIG Research, wrote in a recent note. Pandora user data will be key, he added. “Ticketmaster has a lot of customer purchase data, but it has no idea to what music its customers are listening.”Liberty Media is wholly separate from Liberty Global, Mr Malone’s European cable group, and has stakes in a range of media, internet and cable companies, including Charter Communications, which is the second largest cable operator in the US after buying Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in tax-driven deals two years ago, which were worth close to $90bn including debt.It controls some of its businesses outright, such as home shopping network QVC and Formula 1, which it acquired this year in a typically complex deal that valued the sport at $8bn. But for most of its investments, the company holds smaller stakes. This week, it also invested in the Drone Racing League, joining Sky and World Wrestling Entertainment in backing the nascent sport.Liberty was formed from the remnants of TCI, the cable operator Mr Malone turned from an also-ran into the largest in America before selling it to AT&T in 1999 for $48bn. TCI regularly took stakes in cable networks in return for distributing those channels and at various times has owned stakes in Viacom, Turner networks and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News Channel. “We were this collection of little minority investments,” says Mr Maffei. Unwinding those investments “in a tax efficient manner” has been critical “because the cost of not doing that would be so high. If you’re paying out a 40 per cent capital gains tax at the corporate level, and then paying it again at the shareholder level, you’re dissipating a lot of returns.”Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer with Gamco Investors, says Liberty Media invites comparisons with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and 3G, the private equity group, for the scale of its investments and the returns it has generated. Since 2003, Liberty has spun off eight companies and launched six tracker stocks, he says. “If you held on to all the pieces it will have returned 13 per cent compared with the market, which returned 8 per cent, and Berkshire Hathaway, which has returned about 8.5 per cent.”Much of its future growth will depend on the recent bet the company made on Formula 1. It has installed Chase Carey, formerly Rupert Murdoch’s top lieutenant, as the sport’s chief executive and is intent on pushing it into new markets — particularly the US. “What attracted us is that it is a global sports franchise,” says Mr Maffei. “There are only three or four of similar scale and you can’t buy the Olympics and you can’t buy Fifa. It was one we saw that had frankly been under-exploited.”He mentions commercial opportunities such as increasing broadcasting revenues and building ancillary events around each Grand Prix. Before Liberty bought Formula 1, the sport had one full-time person working on sponsorship and a couple working part time to service 17 sponsors. By contrast, Major League Baseball which, unlike Formula 1, is almost entirely US-focused, “has 80 people working on sponsorship and 75 sponsors”.There are other untapped opportunities: “We have teams spending several hundred million dollars a year trying to get five seconds faster than the other guy, 10 seconds faster. It’s all about technology, and we don’t have a technology sponsor.”He raises the prospect of staging Grand Prix in cities such as Miami, Las Vegas “down the Strip”, and New York, with the Manhattan skyline as a backdrop. “There are a lot of potential venues that are interesting.”Valuing Liberty is difficult, but Mr Marangi estimates its various holdings, stakes and owned companies are worth a combined $80bn. Liberty’s complex structure, array of tracking stocks and lack of a single, unifying brand distinguish it from rival media conglomerates such as Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox. Its focus on the long term — unlike private equity firms it has no fixed time horizon for its investments — also differentiates it, according to Mr Marangi.Mr Maffei says Liberty is not wedded to any of its assets. “We’re different from companies that don’t have the view that they are ever going to get rid of anything.” Instead, he says, the company intends to use its assets to keep growing as tax efficiently as possible. “That is where we are,” he says. “Where we have the most leverage.”

However, Mr Rutledge first said the company would need to add 20,000 workers in 2015, as it was in the process of acquiring Time Warner Cable and Bright House. Charter also pledged to relocate TWC’s offshore call centres to the US as part of that deal.Mr Trump claimed credit for the move, adding it to the list of companies he has praised as job creators. “Charter’s announcement follows a number of American businesses from Exxon to Intel to Lockheed to Boeing to many others that have recently announced billions of dollars in investment and thousands of jobs coming into the United States following my election victory,” he said.Charter said in a statement that it had decided to make the infrastructure and technology investment “with confidence in the deregulatory policies of the administration and the Federal Communications Commission”.In the Oval Office, Mr Rutledge said: “We’re also excited about the opportunity in the right regulatory climate and the right tax climate to make major infrastructure investments. We’re going to spend $25bn, we’re committed to spending that, predicated on the kind of regulatory consistency and efficiency that we expect as a country.”Telecoms industry executives have said they expect Mr Trump’s regulatory overhaul to be a boon to business, opening the door to capital spending and possible merger activity.Charter has explored a possible deal with Verizon that would create the world’s largest telecoms and cable company.This month, Mr Rutledge told an industry conference that “to de-risk future investment makes you feel better about investing . . . having a more stable regulatory environment can’t be anything but good”.
17;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Charter unveils stronger than expected rise in sales;;Charter Communications, the US cable television and internet provider, disclosed on Thursday an increase in quarterly revenues that topped Wall Street estimates.Revenues boomed by more than four-fold from the previous year to $10.28bn in the fourth quarter, driven by the closing of its deal in May 2016 to buy Time Warner Cable. On a pro forma basis that combines Charters’s results with Time Warner’s in the previous year’s period, sales were up by 7.2 per cent.Wall Street economists had forecast sales of $10.23bn.Net income rose to $454m, or $1.67 a share, from $130m, or 48 cents a share, on a pro forma basis.Charter’s shares rose by 1 per cent in pre-market trading, which would add to a year-to-date gain as of Wednesday’s close of almost 13 per cent.The group posted rapid growth in revenues from its internet provider business, which were up by 13.3 per cent on a pro-forma basis to $3.3bn. Cable video grew at a slower pace of 1.9 per cent to $4.1bn.Cable companies have been working to fight the rise of “cord cutting” where consumers stream video over the internet rather than the the more lucrative television offering.“”In 2017, we remain focused on applying our growth-oriented operating strategy across our new footprints, driving more customer satisfaction, growth, and shareholder value,” said Tom Rutledge, Charter’s chief executive.

Verizon shares fell 1.3 per cent.
19;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2016-09-05T11:56:28Z;Charter Communications plays legal hardball with networks;John Malone’s group uses corporate structure to demand lower prices;John Malone, the “Cable Cowboy”, is known for playing the angles to defer or avoid paying taxes to Uncle Sam in the aftermath of a deal. Now his game has moved on to other forms of mergers and acquisition ju-jitsu aimed at boosting his bottom line.His US pay-TV distributor, Charter Communications, is battling television networks over the terms of its recent tie-up with rival Time Warner Cable. The dispute centres on the esoterica of merger subsidiaries and is the latest front in the bloody fight between beleaguered content providers and the heavyweight pay-TV operators who wish to spend as little as possible on programming.Mergers and acquisitions are rarely as simple as company A buying company B. Start sifting through the transaction documents and there will be boxes and arrows showing multiple corporate vehicles jammed together and broken apart (two common structures, the vividly named “double dummy” and “reverse triangular”, sound like gymnastics moves, or worse).The complexity is needed for managing tax, liabilities and relationships with counterparties. Mercifully for investors and analysts, the structuring technicalities are not often broadly consequential. One set of shareholders gets cash and stock for their shares. The company that comes up with those funds then owns the target’s assets and liabilities.Mr Malone’s adventures started in 2013 when he bought a stake in Charter, a small player that had come out of bankruptcy and had 6m subscribers. It quickly became evident that Mr Malone was planning to use it to create a pay-TV and broadband internet juggernaut.He had pursued TWC, but was surprisingly thwarted by Comcast which snatched the company in early 2014. But regulatory worries nixed that deal a year later, and Charter jumped back in with an offer of cash and its own stock. The resulting tie-up with TWC was announced in May 2015.The Charter-TWC deal, valued at $71bn, closed in May this year. The popular interpretation is that Charter, despite being the smaller enterprise, acquired TWC. TWC had struggled for years despite its presence in the New York City and Los Angeles markets.Charter had told Wall Street that the deal would produce $800m of annual synergies with a big chunk coming from lower programming expenses. Such savings typically take time to materialise: when existing agreements with content providers roll off, the newly enlarged pay-TV distributor can demand more favourable renewal terms.But Charter believes that it is entitled to cheaper terms immediately. TWC had lower rates because of its larger scale. Charter asserts those lower rates still apply because of the way it crafted the legal entities underlying the combination. It says TWC survived the merger, so its rates for buying programming survive, not just for legacy TWC subscribers but across the Charter customer base.3The number of networks that have sued Charter alleging breach of contractSo far three networks — Fox News, Univision and CBS/Showtime — have sued Charter in the New York state court alleging breach of contract, contesting the claim that TWC and its lower rates still apply. Lawyers expect similar lawsuits from other networks in September.The suing networks all point to executive actions, commentary and presentations that refer to Charter as assuming control of TWC. Mr Malone is a Charter board member and his affiliate, Liberty Broadband, owns a fifth of the combined company.The chief executive of the combined group is also Tom Rutledge, a highly respected industry veteran who joined Charter in 2011. The question is if any of this evidence matters for the underlying legal foundations of the deal.Charter is highly leveraged so every dollar of cost savings is closely scrutinised by creditors and shareholders. Cable analyst Craig Moffett has said the tangles were expected and will be settled outside of court as these disputes often are.“It is highly likely that we will see negotiated settlements for these kinds of cases, where the two sides swap price for [contract] duration and certainty,” he said.But for now, Charter is talking tough as it tries to hold Fox and Univision to their contracts. According to one filing, one Charter executive wrote in an email to a Univision executive: “We will just accept as you have never had this job previously and probably do not know what you are doing”.In another missive to Fox News, Charter wrote: “We appreciate that, as publicly reported, the [Charter/TWC deals were] were not self-explanatory.”No surprise when Mr Malone is involved.sujeet.indap@ft.com

There is an unprecedented amount of diverse, creative content being produced that is extremely bandwidth intensive,” said David Trujillo, Partner at TPG.“Consumers are craving access to that content through various internet-connected devices in the home all at once. This places never-before-seen demands on the underlying infrastructure. High-speed data has become, and will remain, the essential connection for both consumers and businesses.”

LionTree declined to comment.LionTree was founded in 2012 by Aryeh Bourkoff, a former UBS analyst and investment banker, and Ehren Stenzler, a UBS mergers and acquisitions banker, in New York.It has since quickly gained favour as a trusted advisor to some of the leading media and telecoms companies, working on major deals in the sector for clients such as Liberty Global, Charter Communications and Verizon.Just this week, LionTree advised Verizon on its $4.83bn takeover of Yahoo’s core internet business and worked with Apollo Global Management, the private equity firm, on its $1.6bn acquisition of Outerwall.Mr Donavan’s hire is the second senior hire by LionTree in London, which last year brought in Louis Kenna, a former BNP Paribas banker.In Europe, LionTree has advised on Liberty Global’s joint venture in the Netherlands with Vodafone and worked with he Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC on its investment in Ireland’s former state telecoms monopoly Eir.LionTree, which employs less than 50 staff all together, has also recently opened offices in San Francisco and is also building up an early investment unit, which focuses on finding start-ups for LionTree and its clients to invest in.
22;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2016-07-08T16:28:43Z;Univision sues Charter over post-merger fees;;Univision, the dominant Spanish-language television network, is suing Charter Communications, alleging that the second-largest US cable operator has “refused to negotiate” new contract terms after its merger with Time Warner Cable.In a lawsuit filed in New York’s Supreme Court, Univision accused Charter of breaching its television carriage contract and using its acquisition of Time Warner Cable to impose license fees for Univision’s channels that are “dramatically below” market rates, reports Anna Nicolaou in New York.Univision’s licensing contract with Charter expired on June 30, and the cable company has tried to impose Time Warner Cable’s contracts rather than negotiate a fresh deal, Univision claimed, based on a “preposterous theory” that Time Warner was managing the cable systems after the merger.“But everyone knows that is not true,” Univision said in a statement. “Charter pitched this deal to regulators, its subscribers, and the public, as one where its management team would take control of the combined company, and that is exactly what happened. Quite simply, Charter promised one thing publicly in order to secure approval for its acquisition and is now privately claiming the exact opposite to Univision.”The filing comes as the newly formed Charter looks to leverage its scale in programming contracts. The carriage fees cable companies pay for television channels have risen in recent years, which operators have argued forces higher monthly cable prices for customers. Cable operators have embraced consolidation to better face off against programmers over rising content costs, and address the growing threat of so-called cord-cutters – consumers who turn to online video services such as Netflix.Charter said in a statement: “We have a long-term contract with Univision and we expect them to honor it.”

Investors waiting for its merger with Charter Communications to close will be hoping not. Share price movements suggest that they have been right to keep the faith.It is more than two years since TWC inked a surprise deal with Comcast Corp to assemble America’s largest cable television and broadband provider. A surprisingly fierce opposition effort sunk that deal last year. Plan B was a back-up deal with John Malone’s Charter Communications, a combination thought to be less controversial. Three months after a targeted closing date, TWC may still need another three months to finish the job.In the rapidly consolidating pay-TV world, Charter/TWC may not even be the most precarious transaction. French operator Altice is trying to crack the American market. After picking up the second-tier operator Suddenlink for $9bn it offered $18bn for New York provider Cablevision last autumn. To get investors on board, it had to pay all cash. That will push its debt to six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation post-completion.Like many a French tourist, Altice got sidetracked in New York. Regulators there are wondering just how much worse customer service will get as Altice attempts to root out $900m in annual cost savings. Those are deep cuts — half of Cablevision’s existing earnings — but it will need them to help meet its interest bills.The most recent concerns for the TWC deal come not from national regulators, but from the California authorities, who must also sign off the combination. The deal should close in early summer, probably in exchange for more concessions to consumers.For merger arbs, closing spreads are narrowing; not so long ago, share prices were at 10 per cent discounts to the deal values. But the gauntlet of approvals show that such trades still require strong stomachs.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
24;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2016-02-05T00:51:10Z;Charter clinches 2016′s first benchmark drive-by junk deal;;A sign of life from the languid US junk bond market.Charter Communications, the junk-rated US cable group that has sunk its teeth into Time Warner Cable, completed the first benchmark drive-by debt offering by a high-yield company this year on Thursday, US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt reports.The acquisitive cable company sold $1.7bn in senior notes that mature in 2024 with a yield of 5.875 per cent, 417 basis points above a comparable maturing US Treasury.Last April the group sold bonds maturing in 2025 with a yield 353 basis points above the benchmark Treasury, underscoring the degree to which companies must pay up if seeking to tap debt markets.So-called drive-by offerings, where an issuer places debt quickly — often announcing its intention to sell debt in the morning with the deal completed before end of day —, have been few and far between among junk-rated companies in the past six months.Since a sharp sell-off late last year, investor redemptions and the closure of several credit mutual funds, the high-yield primary market has seized up.The drive-by deals tend to come from well-known companies that investors are familiar with and take advantage of markets when they are open. Investment grade groups generally employ the measure, with Walt Disney and Ford completing same day offerings this January.Earlier this year, Lamar Media completed a drive-by deal, selling $400m in debt. Benchmark offerings tend to be at least $500m or larger.Charter said it would use the proceeds to pay down its revolving credit facility, with any remaining funds used to either redeem some of its outstanding debt or fund a portion of its $55bn takeover of Time Warner Cable.Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Citi and Wells Fargo led the transaction from Charter Communications subsidiary CCO Holdings.
25;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Dealmakers claim 2015 boom is different;Cheaper debt and stronger balance sheets drive merger record;After a record-shattering year for global dealmaking, there is more to come. That is the overwhelming message from top corporate advisers, even after 2015 delivered $4.59tn of mergers and acquisitions, including four transactions among the 20 biggest in history — and deal volume records in five sectors, led by healthcare.Brimming with belief, bankers and lawyers say the conditions for further dealmaking — such as the availability of cheap borrowing and heightened confidence in corporate boardrooms — remain in place. Deals continue to provide large companies with the means to gain market share or overcome an inability to increase revenues organically. “As long as the economic environment does not dramatically change, we will keep on seeing a lot of deals,” says Robin Rankin, co-head of global M&A at Credit Suisse. This relatively stable environment may explain why more than half of this year’s M&A activity came from an unprecedented 137 “megadeals”— defined by Thomson Reuters as transactions of $5bn or more. Among the largest of these were the blockbuster tie-ups between drugmakers Pfizer and Allergan, brewers AB InBev and SABMiller and oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group. Yet corporate advisers say they see few of the warning signs that appeared before the last peak in M&A activity, in 2007, when $4.13tn of deals were struck before the global financial crisis took hold. Colm Donlon, head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Morgan Stanley, says one difference is that the last peak was driven by a significant proportion of deals from Europe. This year, European deals contributed just 19 per cent to overall activity, compared with 38 per cent in 2007. “The global cycle still has further to run because it has not yet captured any meaningful upswing in Europe,” argues Mr Donlon. He believes next year may involve more companies from North America and Asia seeking to take advantage of a weaker euro to strike deals in the region.What lies in store for financial markets next year? — the FT looks at the prospects for major asset classes, including currencies, emerging markets, bonds, equities and commoditiesAnother contrast since the last peak is the greater availability of cheap financing and the healthier state of corporate balance sheets. In 2007, the benchmark US 10-year Treasury yield sat at 4.6 per cent compared with 2.2 per cent today. And even after record levels of share repurchases in this cycle, companies in the S&P 500 index are still holding more than $1.8tn of cash, compared with $0.8tn back then. Both facts suggest there is ample firepower for companies to pursue transactions. Companies are also increasingly using their own equity to pay for deals. This year, 47 per cent of all takeover activity has been at least in part financed with stock, compared with 21 per cent in 2007. Examples included condiment maker Heinz’s cash-and-stock takeover of food group Kraft and the recent all-share merger between chemicals heavyweights Dupont and Dow Chemical.A partial share offer also helped Charter Communications, the John Malone-backed US cable group, lock up a deal to buy Time Warner Cable. Gilberto Pozzi, co-head of M&A at Goldman Sachs, says this is a sign that risk and upside are being more equally shared by both sets of shareholders these days.“In the last cycle, the buyer’s shareholders were taking upside and downside because the deals were predominantly being financed with debt,” he says. “Now, CEOs are trying to balance the risk allocation and the value creation. That is why you see more mergers of equals and more part stock deals.” However, private equity buyout deals have languished. Choppy high-yield debt markets, additional regulatory scrutiny on leverage levels and elevated stock markets meant that only $300bn of private equity deals were reached this year — half the level of 2007. This may change next year, but not dramatically, according to Steve Baronoff, chairman of global M&A at Bank of America. Kenneth Jacobs, chief executive of Lazard, says: “The last cycle, toward the end, was skewed toward financial sponsor activity. When the financing environment dried up and valuations became too rich, it ended.”Some buyout groups have evolved their approach since then, and are now using public companies to pursue private equity-like strategies. This has been evident in 2015 deals involving 3G, the investment firm led by three Brazilians who bring rigorous cost-cutting disciplines to large consumer companies, and France’s Altice, which is seeking to upend the telecoms and cable industry with a private equity model. While take-private deals have declined, transactions driven by activist shareholders have been on the rise — most notably in the US, where corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb, Nelson Peltz and Bill Ackman have used their funds to push for better shareholder returns. Activist pressure prompted dozens of public fights and even led some companies to seek deals — including EMC, the data storage group. It agreed to be acquired by Dell after persistent demands by hedge fund Elliott Management that it break itself up. Scott Barshay, partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, says: “Activist hedge fund activity has been a game-changer. A company with a $20bn market cap was completely safe from activists in 2007, while in 2015 no company is too big for an activist to attack.” But despite the apparent differences between this year and the last M&A peak, some advisers see reasons for caution in 2016.Rules governing US companies’ ability to conduct cross-border mergers and then redomicile to escape the US tax authorities have been tightened for the second time in just over a year. These so-called tax inversions have been a principal driver of takeovers in 2015. Competition regulators also appear set to play a greater role in determining whether mergers can go ahead. This year, the US Federal Trade Commission has challenged Staples’ proposed $6.3bn acquisition of rival office supplier Office Depot. Meanwhile, Halliburton’s 2014 deal to buy rival oil services group Baker Hughes continues to be held up.Robert Leitão, head of global financial advisory at Rothschild, says: “The foundations upon which the M&A activity happened this year may not be sustainable, so it is not clear to me things will continue at this rate. We may have reached the peak for activity, especially in Europe where challenges remain.”

By that time, checkmate often looms. Few players are more cunning than media tycoon John Malone, who on Thursday announced a series of manoeuvres among his Liberty pieces. Most of these moves relate to two US companies, Liberty Media and Liberty Interactive. Each already has multiple share classes, and both plan to create more.Liberty Media has three classes of stock. Holders of those shares will receive new shares in Liberty Braves (owner of the Atlanta Braves baseball team), Liberty Sirius (owner of satellite radio company Sirius XM) and Liberty Media (the holding company for much else, including stakes in Live Nation, Viacom, and Time Warner).At the same time Liberty Interactive’s four share classes will turn into six, with new listings for CommerceHub and Expedia. At least there are no changes at the largest part of the empire — Liberty Broadband, which owns a quarter of television distributor Charter Communications.The spin-offs are rational in one way: they allow direct exposure to individual business units. But in another sense, they are pointless — companies such as SiriusXM, Expedia and Live Nation are already listed. Investors can already buy shares in them directly.The more interesting developments may be taking place away from the Liberty asset-shuffling. Two other Malone entities, Discovery Communications and Liberty Global, have taken a collective 7 per cent stake in Lionsgate, the studio group behind Hunger Games and Mad Men. Cable television may have been Mr Malone’s focus in recent years, but the Lionsgate deal suggests an interest in combining content assets.All of which makes for a confusing chess board. Perhaps Mr Malone has a master plan. But for the moment, the Liberty empire risks looking directionless.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

At Altice “no one is making more than $200,000 a year,” he said.Dexter Goei, Altice’s chief executive, pointed out that Cablevision has more than 300 executives making more than $300,000 per year.“So this we will change,” said Mr Drahi.He added that the high cost base of US cable operators compared unfavourably with his European operations. “My model is to bring in the US [average revenue per user] to Europe and European [costs] to the US.”Earlier in the day, Altice had said that Cablevision would benefit from the company’s international operational expertise, scale and investment capacity.It explained that Cablevision would keep its capital structure separate from that of Suddenlink but added that the units would draw on management from both companies, creating a group with 4.6m customers spread over 20 states.“Both companies will benefit from this national platform and from operating efficiencies and economies of scale,” Altice said.The terms of the Cablevision deal once again showed the high price Altice is willing to pay and the significant leverage it is willing to take on to establish a foothold in the US market.Altice said it would pay $34.90 a share in cash, valuing Cablevision’s equity at $9.6bn. The offer is a 22 per cent premium to the US company’s closing share price on Wednesday of $28.54. But Cablevision shares have been bolstered in recent months by speculation of a takeover and the offer is a 66 per cent premium to its price in mid-May, when Mr Drahi and Mr Malone were battling for Time Warner Cable.Critics wonder whether group has taken on too much too quickly with CablevisionRead moreAnalysts have expressed concern over Altice’s growing debt pile, which has funded his acquisition spree.When asked by the Financial Times if the company was over leveraged, Mr Drahi said: “I am not concerned. No, not at all.“We will deleverage very rapidly as we achieve synergies.”Mr Drahi said that the acquisition would reinforce his group’s presence in the US market. “We will be in a stronger position, as in all other markets in which we operate, to deliver the best services, invest in the most advanced technology and develop innovative products,” he said.The proposed deal will sever the Dolan family’s long connection with Cablevision.The family, which also controls the AMC cable network and Madison Square Garden arena in New York, has owned Cablevision since Charles Dolan founded the company in Long Island in 1973.Mr Dolan built the business in the New York area over the decades that followed. He also founded HBO, which is now owned by Time Warner.Cablevision remained under the Dolan family’s control even as the cable industry consolidated over successive years, with the likes of Mr Malone and the Roberts family of Philadelphia, which owns Comcast, snapping up rival smaller operators.Apart from a Nespresso machine, there are few frills at Altice’s office in Geneva. Yet the group has recently put up €28bn to transform itself from a small-scale cable group into one of Europe’s leading telecoms operatorsRead moreAltice intends to finance the Cablevision acquisition by raising roughly $8.6bn of new debt as well as $3.3bn in cash, which will come from an Altice equity raising. The transaction will leave Cablevision with $14.5bn of net debt.Mr Drahi has recently formed a new Dutch holding company with a dual-class share structure, allowing him to fund more takeovers with equity without diluting his voting rights.Altice added that private equity group BC Partners and CPP Investment Board, a fund manager that invests the assets of the Canada Pension Plan, would have an option to buy up to 30 per cent of Cablevision’s equity. BC Partners and CPP Investment Board sold 70 per cent of Suddenlink, the US’s seventh-largest cable operator, to Altice but retained the other 30 per cent and have signalled an interest in doing further deals with Mr Drahi.Reporting by Matthew Garrahan, James Fontanella-Khan and David Crow in New York, Adam Thomson in Paris and Arash Massoudi in London

Altice, the Dutch listed telecoms company, likes the style but still believes in sharp European tailoring. After its bid for US cable company Suddenlink in May, Altice agreed on Thursday to acquire another, Cablevision, for $17.7bn in cash and shares. That is a premium of 22 per cent over the previous day’s share price of $28 — but the premium is three times as high if measured from before the Suddenlink announcement. Cablevision has looked like a target for Altice for a while.Altice will pay, before any cost cuts, over nine times next year’s forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The company promises it will find annual savings of $900m. Taxed and capitalised that is worth over $5bn. On that basis, Altice’s premium over the pre-Suddenlink enterprise value for Cablevision ($3.5bn) looks fair.That assumes Cablevision has enough fabric to work with. Perhaps so. Altice’s estimated savings would snip a fifth off Cablevision’s operating costs. Its operating expenses are nearly 72 per cent of revenues. At the much larger Time Warner Cable that proportion is a third lower.But Altice’s cost cutting may not be as easy at Cablevision as it has been elsewhere. Cablevision, like other US cable companies, is fighting to keep hold of lucrative television subscriptions (tech-savvy customers prefer to watch their TV more cheaply over the internet). Not only that, but Cablevision also has an aggressive competitor, Verizon, luring away customers with its fibre optic broadband. Altice says Verizon overlaps with only a third of its broadband customers. More like double that, say analysts MoffettNathanson.Altice has found a plus-sized outfit for its autumn line-up. But it has much to do to fight off competitors as it trims the garment down to size.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Shares in Dish added 5 per cent, taking its market capitalisation to roughly $33bn.T-Mobile and Dish have openly discussed a partnership of some sort in recent months.In March, Braxton Carter, T-Mobile’s chief financial officer, said of Mr Ergen: “You look at what he is doing with some of his technologies, and that type of marriage could be very, very, very interesting, or partnership.”On a conference call with investors in May, Mr Ergen said: “We’re keeping all our options open. But obviously we admire what John [Legere] and his team have done at T-Mobile, and certainly we follow what they do.”A combined company would be able to sell bundled content and wireless telecoms services to T-Mobile’s 44.7m retail customers and Dish’s 13.8m satellite TV subscribers.It would also be able to deploy the billions of dollars of wireless airwaves or “ spectrum” that Mr Ergen has acquired in recent years as a hedge against the future of the US pay-TV industry, which is suffering from decline.Valuations, and a desire to control rather than share, makes this a trickier deal than it should beContinue readingAfter emerging as the second-largest bidder in a record-breaking $44.9bn auction of government airwaves this year, Dish now controls about 15 per cent of industry spectrum capacity, but has no obvious use for it.T-Mobile, the fourth-largest US wireless group, has been growing quickly in the past two years, adding 14m new customers as it waged a price war on its larger competitors. But it controls just 12 per cent of industry spectrum capacity, which can lead to inferior network coverage.Analysts were divided on the chances of a T-Mobile and Dish combination.David Phipps, an analyst at Citi, said he had “set a 25 per cent probability” on the deal and argued Dish was more likely to sell itself to Verizon, the largest US telecoms group.Verizon accounts for roughly 40 per cent of industry revenues but controls just 20 per cent of spectrum, leading some analysts to suggest it will need to acquire more airwaves to cope with an explosion in people watching videos on their smartphones.We now think the most likely option for Dish is a sale to Verizon. Verizon has a spectrum shortage vis-à-vis rivals and Dish’s spectrum could narrow its spectrum deficit“We now think the most likely option for Dish is a sale to Verizon. Verizon has a spectrum shortage vis-à-vis rivals and Dish’s spectrum could narrow its spectrum deficit,” said Mr Phipps.However, John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS, said he did not expect the talks to flush out a bid for Dish, noting that such a deal would dilute Verizon’s earnings.It is not clear that Verizon, which is already heavily indebted, could afford such a large purchase. In 2013 it took on $49bn of debt, the largest corporate bond sale in history, to help buy UK telecoms group Vodafone out of their US joint venture.14mNew customers gained by T-Mobile over past two yearsEarlier on Thursday, Mr Legere deleted a tweet that appeared to cast doubt on reports his company was in merger talks with Dish.Mr Legere, a prolific user of Twitter with 1.4m followers, linked to a piece of analysis discussing a merger of the two companies on the Re/Code website, describing the article as a “snarky sensational and shallow look at a rumour that deserves no comment”.“Sad to watch the level of writing @recode especially Ina,” Mr Legere added, in an apparent reference to the article’s author, Ina Fried, a senior editor at Re/Code. He later deleted both tweets."

David Pyott, CEO of Allergan, could receive $118m if he leaves following his company’s acquisition by pharmaceuticals rival Actavis.For CEOs of the 10 biggest companies taken over in 2014, golden parachutes could total $430m, according to Equilar.Even more difficult to justify, though, are payments for seeing a deal through even if it does not result in the loss of a job.In May Bruno Lafont (above), CEO of Lafarge, the French cement company on the verge of being taken over by Switzerland’s Holcim, was awarded a €2.5m bonus for his “key role” in pushing the deal through and his “exceptional performance” in “extraordinary circumstances”. These may include the fact that, earlier this year, Mr Lafont lost out on the job as CEO of the merged LafargeHolcim. Wrangling between the two companies over his role, as well as the price, resulted in a rejigging of the latter and Mr Lafont being bumped up to a co-chairman role.Yet the deal has not even cleared its final hurdle. First announced in April 2014, it is expected to close in July after a share tender by Lafarge shareholders.Lafarge and its bankers continue to insist that the deal is a merger not a takeover. Which makes Mr Lafont’s payment all the more difficult to understand.

However, prices have been rising sharply as the acquisition spree has accelerated.“As premiums for deals go up, companies will come under increasing scrutiny and will have to defend the synergies and rationale of deals,” he said.The M&A boom has come amid a borrowing binge by US companies, as treasurers lock in cheap, longer-term funding ahead of an expected interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve. Economists believe the US central bank will start tightening monetary policy in September, a move likely to rattle markets that have become accustomed to low interest rates.Average company bond yields have halved since 2007 to about 3 per cent in the US, and there has been more than $100bn of corporate bond issuance every month for the past four months — the longest ever streak of issuance above that mark. Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts that June will become the fifth month in a row.“Issuers should realise that the window to lock in low long-term yields for any purpose is closing,” Hans Mikkelsen, a senior strategist at BofA, wrote in a recent note.The return of big deals, financed by bank cash, offers a glimmer of hope for yieldsContinue readingAcquisitions have been mostly financed by shares, ample cash reserves and bond markets, but some of the pre-financial crisis debt structures have also staged a comeback.Global issuance of collateralised loan obligations — or CLOs, bundles of loans made to poorly-rated companies that are sold off in slices to investors — almost doubled last year to $99.3bn, according to Dealogic. Although below the heydays of 2006-07, the market’s renaissance has helped lubricate the resurgent M&A boom.The Fed’s plans to increase interest rates could dent the plans of corporate dealmakers, however, and hurt some of the riskier companies laden with buyout debt. Standard & Poor’s predicted that its gauge of defaults for lowly-rated companies will rise from 1.8 per cent in March this year to 2.8 per cent by March 2016.Nonetheless, most analysts and money managers expect the frenzy to continue, given the pent-up demand for fixed-income investments, even when monetary policy tightens. “Short-term rates should rise, but long-term yields are likely to be more anchored over the next one to two years,” said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock.

According to chat transcripts shown in court, Mr Hayes began the scheme within UBS shortly after he joined in 2006.Mr Hayes paid “bribes and kickbacks” to brokers to help him influence rate setters at other banks. He would pay them by entering into so-called wash trades that served no purpose other than to deliver commission to the brokers, who would suggest to other banks where to set the daily Libor rate in their emailed run-throughs.Mr Hayes, now 35, was motivated by greed and the desire for higher pay, Mr Chawla said. Goldman Sachs tried to lure him away from UBS in 2008 with the promise of a $3m guarantee and a greater role, but the Swiss bank counter-offered and he stayed until 2009, when Citigroup offered him even more, the jury heard.The case continues.● Related in depth: Libor scandalUS cable cowboy Malone lassoes Time Warner unitAmerica’s cable cowboy is riding high. John Malone has lassoed Time Warner Cable after pursuing the US’s second-largest cable operator for more than a year, writes Shannon Bond in San Francisco.In a blockbuster $90bn-plus three-way deal, Charter Communications — the cable group backed by Mr Malone — aims to roll up TWC and the smaller Bright House Networks, creating a rival to industry leader Comcast.Charter’s $195.71 a share cash and stock bid for TWC comes at a time of change in the cable industry, as operators see their businesses reorient around providing internet access. Pay-TV subscriptions are declining but broadband customers are on the rise, putting cable operators at the centre of how consumers access online information and entertainment.Pressure to keep up with Americans’ shifting preferences has sparked a wave of consolidation among cable groups, telecoms companies and satellite providers. AT&T’s $48.5bn proposed acquisition of DirecTV is undergoing regulatory review. Altice, the European group, recently took a 70 per cent stake in Suddenlink, a smaller US operator.Comcast called off its own attempt to buy TWC last month amid regulatory concern over the vast power that the combined companies would wield in video service and broadband provision.Charter’s two deals will boost its subscriber base from 6.2m to 23.9m, just behind Comcast’s 27m.But analysts say the comparatively smaller scale of Charter’s proposal gives it a much better chance of being approved by regulators.● Related Lex note: Everything is possible

Continue readingIn a business climate where tech companies stay private longer, he said that an initial public offering was “really important” for Snapchat, which was committed to staying independent rather than being snapped up by a larger company such as Facebook.According to analysts, Snapchat’s audience is younger than those of other social media apps. Company figures this week said it had 100m daily active users, 65 per cent of whom sent snaps every day.As Snapchat tries to turn traffic into revenue, Mr Spiegel told Businessweek he had been touring agencies and brands in London, Los Angeles and New York.Advertisers will have to make ads especially for the service — not least because it uses a vertical (portrait-style) video format — but Mr Spiegel said the audience was “compelling and big enough” for them to put in the effort.He tried to appeal to marketers by showing that he valued ads as a product, not a necessary evil, and criticised people who saw “internet advertising as a tax on the system”.● Related news story: Snapchat in $650m funding roundChevron investors win landmark vote for ‘proxy access’The campaign for US companies to grant shareholders more powers to nominate directors scored a landmark victory on Wednesday at Chevron, the country’s second-largest oil group, writes Ed Crooks in New York.A proposed rule giving investors that have held 3 per cent or more of the company for three or more years the right to nominate directors was backed by 55 per cent of the votes cast at Chevron’s annual meeting in San Ramon, California.The vote is not binding on the company, but shareholders that support the measure said it would be difficult for Chevron’s board to refuse to adopt it.“Proxy access”, as the power is known, has been a focus of campaigning this year by corporate governance activists including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund and Calpers, the California state pension system.Calpers has backed resolutions calling for proxy access at 108 companies this year, and as of Wednesday had been successful at 48 and unsuccessful at just 21.Supporters have been targeting companies where there are concerns about corporate governance, such as excessive executive pay unrelated to performance, but have also been focusing on energy companies, seeking to raise the issue of the possible impact of climate change on their industry.Proxy access means that directors nominated by eligible shareholders have to be included in the materials circulated by companies for their annual meetings.In the version supported by investors at Chevron, the eligible shareholders could nominate directors for up to a quarter of the existing board’s seats.Nominated directors also get to include a statement of up to 500 words in the proxy materials.In practice, corporate governance activists do not expect that at companies with proxy access directors nominated by shareholders would very often compete against board nominees in contested votes.Instead, companies are expected to reach agreements with shareholders, with boards nominating directors backed by large investors.Shazam shifts to big picture thinking with updated appFrom start-ups to technology heavyweights, a number of groups made significant pushes to create alternate realities that could soon be explored by consumers, writes Murad Ahmed in London.Shazam, the British music discovery app, turned its attention to recognising images this week.The British start-up said on Thursday that it was joining the race to create “augmented reality” features that can use a mobile device’s camera to scan and identify images in the real world. Shazam’s updated app is able to identify items such as “posters, packaged goods or print media” that feature one of the company’s logos.Using the camera on their mobile device, users will scan the logo and be shown anything from a movie trailer for the film being promoted to an online store where they can buy the goods in an advertisement.Google also made its first firm move into virtual reality technology by teaming up with GoPro, maker of high-definition action cameras.The two companies unveiled a joint project called Jump. This will use a rig of 16 cameras arranged in an outward-facing circle. The video filmed on the devices will be synchronised and combined in such a way that it can be processed into VR-ready media. Once the footage from those cameras is uploaded to the cloud, Google will use algorithms to stitch the sound and images into 360-degree, 3D films.This will allow the company to deliver the videos to users of its cardboard view­er, a low-cost headset it laun­ched in January. Any recent smartphone can be inserted into the kit as the screen.And finally …the lighter side of the news● Never come between a banker and his pay package. Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has lambasted investors who followed the guidance of proxy advisory services and voted against his wage settlement as “lazy” and “irresponsible”. Could it be that Mr Dimon is feeling just a little bit oversensitive about this issue, or does he just need to spend some of his $7.4m cash bonus on an anger-management course?● Dystopian fiction is littered with corporations that have engulfed every aspect of consumers’ lives. While Apple has a way to go yet, having only recently crept from desktops to wrists, its bosses are not ones to stand idle. Jeff Williams, senior vice-president of operations, has hinted at ambitions for an electric car. That could sound the death knell for garages — all you would need to do if you break down is switch it off and on again.● “When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging” is rarely good advice for miners. However, several Australian groups that have struggled to find investors are doing just that. They are rolling up their heavy plant and putting the money into weeds — specifically, producing medicinal marijuana and hemp products.

DIY (“Destroy it yourself”) accidents and arguments. But there is a beneficiary. Kingfisher, the home-improvement group, has reported rising sales at its trade shops as DIY becomes “Do it for me”.

33;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2015-05-29T15:49:32Z;Bad sign when media executive pay outstrips bankers’;Big awards are becoming common among communications companies, and not just as part of a deal;Oh to be the former chief executive of a new media company.Robert Marcus, who just agreed to sell Time Warner Cable to Charter Communications, is in line for a $85m payout if he is let go within two years. Four other TWC executives would split a similar sized pot if they departed.Tim Armstrong, meanwhile, is getting a “founders incentive award” equal to 1.5 per cent of AOL’s market cap, or nearly $59m, for selling the company to Verizon. If he stays on, he will also be eligible starting next year for annual equity awards with a target value of $3m.Big payouts are becoming increasingly common among media and communications companies, and not just as part of a deal. Last year, David Zaslav was the US’s highest paid chief executive, pulling in $156m for his work at Discovery Communications, according to Equilar. The executive pay consultancy also found that six of the 10 highest paid US chiefs worked in the sector, including Leslie Moonves of CBS and Disney’s Bob Iger.While outrageously large pay packets turn up occasionally in all sorts of businesses, investors should take notice when a particular sector starts to dominate the CEO pay league tables.Think back to 2007, just before the financial crisis. Merrill Lynch’s newly arrived chief executive John Thain was cock of the walk, taking home $83.1m, and financial services chiefs made up four of the top 10. Within months, many of the world’s biggest banks — including Merrill — were in dire straits and in need of government rescue.Since then politicians and bank shareholders have become a lot more vocal about executive pay. The Dodd-Frank financial reform act required all public companies to give their investors a non-binding “ say on pay” vote at least every three years, and some bank shareholders are actively using the opportunity.This year, 38.1 per cent of JPMorgan Chase shareholders voted against the bank’s executive pay package. The strong no vote came after two proxy advisory services warned that the bank was not tying enough to performance and one, ISS, complained that chief executive Jamie Dimon had a “large discretionary cash bonus . . . without a compelling rationale”.Mr Dimon hit back at his investors this week, accusing them of being “ lazy” and allowing the proxy services to vote for them. But it is not at all clear that is what happened. A large, but slightly different, bloc of shareholders voted for splitting the chairman and CEO roles upon the retirement of Mr Dimon, who holds both posts. Even more investors voted against management and asked for public disclosure when the bank “claws back” executive pay.Most media company shareholders remain a lot more quiescent. The subject of executive pay did not even come up for a vote at Discovery’s annual meeting last week.Time Warner Cable had been shaping up to be a possible exception. Mr Marcus’s $85m golden parachute first drew attention during last year’s failed merger with Comcast. So a union pension fund put a question on this year’s proxy statement that would have limited the vesting of his share awards in case of another deal. Management recommended voting against. But the annual meeting is not scheduled to happen until July.Media companies are unlikely to start asking for taxpayer handouts, but it cannot be a good sign when they start outdoing the bankers on pay.
34;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
35;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2015-05-26T17:49:37Z;Regulators will ask if Charter-TWC deal is in public interest;Analysts believe acquisition could face fewer hurdles than Comcast bid;The question facing regulators sizing up the three-way merger of Charter Communications, Time Warner Cable and Bright House is whether their combined businesses would become a useful rival to the cable and video giant Comcast — or just another Comcast.Analysts and even some opponents of Comcast’s failed bid for TWC said the Charter deal stood a much better chance of being approved by the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator.Comcast’s TWC bid was scuppered by concerns that it would hurt competition and consumers. But the FCC has sought to correct an industry perception that it has a knee-jerk aversion to all cable deals, according to a person familiar with the matter.On Tuesday, Tom Wheeler, FCC chairman, signalled that the Charter-TWC deal will face close scrutiny and stressed that such transactions must be in the public interest. “An absence of harm is not sufficient,” he said in a statement.The FCC worries about size in the cable industry for two principal reasons. The first is the fear that a dominant player such as Comcast can jack up its prices or let service quality stagnate when consumers have few or no alternative providers.This should be less of a concern with a Charter-TWC-Bright House deal. The combined companies say they would represent less than 25 per cent of the high-speed broadband market — significantly less than Comcast-TWC, which would have controlled an estimated 57 per cent.The second regulatory concern stems from the spectacular growth of online video services as more Americans turn to them for entertainment and news.The FCC’s response to the Comcast-TWC deal suggested worries that Comcast’s ownership of a video content businesses gave it a motive to use its broadband clout to hurt online video providers such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Apple or Google.Unlike Comcast, which owns the NBCUniversal broadcast business, neither Charter nor TWC owns any TV channels.Analysts at New Street Research noted that John Malone, Charter’s largest shareholder, also has a stake in the TV business Discovery Communications, but they wrote that “affiliation is not the same thing as control”.They added that Charter-TWC had other advantages, including its knowledge of how regulators assessed the proposed Comcast deal and the absence of past troubles akin to its dispute with Netflix over connection speeds.Rick Boucher, a former US congressman who represents broadband companies, said: “I would rate the deal’s prospects as encouraging.”But consumer advocates were not so heartened.Gene Kimmelman, chief executive of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group that opposed the Comcast deal, said his group would likely push for regulators to impose conditions to ensure that Charter-TWC could not discriminate against certain video distributors.“While it does not appear to have the same competitive harms that the Comcast deal did, the burden is on Charter to demonstrate why this actually serves the public interest,” he said.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan and Gina Chon
36;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Charter’s deal for Time Warner Cable is classic John Malone;The ‘cable cowboy’ has pulled off a deal that even his rivals are applauding;The cable cowboy always gets his man. A year ago, John Malone’s dreams of acquiring Time Warner Cable were in tatters when Charter Communications’ bid was trumped by a better offer from Comcast.But the Colorado billionaire earned his spurs — and his nickname — playing the long game in an industry that has consolidated over the past three decades. After a year-long pursuit, Comcast abruptly withdrew its offer for TWC in the face of mounting regulatory opposition, clearing the way for Charter, which is backed by Mr Malone’s Liberty Broadband, to swoop back in.The three-way deal to combine Charter, TWC and Bright House Networks, a smaller cable operator, is a classic Malone deal with a fiendishly complex structure aimed at delivering the maximum amount of influence and tax savings.On the surface, Charter is paying a hefty premium on its hostile bid of January 2014, when its cash and stock offer for TWC was worth $61bn, or $132.50 a share.But since then, several things have happened to lead Charter to submit a bigger offer. First, TWC’s profits and cash flow increased. So, for a higher nominal purchase price, Charter is acquiring a more valuable asset.Second, Charter’s main currency — its shares — also became more valuable in the intervening period, outperforming TWC stock in recent months and increasing its relative purchasing power.“Yes, it’s a premium [on last January’s offer], but it’s not as large as it seems,” Greg Maffei, chief executive of Liberty Broadband, told the Financial Times.Liberty Broadband, which was spun out of Mr Malone’s Liberty Media in January, will control 19 per cent of the enlarged company. However, it will have 25 per cent voting control after negotiating a voting proxy on some of the shares held in the company by the Newhouse family, which is selling Bright House to Charter.This gives Liberty de facto control of the second-largest supplier of high-speed broadband services in the US behind Comcast and the third-largest provider of cable video services behind Comcast and the combined AT&T-DirecTV.Even Mr Malone’s rivals applauded the three-way combination. “This deal makes all the sense in the world,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive.Unlike Comcast’s bid for TWC, Charter and Liberty do not expect their deal to be blocked by regulators.“Collectively, we have $2bn of confidence,” said Mr Maffei, referring to the break-up fee attached to the merger.The combined entity would represent less than 25 per cent of the high-speed broadband market, he added, significantly less than a combined Comcast-TWC, which would have controlled an estimated 57 per cent.Broadband access and provision “seemed to be the hot button issue with regulators” during the aborted Comcast-TWC deal, he said.Assuming regulators clear the Charter-TWC-Bright House combination, the question Mr Malone and his colleagues will face is what to do next.The billionaire is the largest private landowner in America, with a portfolio bigger than his old friend Ted Turner. But he is not ready to go out to pasture just yet, having also built a formidable pay-television and cable operation in Europe.His biggest deal may lie ahead of him. Last week, he acknowledged that Vodafone, the UK telecoms group, would be a “great fit” with his European cable assets, telling Bloomberg “there would be very substantial synergies if we could find a way to work together or combine the companies”.The comments, which sent Vodafone shares close to a 12-month high, were a big change in tone from Mr Malone. With a market capitalisation of almost £104bn, Vodafone would be a big pill to swallow.Yet such complexities would not be beyond Mr Malone, who has demonstrated over the years that he has the stomach for high-pressure situations. A decade ago, he began to build a position in News Corp voting shares, a move that threatened to undermine Rupert Murdoch’s long-held family control over the company.Mr Malone then secretly added to the stake, outfoxing Mr Murdoch who was forced to hand News Corp’s shares in DirecTV to Mr Malone in exchange for the shares.Fast-forward to 2015 and the cable cowboy is on the verge of completing another historic deal with Charter, TWC and Bright House. Will Vodafone be next?
37;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Regulators await Charter’s $90bn plan for scale in cable;Malone company aims to create second-biggest US cable group;Charter Communications unveiled a $90bn-plus plan to become the second-biggest US cable operator on Tuesday, even as regulators pledged to test whether the latest attempt to consolidate the industry was in consumers’ interests.Charter’s complex, tax-driven bids for Time Warner Cable and the smaller Bright House Networks bore the hallmarks of John Malone, the US cable pioneer who has spent two years trying to use his minority stake in Charter to create a counterweight to Comcast, the industry leader.Charter’s $195.71 a share cash and stock bid for TWC, valuing the target at $56.7bn or $78.7bn including debt, was announced alongside a renegotiated $10.4bn offer for Bright House. Together they represent the sixth-largest US deal on record, according to Thomson Reuters. Charter expects to spend $1bn on fees and other expenses.The two deals would transform Charter’s subscriber numbers from 6.2m to 23.9m, just behind Comcast’s 27m. If successful, they would also deal a blow to Altice, the European group backed by Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi that was scrambling to buy TWC in recent days.The deals came only a month after Comcast withdrew its $45bn bid for TWC in the face of regulatory opposition, and were greeted by a reminder that regulators will subject Charter’s bids to similar scrutiny.Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said: “The FCC reviews every merger on its merits and determines whether it would be in the public interest. In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient. The commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved.”Shares in TWC remained below the offer price. They were up 5 per cent at $179.83 in lunchtime trading, while shares in Charter were up 0.6 per cent at $176.29. Altice dropped 6.6 per cent to €122.60.Charter’s opening pitch to Washington included a pledge to bring faster and cheaper broadband to TWC customers, and a promise to bring customer service jobs back to the US from overseas.Tom Rutledge, Charter’s chief executive who will also become chairman after the deal, said: “Our new company will drive significant investments into America’s broadband infrastructure delivering faster broadband speeds, better video products, and more competition and innovation into the marketplace.”Charter has pledged to pay a break-fee of about $2bn in the event the deal fails due to regulatory concerns. It said it “conservatively” planned to cut $800m in costs from the combination with TWC alone.US cable operators have embraced consolidation to compete more effectively with a new generation of online video services such as Netflix, and to better withstand the growing pricing power of content providers. Consumers’ viewing habits are also shifting away from TV sets in favour of mobile and broadband connections.Mr Malone’s Liberty Broadband will purchase $4.3bn of newly issued Charter shares to help fund the deal on top of the $700m it agreed to buy as part of the earlier accord with Bright House.Liberty Broadband will own 19 per cent of the combined company. Advance/Newhouse, the Newhouse family’s media empire, will own 13 per cent, with TWC shareholders holding 44 per cent and existing Charter shareholders owning the remainder.The deal marks the culmination of two years of takeover talks for Rob Marcus, TWC’s chairman and chief executive. Five TWC executives would receive $170m in payouts if they are terminated within two years of the deal’s completion, with more than half of that going to Mr Marcus, according to the company’s latest proxy statement.The TWC chief held talks with both Charter and Altice in the past week. Altice, Mr Drahi’s mobile and cable group, made its first foray into the US last Tuesday, by acquiring 70 per cent of Suddenlink in a deal that valued the seventh-largest US cable operator at $9.1bn.After Altice’s interest became public, Charter sped up its negotiations with TWC, leading to frantic weekend negotiations to close a deal. Altice attempted unsuccessfully to extend the discussions and buy more time to improve its offer, people close to the company said. Altice declined to comment.Mr Marcus and his executive team have been credited with focusing on improving the performance of the combined company even as it looked to close the deal with Comcast. That transaction valued TWC at $158.82 a share.

And to those with deep pockets. Sixteen months ago, Charter Communications offered to buy Time Warner Cable for $132.50 per share. That deal fell through when TWC went with Comcast, which offered about $160. But with the Comcast deal scuttled by regulators last month, Charter was free to have another go. On Tuesday, it clinched a revised deal, buying TWC for $196 per share. That would seem to be a huge victory for TWC (albeit one made possible by regulators). But it is not an unequivocal victory.In what was a heated fight with Charter last year, TWC offered nothing but contempt for Charter shares. It demanded $160 per share from Charter, with at least $100 of that in cash. The target insisted that the stock component would have to be protected by a so-called collar that would increase the number Charter shares offered if its share price fell. In Tuesday’s deal, TWC shareholders will get their $100 per share in cash (or up to $115 if they want). However, the share component will not be protected by a collar.So how should TWC shareholders feel about Charter shares? Since last February when TWC went with Comcast, Charter’s shares have risen 40 per cent. That rally helps explain how Charter feels comfortable paying a juicy nine times cash flow for TWC.Charter’s own trading multiple of 11 times cash flow is well ahead of the sector. The risk for TWC shareholders is that it falls to the industry average of seven times. Charter might try to push up its equity value by paying down its $62bn of debt but in the past month, as deal speculation grew, the buyer’s shares have fallen nearly a tenth.John Malone, Charter patron, has in just a few years pushed the company from bankruptcy to being the kingmaker of American cable. Five years ago, Charter shares traded at $35. Today they are at $175. The next five years will not be so easy.E-mail the Lex team at lex@ft.com

But First Solar now faces competition from crystalline silicone (C-Si) producers.A supply shortage had pushed C-Si prices higher in the past, making it less competitive, but “driven by significant decline in polysilicon price and manufacturing efficiency improvement, we estimate that production cost of C-Si modules will be only 2 cents higher than First Solar by the end of 2015”, he said.Shares of First Solar, which have declined nearly 15 per cent in the past year, fell 7 per cent to $51.04.AstraZeneca shares fell more than 2 per cent to $67.68 after US drugs developer Amgen said it would terminate its participation in a joint project to develop brodalumab, a treatment aimed at helping patients with the skin disease psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.“The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behaviour in the brodalumab program, which Amgen believes likely would necessitate restrictive labelling,” Amgen said in a statement.AstraZeneca said it would announce its decision on the future development of the treatment as soon as possible.Shares of Time Warner Cable led the benchmark S&P 500, after Charter Communications agreed to buy the company in a $57bn deal that is subject to regulatory approval. The takeover comes a month after US regulators thwarted Comcast’s attempt to take over TWC.Airline stocks, which have recently been hit by concerns that carriers will boost capacity and cut prices to win market share, came under renewed pressure on Tuesday. The NYSE ARCA airline index fell more than 2 per cent and is down 9 per cent since last week.All 10 components of the S&P 500 were in the red with technology and materials stocks leading the decline.The S&P 500 declined 1 per cent to 2,104.20, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1 per cent to 18,041.54 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1 per cent to 5,032.75.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
40;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Time Warner Cable battle highlights industry upheaval;Aftershocks expected with Altice the potential loser as Malone’s Charter closes in;The battle over Time Warner Cable, the second-largest US cable television operator, reflects the profound change sweeping through the industry and is expected to set off a series of aftershocks.After days of haggling, it emerged on Monday that Charter Communications, the third-largest cable TV company, which is backed by media tycoon John Malone, was closing in on buying TWC in a $78bn deal including debt. The potential loser is Altice, the European cable group chaired by billionaire Patrick Drahi, which has also been interested in acquiring New York-based TWC, according to people familiar with the matter.Luxembourg-based Altice made its first foray into the US only last week by striking a $9.1bn deal to acquire a controlling stake in Suddenlink, the fifth-largest pay-TV operator, and is expected to look for another deal to muscle up against a combined Charter-TWC and industry leader Comcast.This all comes at a time when subscription TV providers are slowly but steadily shedding customers. The US pay-TV industry has shrunk by 0.5 per cent over the past 12 months, according to Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson Research. “That may not sound dramatic, perhaps, but it’s the fastest rate of decline on record,” he says.Smaller cable groups, many of which have been in family control for years, are seen as likely takeover targets. Shares of Cablevision, the fourth-largest pay-TV operator controlled by New York’s billionaire Dolan family, surged 22 per cent last week on speculation about further consolidation. Privately owned Cox Communications is also seen as a target.In recent years, industry executives have argued that consolidation would help cable operators better compete against their rivals in the satellite and telecoms sectors, face off against programmers over rising content costs, and address the growing threat of so-called cord-cutters— consumers who turn to online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon and HBO Now.Cable companies have countered antitrust concerns by arguing that their geographical spread means that no single group has a national presence: the industry evolved in a fragmented way that gave large operators control of regional monopolies.But recently, growth in their broadband businesses has surpassed TV services. Comcast counted more internet subscribers than video customers for the first time in the second quarter of this year.The emerging primacy of broadband has changed the picture for the industry and, crucially, for regulators. Following Comcast’s withdrawal of its bid for TWC in April, Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the chief US media and telecoms watchdog, said the deal “would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation, including the ability of online video providers to reach and serve consumers”.With this in mind, the same regulatory concerns that derailed Comcast’s attempt to buy TWC may figure in scrutiny of any tie up between Charter and TWC.“We believe after the TWC-Comcast review, the government now believes Comcast is already too big, and Charter-TWC creates another Comcast,” says Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG Research. “It will get blocked.”As well as regulatory issues, Charter could face questions about how it is going finance a purchase of TWC, and also the level of indebtedness at the New York-based company after the takeover.Charter is expected to propose offering $195 a share for TWC — well above the $132.50 it bid for the New York-based company last year. TWC’s stock closed at $171.18 on Friday.In the current climate, size, price and leverage mean littleContinue readingHow Charter, which has a large debt load on its balance sheet, can finance a large cash offer for TWC may be a critical factor.Meanwhile, Mr Drahi has made a name for himself by using leverage to develop Altice’s European media empire — an approach he is now taking to the US.Altice only put $1.2bn of cash on the table to buy Suddenlink, in a deal that valued the target at $9.1bn including debt.There are questions about a possible counter bid by Altice for TWC. The most important one is whether, as such a new entrant to the US market, Mr Drahi is prepared to take on so much so quickly. The Suddenlink deal brings Altice’s shopping bill over the past 15 months to a staggering €36bn.But the other doubt is how he will fare when competing against his former mentor, Mr Malone, particularly if regulators are inclined to block a Charter purchase of TWC. For Mr Drahi, there is still much to play for.Additional reporting by Adam Thomson in Paris
41;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2015-05-25T17:30:08Z;Charter nears deal to buy Time Warner Cable;John Malone close to winning contest with Altice’s Patrick Drahi in US cable battle;Charter Communications is nearing a deal to acquire Time Warner Cable for about $55bn, said people familiar with the matter, in a victory for US tycoon John Malone— the so-called “cable cowboy” — over Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi of Altice.Charter, the third-largest US cable operator, is set to combine with its larger rival in a stock-and-cash deal that values shares in TWC at $195 each. The enterprise value of the transaction will be $78bn, which includes about $22bn in net debt.The deal comes amid sweeping changes in the US cable industry, with consumers increasingly watching their video on the internet, rather than on television sets. Consolidation could help cable operators compete more effectively with a new generation of online video services such as Amazon and Netflix, and also better withstand the growing pricing power of content providers.In a wave of dealmaking that has swept the sector, AT&T agreed to buy DirecTV for $48.5bn in 2014 and Charter itself lined up to acquire Bright House Networks, a smaller US cable operator, for $10.4bn earlier this year.As part of the TWC deal, Charter will complete its Bright House transaction and merge the three groups into a single entity that will have a total of 23m customers.That will make it the second-largest cable operator behind Comcast, which has 27m customers, including telephone and internet. Comcast, was thwarted by regulators in its own bid for TWC.TWC shareholders will have the option of $100 in cash and the remaining $95 in Charter stock or $115 in cash and the remaining $80 in stock.Mr Malone, the Colorado-based billionaire who has been a linchpin of cable consolidation for more than two decades, will inject $5bn of equity to help fund the deal through Liberty Broadband.Charter is prepared to pay 23 per cent more than Comcast had agreed to pay for TWC in 2014. The large premium is partly because of the late entry of France’s Altice in the bidding war for TWC.Altice’s defeat is not likely to signal a retreat by the European operator from further expansion in the US. The French group, which last week bought rural cable operator Suddenlink for $9.1bn, is expected to continue scouring for deals both in the US and in Europe.Aftershocks expected with Altice the potential loser as Malone’s Charter closes inContinue readingCable companies are the largest providers of high-speed broadband services in the US so the Charter-TWC deal is likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny because a successful deal would concentrate significant broadband power in one company.Regulatory opposition was a key factor in Comcast’s withdrawal of its own $45bn bid for TWC. The Philadelphia-based company had pursued TWC for more than a year but dropped the bid even as regulators indicated they would have blocked the transaction.The Charter-TWC deal has a $2bn break fee, which indicates that there are concerns that the deal could still fall apart over regulatory concerns.A definite agreement is expected to be announced before US markets open on Tuesday morning after the Memorial day break, but people familiar with the matter warned that the deal could still fail.Additional reporting by Matthew Garrahan in New York and Adam Thomson in Paris

Altice has lined up financing from banks including JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada, Nomura and Société Generale to support a possible bid, some of these people said.But one other person close to the company said Altice had only just struck a $9bn deal five days ago and the company usually studies a new market for several months before seeking further deals.Altice, TWC and Charter all declined to commentCharter had until last week appeared seemingly uncontested in its efforts to acquire its larger rival Time Warner Cable, until Altice made its first foray into the market by acquiring Suddenlink, the US’s seventh-largest cable operator.Following the deal, which valued Suddenlink at $9.1bn including debt, Altice fed speculation that further moves would follow soon by declaring that any company smaller than the largest US cable operator Comcast was a potential consolidation target.Time Warner Cable only last month saw a $45bn takeover attempt by Comcast, which was agreed in February 2014, collapse because of regulatory scrutiny.That deal was originally struck as Time Warner Cable sought to escape the clutches of Charter, which had previously offered $132.50 in cash and stock. Time Warner Cable asked Charter for $160 per share at the time but then agreed a deal with Comcast that valued it at $158.82 per share.Shares in Time Warner Cable rose 3.1 per cent to $171.18 on Friday, giving the company a market value of $48.4bn as speculation of a deal with either Altice or Charter continued.The takeover talks come amid sweeping changes in the US cable industry as consumer habits are shifting away from television sets in favour of mobile and broadband connections and as content providers are exerting greater pricing pressure on distributors for premium programming that keep their customers’ attention.By consolidating, cable operators look to cut costs and use their scale to combat prices set by content providers.Additional reporting by Shannon Bond
43;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2015-05-20T22:39:44Z;Altice: great white hope;Are seas of media big enough for both Patrick Drahi and John Malone?;Are the seas of media big enough for two sharks such as Patrick Drahi, the chairman of cable and telecom group Altice, and John Malone, chairman of Liberty Global? Both have monstrous acquisition appetites, and Mr Drahi learnt from Mr Malone — his former employer — to cut costs ruthlessly and use leverage to juice returns.Private equity firms have done this for years. They, too, must keep moving or die. But Messrs Drahi and Malone like exactly the same sort of prey. This makes life harder for both.Last month, Altice lost to Liberty in the bidding for Belgian mobile operator Base. Mr Drahi, undeterred, has glided into Mr Malone’s territory. On Wednesday, Altice announced its first foray into the US with the $9.1bn acquisition of 70 per cent of US cable company Suddenlink.The deal is what might be called a full Malone: pile on debt (Suddenlink will emerge with debt of six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) then cut costs (Altice hopes for $200m in savings). Then use cash flow to de-lever, clearing the way for the next purchase. The US will now represent 12 per cent of Altice’s sales. The plan is to approach 50 per cent.John Malone has a similar hunger. His US-listed Charter Communications has its beady eye on larger rival Time Warner Cable. No surprise that the share prices of both TWC and rival Cablevision rose sharply on the day, as did Altice’s, 11 per cent.Thus the valuation of acquiring any of the 10 or so companies Altice sees as ready for consolidation should rise further. This in an industry that already has challenges with retaining customers who increasingly watch their video on the internet. Altice, understandably, found Suddenlink’s strong broadband subscriber growth appealing. Altice management believes that it can reduce overhead enough to offset declining pay-TV subscribers.There is blood in the water. Prepare for the feeding frenzy.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
44;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2015-05-19T22:42:23Z;Altice in talks to enter US cable market;Bid for Suddenlink could pit Malone protégé against ‘cable king’;Altice, the European cable and mobile group, is in advanced discussions to acquire Suddenlink Communications, the seventh-largest US cable operator with almost 1.5m subscribers, according to people familiar with the matter.The value of the deal, which could be announced as soon as Wednesday morning, is likely to be in excess of the $6.6bn BC Partners and CPP Investment Board paid in 2012 to buy Suddenlink from another investor group, these people said.Altice and Suddenlink both declined to comment.In an industry where economies of scale between neighbouring networks offer big savings, cross-border cable deals are uncommon, sparking speculation that this may not be Altice’s last deal in the US.Patrick Drahi, Altice’s billionaire founder, once worked for John Malone, and has ambitions that are increasingly putting him in competition with those of the US “cable king”.People familiar with the matter said Altice recently lost out to Mr Malone’s Liberty Global European cable group in the bidding for Base, a Belgian mobile operator, and the two men could find themselves in competition again in US cable.Through his investment in Charter Communications, Mr Malone has helped spur recent dealmaking in a US cable market where growth is increasingly driven by broadband internet access rather than video. The failure of Comcast’s $45bn bid for Time Warner Cable has intensified speculation about follow-on deals.Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, said Suddenlink’s new owner could look at combining it with MediaCom, but he did not expect Altice to do a deal with a bigger cable company.1.5mNumber of subscribers at Suddenlink Communications, the seventh-largest US cable operatorAltice, which has a market value of almost €29bn, has made aggressive efforts to consolidate the French communications market, where it controls Numericable-SFR. Expectations of an eventual deal with Bouygues have ebbed, but Dexter Goei, chief executive, told the Financial Times in February that the group is on the hunt for bigger acquisitions.Suddenlink, led by chief executive Jerry Kent, has operations spanning Texas, West Virginia, Louisiana, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arizona and elsewhere.“Altice is effectively buying a broadband monopoly because there’s no fibre in (Suddenlink’s) area,” Mr Greenfield said, describing the company as “a well-run operation that is focused on the cash flow out of the broadband business.”“Rural cable has always had the benefit of not having the same level of competition. That’s why Suddenlink has been successful — they’ve really focused on being all about broadband,” he said.Altice is effectively buying a broadband monopoly because there’s no fibre in (Suddenlink’s) areaSuddenlink made headlines recently when it dropped Viacom’s channels in a high-profile dispute with the owner of MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon.Mr Kent has spoken about “an evolutionary shift in how the [US] pay-TV model works” as media owners, telecoms companies, cable groups and tech companies all experiment with online video and allowing consumers to watch content without cable or satellite subscriptions.He told the FT earlier this year: “With these shifts, it really has transformed from the old argument that content is king to the consumer is king.”News of the talks, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, came as Mr Malone told an interviewer there “would be very substantial synergies” in a combination between Liberty Global and Vodafone, the London-listed mobile operator.He cautioned, however, that such a deal could be hard to pull off. Vodafone was like “a big banana in a jar”, he told Bloomberg: “The question is: how do you get your hand out of the jar with the banana.”

Early last year, Time Warner Cable, hit by subscriber losses and under siege from a hostile bidder, signed a risky tie-up with Comcast. With that $45bn deal now scuttled by regulators, the operator (and its 11m television and 12m broadband subscribers) is back in play.A year ago, Robert Marcus, TWC’s new boss, rightly took heat for the $80m golden parachute that would have opened above him had the Comcast deal gone through. But while the deal was pending, he stabilised the business. TWC may have gone from desperate seller to kingmaker.When TWC jumped into the arms of Comcast, it was running away from the clutches of Charter, its smaller rival controlled by John Malone, the cable tycoon. Charter had offered TWC $132.50 a share — $83 in cash and the rest in Charter stock. TWC was unimpressed by the stock component. It asked for $160, with $100 in cash and the stock portion to be guaranteed against big fluctuations. That counterproposal was made moot by the Comcast merger.Today TWC shares trade at $158. As a multiple of forward earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) its shares trade at a robust 8 times. Charter’s offer last year was at around 7 times. There are ways to manipulate multiples with cost savings and tax benefits but the game of merger musical chairs has made the sector more pricey regardless.The thinking a year ago was that, despite its size, TWC would have to sell itself. However, TWC has halted the fall in subscriber numbers (in the first quarter it added 30,000 video subscribers along with 315,000 internet users).Today it could use that strength to be the buyer of smaller cable operators such as Bright House, which are too small to respond independently to the changes being brought to television consumption by internet video. The options are tantalising. Comcast’s ambitions were slowed by its size, something TWC must consider as it weighs its options.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
46;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2015-04-24T16:23:22Z;Comcast opponents hail open internet victory;TWC deal failure seen as sign of broadband users’ growing political clout;Comcast officially withdrew its $45bn offer for Time Warner Cable as the US justice department suggested it would have blocked the combination and hailed the failure of the deal as a victory for innovative content providers and streaming video services.Campaigners who had opposed the combination of America’s two largest cable and broadband providers from the start greeted its collapse as a sign of increasing support for an open internet in Washington.“The demise of this merger, alongside the net neutrality victory from earlier this year, mark the rise of internet users as a powerful political constituency that can no longer be ignored by elected officials and policy makers,” said Craig Aaron, chief executive of the lobby group Free Press.Regulators’ opposition supported the proposition that they had focused more on rapidly evolving digital technologies than on the cable video market.The mooted Comcast-TWC deal “would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation, including to the ability of online video providers to reach and serve consumers,” said Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.The DOJ similarly cited “significant concerns” that the tie-up would have made Comcast “an unavoidable gatekeeper for internet-based services that rely on a broadband connection to reach consumers”.Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company would “move on”.“Of course, we would have liked to bring our great products to new cities, but we structured this deal so that if the government didn’t agree, we could walk away,” he said.Neither company will have to pay a “break fee” following the deal’s collapse. But at least 11 banks worked on the deal and related transactions and stand to miss out on up to $325m in fees, according to estimates from Freeman & Co, the consulting group.This includes fees associated with the likely collapse of Comcast and TWC’s agreement to sell 3.9m subscribers to Charter Communications, the John Malone-backed cable operator, and Charter’s $10.4bn proposed purchase of Bright House Networks.TWC executives will also miss out on a hefty windfall. Rob Marcus, TWC’s chief executive, was in line to receive $79.9m in cash, equity and benefits if the deal had completed — despite only being appointed to the job two months before Comcast submitted its offer.Arthur Minson, TWC’s chief financial officer, had been set for a severance package worth an estimated $27m.Comcast’s next move is unclear but the company, which owns NBCUniversal, is likely to look for other deals, said Amy Yong, a Macquarie Securities analyst.Its options “could include expanding its footprint overseas, increasing its presence in media to boost NBCUniversal, or moving into the wireless business,” she said.Analysts and bankers expect Charter to make a renewed approach to TWC, which it had bid for last year before Comcast entered the picture.A combined Charter-TWC may then look to buy another company such as Cablevision, controlled by New York’s Dolan family. “Charter-Time Warner Cable is the most logical long-term buyer” for the 3m-subscriber company, said Ms Yong.The failure of the Comcast-TWC deal will not dent cable consolidation for long, said Susan Crawford, co-director of the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard University.“There will be more efforts in the cable industry to further consolidate but that’s not good for the country,” she said. “Operators face neither competition nor real oversight so they can essentially extract a private tax from all high-capacity uses of their networks.”

A total of $854.2bn worth of transactions was announced in the first three months of this year, an increase of 25 per cent from a year ago, writes Arash Massoudi in London.The pharma sector accounted for 13 per cent of all mergers and acquisitions, or four of the 10 biggest deals, in the first quarter. That included the $12.8bn all-cash takeover of US prescription manager Catamaran by healthcare provider UnitedHealth Group on Monday.The US has by far been the most active region with nearly half of all deal volumes.The week’s other big takeover came as US cable group Charter agreed to acquire Bright House Networks for $10.4bn in the latest round of consolidation among cable TV and broadband groups.The prevalence of large deals, such as ketchup maker Heinz’s deal to acquire US foods group Kraft, has masked the declining number of overall transactions.Deals in Europe, however, have lagged behind despite the positive effects of monetary stimulus from the ECB. A merger this week between Italy’s Yoox and Net-A-Porter of the UK to create an online luxury fashion group with annual sales of €1.3bn provided only a measure of comfort to dealmakers.Two large deals from Asia’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, helped the value of deals reached in the Asia-Pacific region to reach its highest levels since Thomson Reuters began tracking the data in 1980.● Related Lex note: UnitedHealth — changing the channelWave of deals as Charter makes $10.4bn Bright moveThe consolidation wave sweeping across the US cable industry is far from over. When Charter Communications, the cable company controlled by John Malone, announced its $10.4bn proposed acquisition of Bright House Networks this week, executives said further deals were possible as the sector braces for a digital future, writes Shannon Bond in New York.If the purchase goes through, Charter will become the US’s second-largest participant in cable and broadband provision “with even more firepower” for dealmaking, said Amy Yong, a media analyst at Macquarie.“There’s now more wriggle room for consolidation for Charter to triple in size.”Pay-TV operators have been bulking up to meet rising content costs.Now they face pressure from a fast-growing crop of internet video services that are attracting consumers.Deal with Net-a-Porter confirms Yoox chief as a tech visionaryContinue readingThe future for companies such as Charter and market leader Comcast, which is in the midst of its own $45bn mega-merger with Time Warner Cable, will lie in the provision of broadband services.Buying Bright House from privately owned Advance/Newhouse will reduce Charter’s leverage, freeing $6bn for it to borrow, the company said.Ms Yong said likely targets include smaller operators such as Suddenlink, which has 1.2m subscribers, MediaCom, with 1m, and Cable One, with 600,000.But the deal comes with a significant caveat: it is contingent not just on regulatory approval, but on completion of the Comcast-TWC transaction, which involves the sale of subscribers to Charter.● Related Lex note: Charter/ Bright House: harmonic convergenceHalve my pay? Laudable, says China bank chairmanThe chairman of China Construction Bank, the country’s second-largest lender, lauded a 50 per cent pay cut for him and his colleagues as “extremely correct”, seeking to downplay tension between unleashing market forces at state-owned groups and addressing public anger over excessive pay and privilege, writes Gabriel Wildau in Shanghai.In August the Communist party’s politburo approved a plan that reportedly capped pay at state-owned financial groups at $97,000 a year. At the same time, China’s top leaders have pledged to improve management of state-owned groups — whose return on assets trails that of privately owned counterparts — in part by freeing them from political constraints.Senior executives at large state-owned enterprises are appointed by the Communist party’s powerful central organisation department and carry ranks equivalent to cabinet ministers.Even before the pay curbs, executives at Chinese state groups earned much less than global peers. Wang Hongzhang, CCB chairman, earned pre-tax pay of $185,000 in 2014. That compares with $20m for JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon.Chinese bank analysts expect the curbs on cash payouts will ultimately be paired with reforms to allow them to offer stock options that link executive pay to company performance. Stock options are not allowed at state firms, but several publicly owned banks have said they may gain permission to experiment with equity-based incentive plans.● Related Lex note: China banks — a national serviceQuindell omits sale details on Slater & Gordon dealFor Quindell, it never rains, it pours — even when it should be sunny, writes Henry Mance in London.The law firm that once referred to itself as an insurance claims processor announced on Monday that it was selling most of its business for at least £637m to Slater & Gordon, the Australian legal group.That looked like good news for Quindell’s investors, who have had to contend with short-sellers’ claims that the company is running out of cash. Its shares have lost three-quarters of their value in the past year.But by Wednesday, Quindell was battling another communications disaster. The company had omitted to mention that the sale to Slater & Gordon also included two of its technology units, whose software is used to process insurance claims. That meant the deal was less advantageous to Quindell than first thought.Quindell — whose market capitalisation was once more than £2bn, and which aimed to join the FTSE 100 — will now be a different type of company. It will consist of a small number of software businesses, whose adjusted pre-tax profits were about £8.5m in the first half of last year. It will also share in any profits from industrial deafness cases that are being taken on by Slater & Gordon.Quindell still has two pieces of housekeeping to do: restating its accounts after PwC, the professional services firm, found that some practices were unacceptable; and changing its name.By Thursday, the stock market capitalisation was less than the initial cash it will get from S & G; a sign that investors are still cautious.● Related FT Alphaville post: Quindell corrects

48;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2015-04-01T12:10:17Z;Newhouse family enters cable’s top tier;Charter deal gives the low profile owners of Condé Nast greater sway over US broadband market;"The Newhouse family’s media empire spans the glossy magazines of Condé Nast, a clutch of local US newspapers and a controlling stake in Discovery Communications, home of cable networks TLC and Animal Planet.Now the family’s latest and biggest deal could propel billionaire brothers Si and Donald Newhouse into the top tier of the rapidly consolidating US cable television industry at a time of sweeping changes in the way media is created, distributed and consumed.Their private company, Advance Publications, is poised to become the largest shareholder in the nation’s second-largest cable operator, if Charter Communications’ $10.4bn bid for Advance’s Bright House Networks is successful.The structure of the proposed deal gives Advance a 26.3 per cent stake in the enlarged company, eclipsing John Malone’s Liberty Broadband, which would hold 19.4 per cent of the combined group. Advance will hand Liberty the larger vote, however, by transferring 6 percentage points of its voting stake to Mr Malone’s group.Despite its big media footprint, Advance keeps a low profile. The company, which Forbes estimates brought in $8bn in revenue in 2014, still maintains its official address at the headquarters of the Staten Island Advance, the newspaper that Si and Donald’s father, Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr, bought in 1922.Following their father’s death in 1979, the brothers expanded the company into book publishing — it owned Random House from 1980 to 1998 — and used the proceeds from the 1980 sale of their broadcast holdings to enter the emerging cable TV market. In recent years, Advance has looked to the next media markets taking a stake in Reddit, the online discussion forum.The Newhouses’ early move into cable proved lucrative. Bright House, which began life as a joint venture with Time Warner Cable and which Advance spun out as a wholly owned company in 2002, has become the US’s sixth-largest cable operator.The contrast is sharp against a print media sector that has been hit by eroding circulation and advertising revenues and a migration of readers to digital outlets. Condé Nast, where Si Newhouse remains chairman but has stepped back from daily duties, was forced to kill titles and cut costs as it, like its peers, struggled to navigate the industry’s changes.“Condé Nast until about 2008 was really seen as a hobby for the family,” says Steve Cohn, editor-in-chief of the Media Industry Newsletter. “They lost a lot of money in the 80s and 90s but it didn’t matter because the newspapers subsidised them. What changed all of this in 2008 was the double effect of the recession plus newspapers losing value because of digital. That really hit the Newhouses hard.”$8bnAdvance’s revenue in 2014, according to ForbesAdvance’s newspaper arm, the domain of Donald Newhouse, has made what Ken Doctor, media analyst at Newsonomics, calls an “overnight religious conversion to digital first”. It cut back some papers’ print schedules and rolled out free websites as many rivals adopted paywalls.Advance’s divergence from its peers continues as other media owners, including Gannett, News Corp, Time Warner and the Tribune Company hive off their legacy print businesses from more promising TV and digital operations.Advance’s strategy is increasingly in the hands of the family’s next generation: Donald’s son Steven is chairman of Advance.net, the digital strategy arm; Jonathan, a cousin, is chairman and chief executive of Condé Nast International; Steven Miron and Nomi Bergen, the children of another cousin, run Bright House.Condé Nast until about 2008 was really seen as a hobby for the family“The public companies are saying, get rid of these [print] assets, separate them from the fast-growing cable or digital assets or relatively stable businesses like broadcast,” Mr Doctor says. “For private companies, the question is, do they still want to be in this business and why?”The family’s fortune reflects its record as a timely trader of media assets. The challenge for the new generation of Newhouses will be whether they can extend that record as they spend the $2bn unlocked by the Bright House deal.Born to Jewish immigrants on New York’s Lower East Side, Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr built up a portfolio of newspapers.He bought dailies in Long Island and Newark, then expanded to Syracuse, New York, Portland, Oregon and New Orleans, ultimately owning more than 20 papers across the US. His strategy, Carol Felsenthal writes in Citizen Newhouse: Portrait of a Media Merchant, was to buy a city’s biggest newspaper, then its second title, drive up advertising rates and eventually merge the two.Magazines were added to the mix when Newhouse bought Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue, in 1959 at what he said was the suggestion of his wife. Advance also bought radio and local television stations and operated a news wire service.Newhouse’s sons — 87-year-old S.I. Newhouse Jr, known as Si, and 85-year-old Donald — now serve as Advance’s chairman and president, respectively. Forbes estimates their net worth at more than $8bn each.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil"
49;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2015-03-31T17:18:59Z;Charter/ Bright House: harmonic convergence;Who needs debt when equity has doubled in two years;Despite resilient corporate debt markets, paying in stock is suddenly fashionable for big deals. Last week Warren Buffett and his private equity firm of choice, 3G Capital, merged their company Heinz with Kraft using mostly shares, sharply reducing Heinz’s leverage. On Tuesday, US cable company Charter Communications, chaired by noted junk bond fan John Malone, borrowed the Heinz/Kraft template, announcing a $10.4bn acquisition of competitor Bright House Communications.Bright House is a cable operator with 2m subscribers (against 4.3m for Charter). It is privately held by media conglomerate Advance/Newhouse. The Charter/Bright House tie-up is the latest round of musical chairs in US cable and broadband industry. The tune should stop following regulatory approval and closing of the Comcast/ Time Warner Cable mega-merger. Charter in a separate, previously announced transaction, is acquiring subscribers from Comcast/TWC as well as investing in another cable company being spun-off from Comcast/TWC.The quarter stake that Advance/Newhouse is taking in Charter will result in a more complicated structure than in the Heinz/Kraft deal. Advance/Newhouse and Charter will form a partnership to which both contribute their cable assets. Advance/Newhouse then receives $2bn in cash, $5.9bn in partnership units that exchange into common stock, and most interestingly, $2.5bn in preferred units that pay a 6 per cent coupon but can be converted into shares at a 40 per cent premium to the current Charter share price. And like Mr Buffett and 3G Capital, Mr Malone’s Liberty Broadband vehicle will buy another $700m in stock in Charter to maintain a 19 per cent stake.These machinations (partly driven by tax) will take Charter’s net debt/cash flow ratio below a reasonable 4 times. Charter shares have doubled since Mr Malone invested two years ago. With that kind of rally, equity can be cheaper than debt.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
50;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2015-03-31T17:11:26Z;Charter agrees to buy Bright House for $10.4bn;Deal is latest in consolidation round sweeping the market for cable TV and broadband;"Charter Communications, the fourth largest cable company in the US, has agreed to buy Bright House Networks in a $10.4bn deal that is contingent on Comcast’s $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable being cleared by regulators.The deal, the latest in a consolidation round that has swept the market for cable television and broadband provision, brings together two of America’s richest men: John Malone, the “cable cowboy”, who owns 26 per cent of Charter, and Si Newhouse, whose Advance/Newhouse group controls Bright House.The deal is contingent on several conditions, including the completion of Charter’s deal to acquire cable subscribers from Comcast. But the shadow of Comcast’s proposed acquisition of TWC looms over the deal: if regulators block it, the agreement to sell subscribers to Charter would be jeopardised, as would the planned Charter takeover of Bright House.But if the Comcast-TWC deal is cleared, the Charter-Bright House combination will proceed, according to people close to the companies.Comcast, the world’s largest cable and broadband provider, hopes to acquire TWC — the second largest cable provider — but has run into a storm of opposition from rival companies, politicians and consumer groups. Critics of the deal argue that the combination will create a group with too much control over the market for broadband provision.People close to the Charter-Bright House deal told the FT the transaction was a vote of confidence in the likelihood that Comcast’s takeover of TWC, announced more than a year ago, would be approved. “We look at the world going forward with the [Comcast/TWC] deal being done,” said a person involved in the Charter-Bright House agreement.But analysts were more cautious. “We have this very complex approval process going on which doesn’t seem to be going in Comcast’s direction,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. “We think the deal will get blocked or Comcast will be unhappy with the terms that they have to agree to and will walk away.”If the deal does go ahead, Charter’s acquisition of Comcast subscribers should proceed.Under the structure of the Charter-Bright House agreement, Liberty Broadband, Mr Malone’s holding company, will inject $700m of equity into the combined company.Advance will receive $2bn in cash as well as shares in the enlarged entity as part of the deal. The group, which also owns the Condé Nast publishing group, will retain a stake in the enlarged company of 26.3 per cent; Liberty Broadband will hold 19.4 per cent and the rest will be held by existing Charter shareholders.Advance will give six percentage points of its voting stake to Liberty as part of the deal, handing Liberty the largest voting stake in the company. Each company will take three board seats in the combined group.Charter said it would become the second-largest cable operator in the US, as the acquisition would add about 2m customers in Florida, Alabama, Indiana and California. “This acquisition enhances our scale,” said Tom Rutledge, chief executive of Charter Communications.Bright House had annual revenue of $3.8bn in 2014, compared to Charter’s $9.1bn.Goldman Sachs, LionTree, Wachtell and Kirkland & Ellis advised Charter, while UBS, Sabin, Bermant & Gould and Sullivan & Cromwell advised Bright House.Shares in Charter closed up 5.3 per cent at $193.11 on Monday and have risen 58 per cent in the past 12 months.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in London and Shannon Bond in New York"
51;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Healthcare and techs to seal quarter gains;S&P 500 in longest winning streak since 1998;It was a choppy ride but US equities ended the first quarter of the year slightly higher as strong gains from the healthcare and technology sectors help offset the retreat in energy stocks.Although the S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent to 2,067.89 on Tuesday, the large-cap index still posted a 0.4 per cent gain for the first three months of the year.The advance marks the index’s ninth straight quarter of gains and its longest winning streak since 1998.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 3.5 per cent for the quarter, despite dipping lower on Tuesday, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.3 per cent lower for the quarter.Healthcare stocks were this quarter’s big winners thanks to the flurry of deals that has helped propel the S&P 500 healthcare index 6.2 per cent higher.The consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors have also outperformed with the rebound in US consumer spending boosting retailers and dealmaking between major food producers turbocharging shares of companies such as Kraft.But with the dollar bull run showing little sign of abating and valuations for many stocks running at multiyear highs, US stocks could see more corrective pauses in the months ahead.Investors are braced for a sharp slowdown in first-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies, which start reporting in the middle of April.According to Frost Investment Advisers, which manages $10bn, earnings are expected to drop 4.6 per cent in the quarter from a year earlier as the strong dollar — up 9 per cent this year — takes a bite out of companies’ overseas earnings and profits from major energy groups continue to slide.“We continue to see US equities underperforming as we approach Fed tightening,” said analysts at Barclays.In the meantime, investors looking for more clues on the timing of the first US interest rate increase had a couple more economic data points to pore over on Tuesday.The latest reading from the S&P/Case-Shiller index showed that home prices in the 20 largest US cities were up 4.6 per cent in January from a year earlier, the biggest gain since September.Elsewhere, a report on US consumer confidence showed a rebound in March that topped expectations as Americans grew more optimistic about future incomes and job prospects.A consumer sentiment index from the Conference Board rose to 101.3 from an upwardly revised 98.8 in February, tracking less than 3 points below a seven-and-a-half-year high hit in January.Among the major movers on Tuesday, Charter Communications rose 5 per cent to $193.11 after it struck a deal to buy US cable company Bright House Networks for $10.4bn.CBRE Group, the world’s largest commercial real estate services company by revenue, jumped 6.3 per cent to $38.71 on news that it has agreed to acquire Johnson Controls’ facilities management business for $1.47bn.
52;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-12-22T18:07:32Z;Healthcare at heart of robust year in M&A;Controversial tax inversion deals carried sector to highest volumes since crisis;"Market wisdom has it that most takeovers destroy value in the long-run. But the world’s largest companies seem to have had little time for history lessons in 2014. In all, there were 96 deals worth more than $5bn completed over the past 12 months. Together, their value was around $1.2tn, or 37 per cent of the overall volume of corporate transactions.In what soon became the best year for dealmaking since the financial crisis — measured on a total volume of $3.34tn — the US led the way, spurred by favourable economic conditions and central bank monetary policy. But Europe and Asia finished the year strongly as well.Dealmaking zeal can also be gauged by the transactions that failed. So-called withdrawn mergers and acquisitions totalled $662bn — up from $285bn last year — in a sign of increased ambition on the part of acquirers.Healthcare, in particular, was a sector of intense activity in terms of deals done and attempted — until the US Treasury took steps in September to curb tax inversions, whereby US companies acquire foreign companies and their favourable tax domiciles.Tax inversions proved one of the year’s most controversial deal drivers. US government action to stop the practice ultimately scuppered the biggest agreed healthcare deal in spectacular fashion: US pharmaceutical company AbbVie dropped its planned $54bn tie-up with the UK’s Shire. That failed deal slowed the momentum behind inversion attempts. Medtronic’s $42bn acquisition of Covidien remains the largest of the tax inversions completed in 2014.“A lot of healthcare announced M&A value was inversion driven but the actual number of completed deals was far less, as a couple of the major deals did not get done,” says Stefan Jentzsch, partner at Perella Weinberg Partners. “It is hard to predict whether healthcare is going to have as big a year in 2015.”Investors, meanwhile, challenged the principle that deals destroyed value. In many cases, acquirers’ share prices soared when deals were announced. Shareholders appear to have grown weary of share buybacks and chose to reward companies using cheap financing to make acquisitions.Global private equity-backed deals accounted for $270bn of the M&A activity in 2014 — an increase of 8 per cent on the previous year but still well below the levels seen before the financial crisis in 2007See belowBut big was not always beautiful. Rising equity markets emboldened activist shareholders and corporate raiders. Many companies were forced to pre-empt or respond to pressure applied by demanding investors.Hewlett-Packard and eBay, two large technology businesses that had lost their edge in recent years, both revealed plans to break up in a matter of a few October days. Global miners BHP Billiton and Vale unveiled plans to spin off assets. Germany’s Eon, one of Europe’s largest electricity companies, also said it would it split into two. “We have seen a marked change in tone during the past few months,” says Colm Donlon, co-head of M&A for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Morgan Stanley. “Our clients are now very focused on portfolio clarity, only wanting to own or keep the best assets, and in moving ahead on larger strategic transactions that had previously been sidelined.”Activists such as Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb and Nelson Peltz persist. Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square even listed a public vehicle in Europe to give his funds greater longevity. But attempts to transfer confrontational, US-style activism to Europe have not met with success.Tim Emmerson, partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, puts it down to UK and EU disclosure and insider dealing laws, and the passive culture of European shareholders. “We will definitely see US specialists continue to put effort into it, but the big question of 2015 will be who manages to make it work,” he says.Consolidation remained a core theme. Holcim and Lafarge, two European cement heavyweights, combined to form a powerhouse. Cigarette makers Lorillard and Reynolds, in which British American Tobacco owns a significant minority stake, struck a complicated four-party deal that also involved Imperial Tobacco. US cable giants Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which had been pursued by rival Charter Communications, tied the knot. Charter walked away with some of the deal’s disposals.However, the complexities involved in executing these sorts of deals should not be underestimated, bankers warn. Comcast is still fighting for clearance from regulators. “One takeaway from this year is that very large, industry transforming deals are more complex and take a longer time to execute than is appreciated, so expectations of further consolidations in parts of the consumer space are overstated,” says Alejandro Vicente, head of Emea consumer investment banking at JPMorgan Chase.Some European companies, particularly German groups, sought growth by snapping up US rivals this year. Merck, Siemens and ZF Friedrichshafen found US partners in three deals with values greater than $10bn. But Europe’s economic problems were not such that US companies avoided the region: General Electric acquired France’s industrial national champion Alstom.“Europe has such a large profit pool that, even with weaker economies, the cash flow from the region’s businesses are still stable,” argues Roland Phillips, partner at Centerview Partners. He expects similar interest in 2015.Among the M&A advisers, Goldman Sachs ranked first in both volumes and fees. Boutique investment banks such as Centerview Partners, Lazard, Evercore and London-based Robey Warshaw made outsized splashes.Yoel Zaoui, a former senior Goldman Sachs dealmaker who runs London-based Zaoui & Co with his brother Michael, says boutiques differ in size and focus. “The key is the quality, experience, drive and reputation of the senior people driving them. In that respect, you can have a small business in size that is a very relevant business in the industry.”My year in M&A: top dealmakers reflectNatalie Blyth

With more stability, it will be easier to agree on terms.”One sign of hope for private equity dealmaking next year came in mid-December, when BC Partners won a hotly contested auction for pet food company Petsmart, paying $8.7bn in the largest leveraged buyout of 2014. Dealmakers suggest it was reminiscent of “classic” buyouts, as it involved a business producing steady cash flows, which will generally be easier to lever up with borrowing.However, the big banks active in debt capital markets, including JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, did not take part in the financing for any of the auction bidders. “Tons of banks fell away,” says one banker involved in the transaction.Competition for new deals is expected to be more intense next year, as private equity investors seek uses for their cash. In 2014, they took advantage of favourable debt and stock market conditions to list companies, sell down stakes, and borrow at low rates to pay themselves generous dividends. In doing so, they returned over $500bn to their investors.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Today’s M&A deals add value in most cases / From Scott Moeller"
53;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Comcast: Broadband battleground;The group may become the world’s largest media company. Content companies are worried;"Ralph Roberts, the 94-year-old co-founder of Comcast, was seriously ill last year, spending 85 days in bed after being stricken by double pneumonia. His son, Brian, Comcast’s chief executive, visited regularly to check on him and update him about the company — the largest cable television and broadband provider in the US and the owner of the NBCUniversal broadcast network and film studio.During one visit, Mr Roberts told his father that Comcast had been approached to see if it was interested in buying The Washington Post. “My dad’s lying there and we agreed that the newspaper business wasn’t a good fit,” he recalls, sitting in his office at Comcast Center, the gleaming 58-floor skyscraper that towers over Philadelphia.The Post was eventually bought by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But Mr Roberts had also been approached by Glenn Britt, the late chief executive of Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable operator, to discuss a deal. “I said to my dad: ‘What about Time Warner Cable?’” recalls Mr Roberts. “His eyes opened. He said: ‘For that, I’ll get better’.”The elder Mr Roberts went on to recover from the double pneumonia and Comcast made an audacious $45bn offer for Time Warner Cable, grabbing the company from under the nose of John Malone, the “cable cowboy”, whose Charter Communications had pursued TWC for months.The proposed takeover is being studied by regulators, who are expected to decide whether to approve it by early next year. If the deal goes ahead, it will create the world’s biggest provider of broadband and cable television services, reshaping the media landscape in the process. The prospect of an enlarged Comcast — which will leapfrog Walt Disney as the world’s largest media company — has sparked anxiety among content companies. The recent, shortlived $71bn bid for Time Warner, owner of HBO and CNN, from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox was driven in part by a need to create a company big enough to stare down Comcast in negotiations on distribution over its cable systems.A combined Comcast-TWC will supply some of the largest metropolitan areas in the US with cable television services and, more significantly, will be the largest provider of fixed-line, high-speed internet access. More than 40 per cent of homes with speeds of 10 mbps — which is necessary to view streaming video services such as Netflix — will get their broadband service from Comcast-TWC. For fixed-line homes capable of receiving speeds of 50 mbps, the combined company’s share will jump to at least 50 per cent, according to Free Press, a non-profit group that campaigns for a free and open internet.Comcast has developed rapidly over the past 50 years, becoming one of the world’s largest media groups. From one acquisition to the next, it now serves customers across America and has a powerful position in cable video and the supply of high-speed internet services. Its origins, though, were rather more humble.The proposed merger of the top two cable providers has generated a storm of protest. Companies such as Netflix, Discovery Communications and other critics have lined up to urge the Federal Communications Commission to block the deal because the combined companies will wield too much market power.“If it is permitted to merge with TWC, for at least half of American households the only choice for high-capacity internet will be Comcast,” says Susan Crawford, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School and the author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.She equates Comcast’s power in high-speed internet provision with the great monopolies of the past, such as the railroad barons of the late 19th century.There is “no consumer benefit” to the Comcast-TWC combination, she says, urging the Department of Justice, which is also reviewing the deal, to act. “It has a public-interest standard to uphold and if it is driven by the facts it will block the merger. This is about freedom of information flows in America.”Want to start an online business that uses bandwidth? You will have to go to ComcastTo understand why Comcast and its expansion plans have attracted such opposition, it is necessary to look at the company’s origins and its place within the evolution of the US cable industry. American homes used to get their television signals over the airwaves. That began to change, slowly, in the 1940s and 1950s in areas that were hard for broadcast signals to reach. Originally called “community antennae television”, cable systems were developed that received a single TV signal and distributed it to multiple homes. Cable was an efficient way to pump multiple channels into individual homes and, over the years, the number of systems grew exponentially.Comcast was born in 1963 when Ralph Roberts, an entrepreneur from Philadelphia, bought American Cable Systems, a 1,200 subscriber cable television operation in Tupelo, Mississippi. It was not his first company: previous ventures included a revolutionary golf putter, a men’s accessories business and a stint working for Muzak, selling the inoffensive recorded ditties played in shops and lifts.The cable business model reminded him of Muzak, in that once an initial capital investment had been made revenue would recur — and keep recurring. “You put up a tower and some equipment,” Ralph Roberts told William Novak, the author of the official Comcast history, An Incredible Dream, “and they paid you every month.” Cable, he added, “looked to me like the greatest business in the world”.Another reason it was, and remains, an appealing business is because a crucial element of the industry in Ralph Roberts’ era still holds true today: the lack of competition.“The cable industry has never competed against itself,” says Leo Hindery, the former president of TCI, the cable operator that was eventually sold to AT&T and then to Comcast. The capital cost of laying cables was so prohibitive that once an operator had laid pipes in a particular street or neighbourhood, it effectively had that area to itself.Satellite television changed that dynamic. “Satellite could paint the whole sky,” says Mr Hindery, referring to operators such as DirecTV and Dish, which were unconstrained by the limits of physical cable infrastructure. With satellite’s coast-to-coast reach cable operators had to bulk up and, starting in 1998, they did in a period Mr Hindery calls the “summer of love”. Individual operators such as Comcast swapped systems with other providers — “at least two-thirds of the nation’s subscribers changed hands”, says Mr Hindery.Consolidation continued apace as operators linked individual cable systems, increasing the size of their regional markets. “We moved from an industry that once had 100 operators to 50, then 20,” says Mr Hindery. Fast forward to 2014 and there are even fewer operators; if the Time Warner Cable sale is cleared, the number of cable companies serving 5m or more subscribers drops from four to three.The prospect of the largest operator in a particular industry buying the second largest would normally set regulatory alarm bells ringing but Comcast executives are confident the deal will be cleared. “There is nothing in this transaction that will lead to a reduction of competition in any [US] markets,” says David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice- president — and the architect of the company’s political and regulatory strategy.Comcast operates across a swath of the northeastern US in cities such as Philadelphia and Boston, as well as Florida and parts of the west coast. Time Warner Cable has markets that include New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. “There is no competitive overlap and there is not a single consumer in America who will have less choice after this transaction,” says Mr Cohen.Comcast’s size and heft in the market for broadband provision is where opponents of the deal believe the TWC transaction could fall foul of antitrust authorities.“If the deal goes through it will make Comcast the gatekeeper over the future of communications,” says Craig Aaron, the president and chief executive of Free Press. “Want to start an online business that uses bandwidth? You will have to go to Comcast.”Comcast points out that it faces competition in broadband from a range of players: telecoms companies such as Verizon and AT&T offer broadband — as well as television services — to their subscribers. Google, which has laid high-speed fibre lines in Kansas City, also has designs on the broadband market.Yet none of these operators has as many customers as Comcast. The company and its cable peers have an inbuilt advantage over potential competitors from other sectors: the networks and cables they laid over the past decades. It turned out that the cables laid by Comcast to carry TV signals were also big enough to carry broadband signals. Broadband is on the way to becoming Comcast’s biggest business — and also gives it a natural hedge against “cord-cutting” cable customers who are cancelling their monthly video subscriptions.Younger viewers that have grown up watching online video may balk at expensive bundles of channels sold by the likes of Comcast and its competitors. But if these viewers want to watch streaming video offered by Netflix or new “over the top” services announced last week by CBS, the broadcast network, and Time Warner’s HBO channel, they will still need a fast internet connection, which is where the largest provider in the US — Comcast — comes in.Most American homes lack competitive choices for fixed high-speed internetWhether the FCC will allow Comcast to complete the TWC deal is up for debate, although Comcast has taken steps to head off potential concerns. “We’re going to sell and spin off about 4m customers,” says Mr Roberts, referring to a complex deal the company struck with Charter Communications. The move will keep Comcast’s share of the cable video market below a 30 per cent limit recommended by the FCC.Prof Crawford says Comcast reducing its share of the video market is “irrelevant”. The bigger issue, she says, is its power in broadband. “What really matters and what is really bringing profit to cable these days is infrastructure and the delivery of information.”Comcast, though, is relaxed about its share of the broadband market; Mr Cohen does not anticipate any regulatory concerns. This, he says, is because there no such thing as a “national” broadband market: consumers buy their services from local providers. “You can’t buy broadband as a consumer nationally. Relevant markets in antitrust [regulations] are driven by people’s ability to purchase services in the relevant market.”The FCC is taking increased interest in the broadband marketplace. Tom Wheeler, its chairman, recently expressed concern over the lack of competition in high-speed broadband provision. “Most American homes lack competitive choices for fixed high-speed internet,” he said. “Where meaningful competition is not available, the commission will work to create it.”Laying out a policy framework to deliver more competition, he added that “where meaningful competition is not available, the commission will work to create it”.It is unclear what this stance means for the deal; Comcast will have to wait to find out. What is clear is that the future of the media industry — which for so long has been gripped by a debate about whether content or distribution is “king” — will be contested on a broadband battlefield. A bigger Comcast will be ready for that fight.The Roberts family: Maintaining control and forging political linksFor all the big takeovers it has pulled off — AT&T Broadband for $72bn including debt in 2002; NBCUniversal for $30bn in 2013 — Comcast remains tightly controlled by the Roberts family.Brian Roberts’ stake in Comcast is worth about $1.2bn. But the company has a dual-class share structure; with about a third of the voting stock, he has effective control over the company that his father started with Julian Brodsky and Daniel Aaron.There was never any doubt that he would follow Ralph Roberts into the company. “If you found me at 10 and asked me: what do you want to do? I would have said ‘I want to work with my dad’,” Roberts says.As a young man he worked for Comcast in a range of roles — sales, marketing and “climbing poles”. “It was a fantastic apprenticeship,” he says.He was made president of Comcast when he was 30 and went on to oversee the most intense period of the company’s growth. “When I got out of college in 1981 we had almost $40m in revenue. We generated about $65bn in revenue last year and the business continues to grow.”The company’s growth has been matched by the forging of deep political connections. David Cohen, its regulatory and political chief, has hosted several fundraisers for Barack Obama. (The president joked at a 2013 fundraiser at Mr Cohen’s home that he had visited so frequently “the only thing I haven’t done in this house is have [the Passover] Seder dinner”). Mr Roberts has played golf with the president at Martha’s Vineyard.The influence of Ralph Roberts continues to shape Comcast. The elder Mr Roberts was himself profoundly affected by the Great Depression; as a child he saw his father lose everything. Ralph “always liked to keep a lot of cash and a lot of debt on the balance sheet”, says Mr Roberts. “But he liked to keep the cash because we’ll always be ready for a rainy day and with cash we can also be opportunistic.“If you lived through the Depression it changes you forever. You live your life assuming everything you have can be taken away from you. And that’s how Comcast got built.”This article has been amended since original publication. Professor Susan Crawford says at least half of all American households will only be able to receive high-capacity internet from Comcast, not two-thirds as previously stated."
54;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-07-29T17:01:20Z;Windstream soars on Reit spin-off plan;;The US telecoms sector climbed on Tuesday after a small wireline network announced plans to spin off part of its business into a real estate investment trust, establishing a new way for rivals to derive value from assets.Windstream, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, said it would turn its existing fibre and copper network, as well as other fixed real estate assets, into a publicly traded Reit, allowing the new company to avoid federal income taxes.The approach has been tried by cellular tower operators like American Tower, but not by a larger cable or fibre optic network owner.Windstream said its board of directors had received a favourable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, although it will still require regulatory approval.“Given the IRS approval, we expect other companies may explore the possibility of spinning off their wireline assets into a similar structure,” Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said.Analysts with Credit Suisse said AT&T and Verizon were likely evaluating a similar strategy, but would “have the advantage of waiting to see how the Windstream transition plays out”.The conversion to a Reit comes as many companies, particularly those in the pharmaceutical sector, evaluate means to reduce taxes. Several, including AbbVie, are hoping to redomicile overseas to reduce their tax bill.The news sent shares of S&P 500 listed telecom operators broadly higher. Windstream soared 12 per cent to $11.83, AT&T rose 3 per cent to $36.59, Verizon advanced 1 per cent to $51.97 and Telephone & Data Systems increased 5 per cent to $25.92.UPS was under pressure after the company, which together with FedEx and Deutsche Post’s DHL dominates the business of shipping parcels around the world, cut its profit forecast for the year as it invests in its business.The company said it would expand operations on the day after Thanksgiving in the US as part of a $175m increase in operating expenses. UPS executives hope to avoid a surge in demand last year that left it incapable of meeting delivery targets.Earnings per share will now be between $4.90 and $5.00 this year, UPS said, compared to a previous forecast of $5.05 to $5.30 a share.Shares of UPS are among the worst performing on the Dow Jones transport index this year. The company declined 4 per cent on Tuesday to $98.86 while rival FedEx dropped 2 per cent to $147.14.A 17 per cent slide in second-quarter profits and tepid third-quarter earnings guidance from Herbalife sent its shares 14 per cent lower to $58.35.Net income at the nutrition supplement company declined to $120m, or $1.31 per share, shy of Wall Street expectations. Sales climbed 7 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn.Herbalife has sought to keep shareholders on board amid its battle with Mr Ackman, the founder of the Pershing Square hedge fund who claims the company is a pyramid scheme.The company, which denies Mr Ackman’s allegations, accelerated its $1.5bn share buyback plan earlier this year.Both the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched a probe into the allegations.Darden shares rose 4 per cent to $46.88 after the company said Clarence Otis, who has served as Darden’s chief executive for nearly a decade, would step down at the end of the year amid an ongoing tussle with activist investor Starboard Value.The shake-up within Darden’s executive suite came as the company entered settlement discussions with Starboard regarding the firm’s proxy contest.Darden, which owns the Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, said it would trim the list of nominees to its board of directors to ensure at least three Starboard nominees are elected at the company’s annual general meeting in September.Overall, US equity markets trended lower despite rising consumer confidence figures. The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,969.95 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4 per cent to 16,912.11. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 4,442.70.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

This time it’s safe to chew. On Monday it said it would snare 4m cable TV subscribers that are up for grabs as part of the Comcast/Time Warner Cable tie-up announced in February. Charter lost out to Comcast back then. But the demands of antitrust authorities breed strange bedfellows. To win regulatory approval (Comcast/TWC will still have nearly a third of the US cable market) Comcast needs Charter’s help. Whatever bitterness that Charter held towards Comcast for snatching TWC first should now subside. Charter’s shares are up nearly a fifth since rumours of this latest deal broke 10 days ago.After the multiple stages of its deal with Comcast/TWC, Charter will own or manage 8m cable subscribers, about double its current level. The first two steps are straightforward: Charter pays $7bn to acquire 1.4m former TWC customers and, separately, the two sides exchange 1.6m subscribers to better line up their respective regional exposures.The next part of the deal is more intriguing. Comcast/TWC will create a new public company for housing 2.6m subscribers. This company would initially be two-thirds owned by Comcast shareholders, and the rest by Charter (which will also manage the subscribers). The new company will have relatively high leverage of 5 times debt to cash flow, around the same as Charter and more than twice the level of Comcast. Thus, investors interested in US cable can choose between highly-leveraged bets (Charter and the new SpinCo) or the moderately-indebted Comcast.Clever structures aside, it is not obvious why this deal will assuage regulators. Comcast becomes an only somewhat smaller juggernaut. And Charter becomes the ironic cheerleader for Comcast, which stole the object of its affection.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
56;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;$20bn Comcast deal may not sway regulators;;Comcast’s $20bn deal with Charter Communications to divest 3.9m subscribers is not likely to change the odds that regulators clear its $41bn deal for Time Warner Cable but it puts Comcast in a better light for showing a willingness to compromise, say people familiar with the matter.Announced on Monday, the Charter agreement is contingent on regulators approving a tie-up that would give Comcast-TWC control of about a third of the US pay television and broadband markets.Comcast had said it was prepared to shed 3m subscribers when announcing its bid for TWC in February, the second-largest US cable operator.The Comcast-TWC merger is expected to face tough scrutiny by the Department of Justice, which is reviewing it for antitrust issues, and the Federal Communications Commission, which considers the public interest. The House judiciary committee will also conduct a hearing.“Regulators weren’t going to settle for arm-waving about divestitures. They need to be able to review concrete details about which systems need to be divested and where,” said Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson Research. “This checks the box with respect to completeness of the application. That is all it really does.”A US court of appeals has twice rejected FCC attempts to impose a 30 per cent cap on cable ownership. Therefore, Comcast’s deal to give up enough subscribers to fall below 30 per cent is seen as more of a good-faith gesture which could be a good starting point for negotiations, people familiar with the matter said.It also makes Charter a stronger competitor in cable, potentially easing antitrust concerns. Regulators would probably impose additional conditions to approve the TWC deal, but Comcast is showing its willingness to compromise by striking the agreement with Charter, the people said.Comcast has also said it would abide by the FCC’s net neutrality rules, even though those standards were rejected by the courts in January. The agency has proposed new rules that it hopes fits the court’s criteria.“This is definitely a sign of good faith that they are not trying to monopolise the industry,” said Amy Yong, a Macquarie analyst.February 2014: Comcast has ended a six-month battle to consolidate the fragmented US pay-TV market.The three-part transaction is one of the largest subscriber swaps in US cable history and would transform the country’s pay-TV and broadband infrastructure, doubling Charter’s footprint to create the country’s second-largest cable operator behind Comcast.First, Charter would acquire 1.4m TWC video subscribers for $7.3bn in cash. Second, the two companies would swap 1.6m TWC video subscribers and 1.6m Charter video subscribers. Finally, Comcast would spin-off about 2.5m video subscribers into a new company, of which Charter would acquire about 33 per cent.“This transaction today gives federal, state and local regulatory bodies early identification of our divestiture process, which we believe should be helpful in our efforts to gain approval for our merger with Time Warner Cable,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive.Critics said Monday’s announcement did little to allay concerns that Comcast would have unprecedented market power to raise prices and control the development of TV, broadband and media.Randy Falco, chief executive of Hispanic broadcaster Univision and a former NBC executive, blasted the deal for eliminating competition and said it would be bad for Hispanic audiences.“The fact is that there is not one other media or telecommunications company that has the level of vertical integration of Comcast – I’m talking about video, broadband and content – not Google, not AT&T, not Facebook, not the satellite providers,” he said. “And when it comes to video and broadband, they are by far and away the largest provider in the country.”“We’ve known from the day that the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal was announced that Comcast intended to divest some subscribers, so this doesn’t change anything,” added Democratic senator Al Franken. “The fact remains that Comcast will have unprecedented power in the television and broadband markets, and I’m very concerned that Comcast will use that power to squeeze competitors and consumers.”Michael Copps, a former Democratic member of the FCC who now serves as a special adviser to Common Cause’s media and democracy reform initiative, said: “It is still way too big, way too much, and I am still of the opinion that the deal should be clearly and promptly shut down.”A Comcast spokesman said: “Comcast has had an extraordinary, long-standing commitment to Hispanic programming, and through the transaction with Time Warner Cable we are committed to bringing high-quality Hispanic content to millions of additional Americans.”At the close Comcast shares were up 1.4 per cent at $51.70. Charter shares were up 7.7 per cent to $140.05.The transaction, which involves subscribers mostly in the Midwest and southeastern US, values the assets at about 7.125 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation – below the 7.9 multiple for Comcast’s TWC deal.Comcast stressed the deal would preserve the $1.5bn in cost savings and broader strategic rationale it had outlined for its TWC deal.“This already is more than what they were expecting to give up,” Ms Yong said. “If they give up more, there will be some investor concerns on the $1.5bn in synergies they have outlined.”
57;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-04-26T20:07:16Z;Comcast and Charter poised to agree $20bn cable subscriber deal;;"Comcast and Charter Communications are close to agreeing an intricate deal that would reshape the US pay-TV market and draw a line under a lengthy power-struggle at the top of the cable industry.The transaction, which has a total value of about $20bn, is contingent on Comcast being granted regulatory approval for its proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable, the country’s third largest cable company with about 12m subscribers.The three-part deal, which could be announced as early as next week, involves Comcast, the US’ largest cable operator, divesting 3.9m subscribers, or about 18 per cent of its 22m subscriber network, according to people familiar with the matter.First, Comcast would sell Charter about 1.4m subscribers from TWC’s network; it would also place 2.5m subscribers in a new company in which Charter will own a roughly 35 per cent stake. Finally, Charter and Comcast would swap about 1.65m subscribers.It is unclear exactly which subscribers will be swapped or the exact geographies under discussion. The swap would be one of the largest ever in the US cable industry.The FT previously reported that discussions were ongoing over a deal.If the three-part deal is agreed, it would mark a victory of sorts for Charter, the company backed by cable industry veteran John Malone, which was thwarted in its attempt to buy TWC in February after Comcast’s bid emerged.A combined Comcast-TWC would supply up to 40 per cent of US households with high-speed internet access. In a gambit designed to mitigate an immediate backlash from regulators, Comcast said it was prepared to shed 3m subscribers at the time of announcing the deal.The all-share deal has fallen in value since it was announced from $45.2bn, or $158.82 a share, as Comcast’s stock price has declined.At the time of the deal, relations between Comcast and Charter were said by people close to the companies to be severely impaired. Charter had pursued its $132.50 per share bid for TWC on its belief that Comcast had ruled itself out of the running.Comcast executives made contact with their Charter peers in the days after the company made its offer public, but the talks over the subscription sales only started recently, according to people familiar with the matter.Comcast and Charter declined to comment."
58;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Comcast and Time Warner in talks to sell subscribers to Charter;;Comcast and Time Warner Cable have entered negotiations to hive off cable assets worth up to $20bn in a deal with Charter Communications that aims to allay Washington’s concerns about their proposed merger.Comcast and TWC have held talks with Charter about a deal involving between 3m and 5m subscribers during recent days, according to people familiar with the matter.The options include the straight sale of subscribers and a scenario where Comcast and TWC spin off subscriptions into a new company and sell Charter a substantial minority stake. A combination of the two is also under consideration.The discussions are at an early stage and no deal is certain, the people cautioned.A deal to buy the subscriptions would mark a big victory for Charter, the company backed by cable industry veteran John Malone, which was thwarted in its attempt to buy TWC in February after Comcast emerged with a surprise bid. TWC has roughly 12m subscribers.The all-share deal has fallen in value since it was announced from $45.2bn, or $158.82 a share, to less than $40bn as Comcast’s stock price has declined. The combined group would have 33m subscribers and supply up to 40 per cent of US households with high-speed internet access.In a gambit designed to mitigate an immediate backlash from regulators, Comcast said it was prepared to sell 3m subscribers at the time of announcing the deal. Comcast’s chief financial officer said that the 3m subscribers would be worth at least $17bn.At the time of the deal, relations between Comcast and Charter were said by people close to the two companies to be severely impaired. Charter had pursued its $132.50 per share bid for TWC on the basis that it believed Comcast had ruled itself out of the running.Comcast executives made contact with their Charter peers in the days after the company made its offer public, but the talks over the subscription sales only started recently, according to people familiar with the matter.Industry observers have speculated that it is likely that Comcast will give up more than the 3m subscribers it had offered in attempts to clear the deal with regulators.“Once you offer something up, you only offer more up, you don’t offer less up. It is the starting point of the negotiations,” said Amy Yong, an industry analyst with Macquarie.“There is nothing legally that requires them to give up the 3m subscribers as the deal stands,” she added.Ms Yong noted the subscribers that Comcast will probably give up could come from the footprints of both Comcast and Time Warner Cable and that they are not likely to be from the top metro areas, such as New York City and Los Angeles.The subscriber sale negotiations come just days after Comcast and TWC outlined the arguments for their proposed merger before regulators. Comcast is the largest provider of high-speed internet services to US households.
59;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-03-28T12:39:12Z;Charter contests proposed TWC-Comcast merger;;Charter Communications has filed legal documents contesting the proposed $42.5bn merger between Time Warner Cable and Comcast, claiming that the deal has been subject to a “flawed process”.In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday night, Charter, a cable operator, outlined a series of complaints against the structuring of the deal, with a particular focus on proposed divestitures and the lack of a break-up fee.“TWC’s process for negotiating and approving the merger was flawed because of the failure of the TWC board of directors to consider and investigate alternatives to the proposed Comcast merger,” the document reads.“In particular, the TWC board simply refused to meaningfully engage with Charter regarding a potential business combination even after deciding to pursue a transaction with Comcast.”The move to ask shareholders to vote down the deal marks a strike back by Charter and John Malone, the cable industry veteran who had backed Charter’s spurned offer for TWC.Before agreeing a deal with Comcast, TWC had spent months fighting off the attentions of Charter in a public battle that turned acrimonious.The filing questions the likelihood of regulators allowing the merger of America’s two largest cable operators – a combined business that would have control of nearly 40 per cent of the broadband market with about 33m subscribers. When Comcast and TWC announced their agreement to merge, Comcast said it would lose 3m subscribers.In its proxy statement, Charter said TWC’s “stockholders have no information to evaluate this aspect of the proposed merger”.The move to ask shareholders to vote down the deal marks a strike back by Charter and John Malone, the cable industry veteran who had backed Charter’s spurned offer for TWC“Furthermore, notwithstanding the likelihood of a regulatory opposition to the deal, the merger agreement contains no regulatory break-up fee, giving Comcast no incentive to seek solutions beyond these limited commitment[s],” it added.The merger consideration offered in the proposed Comcast merger was claimed to be worth $158.82 per TWC share at the time it was announced. However, the value of that merger consideration has declined substantially and based on the closing price of Comcast stock on Thursday is now worth $141.16 per TWC share.Charter had spent six months pursuing a deal with TWC and was caught off guard by Comcast’s successful bid in February.A deal would have seen Charter, the fourth-largest cable operator in the US, nearly triple its about 4m subscribers with TWC’s 11m in highly sought-after markets, such as New York and Los Angeles.Time Warner Cable responded to the filing saying “we are fully committed to our merger with Comcast, which we believe is in the best interests of shareholders”.Comcast was not available for comment.
60;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
61;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-03-20T12:16:02Z;Don’t expect Malone the ‘cable cowboy’ to ride into the sunset;History suggests it would be unwise to write off Liberty Media;When Comcast delivered its surprise bid for Time Warner Cable last month, most observers assumed it would knock the so-called “cable cowboy”, John Malone, off his horse.The Colorado billionaire earned his spurs – and his nickname – long before his Liberty Media and Liberty Global groups started rolling up swaths of the US and European cable television sectors. He had long coveted Time Warner Cable, and mounted a hostile bid using Charter Communications, a smaller cable television operator in which Liberty Media group holds a 27 per cent stake.But Comcast’s whopping $158.82 a share all-stock offer was valued at $42.5bn the day it landed – instantly trumping Charter’s lower offer of $132.50. As such, it appeared to end Mr Malone’s hopes of adding a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable to a portfolio of investments across Liberty Media and Liberty Global, which already includes LiveNation, the global concert and ticketing operator, Sirius XM, the satellite radio group, and Virgin Media, the UK cable TV provider.Market chatter suggests an improved bid by Charter for Time Warner Cable will not be forthcoming. Comcast and Time Warner Cable certainly seem unconcerned: recent public comments by senior executives have focused on their confidence that the acquisition will not face significant regulatory hurdles, rather than any risk of a revived Charter bid.However, history suggests it would be unwise to write off Mr Malone. There are few more accomplished – or aggressive – dealmakers in media, as Rupert Murdoch knows to his cost. A decade ago, Mr Malone began to build a position in News Corp voting shares, a move that threatened to undermine Mr Murdoch’s family control over the company. Mr Malone then secretly added to the stake, outfoxing Mr Murdoch who was forced to hand News Corp’s shares in DirecTV to Mr Malone in exchange for the stake.Last week, Mr Malone restructured his US holdings to give Liberty Media more firepower for acquisitions. The company launched two new tracking stocks and dropped a bid to buy the 47 per cent of Sirius that it did not own, in favour of a rights issue to raise new funds.Likely acquisition targets are smaller cable operators, such as Cox Communications – although it is unclear if family-owned Cox would sell – as well as the 3m or so subscribers that will probably be jettisoned by Comcast to ensure its Time Warner Cable deal is cleared by regulators.Mr Malone may also have his eye on bigger prizes – particularly if Comcast shares keep falling. Comcast stock is off 10 per cent since it bid for Time Warner Cable, which has driven down the value of its all-share offer by a corresponding amount. Might an improved Charter bid with a larger cash component be enough to sway investors in Time Warner Cable?Analysts think not. “Other than a regulatory pushback, it’s hard to see how Comcast doesn’t get this deal done,” says Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research.Not everyone is happy about the power Comcast will yield once it has absorbed Time Warner Cable. Last week, Chase Carey, the president of 21st century Fox, became the most high-profile corporate figure to voice concerns about the tie-up, pointing to the combined company’s dominance in providing high-speed internet access. Once the deal completes, about 40 per cent of US homes will get their internet from Comcast. “Are you really headed to every home having simply one broadband provider and what are the implications of that?” he said at an investment conference.Companies from all corners of the media industry will be affected by a bigger and stronger Comcast, including several of Mr Malone’s investments. He has a personal stake in Discovery Communications, which owns channels such as TLC and Animal Planet. Discovery would have to negotiate distribution agreements with Comcast-Time Warner Cable and, in the process, compete with cable channels owned by NBCUniversal, a Comcast subsidiary.Mr Malone has the motivation to build a viable competitor to a bigger and stronger Comcast at a time when broadband and pay-TV is in flux. Possible joint ventures and acquisitions abound – with satellite companies, such as DirecTV, and Dish Networks, and telecom groups, such as Sprint. With a possible war chest at his disposal once he completes the Liberty Media rights issue, do not expect Mr Malone to stand idly by. The cable cowboy is exploring every deal option. Comcast may want to keep the champagne on ice – at least for now.Matthew Garrahan is the Financial Times’ media editor

Wall Street analysts expected the retailer to report a loss of $25m on sales of $685m.Aéropostale’s woes have been somewhat more acute than those of its peers as the retailer caters to less affluent consumers, a demographic whose spending power remains depressed amid the uneven economic recovery.Executives said the company would close 50 stores this year, while opening fewer shops than it had anticipated.The company’s results follow lacklustre figures from Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters and Urban Outfitters, all of which reported sharp same-store sales declines at their namesake shops.“The results we generated in 2013 are not acceptable, nor are they a reflection of the progress we believe we have made in transforming our brand,” said Thomas Johnson, chief executive of Aéropostale.Separately, Aéropostale said it signed a commitment letter with Sycamore Partners and its affiliates for a strategic partnership and $150m in senior secured credit facilities. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the retailer would probably have to draw upon the facility soon as its cash burn accelerates.“Aéropostale occupies the weakest competitive position in teen retail, and continues to cede market share to cheap fashion retailers and other teen retailers,” said Morgan Stanley’s Kimberly Greenberger. “We think it is a structurally challenged business.”The retailer’s market capitalisation, which at its peak eclipsed $3bn, sunk below $500m. Shares in the company closed down 20.1 per cent to $5.83, taking its year-to-date decline to more than 32 per cent.General Mills weakened after the company forecast adjusted earnings between 61 and 62 cents a share for the quarter ended February 23, shy of Wall Street expectations.The performance for the quarter, according to General Mills, includes a jump in spending to promote its yoghurt business and is “consistent with recent food industry trends in developed markets”.General Mills noted operating profits in its retail segment would decline as much as 11 per cent in the third quarter.For the full-year, the maker of Häagen-Dazs ice cream and Cheerios cereal said it would earn between $2.87 and $2.90 a share, roughly in line with expectations.General Mills shares fell 2.4 per cent to $49.77.Liberty Media advanced after the company said it had pulled its bid for full control of Sirius XM and would split its media holding company into two separate tracking stocks.Investors will now be able to invest in Liberty Broadband Group, which will hold the company’s interest in Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable, as well as Liberty Media.The company added it would sell a portion of its shares in Sirius XM, although it would remain “enthusiastic owners”. Shares in the media group rose 7.2 per cent to $135.25.Ulta Beauty, the hair salon and make-up retailer, climbed 6.4 per cent on Friday to $95.26 as the company topped fourth-quarter sales expectations and forecast continued same-store sales growth.The US retailer reported a 14 per cent rise in sales from a year earlier to $868m as comparable sales quickened. Profits rose 10 per cent to $71m, or $1.09 per share.Management said sales would grow as much as 21 per cent in the first quarter to $704m, with earnings between 70 and 75 cents. Wall Street analysts had expected first-quarter earnings of 80 cents.Overall, US equity markets trended higher despite a weakening of consumer confidence at the start of March.However, the benchmark S&P 500 ended down 0.3 per cent to 1,841.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also lost 0.3 per cent to finish at 16,065.67. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was off 0.4 per cent at 4,245.40.
63;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-02-21T23:17:28Z;Charter prowls for deals after Comcast blow;;Charter Communications has not given up on its ambitions to grow through mergers and acquisitions after its hostile bid for Time Warner Cable was eclipsed last week by Comcast’s proposed $45.2bn friendly deal for the cable operator.Charter remains on the prowl for deals that would boost its base of about 4m subscribers, Tom Rutledge, Charter’s chief executive, said on Friday during a call with investors.“We are still interested in wisely acquiring subscribers through M&A when that opportunity arises,” he said. “If the landscape changes in such a way that we see opportunity, we will be opportunistic and take advantage of it.”Charter, the fourth-largest cable operator in the US by subscribers, is being forced to rethink its strategy after spending the past several months circling Time Warner Cable, advocating for consolidation of the fragmented US cable industry.Charter shares tumbled after news of the Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up last week and were trading at about $125 on Friday after previously hovering around $138.While Charter remains open to deal making, Mr Rutledge emphasised that the company’s main opportunity now lay in growing its business by increasing its penetration into the 7m homes it already passes. The company counts about 4.2m video subscribers and 4.4m broadband customers.“That is where the biggest ROI [return on investment] is. If Charter does that successfully, we will create enormous value for shareholders,” he said. “I don’t think the landscape changing precludes that opportunity.”His remarks came as Charter reported net income of $39m for the fourth quarter, up from a loss of $40m for the same period a year before. Revenues increased 12 per cent for the quarter to $2.1bn, thank to growth in video and internet sales.Industry executives have argued that consolidation would put cable companies in a better position to compete against satellite and telecom operators, as well as fend off the rising trend of “cord cutting”, as people cancel pay television subscriptions and turn to cheaper online streaming options such as Netflix and Amazon. Consolidation also could help cable operators in their battle with programmers against rising costs.“On the negative side of the ledger, however, there is still the nagging problem of programming cost. Absent a deal, it is hard to see what can stop the rise,” said Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson Research.Last May, John Malone’s Liberty Media spent $2.6bn on a 27 per cent stake in Charter. Within weeks, Liberty executives approached Time Warner Cable executives about a deal with Charter. Several advances were rejected until Charter made public a hostile cash-and-stock offer for Time Warner Cable valued at $132.50 a share. Comcast swooped in with an all-share bid worth $158.82 per share.News emerged last week that Charter had expressed interest in acquiring either some or all of the 3m subscribers that Comcast has pledged to release as part of its effort to persuade regulators to approve the proposed combination of the top two US cable operators.A Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up would control about a third of the US pay-television and broadband markets. Documents released last week showed that Comcast has promised not to agree to any such sales until late May at the earliest.Market rumours have suggested a possible follow-on deal involving Cox Communications, the third-largest US cable operator by subscribers, but the privately-held company has maintained that it is not for sale.
64;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;US ‘Cable Cowboy’ John Malone begins succession planning;;John Malone, the US billionaire dubbed the “Cable Cowboy”, has begun planning his succession at Discovery Communications and Liberty Global by giving their chief executives right of first refusal if he decides to sell his stakes in the media companies.Both companies have dual class share structures that give Mr Malone control. In separate regulatory filings, the billionaire gave David Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery, and Michael Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global, the option to buy his voting rights, or match a final offer from another potential buyer, should he choose to sell.Mr Malone said he was “thrilled” to have reached agreements with Mr Zaslav and Mr Fries. “Nothing is changing right now,” he said. “I have no plans to transfer any of my voting shares and plan on staying actively involved in both Liberty Global and Discovery Communications.”“But, in the event that I do in the future decide to pursue the sale of my voting position, I am excited about providing these two strong executives . . . with a path toward acquiring that stake.”Mr Malone controls one of the largest collection of media assets and is one of the sector’s most prolific dealmakers. Liberty Media, which is focused on US media companies, has in the past few years spun off the Starz cable channel, taken control of Sirius XM satellite radio and acquired a 27 per cent of Charter Communications.Mr Malone intended Charter to be the vehicle for the purchase of Time Warner Cable but was outbid last week by Comcast in a deal that valued TWC at about $45bn.Liberty Global, which is focused on Europe, has spent close to $30bn in the past two years acquiring cable companies such as Ziggo in the Netherlands and Virgin Media in the UK.Discovery Communications, meanwhile, owns cable channels such as TLC, Animal Planet and OWN, its joint venture with Oprah Winfrey.Mr Zaslav could make about $110m this year after agreeing a new contract with Discovery that will keep him with the media group until 2019.Under his deal, Mr Zaslav will receive 1m performance-based restricted stock units that could boost his total earnings to $110m, although the final total could fluctuate with the performance of Discovery shares.
65;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-02-14T22:50:16Z;Charter looks for way back into Time Warner Cable deal;;Charter Communications has expressed interest in picking up some or all of the 3m subscribers that Comcast could sell to help persuade regulators to clear its proposed $42.5bn acquisition of Time Warner Cable.Comcast eclipsed Charter’s hostile bid for TWC with a friendly deal agreed on Wednesday night. In an effort to smooth relations, the industry leader opened lines of communication with its wrongfooted rival on Thursday, according to people familiar with the discussions.Comcast told Charter that it could not negotiate over the disposal of those 3m subscribers for months. Deal documents released on Thursday show Comcast pledged not to agree any such sales until late May at the earliest.US cable heavyweights have spent nearly nine months haggling over the consolidation of the patchwork industry, plotting competing deals to reshape America’s video and broadband industries.Charter had made an unsolicited $132.50 cash-and-stock offer before Comcast countered with an all-share bid, worth $158.82 before its stock fell on Thursday and $154.38 on Friday.Industry experts doubt that it will return with a full counterbid for TWC, led by Rob Marcus, although people familiar with the company said it had not ruled out any option.Charter, the fourth-largest cable operator in the US with about 4m subscribers, missed out on the opportunity to nearly quadruple its footprint with TWC’s 11m subscribers in highly sought-after markets, such as New York and Los Angeles. But a deal to acquire 3m more customers also would increase the company’s heft.Speculation about a possible follow-on deal has swirled around Cox Communications, the third-largest US cable operator by subscribers, but the privately held company reiterated on Friday that it was not for sale.Some analysts have pegged Cox as a potential buyer for the assets that Comcast would divest in the TWC deal.Comcast has promised annual cost savings of $1.5bn from combining with TWC. Its shares were up 1.4 per cent at $53.70 on Friday having fallen 4 per cent on Thursday.TWC’s shares rose about 0.8 per cent to $146 on Friday after climbing 7 per cent on Thursday, but remained at a discount to the value of Comcast’s offer because of investor caution about a drawn-out regulatory review.Comcast could control what viewers get to watch on TV. And this could lead to higher pricing, which is already a serious concern in the cable industryThe combination of the two largest US cable operators would control about a third of the US pay-television and broadband markets, potentially strengthening Comcast in negotiations with traditional broadcasters and newer digital services such as Netflix. SNL Kagan said it would account for nearly 61 per cent of all US cable video subscribers.Analysts were split over whether the Comcast-TWC deal as it is now structured would be approved given the influence the combined company would have on which television networks it carries, internet connectivity speeds and other issues.“Comcast could control what viewers get to watch on TV. And this could lead to higher pricing, which is already a serious concern in the cable industry,” said Dave Novosel, analyst at independent corporate bond research service Gimme Credit. “Comcast could also regulate the speed at which (internet data) travels. Therefore Comcast could exert greater pressure on companies such as Netflix.”Comcast contends that the deal would usher in new technologies and services for consumers and not eliminate competition, as it now does not compete with TWC in any geography. Comcast expects to learn within about two weeks which regulatory agency will take the lead on what is expected to be a protracted review.The Federal Trade Commission has traditionally reviewed cable deals, but the Department of Justice led the review of Comcast’s acquisition of entertainment group NBCUniversal.Senator John Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, said that the proposed deal “raises serious questions that deserve thorough scrutiny”. He added: “Of course, the threshold question must be whether the creation of an even larger video and broadband juggernaut results in greater choice and lower rates for consumers. This has not been my experience with previous mergers of this size.”Additional reporting by Gina Chon
66;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Comcast’s Roberts lines up TWC deal on Russian slopes;;It was in confident mood that several of the senior bankers on Charter Communications’ deal team headed to the slopes of Utah last Saturday for a long weekend of skiing and networking.The low-key event was hosted by Aryeh Bourkoff, the dealmaker whose Liontree boutique had been instrumental in forming Charter’s audacious and unsolicited multibillion-dollar bid to take control of its larger rival, Time Warner Cable.The assembled bankers, media executives and celebrities discussed the challenges facing the US media industry between turns down the languorous pistes that run through the Deer Valley resort.Even the pessimists among them would not have guessed that half way across the world in Sochi, the Russian ski resort hosting this year’s Winter Olympics, Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, was ironing out the final details of a bid that would all but destroy Charter’s takeover attempt.By Thursday morning, Comcast had gone public with its own offer for TWC. A $42.5bn, all-share bid valuing the company at $158.82 per share, that eclipsed Charter’s offer of $132.50 a share and won the agreement of a TWC management team that had been under siege for months from Charter’s hostile approach.Comcast, already the largest US cable television and broadband company, had been widely considered to be out of the running to make a counter bid. Just weeks before, it appeared to be working alongside Charter on an agreement that would have seen it take on some of the subscribers Charter would have to divest in order to win approval for a TWC acquisition.The sudden turn of events caught Charter’s deal team and the market off guard, and marked a huge victory for Barclays, JPMorgan and Paul Taubman, the veteran dealmaker, all of whom had been quietly working on Comcast’s solo bid.If it gets through what is likely to be a heated regulatory process, Comcast’s takeover of TWC will rank as the largest M&A deal so far this year, and the third largest since the financial crisis. It would be the 10th largest US M&A deal on record and the third-largest deal in the media and entertainment sector in history.Comcast’s financial advisers stand to make $51m to $68m in fees, according to estimates from Freeman & Company, and will enjoy the bragging rights of shooting up the M&A league tables in an otherwise placid year for dealmaking.Mr Taubman, in particular, stands to benefit hugely. As a lone operator, he will collect a large fee for himself. The win will be made all the sweeter by the fact that he left Morgan Stanley, TWC’s main financial adviser, less than 18 months ago after losing out on the top investment banking job.The deal would also be a huge victory for Rob Marcus, TWC’s recently installed chief executive, who stands to make an exit package of at least $50m if replaced and would be vindicated in his stance that the company he runs is worth about $160 a share.Charter’s deal team, which has been led by Mr Bourkoff and Goldman Sachs, has not ruled out another twist in the slalom-like race to consolidate America’s cable industry, however.Charter is already eyeing the possibility of bidding for the 3m subscribers Comcast has said it will divest if the deal goes through. That, in itself, would be a significant deal for a company with less than 5m subscribers, but would be a small consolation for the dealmakers who watched Comcast overtake them on the slopes.
67;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-02-14T11:25:19Z;Squash-playing Comcast chief Brian Roberts no stranger to battle;;As a keen squash player who won gold at the Maccabiah Games – also known as the Jewish Olympics – Brian Roberts knows something about outplaying a competitor at close quarters.This week the chief executive of Comcast, the world’s largest media company by market capitalisation, did just that when he landed what could be a knockout bid for Time Warner Cable.Comcast’s all-share bid, which values its smaller rival at $42.5bn, trumped a lower offer from Charter Communications, backed by John Malone’s Liberty Media, which had been pushing for a deal with Time Warner Cable for several months.Although the deal will face antitrust scrutiny, analysts expect it to be cleared by regulators if Comcast makes significant concessions and disposals.For Mr Roberts the deal is the third multibillion-dollar acquisition he has masterminded for the Philadelphia-based company. Comcast was founded by his father in 1963 with the purchase of a 1,200-subscriber Mississippi cable television system. In 2001 he led the $50bn merger of Comcast with AT&T Broadband in a deal that laid the foundation for the company’s fastest growing business – internet provision. A decade later, Comcast snapped up NBCUniversal in a deal that eventually valued the broadcaster at about $30bn.As his Maccabiah triumph shows, the younger Mr Roberts, who first interned at Comcast aged 15, has a competitive streak: his squash gold medal came in 2005 and followed silver medal wins at the four previous games. He played squash while studying at University of Pennsylvania but given his height and slight frame he was put on a weightlifting programme by his trainer, Al Molloy, a coach revered in squash circles.Mr Molloy’s job was to toughen up Mr Roberts who, according to a Sports Illustrated profile from 2000, “had a pretty stroke, but an opponent could get in his head and provoke him to the edge of tears”. Mr Molloy wrote “No Pain, No Gain” on a blackboard in the locker room: the mantra was adopted by Mr Roberts in his professional life.“Aside from my father, no man has influenced me more than Al Molloy,” Mr Roberts once said. “If you’re going to accomplish something in business, you have to be tough, physically and mentally. Al gave me that.”This approach has served him well. In 1990 he was appointed president of Comcast, when the company was generating annual revenues of $657m. Since then, through a series of canny acquisitions, organic growth and the explosion of demand for internet services, revenues have grown to more than $64bn.Not all of his big moves have come off. A $54bn bid for Walt Disney in 2004 that aimed to marry Comcast’s distribution with Disney’s content was rejected by Disney.He had more luck in 2011 when he successfully acquired NBCUniversal, which owns the NBC broadcast network, CNBC, the largest business cable network in the US, and other assets, including the MSNBC news network and Universal Studios.Aside from my father, no man has influenced me more than Al Molloy. If you’re going to accomplish something in business, you have to be tough, physically and mentally. Al gave me thatNBC owns the rights to broadcast the Olympics and it was in Russia, at the Winter Games, that Mr Roberts negotiated the Time Warner Cable deal, outplaying his rival, the so-called “cable cowboy”, Mr Malone.Mr Roberts’ political clout has increased as his company has grown in size. He has played golf with President Barack Obama on Martha’s Vineyard, while David Cohen, Comcast’s chief lobbyist, has held fundraising events at his home for the president.A Philadelphia native, Mr Roberts continues to live in the city. Comcast is headquartered there: Ed Rendell, a former mayor and governor of Pennsylvania, once said the company had become as important to Philadelphia as Coca-Cola is to Atlanta.Its importance to Mr Roberts’ home city – and to the US media landscape – will only increase if the Time Warner Cable acquisition is approved.
68;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;TWC battle will test Comcast’s regulatory skills;;"Comcast and Time Warner Cable are already the two most powerful companies in an industry that is unpopular with consumers and critical to America’s digital future. Combining the two to create a pay-TV and broadband giant far larger than any rival is sure to provoke tough scrutiny from regulators, politicians and consumer groups.As Charter Communications, their smaller rival, pursued TWC for six months, some analysts assumed the regulatory hurdles would be simply too high for Comcast to try a bid of its own. Yet the early reaction to its $45.2bn offer was that a deal is possible if the companies are sufficiently patient and creative with the concessions they offer.Comcast’s $30bn deal for NBCUniversal in 2011, which combined the country’s largest television distributor with one of its largest programmers, seemed to face similar obstacles. But its success cemented Comcast’s reputation as an astute political player.David Cohen, the Comcast official who guided the NBCUniversal transaction through the regulatory thicket, is known for his influential Washington connections, including President Barack Obama, for whom he has held fundraising events at his house.The Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal needs antitrust approval from the US justice department or the Federal Trade Commission. It also needs clearance from the US Federal Communications Commission, whose mandate includes the public interest, and from state and local regulators. Hearings in Congress are also likely.But experts said Comcast was starting off on the right foot by offering to give up 3m subscribers, extend open internet access rules to Time Warner Cable customers and offer broadband packages to low-income consumers. Mr Cohen said the companies had not yet discussed which systems would be divested.“It’s very smart of the company to put those offers forward, showing that they are being extremely proactive to mitigate any concerns that regulators might have,” said Helgi Walker, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and a former FCC staffer: “That won’t stop the FCC from asking for more. But it’s a sophisticated approach.”Regulators have blocked some recent deals outright and demanded more concessions before approving others. In an unusual move, the DoJ’s top antitrust official, Bill Baer, recently publicly voiced doubts about the benefits of a mooted Sprint takeover of T-Mobile, which would cut the number of mobile competitors.Comcast and Time Warner Cable emphasised that their networks do not overlap. That means the deal is not a simple horizontal merger, legal experts said, and horizontal mergers are more vulnerable to being blocked by antitrust officials.But content providers, broadcast networks, and others such as Netflix and Amazon which rely on Comcast and TWC to reach viewers may be worried about the power of a larger Comcast.Clashes over rising content costs have led to more than 80 broadcaster blackouts in the past two years, including a month-long CBS blackout for TWC customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas last summer.Comcast will have unprecedented market power over consumers …No one woke up this morning wishing their cable company was biggerMr Cohen said the deal would not have a dramatic impact on its bargaining power with programmers and said only a “distinct minority” of the $1.5bn in estimated synergies from the deal would come from programming savings.He said Comcast could not promise that customers’ bills would decrease, but said consumers would not be hurt by the deal.US cable operators also face growing video and broadband competition from satellite and telecoms providers such as DirecTV, Dish, AT&T and Verizon. They also are battling a rising tide of “cord cutters”, people who cancel pay-TV subscriptions for cheaper online video streaming options.Comcast contends that a combination with TWC will not change the competitive environment because telecoms and satellite rivals would still face the same number of competitors in each market. A combined entity would invest in cutting-edge video and broadband services, added Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive.The deal presented “a lot fewer” competition issues than the NBCUniversal transaction did, Mr Cohen added.Paul Taubman’s retirement lay in tatters on Thursday. The veteran dealmaker, who quit Morgan Stanley in 2012 after narrowly missing out on the top investment banking job, has had little time to watch his beloved Yankees; even less to practise his golf swing.Continue reading“It may sound scary,” he said, but the company would control less than 30 per cent of the multi-channel market in local marketplaces, he argued, “and that’s always been the flashpoint for the government to be concerned.”Comcast’s ambitions to close the Time Warner Cable deal by December may be unrealistic, however. The NBC deal took just over a year to get approved even though it was considered a vertical merger, which is less likely to be blocked by antitrust officials.Consumer advocates lambasted the Comcast-TWC deal, calling it disastrous for consumers. The combination could raise prices for consumers and would put too much control over the media in the hands of one company, said Craig Aaron, chief executive of Free Press, the Washington advocacy group.“Comcast will have unprecedented market power over consumers and an unprecedented ability to exert its influence over any channels or businesses that want to reach Comcast’s customers,” Mr Aaron said.Comcast and TWC rank at the bottom of customer service satisfaction studies by JD Power and others. “No one woke up this morning wishing their cable company was bigger,” Mr Aaron said.The last big US deal to be blocked outright was AT&T’s 2011 attempt to buy T-Mobile USA. People familiar with that deal said AT&T made the mistake of being arrogant, thinking its lobbying power in DC could win over the justice department and the FCC, which both voiced their disapproval.The FCC is now run by Tom Wheeler, a former cable lobbyist who has said he would have approved the T-Mobile deal if AT&T agreed to various new regulations. But a person familiar with the FCC said there were strong reservations about a Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up and the deal would be closely scrutinised."

He thought he had Time Warner Cable cornered. Despite its protests, TWC would succumb to his bid in time. The only possible spoiler, Comcast, had a handshake agreement to assist Charter by acquiring some TWC assets down the line, to help Charter reduce debt. But Thursday, Comcast announced it wanted all of TWC and stepped up with a $159 per share, all stock, offer (Charter’s offer is $132.50 in cash and stock).Comcast was going along very nicely on its own. Its investors will wonder why it would spend $45bn in order to take on years of distracting regulatory back and forth, followed by a tricky integration, before a penny of returns is earned.Comcast is a media conglomerate, ironically resembling Time Warner before it dumped businesses. It is the largest US cable provider with 22m subscribers and owns the NBC broadcast network, cable networks such as E! Entertainment, and the Universal movie studio. In cable, Comcast – unlike TWC – has been a solid operator. Its TV subscribers fell just 1.4 per cent in 2013; TWC’s fell 7 per cent. Comcast’s cloud-based digital video platform, X1, has given it the reputation as the rare innovator in the cable sector.Comcast’s prospects will be of keen interest to TWC’s investors, given that they will own a quarter of the company if the deal gets done. They have three reasons for optimism. An all-stock deal leaves the combined company with financial flexibility to make investments to keep up with Netflix and Apple. If Comcast can manage to wring out synergies and growth, former TWC holders will share in the upside. And if the new Comcast wobbles, the $159 price is 60 per cent premium to TWC’s share price last summer, when deal fever broke out, so they have nice cushion to fall back on.Comcast investors have just one source of comfort: a management team, which has delivered 340 per cent of total return over five years.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
70;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-02-11T14:24:39Z;Charter nominates Time Warner Cable directors;;Charter Communications has upped the ante in its bid to consolidate the US’s fragmented pay-television market, nominating a fresh board of directors for its larger rival Time Warner Cable.In a move that ends weeks of speculation about the identity of its slate of 13 directors, Charter announced on Tuesday morning a list including eight current or former chief executives, three former Wall Street lawyers and an ex-chief technology officer from TWC.Time Warner Cable’s entire slate of directors faces re-election at the next annual meeting, bolstering Charter’s chances of taking control of the board.Among the nominees are media and cable executives Lisa Gersh and Eamonn O’Hare, academic Isaac Corre, and private equity boss John Welsh and former vice-chairman of SkyTel.Other names on Charter’s slate, which will be voted on at TWC’s annual shareholder meeting, expected in May, include Irwin Simon and Dexter Goei, chief executives of Hain Celestial and Altice, respectively. The one-month window to nominate a new slate expires this Friday.The list has been composed to meet the shortcomings Charter has cited with TWC’s board.None of the proposed board is in the employment of either Charter or John Malone’s Liberty Media, which owns a 27 per cent stake in the company. This compares with a TWC board that counts among its numbers one current and six previous employees of the cable group or an affiliate company.The decision to put forward 13 new board members underscores Charter’s determination to secure control of its larger rival. The two companies have spent the month locked in a fierce publicity battle after Charter became frustrated by a perceived lack of engagement during six months of behind-closed-door negotiation.TWC has sought to frame Charter’s January bid of $132.50 a share, valuing the company at $61bn including debt, as derisory. The company has said, however, that it would engage in negotiations were Charter to lift its offer to $160 a share – a stance that has been used to offset criticism of its board being entrenched.Rob Marcus, TWC’s chairman and chief executive officer, said: “It is clear that Charter is nominating a slate of directors for the sole purpose of pressuring our Board into accepting the same lowball offer that it previously considered and unanimously rejected.“Our Board remains focused on maximising shareholder value. We are confident in our strategic plan, which was detailed publicly on January 30, and we are not going to let Charter steal the company,” he addedEarlier this week, TWC told the Financial Times that its directors are “highly seasoned and established professionals” from fields including consumer products, media, technology, finance, academia and government. “While the members’ backgrounds and experiences are richly diverse, all our directors are singularly focused on maximising value for Time Warner Cable’s shareholders.”
71;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-02-09T19:43:41Z;Charter to nominate new TWC boardroom;;Charter Communications is planning to nominate a slate of 13 new directors to Time Warner Cable in the coming days, according to people familiar with the matter, ratcheting up pressure in its $61bn takeover battle for the larger cable operator and prompting an examination of Time Warner Cable’s current board make-up.The deadline for Charter to nominate directors looms at the end of this week, with specific timing depending on when Time Warner Cable sets the date for its annual shareholder meeting in May.The two companies are at a standstill after Charter last month made an offer for Time Warner Cable worth $61bn including debt that values the company at $132.50 a share. Time Warner Cable rejected the offer as “grossly inadequate” but said that it would engage in talks were it to receive an offer of about $160 a share.The decision to put a notional price on the company – or at least one at which they would be willing to discuss a sale – has undermined Charter’s claims that TWC’s board is entrenched.Some shareholders and corporate governance experts have expressed concern about the independence of Time Warner Cable’s board, among other issues.While the company considers 11 of its 13 directors to be independent – all except the current and recently retired chief executive – at least six have worked at Time Warner Cable or an affiliate company in the past. Another is a long-time board member, having served as a director of Time Warner Cable since 2003 and a director of a Time Warner Cable predecessor from 1986 to 1992.Time Warner Cable, following New York Stock Exchange rules, considers a director to be independent if they have not worked at the company in the past three years. Yet some corporate governance experts say that independent directors should not have had direct dealings or been employed by the company for at least six years.“You’d have to make a pretty strong case to propose an entirely new slate, but a proposal of fresh blood on the board is not out of order here,” said Lucy Marcus, a corporate governance expert. “Why is independence important? To challenge and question and help with blue sky thinking. If you are too close to the company, it becomes very hard to do that.”One of Time Warner Cable’s largest shareholders rehearsed a list of complaints about the company’s board, from approving the purchase of overvalued sporting rights, to appointing a chief financial officer whose tenure lasted less than two years, and directing a share buyback programme while rivals were investing in their cable network.“I question how independent they are,” the shareholder said, “and if you look at how the share price performed prior to the takeover discussions, I would given them a C or a D grade. The board has to have accountability at some point.”A Charter slate that included cable industry veterans would be a “credible” alternative to a current board, the shareholder added.Another shareholder said: “It’s a classic corporate board who cannot see beyond the status quo. It’s hard for them to recognise that someone as aggressive as John Malone could do a better job than them”.Time Warner Cable said that its directors are “highly seasoned and established professionals” from fields including consumer products, media, technology, finance, academia and government. “Time Warner Cable is the only large US cable company not controlled by a family or major shareholder and our board reflects that independence,” a spokesman said in a statement. “While the members’ backgrounds and experiences are richly diverse, all our directors are singularly focused on maximising value for Time Warner Cable’s shareholders.”NJ Nicholas Jr has been Time Warner Cable’s “independent lead director” since May 2012 and a director of the company since March 2003. Now described as an investor, Mr Nicholas, 74, is a company veteran. For nearly three decades, he worked at Time Inc and Time Warner during the period that Time Warner Cable was acquired by Time Inc and the media groups’ subsequent merger with Time Warner. He was co-chief executive of Time Warner from 1990 to 1992.Among other directors, Peter Haje was general counsel at Time Warner, Don Logan was chairman and chief executive of Time Inc, and Wayne Pave was Time Warner’s chief financial officer.“I think the current board is probably more comprised of people who understood Time Warner Cable when it was once part of a larger entity,” said Amy Yong, an analyst with Macquarie, who noted that she was not concerned with the board’s independence.ISS Governance, the proxy advisory firm, declined to offer an opinion on Time Warner Cable’s board, stating that it is likely that Charter would mount a proxy contest and that ISS would be required to issue a recommendation.Ms Marcus pointed to other concerns with the Time Warner Cable board, including that the chief executive is also the chairman, bestowing a huge amount of power with one person. She also noted the difficulties of having past chief executives as board members. While they add historical expertise, they can make it harder for a company to break with past operations and embark on new strategies.Charter declined to comment.
72;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-01-30T20:06:08Z;TWC outlines battle plan to see off Charter;;Time Warner Cable outlined a three-year battle plan to revive its residential offerings and ramp up its business services group, as the second-largest US cable operator by subscribers spurns a $61bn takeover bid from smaller rival Charter Communications.After three years of accelerating declines in video subscribers, Time Warner Cable has pledged to return to growth through improving its poorly rated customer service and implementing new technologies. Those plans involve introducing digital video offerings to its customers, which number about 15m, as well as increasing internet speeds and wireless internet services.The plan is designed to boost revenue and profits, delivering total revenue growth of about 4 to 5 per cent this year, compared to a 3.4 per cent increase in revenues in 2013.“We’re geared up to manage this company for the long-haul,” Rob Marcus, Time Warner Cable chief executive, said on Thursday during a 90-minute call with analysts. He became chief executive in January and has worked at the company since 2005.The New York-based company is attempting to prove it is better off operating independently as it faces pressure from some of its largest shareholders to engage with Charter in an offer that it rejected as “grossly inadequate”.This month Charter made an offer for Time Warner Cable worth $61bn including debt that values the company at $132.50 per share. Charter is backed by John Malone’s Liberty Media. Time Warner Cable said it was not seeking to sell but would entertain an offer at a deal price of about $160 a share.Comcast, the largest cable operator in the US, has stepped into the fray. Comcast has entered discussions with Charter about which assets it might buy if Charter should win its pursuit of Time Warner Cable.“That leaves Time Warner Cable both financially and morally isolated,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. “It is now much, much harder for Time Warner Cable’s board to continue to stonewall Charter.”Charter has criticised Time Warner Cable’s operations and said it is in a better position to run the company. To bolster its defence, Time Warner Cable on Thursday released a presentation comparing the two companies and claiming it is in a better position than Charter, reflecting years of innovations and investments.“Some of the comments made by Charter management imply that Time Warner Cable is somehow behind Charter in terms of operating metrics and investment,” Mr Marcus said. “This should set the record straight.”The news comes as Time Warner Cable reported that its net income tumbled 9.3 per cent to $1.95bn in 2013 from $2.16bn in 2012. Total revenues for the year increased 3.4 per cent, fuelled by a 1.2 per cent rise in residential services revenues and a 21.6 per cent increase in business services revenues. Time Warner Cable primarily has boosted revenues by charging higher prices instead of increasing its number of customers.The fragmented US cable industry is challenged by steep competition for television services from satellite and telecoms operators, as well as so-called cord-cutting, where people cancel pay-television subscriptions in favour of cheaper online streaming alternatives.Time Warner Cable lost 833,000 video subscribers in 2013, following a loss of 532,000 in 2012 and 453,000 in 2011.The folks at Charter and Liberty are very smart guys. They think they see a chance to force a trade before the public realised what we can achieve with our standalone planThe company pointed to positive momentum in recent months, with net additions of customers improving each month in the fourth quarter and positive momentum in January.“Last year’s residential subscriber performance was dismal,” said Artie Minson, chief financial officer at Time Warner Cable. “We have made significant progress in turning this ship on the subscriber side and we’re entering the year with renewed focus.“The folks at Charter and Liberty are very smart guys. They think they see a chance to force a trade before the public realised what we can achieve with our standalone plan,” he added.Time Warner Cable shares have increased about 40 per cent since news of Charter’s interest emerged in June. In mid-morning trading on Thursday, Time Warner Cable shares were about flat at $133.20.The battle has probably only just begun to heat up, with about two weeks remaining before the deadline for Charter to nominate directors. That leaves the option for Time Warner Cable to either engage with Charter or face a hostile takeover should Charter not walk away from its pursuit of a deal.

A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the process.It also emerged on Monday that Comcast, the US’ largest cable operator by subscribers, had entered discussions with Charter about which assets it might buy were Charter to win its pursuit of TWC. Comcast is working with Paul Taubman, the veteran dealmaker who left Morgan Stanley in 2012.At Morgan Stanley, Mr Taubman was an adviser to Comcast on its $58.7bn purchase of AT&T Broadband in 2002 and its $16.7bn takeover of NBCUniversal. He was also instrumental in securing the bank’s lifeline from Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group during the financial crisis of 2008.News of the discussions between Charter and Comcast, coupled with pressure from one of TWC’s largest shareholders to engage in talks, sent shares above Charter’s $132.50 per share offer. Charter’s shares rose 4.1 per cent to $136.92.Charter made public its $61bn cash and stock offer, which includes debt, a fortnight ago, citing frustrations in its efforts to negotiate a deal with TWC executives. TWC’s management rejected the offer and said it would not consider an offer that valued the company at less than $160 a share.In the days since, the two companies have engaged in a public battle to secure shareholder support for their respective proposals.Financial advisers to Charter include Goldman Sachs, LionTree Advisors and Guggenheim Securities. BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank are also advising Charter.

According to one person with knowledge of the letter, it contains no mention of Charter’s price.T Rowe Price is the ninth-largest holder of TWC’s stock with a stake worth $887m. It ranks as the third-largest holder in Charter shares with a stake worth $726m, according to Bloomberg data.A spokesperson for TWC said the company “has an active, ongoing dialogue with many of its shareholders”. A Charter spokesperson said: “We continue to reach out to Time Warner Cable shareholders and explain the merits of our offer.”TWC shares closed 0.2 per cent lower at $134.55 in New York.The decision to contact TWC marks the latest twist in a protracted takeover battle that has exploded into the public arena this month. Last week, TWC rejected as “grossly inadequate” Charter’s offer, which would represent about seven times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.TWC said last week that while it was not seeking to sell, it would entertain an offer at a price of about $160 per share, or eight times ebitda, with cash of $100 per share and Charter stock valued at $60 per share.Since rebuffing Charter’s offer, the two companies have engaged in a battle to win public support for their respective stances, triggering an exchange of PDF slide-decks highlighting the merits, or lack thereof, of a deal; conference calls with analysts and the press and a steady churn of statements.Earlier on Thursday, John Malone, the veteran cable dealmaker and chairman of Charter’s largest shareholder, Liberty Media, said that the deal was crucial to build the scale needed “to attract the developers and innovators critical to remaining competitive”.It is unclear if other TWC shareholders have made similar recommendations to the company.At the time of the offer, one of TWC’s largest shareholders told the Financial Times that $160 per share was “a dream” and said the company had a duty to be more responsive to Charter in order to negotiate a price perhaps up to the high $140s.Financial advisers to Charter include Goldman Sachs, LionTree Advisors and Guggenheim Securities.

75;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-01-16T15:40:50Z;M&A collars: dominance and submission;Time Warner Cable/Charter deal highlights a rare M&A feature;Time Warner Cable does not just want $160/share from Charter Communications. It also wants a collar. Not the kind of collar bankers might wear on a visit to the dominatrix. The kind they offer as insurance, for companies about to be bought for shares.TWC has expressed deep scepticism about the value of the Charter shares that will comprise more than a third of the buyout offer. If Charter were to submit to a “symmetrical” collar – effectively, a put option – it would be forced to issue more of its shares to TWC investors should its share price fall in the days before the deal closes. Charter’s 29-page manifesto touting the deal finds no space to mention a collar. It is already giving up almost half of its ownership to TWC. It will resist being handcuffed any further.Collars are a rare feature in deals. According to FactSet, the financial data and software company, less than a 10th of transactions have one. They typically show up in deals where the buyer is paying in both cash and stock. All-stock deals are more about ownership split – once the exchange ratio is agreed upon, no adjustment is needed. Because acquirer stock prices can slide, sellers use the collar to keep the value of the signed deal constant. Symmetric collars make this work in both directions. If the buyer’s stock jumps, the seller gets fewer shares than anticipated.A key term of a collar is the adjustment range. If the buyer’s shares move up or down a preset amount, 20 per cent in TWC’s proposal, then the exchange ratio shifts to keep the offer value constant. If, however, the movement in the buyer’s shares exceeds that band, say 30 per cent, the adjustment is capped at the 20 per cent bound.Selling puts is a bullish signal. If Charter will not submit to TWC’s whip-cracking and put the collar on, then it appears these bitter rivals finally agree on something: the weak prospects for Charter’s stock price.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
76;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2014-01-14T17:23:51Z;Time Warner Cable shoots down latest Charter offer;Some analysts have cautioned that a combined group would be highly leveraged;Let the negotiations begin.After rejecting six months of advances, Time Warner Cable, the US cable operator, on Monday shot down yet another offer from its smaller rival Charter Communications worth $61bn including debt. But public sparring between executives of the two cable companies showed that there may well be room to make a deal.Charter’s proposal, its third since June, values Time Warner Cable at $132.50 per share, or about seven times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.The deal includes cash worth $83 per share and Charter stock valued at about $49.50, and an agreement that gives Time Warner Cable shareholders protection against a sharp fall in Charter’s share price. (It also would protect Charter shareholders if there was a sharp rise in the Time Warner Cable share price.)Time Warner Cable’s board unanimously rejected the pitch, calling it “grossly inadequate” with the valuation well below previous transactions in the cable sector, which analysts peg at about eight to nine times ebitda. The company said that while it was not seeking to sell, it would entertain an offer at a deal price of about $160 per share, or eight times ebitda, with cash of $100 per share and Charter stock valued at $60 per share.One of TWC’s largest shareholders described $160 per share as “a dream” and said the company had a duty to be more responsive to Charter in order to negotiate a price perhaps up to the high $140s.“We want to get them talking to Charter, and to pressure them to open up the books. Sitting back and saying ‘$160 or forget it’ is not going to cut it. The stock could go to $100 if the deal does not go through. That is real downside, that is the fear factor here.”The FT’s Emily Steel looks at changes within the US cable industry and how it is adapting to technological upheavalA recent survey by Macquarie of about 50 Time Warner Cable shareholders, about 70 per cent of whom had held the stock for longer than a year, found that most thought the charter proposal was insufficient.Nearly all shareholders – 97 per cent of those surveyed – are eager to sell the company to the highest bidder. “Almost no one wanted to maintain the status quo or see Time Warner Cable use its balance sheet to stave off an acquirer,” said Amy Yong at Macquarie.Just 14 per cent of Time Warner Cable shareholders would accept a full purchase price of $135 to $140 per share, with about 64 per cent holding out for $140 to $150 per share, she said.Tom Rutledge, Charter chief executive, said Time Warner Cable’s demand was an “unrealistic price expectation . . . designed to be dismissed” given the upswing already included in Time Warner Cable shares. “The stock has gone up 40 per cent because the marketplace does anticipate that a combined entity would be a better entity,” he said.Time Warner Cable’s $160 per share demand, meanwhile, is calculated based on adding a premium to the price at which its shares currently trade. Rob Marcus, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, said: “It is obvious that what they are trying to do here is buy a premium asset at a bargain basement price.”The other point of contention is the ratio between cash and Charter stock, which is trading at about $134, up more than 70 per cent in the past year.Charter’s initial offer of $83 cash per share falls short of most shareholders’ expectations, according to Macquarie. About 28 per cent of shareholders are looking for a minimum of $90 cash per share, with nearly a quarter of shareholders holding out for $100 of cash per share, said Ms Yong. (About 30 per cent were indifferent to the cash offer, she said.)Time Warner Cable shareholders would own about 45 per cent of the combined entity, which would be the second-largest US cable operator behind Comcast with 16m video and broadband subscribers.“There is tremendous upside growth potential,” Mr Rutledge said. “They get to ride in that upside.”Charter’s market capitalisation is about $14bn, with Time Warner Cable about $34bn. Including debt, a Time Warner Cable takeover could cost Charter more than $60bn.Some analysts have cautioned that a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable would be highly leveraged and leave little margin for error in integrating the two companies. Others said Charter should be careful given its 2009 bankruptcy, blamed on heavy debt and under-investment.Charter said in an investor presentation on Tuesday that it expects $500m in annual synergies, increasing to $750m over time.“We have reservations about the value of Charter stock,” Mr Marcus said. “Our objective essentially is to maximise the amount of cash in any deal so that we weren’t subject to the vagaries of their stock price.”Both Charter and Time Warner Cable executives said their stances were reflective of conversations with Time Warner Cable shareholders. Liberty Media, which owns a 27 per cent stake in Charter, said on Monday that it was supportive of Charter’s efforts and had been “encouraged by Time Warner Cable shareholders to pursue this opportunity.”Charter executives slammed the operating strategy of its larger rival when it held a conference call with investors on Tuesday afternoon.John Bickham, Charter’s chief operating officer, pointed to Time Warner Cable’s accelerating loses of video customers, internet subscribers and phone customers. “This negative momentum isn’t simply the result of their operating plan over the last year,” he said. “It is the failed plan over the past half decade.”He also underscored the fact that Time Warner Cable has the lowest customer satisfaction scores in the industry.Yet Charter executives should not be so comfortable. While Time Warner Cable ranked at the bottom of a 2013 JD Power customer satisfaction study for television providers, Charter ranked second to last.Mr Rutledge said on the investor call that Liberty Media had expressed a willingness to put in additional capital in pursuit of a deal with Time Warner Cable.Time Warner Cable released a statement following Charter’s pitch to investors.“There was nothing in Charter’s presentation and call today that changes the fact that its proposal is grossly inadequate,” it said. “We have engaged with Charter, but Charter is not prepared to pay for a one-of-a-kind asset that Tom Rutledge referred to today as the biggest and best M&A option available. We are confident in our standalone plan and we are not going to let Charter steal the company.”Additional reporting by Stephen Foley

O Wind,If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?Like romantic poets, M&A bankers and lawyers are always trying to stir up activity, talking hopefully of their belief that deal-making is about to blossom. Perhaps there is some evidence that something is indeed stirring after the winter of recession.One would expect it at this point in the business cycle. Corporate balance sheets are full of cash, and interest rates are at very low levels, making it cheap to raise bond finance. As John Authers noted this week, investors are finally pushing companies into investing some of that money in growth.This week’s deals build on a mini-trend during 2013. As Mergermarket recorded, the value of global M&A rose steadily in the first three quarters of 2013, after a depressed period from 2008 onward as companies retrenched and deleveraged.They also show that acquirers are willing to pay high prices for their targets. Suntory faces a dip in its credit rating for paying 20 times operating cashflow for Beam. Google, which has plenty of cash, is paying an estimated 21 times the revenues of Nest to acquire the smart home appliance company for $3.2bn.Two points of caution:First, this is not a normal global cycle. Some European economies – notably France – are still struggling with low growth and the tapering of US quantitative easing has crimped growth in emerging markets. There is no global surge.Second, and related to this, headline bids and deals such as Verizon’s $124bn purchase of the 45 percent of its mobile arm owned by Vodafone – have been targeted on the US, where the outlook is clearest. This week’s events fit the trend.We could still be in what Lex calls “an era of fitful M&A”. That said, M&A bankers have a better story to tell clients in pitching deals than in the past few years. There is more of a spring in their step.
78;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Time Warner Cable rejects $61bn pitch by Charter Communications;;A battle for the future of the US cable industry burst into the open on Monday as Charter Communications went public with an offer for Time Warner Cable worth $61bn including debt, only for its larger rival to reject its advances as “grossly inadequate”.Backed by John Malone’s Liberty Media, Charter has circled Time Warner Cable since last summer, publicly advocating for consolidation in an industry battling new competition, new technology and shifting consumer habits.On Monday, it made public the terms of its pitch, detailing a cash and stock offer that values its target at $132.50 per share and saying that Time Warner Cable had repeatedly refused to engage in discussing a deal for more than six months until executives of the two operators met in December.During that December meeting, Charter made an offer “in the low $130s”, it said, after the rejection of previous proposals in June and October.Time Warner Cable responded by saying that it was not seeking to sell the company but was open to a deal at a price of $160 per share, or eight times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It called Charter’s three approaches, at $114, $127 and $132.50, “a non-starter” at seven times ebitda and a significant portion of the price in Charter stock.Monday’s offer comprised cash worth $83 per share and Charter stock valued at about $49.50. Time Warner Cable’s shares closed at $132.40 on Monday.Charter’s market capitalisation stood at $14bn on Monday, with Time Warner Cable at $34bn. Including debt, a Time Warner Cable takeover could cost Charter more than $60bn.Time Warner Cable shareholders would own about 45 per cent of the combined entity, which would be the second-largest US cable operator behind Comcast with 16m video and broadband subscribers, according to analysts.“We have reservations about the value of Charter stock. Our objective, essentially, is to maximise the amount of cash in any deal so that we aren’t subject to the vagaries of their stock price,” Rob Marcus, Time Warner Cable chief executive, told the Financial Times.He said that Time Warner Cable’s position reflected shareholders’ opinion.“Our house wasn’t for sale, somebody knocked on our door and made a low-ball proposal. They didn’t just do it once, they did it three times,” he said. “It is obvious that what they are trying to do here is buy a premium asset at a bargain-basement price.”Our house wasn’t for sale, somebody knocked on our door and made a low-ball proposal. They didn’t just do it once, they did it three times. It is obvious that what they are trying to do here is buy a premium asset at a bargain-basement priceTom Rutledge, Charter chief executive, told the FT that Time Warner Cable’s demand was an “unrealistic price expectation . . . designed to be dismissed” given that Time Warner Cable’s shares have soared nearly 40 per cent on deal speculation in the past six months.He added that several Time Warner Cable shareholders had approached Charter, endorsing a deal and asking Charter to ratchet up its efforts.“We’re really trying to engage the shareholders of Time Warner Cable because we haven’t been able to engage the management and the board,” Mr Rutledge told the FT. “This is an offer that we think is quite compelling and creates tremendous value for Time Warner Cable and for Charter.”Mr Rutledge said that in addition to the synergies and tax benefits that Charter would bring to a deal, its executives had the “skill and proven track record” to help Time Warner Cable stem customer losses and improve services.He pointed to the fact that Time Warner Cable had lost more than 500,000 video customers during the second and third quarters of 2013 as well as broadband and voice customers. Charter, meanwhile, lost 82,000 video customers during the same period and gained broadband and voice customers.“The track record they are on is quite evident,” Mr Rutledge said. “There is tremendous upside growth potential, and they get to ride that upside.”Mr Marcus said that Time Warner Cable’s business started to improve in December and is on a positive track for 2014. “We have confidence in our own ability to create value,” he said.The deal comes after Liberty Media, Charter’s largest shareholder, proposed earlier this month to make satellite radio broadcaster Sirius XM a wholly owned subsidiary in a deal that could give it more resources to fund the Charter-Time Warner Cable deal.We’re really trying to engage the shareholders of Time Warner Cable because we haven’t been able to engage the management and the boardLiberty said it supported Charter’s efforts and had been “encouraged by Time Warner Cable shareholders to pursue this opportunity”.Some analysts have cautioned that a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable would be highly leveraged and leave little margin for error. Others have cautioned that Charter should be careful given its 2009 bankruptcy, blamed on heavy debt and under-investment.Mr Rutledge dismissed analyst concerns about high levels of leverage, noting that financing was fully negotiated.Charter is taking its pitch to investors, with plans for a conference call with analysts on Tuesday afternoon.Financial advisers to Charter include Goldman Sachs, LionTree Advisors and Guggenheim Securities. BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank Securities are also financial advisers to Charter, and with Goldman Sachs are leading financing for the deal. Law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Kirkland & Ellis LLP are also representing Charter.Advisers to Time Warner Cable include Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company and Citigroup, as well as Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison as legal counsel.
79;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Time Warner Cable: turn up the volume;Breakdown between cash and shares more important than price;We knew Charter Communications would start with a lowball bid for Time Warner Cable. And Monday night’s opening salvo, at $132.50 a share is a few bucks less than TWC’s recent market levels. Yet, the first offer is more important for what it says about how the bid is divided up between cash and Charter stock: $83 a share and $49.50, respectively. As talks proceed, dismiss the nominal offer price for TWC shares. The relevant figure is the split between cash and stock.The wide gap in equity values between TWC ($37bn) and Charter ($14bn) forces the diminutive Charter to offer its shares as a big slice of the bounty to TWC shareholders. So one element of tension lies in that the cash TWC more covets adds to the debt Charter will have to shoulder post-acquisition. Based on the current offer, TWC shareholders would own a serious 45 per cent of Charter.The complexity of Charter’s bid also underscores that the deal is seeking to solve too many variables. Charter needs to offer shares since its debt capacity is limited. But it cannot offer too many or TWC investors would own a majority of the company. John Malone’s Liberty Media, which owns 27 per cent of Charter, could invest cash in Charter that could be used to pay TWC shareholders, if Liberty bought more equity. But Liberty itself would need to raise debt to do so and that is tricky until it gets full control of the subsidiary, Sirius XM.To the extent that TWC and Charter would be better off together – the thesis is better bargaining power with content providers – then the two should unite in a simple stock swap that would not require more debt. TWC shareholders would gain control, but if Charter boss Tom Rutledge is deserving, he can stay at the helm. A simple transaction, while not Mr Malone’s style, is more likely to be successful.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
80;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-12-16T13:01:17Z;US cable musters forces to meet upheaval;Speculation grows over consolidation in fragmented sector;For years, cable operators have been at the heart of how television is financed, distributed and viewed in the US. But with new competitors rising and rapid technology changes upending the business, the industry is entering a period of upheaval and possible consolidation.Speculation is rife about consolidation that involves some combination of Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Charter or Cox – the four biggest cable companies in the US by subscribers.Charter Communications, which is 27 per cent owned by John Malone’s Liberty Media, is preparing to make the first move as it readies a formal offer to buy Time Warner Cable, in a deal that would value Time Warner’s equity at more than $36bn.The results of this shake-up will have an impact not just on the estimated 56.4m US households that pay roughly $145 a month to cable operators, according to SNL Financial, but also ripple through to programmers and distributors across the world.The rationale for consolidation is clear. Geographically divided, no one cable operator has national dominance (see chart on left).This has kept cable operators from competing with one another in the past but they are now fending off new rivals. One issue is cord cutting, where people cancel pay-television subscriptions and turn to cheaper online streaming alternatives such as Netflix and Hulu that can appear – just like traditional programming – on internet-connected televisions.Even those who are not cutting the cord are choosing TV services provided by satellite or telecoms operators instead.With new rivals entering the fray sending the demand for television content soaring, there has been a sharp increase in the costs television distributors pay programmers. Negotiations between distributors and programmers are growing increasingly hostile, leading to more than 80 broadcaster blackouts in the past two years.So far, cable operators have met the challenges by charging higher rates and diversifying into broadband, phone and business services. Yet for the industry to compete in the future, some executives argue that consolidation is the solution.The Cable Cowboy – John MaloneNone of this is new to Mr Malone, the 72-year-old chairman of Liberty Media, known as the “cable cowboy”. In the 1980s and 1990s, he led a wave of cable consolidation by lassoing together a series of smaller US cable operators to build TCI, the country’s largest cable company that he sold to AT&T in 1998 in a $48bn deal.Now he is at it again.In May, Liberty Media spent $2.6bn for 27 per cent of Charter Communications, the fourth largest cable operator in the US by subscribers. Mr Malone’s grander strategy soon became clear. Within weeks, Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s chief executive, approached Glenn Britt, the outgoing chief executive of Time Warner Cable, to discuss the possibility of a deal with Charter.The approach was rebuffed but Mr Malone and Charter have continued to circle their target, publicly advocating for the benefits a new wave of consolidation would bring. Charter now is ratcheting up the pressure, planning to send a so-called bear hug letter to its larger rival Time Warner Cable as early as Monday. The offer represents a price between $130 and $135 a share or an equity value of more than $36bn.“When I joined the cable industry way long ago what occurred to me was it was an enormously balkanised business. It was sub-scale and had no ubiquity,” Mr Malone said, adding that consolidation would allow the geographically fragmented companies to pool resources, invest in new technologies and build national markets.“The history of the business is replete with the industry solving its balkanisation and scale problem through joint effort . . . I think that can be done again.”Charter, which has about 5m residential and business customers in a smattering of markets from California to New England and Tennessee to Oregon, also discussed a $25bn debt financing package to help it acquire its larger rival. Charter would need substantial funding to snap up Time Warner Cable.Some analysts caution that while the broader logic for consolidation is clear, a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable would be highly leveraged and leave little margin for error in integrating the two companies. Others caution that Charter should be careful given its 2009 bankruptcy, blamed on heavy debt and under investment.The Target – Time Warner CableIt is no accident that Time Warner Cable finds itself at the centre of the cable consolidation bull’s eye.The second largest cable operator in the US by subscribers, the company is considered the industry’s crown jewel with its 15m customers across the highly sought-after markets of New York and Los Angeles, among other regions.Yet Time Warner Cable’s operations have faltered. In the most recent quarter, Time Warner Cable missed expectations, losing video, high-speed data and voice subscribers. The weak performance, analysts say, could spur a deal.Ironically, its takeover candidate status has sparked shares in Time Warner Cable to soar nearly 40 per cent in the past six months. With shares now trading at about $130, some question whether potential buyers will be willing to pay an additional premium for a company with deteriorating performance– a concern borne out by Charter’s offer of between $130 and $135 a share.Time Warner Cable’s longtime chief executive Mr Britt, who dismissed Charter’s earlier advances, retires from his post at the end of the year after 12 years on the job. Stepping into the position is Rob Marcus, Time Warner Cable’s chief operating officer who started his career as a mergers and acquisitions lawyer. His contract stipulates that he could be paid more than $50m if the company is acquired and his position is terminated.One banker close to the situation said Time Warner Cable had switched from trying to resist a takeover to pushing to get the highest price for a deal. “There is a realisation that it will get done, the business will be sold, it is just a question of to whom and at what price.”During an investor conference last week, Mr Marcus said that the company’s management team is focused on running Time Warner Cable for the long haul and that any deal activity is driven by shareholders’ best interest.“My job is to maximise value for shareholders,” he said.The 800 Pound Gorilla – ComcastEnter Comcast, the industry heavyweight with 52m customers, ownership of entertainment group NBCUniversal and a $172bn enterprise value.Comcast entered the cable consolidation fray after Time Warner Cable reportedly invited the company to consider a deal. Comcast has considered both a solo “white knight” bid for Time Warner Cable or a joint bid with Charter. Charter’s current proposal does not include Comcast, according to people familiar with the process.A Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would create an industry behemoth, controlling a third of the US video subscriber market and a 35.9 per cent share of the US broadband subscriber market, according to MoffettNathanson estimates.While shareholders are likely to support such a deal because it would provide an outlet for its cash, bankers and analysts are sceptical that Comcast could launch a successful bid given the size of the market it would control and the potential for significant regulatory hurdles. Comcast already is under scrutiny following its deal for NBCUniversal that valued the entertainment company at about $30bn and bundles the country’s largest television distributor with one of the country’s largest programmers.That sentiment is bolstered by recent comments from the US Federal Communications Commission that such a deal would probably face regulatory objections.A lawyer, who is not involved in the deal but wished to remain anonymous, said that the response from the FCC would have damped Comcast’s ambition. “They would have seen that and thought the uphill struggle involved was probably not worth the energy required,” the lawyer said.A joint bid with Charter, meanwhile, could dodge regulatory concerns and give both acquirers a boost in scale by dividing Time Warner Cable’s assets. Amy Young of Macquarie Research points out that both Charter and Comcast own networks adjoining Time Warner Cable’s.The Missing Links? – Cox and CablevisionWaiting in the wings are outliers Cox and Cablevision.Cox is the third-largest US cable company with an estimated 6m residential and business customers primarily in the south. The Atlanta-based, privately owned company long has been rumoured to be an acquisition target, but the company insists that it is not for sale and rather is seeking growth.Cox, too, has reportedly considered a bid for Time Warner Cable.Meanwhile Cablevision has largely stayed out of the spotlight. But its strength in the New York metro area, where it has 1.8m customers, will probably make it a hot commodity should other deals go through and industry consolidation begins in earnest. Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter all operate in regions adjacent to Cablevision’s network.Geography matters, because it is cheaper and easier to manage a large contiguous network than having outposts in many cities. New technology advancements also can get a boost. Cable operators, for instance, have been launching hundreds of thousands of new WiFi hotspots. A combined entity could invest more in the initiative as well as give it a more robust promotional push.“If pay TV households get reshuffled and swaps enter into the equation, Cablevision could get broken apart and sold to Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter,” Macquarie’s Ms Young said. She calls Cablevision the “missing geographic link”.The Hit Makers – Television NetworksThe consolidation fervour in the cable business has spread to the television networks that produce programmes and hit shows. Discovery Communications, the owner of the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet, has considered a bid for Scripps Networks, home of the Food Network and the Travel Channel.While the consideration is driven largely by ambitions to grow internationally, such a deal also could give programmers more heft in fee and rights negotiations. Discovery and Scripps declined to comment.As cable operators fight back against rising programming costs through consolidation, television networks too are seeking the benefits of scale. Once again, Mr Malone could be stirring up the pot – he is a director on Discovery’s board.Some analysts caution that TV groups such as Discovery and Scripps already exert substantial pricing power and that further consolidation is not likely to help much more.Despite underlying business tensions, television programmers and distributors historically worked together to promote overall growth of the business. Technological changes, however, are forcing those tensions to erupt into frequent, public battles.This summer, for instance, a contract dispute between Time Warner Cable and the broadcaster CBS led the network to become unavailable for millions of customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas for about a month.This wave of consolidation is not limited to US borders. Just last week, Mr Malone’s Liberty Global group was revealed to be in talks with Dutch operator Ziggo. The move came after Liberty paid $23.3bn last year to acquire Britain’s Virgin Media.Additional reporting by Ed Hammond
81;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-12-13T17:54:38Z;Charter closes in on Time Warner Cable offer;Proposal priced at low end of expectations as consolidation speculation grows in an industry battling cord-cutting, competition and content costs;Charter Communications is preparing a formal offer to buy its larger rival Time Warner Cable for a price that would represent between $130 and $135 a share, or an equity value of more than $36bn.Executives from the two companies met on Tuesday to discuss Charter’s proposal, said by people familiar with the matter to be “in the low $130s”. Charter is planning to send Time Warner Cable a so-called bear hug letter as early as Monday.The offer price is at the low end of expectations, and significantly short of the $150-$160 range at which Time Warner Cable has been reported to be interested in selling.Time Warner Cable shares, which rose as high as $138 last month amid mounting speculation about US cable industry consolidation, fell to $130.84 on Friday morning, giving the company a market capitalisation of $36.88bn.Rob Marcus, Time Warner Cable’s incoming chief executive, told an investor conference this week that its management team was focused on running the company for the long haul and that any dealmaking would be driven by creating shareholder value.“My job is to maximise value for shareholders, and there’s no way that I would let my personal ambitions, my personal agenda about running the company, get in the way of making the right decision for shareholders,” he said.A possible joint bid between Charter and Comcast, the largest operator in the cable market, had been mooted earlier. However, Charter’s current proposal does not involve Comcast, according to people familiar with the process. Charter, which has a market capitalisation of $13.9bn, has met banks to discuss a financing package of $25bn.Industry analysts have broadly welcomed Charter’s proposed takeover, despite the gulf in size between bidder and target. The smaller group has a stronger recent growth record while Time Warner Cable has faltered lately, suffering subscriber losses in video, high-speed data and voice. In its most recent quarter, Time Warner Cable lost 131,000 customers in total, after 306,000 video subscribers left.“Beyond the scale that a Time Warner Cable deal offers, we believe Charter sees an opportunity to accelerate revenue and free cash flow growth given Charter would implement a different strategy than Time Warner Cable,” Michael Senno of Credit Suisse said on Friday.Speculation about the consolidation of the fragmented US cable industry has been building for several months. Some industry executives, including Liberty Media’s John Malone, have advocated such deals, arguing that it would reduce costs and better position the industry to compete.Cable operators are facing increased pressure in their video businesses from so-called cord cutting, as customers cancel pay-TV subscriptions for cheaper online streaming options, such as Netflix. The industry is also battling competition from satellite TV and phone companies, and rising content costs.All the companies involved declined to comment.
82;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-11-27T23:52:17Z;Charter in $25bn debt financing talks on possible Time Warner Cable bid;Discussions with banks over $25bn debt package;Charter Communications has discussed a $25bn financing package that would put weight behind its increasingly public battle to acquire rival cable-TV provider Time Warner Cable.Charter, which has been circling its larger rival since the summer, has been in talks about debt financing for the deal with banks including Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, according to people familiar with the process.The discussions with the banks are continuing and have been running since July.Charter, which is being advised by LionTree, the investment bank, and law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, has been working with Goldman Sachs to help put together an agreeable financing package, people familiar with the process added.Charter, which has a market value of $14.1bn, needs to raise substantial funds to swallow Time Warner Cable, which had a market capitalisation of $38.6bn based on Wednesday’s closing price of $136.80 a share.The company has implied that it would consider a premium bid from Charter.However last week it emerged that executives at Time Warner Cable had approached Comcast, the Philadelphia-based cable-TV market leader, to ask it to make an offer that would rival Charter’s overtures.Speculation about the consolidation of the fragmented US cable industry has been building for several months. Some industry executives, including Liberty Media’s John Malone, have advocated such deals, arguing that it would reduce costs and better position the industry to compete.Cable operators are facing increased pressure in their video businesses from so-called cord cutting, as customers cancel pay-TV subscriptions in preference for cheaper online streaming options, such as Netflix. At the same time, the industry is battling against satellite TV and phone companies.Some cable executives believe that consolidation also could help television distributors in their battle with programmers over fee increases.“The fact that Charter plans to finance this deal with debt increases the odds that the coming consolidation will drive cost-cutting in service, infrastructure and content,” said Barry Parr, a media analyst with Outsell.But Craig Moffett, an analyst with Moffett Nathanson, cautioned that while the logic of industry consolidation was clear, the possible synergies may not be as great as many expected.He said that a Charter-Time Warner Cable deal would result in a highly leveraged combined entity, placing large demands to “run the business better”. “You are taking on significant risk if you are Charter’s board and Liberty,” he said this week.In reference to Charter’s emergence from bankruptcy, after seeking protection in 2009, he added: “One would guess that paying too much would be something that they would be sensitive about.”Time Warner Cable shares have climbed almost 47 per cent since the start of the year as a result of expectations of a bid.All parties involved declined to comment.
83;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
84;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-11-26T17:19:46Z;US cable-TV: customer is king;Pay-TV providers need to focus on customer retention;For all the dealmaking hype, cable television remains a consumer product. Remember that as the industry’s latest round of consolidation unfolds. The Time Warner Cable/Charter Communications buyout saga continues, with Comcast diving into the fray, either as enabler or spoiler.With content distributors proliferating (Netflix, Apple, Hulu) and content providers (cable and broadcast networks such as ESPN and CBS) raising prices, cable companies want the industry to shrink to just a few multi-regional players. They may be right. But before piling on the merger debt, pay-TV providers need to consider customer retention.Banks, bonds markets, sovereign wealth funds, equity investors, Liberty Media and bake sales are all reportedly in line to help Charter (enterprise value: $28bn) acquire TWC ($61bn). Comcast ($172bn) could also help Charter by buying bits of TWC that complement its own business. But Comcast, which just bought out all of NBCUniversal from General Electric, may be cautious. Its shares were already up a fifth this year.TWC’s crown jewel is its big (14m) but shrinking customer base. Charter has just 4m subscribers but board member John Malone and chief executive Tom Rutledge believe that their acumen befits a bigger empire. If so, TWC itself should acquire Charter and install the pair as bosses.To understand why this matters, recall Charter’s history. Heavy debt and under-investment led to its 2009 bankruptcy. Mr Malone’s quarter stake in Charter comes from the vultures who bought Charter debt.Perhaps a beefed-up TWC will be able to push back on content costs. If the smaller company buys the larger, however, the result could be another big debt pile, an LBO-like five times the cash flow of the combined company. This could lead to scrimping on service and system upgrades – a precarious move when cable substitutes such as satellite, wireless, internet and fibre optics are increasingly available.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
85;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-10-31T18:09:25Z;Time Warner Cable: house on fire;Talk of a deal intensifies as company loses some broadband users;High-speed internet has been a firewall for US cable companies, protecting subscriber numbers as TV customers cut the cord. But Time Warner Cable’s third-quarter results reveal a company engulfed in flames. Not only did its TV customers storm the exits (after merely trickling out before), it shed some broadband users too. Either its customers do not want to watch Netflix over the internet or, more likely, are switching to Verizon or another provider. So with a chief executive transition pending, and wheeler-dealer John Malone smacking his chops in anticipation of a tie-up, investors are left to wonder if TWC has no choice but to do a major deal.TV subscriber numbers are grim enough. TWC lost 300,000 cable customers in the third quarter and has already lost more this year than in all of 2012. But while internet users came to the rescue last year, this time round they too are deserting the company (24,000 went elsewhere in the quarter). Making the loss more galling, TWC rival Comcast added nearly 300,000 internet subscribers in the same period. Of course, competition differs across regions of the US. But Time Warner’s dispute with CBS could not have helped its already frayed relationship with its customers.Time Warner predicts $2.5bn in free cash flow this year, slightly less than last year. Still, it has managed to deliver a total shareholder return of 27 per cent in 2013. That has been propped up by the possibility of a deal with John Malone’s smaller cable company Charter Communications (TWC’s market cap of $34bn is more than 2 times Charter’s). The knee-jerk reaction is to assume that TWC will jump into the arms of Mr Malone. But given the sizes of the two companies and the weakened negotiating position of TWC, investors should weigh their position based on the probability of a homegrown turnround.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
86;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-08-06T18:14:52Z;Pay-television market likely to face further consolidation;;Investors in cable and satellite companies on both sides of the Atlantic are betting on another round of consolidation in the pay-television market led by John Malone, the “cable cowboy” of the industry’s pioneering era.Earnings announcements from most of the large US cable companies and the country’s two satellite television operators showed the continuing pressure they face on traditional video subscription revenues and on the cost of programming. Time Warner Cable, for instance, is in a prolonged and public battle with CBS, the broadcaster, over the costs to carry CBS programming.Industry executives and analysts point to consolidation as an inevitable solution. Scale would allow US cable operators, a fragmented industry, to invest in new infrastructure and deploy innovative technologies. It also would give the cable operators and other pay-television operators more sway in negotiations with television programmers.“We believe in the benefits of consolidation, including significant opportunities for cost and tax synergies, and more importantly, the ability to grow assets organically at a faster pace,” Tom Rutledge, chief executive of Charter Communications, the fourth-largest US cable operator, said during a conference call on Tuesday. “Beyond that, if you get to a certain scale, you have the different form of leverage in programming negotiations.”Charter, which reported a $96m net loss in the second quarter of 2013 compared to a $83m loss a year earlier, has been at the centre of speculation since Mr Malone’s Liberty Media spent $2.6bn acquiring a 27 per cent of the company in March. Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’ chief executive, is said to have discussed a deal with Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable.Mr Maffei echoed the benefits of industry consolidation during a separate conference call on Tuesday but said it was unlikely that Liberty Media would buy stakes in cable companies other than in “helping Charter execute” its business plans.Pay-television operators need to consolidate in order to counter the “monopolistic” power of television programmers, which are raising rates by three to five times inflation, Charlie Ergen, chairman of Dish Network, said during a conference call on Tuesday.Dish Network, the US satellite TV operator run by Mr Ergen, made a net loss of $11m, or 2 cents a share, in the second quarter after writing down the value of two of the three satellites it acquired by $438m. In the same period last year, Dish reported a net profit of $226m, or 50 cents a share.“You have a general movement driving towards consolidation because programmers have become so powerful,” he said, noting that while deals are likely to happen first among cable operators he is open to a merger with DirecTV. “Consolidation would help level the playing field.”Speculation about a possible merger between Dish and DirecTV, the two US satellite operators, has revived since Mr Ergen was frustrated in his bid for Sprint.“Frankly, the balance between content providers and distributors is out of whack. And therefore, further industry consolidation does make sense to help address what I think are unsustainable cost increases for the average customer,” Michael White, DirecTV’s CEO, told analysts last week.He cautioned, however, that Mr Ergen may not be ready to talk about a merger: “it always takes two to dance and frankly,the kind of options that you would normally think about are committed on other ideas and strategies,at least at the moment as best as I can tell.”In Europe, Mr Malone’s Liberty Global group has also fuelled expectations of further consolidation, having bought Virgin Media in the UK and raised its stake in Ziggo of the Netherlands.Mike Fries, Liberty Global’s chief executive, last week ducked questions about acquisition targets in southern Europe but said: “There’s huge benefit to consolidation in all of our markets, Holland included. We compete with national telcos. The bigger scale we have in any market, the better we are able to compete.”Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson.
87;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Inside Business: Malone hitches up to broadband bandwagon;Malone is on the prowl for acquisitions;"Five years ago, reporters covering Allen & Co’s annual Sun Valley summit were scrambling around the floor of the lodge where the world’s media and technology leaders gather each July, helping Rupert Murdoch look for his wedding ring.The News Corp chairman filed for divorce last month and the press is now kept at a distance, but otherwise Sun Valley’s rituals are little changed as Herb Allen’s guests regroup near Idaho’s Sawtooth mountains this week.Each sighting of two “media moguls” or “tech titans” talking sparks speculation about what deal they might be discussing. This year, the 286 male and 17 female guests jetted in laden with expectations that they would, for example, sort out Apple’s television strategy; Vivendi’s plans for its Activision stake; and Hulu’s buyer.Sun Valley’s reputation as a hotbed of dealmaking is exaggerated but with dealmaking central to its legend, nobody is more in focus this week than Liberty Media’s John Malone.His companies have been involved in some of this year’s biggest deals, buying Virgin Media in the UK for $23.3bn, taking a stake in Dutch cable operator Ziggo, tussling with Vodafone over Kabel Deutschland and spending $2.6bn for 27 per cent of Charter Communications, the fourth-largest US cable operator.He is looking for the next target already. Last month, he touted Charter as “a horizontal acquisition machine”, saying that consolidation could balance out an industry he likened to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, where too many sub-scale groups trail behind Comcast.Mr Malone is not one to enjoy playing the dwarf, so Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s chief executive, has begun pitching Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, on a deal with Charter. TWC has three times Charter’s subscribers and more than double its enterprise value, and Mr Britt – another Sun Valley guest – seems unconvinced so far.The deal would test Mr Malone’s financial engineering talents, requiring some combination of a dilutive issue of new equity from the highly-rated Charter, an infusion of cash from elsewhere in Liberty’s portfolio, leverage of perhaps five times earnings on the combined company’s balance sheet and a creative use of Charter’s historic tax losses.Liberty may yet pick smaller targets instead, but scale counts in cable. Morgan Stanley estimates a combined Charter-TWC could yield annual savings of $400m-$600m, largely from greater negotiating power with programme suppliers.Consolidation in the fragmented US pay-TV market looks inevitable, and for it to be led by the man who built America’s largest cable company before selling TCI to AT&T in 1999 might seem poetic.Forget the nostalgia, though. Mr Malone’s plans have little to do with what cable was when he earned his “cable cowboy” nickname. “We keep looking at these personalities, but just as important is the business logic [of] becoming the largest TV and broadband distributor,” says Michael J Wolf, managing director at Activate, a strategy consultancy.We keep looking at these personalities, but just as important is the business logic [of] becoming the largest TV and broadband distributorBroadband is the key to Mr Malone’s renewed interest in cable. With profit margins under pressure in video, high-speed connectivity is cable’s growth story.Mr Malone said at his annual meeting last month he is betting that broadband will be “the controlling attribute that drives market share”, even in video, as more programming is delivered “over the top” via internet connections rather than cable or satellite boxes.He sees cable as uniquely positioned to deliver the bandwidth needed by services like Netflix and the cheaper video packages cable companies will offer if they can “unbundle” costly sports channels.But what kind of broadband cowboy would Mr Malone be? He says his vision includes more tiered pricing and charging bandwidth-hungry users of cable’s pipes (such as Netflix) for the capacity they use.Short-term opportunism is mixed in Mr Malone’s long-term vision. Consumer advocates already warn that tiered pricing and usage-based billing will hurt the “little guys”, and we should not assume he can simply replicate his buccaneering cable days. Cable companies now face cord-cutting consumers and competition from the Netflix, satellite and telecom groups, Mr Wolf notes.Even if Mr Malone is just defending his power base this time, however, he seems determined to play a central role in shaping the future of internet access in America and beyond. Unravelling the pay-TV bundle will not happen overnight, but his bet on broadband could affect Sun Valley’s ageing moguls and digital newcomers alike for years to come.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times’ media editorandrew.edgeclife-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness"
88;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-07-01T18:54:13Z;Liberty Media: pain and cable;Even by John Malone’s standards, Time Warner is too much to bite off;Go big or go home – that’s how John Malone rolls. But even by his titanic standards his pursuit of Time Warner Cable is staggering and will ultimately prove too much to bite off. Three months ago the prodigal son of cable returned to his roots by acquiring – through his Liberty Media company – a 27 per cent stake in Charter Communications for $2.6bn. Charter is the fourth-largest US cable provider with 5m subscribers and an enterprise value of $25bn. By contrast, Time Warner Cable has 15m subscribers and an enterprise value of $55bn, which illustrates just how audacious Mr Malone’s play actually is.But his bravado is understandable. He bought into Charter at $95.50 per share three months ago and it is already up a third since then. Even so, Mr Malone realises that Charter cannot be measured against the cable operators alone. Throw the satellite and phone companies into the competitive mix and Charter is merely a bit player in the business of pay TV and broadband internet. What is more, with the increasing leverage of the content providers (both the cable channels and local stations keep extracting increasingly hefty fees), distributors need to beef up in order to hold the line on programming costs. They also need size to extract the most benefit from high-speed internet, the cable industry’s real growth engine.No one is a better financial engineer than Mr Malone, so perhaps the combined muscle of Liberty Media (enterprise value $26bn) and Charter could stretch to make the maths on a TWC bid work. But Time Warner Cable has been reportedly cool thus far, so turning to Cablevision, controlled by the Dolan family, is the next logical step. Combining with this New York-area company would create the clear number three in US cable. Synergies could come from boosting Cablevision’s operating margin of 28 per cent – 7 percentage points lower than Time Warner Cable’s and Charter’s. And with Cablevision’s enterprise value of $14bn, humility in the name of strategy should guide Mr Malone’s next move.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
89;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-04-18T17:06:36Z;Deals shed light on Liberty chief’s role;;"John Malone’s portrait hangs in the boardroom of Liberty Media’s Colorado headquarters, and outside the window is a bronze eagle given to him by his wife. Mr Malone, Liberty’s chairman and America’s largest landowner, owns much of the land between the statue and the Rocky Mountains in the distance.The cable pioneer and feng shui follower decorated the building on the 60-acre site in Englewood, near Denver, with South African mahogany to remind him of the interior of his 82-foot yacht, and styled the company logo after the drains on its deck.It is not a setting in which a number two can easily escape from the shadow of the man who built TeleCommunications Inc (TCI) into America’s largest cable company, helped start channels from CNBC to Discovery, jousted with Rupert Murdoch and now oversees an empire stretching from Dutch cable operators to QVC’s shopping channel.Yet a string of recent deals, in which Liberty Media spun off the Starz channel, took control of Sirius XM satellite radio, built a stake in Barnes & Noble and returned to cable distribution by buying 27 per cent of Charter Communications, has started to shine a light on Greg Maffei’s role as chief executive.“The thing to understand about Greg is he’s ADD,” Mr Malone says. Liberty Media, too, could be said to suffer from attention deficit disorder. Mr Maffei says no unifying principle connects its diverse assets because “we’re usually way too opportunistic”.Mr Maffei, who recently became chairman of Sirius, Starz and Live Nation, the concert promoter for such chart-topping acts as Rihanna and U2, identifies one constant theme amid Liberty’s shuffling: aggressive returns of capital to shareholders, designed to incur the minimum of corporation tax.“It hasn’t been about building the empire or trying to build a bigger enterprise. It has been about trying to build shareholder value,” he says. “How many media companies have spun off as much as we have?” he asks.In the 1980s, John Malone seized the opportunity that loose regulations offered cable to turn TCI into “an ungodly successful model”, Greg Maffei says, but his $54bn sale of TCI to AT&T in 1999 left interests in many channels and their parent companies that made little sense without “the big kahuna” at the centre, writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson.Mr Maffei points to four significant moves to make sense of the portfolio since he joined Liberty in 2006. .First, it sold small stakes in “mediocre” investments such as On Command and Open TV; then it swapped its voting stock in News Corp for a controlling holding in DirecTV, which it subsequently spun off.Third was a $530m rescue investment in Sirius, which feared bankruptcy in 2009 as car sales plunged. “We were lucky on timing, on structure and everything,” Mr Maffei says, before adding that Liberty’s bottom-of-the-market move was based on an analysis that Sirius’s liquidation value would exceed its investment.Fourth, Liberty has bought back about 45 per cent of its stock since he joined, at an average price of below $40 compared with its $109.39 valuation on Wednesday night. That has driven up its net asset value dramatically.The remaining holdings are scattered around several companies.As well as Liberty Media, there is the newly spun-off Starz and Liberty Interactive, home to digital brands from Evite to Bodybuilding.com, which is split into two tracking stocks. Liberty Global, the non-US cable business, which has made headline-grabbing deals with Virgin Media and Ziggo in Europe, is run by Mike Fries.The largest assets now held by Liberty represent a series of bets. At Sirius, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of Liberty Media’s value in analysts’ models, the question is how Liberty can extract the value created by its comeback.Mr Maffei says a large dividend or buyback is “likely” now Liberty has control of Sirius, but offers few clues as regards timing.Charter is a bet on America’s appetite for high-speed broadband, and on consolidation in the cable sector creating savings. At Live Nation, the concert business, Liberty sees new ticketing technology leading to a more efficient conversion of earnings to cash.It could as easily cut its 27 per cent stake in Live Nation as add to it, however. “We’re Liberty. We never know whether we want the stock to go up or down,” he says. Across its portfolio, it might buy more if prices fall or sell if they rise.The $2.6bn Charter deal used up the net cash Liberty was left with after the Starz split, but Mr Maffei sees up to $1bn of “non-core stuff” in its portfolio and says with cheap financing on offer it would love to borrow “as much as we could, prudently”.Valuations for potential acquisition targets are more expensive than in 2009 but more international exposure remains an aspiration and Liberty has explored markets including Brazil, Turkey and Spain, he says.Liberty Media, with a capitalisation of $13.3bn, trades below net asset value. The discount has narrowed but is not illogical because “there’s some risk we’ll do a stupid deal”, Mr Maffei says. “We’ve been lucky that some of the big ones have worked out and covered our sins.”Asked whether Liberty might take a break from new deals to absorb its recent moves, he suggests the shark must keep swimming: “My gosh, Liberty without deals? What would that mean?” he laughs.A former chief financial officer to Bill Gates and Larry Ellison, Mr Maffei is used to working for prominent figures. According to one adviser: “Greg’s a great investor. He understands opportunities and is very detail-oriented, but it’s John’s vision.”“More normally, it’s me proposing – or the team and I proposing, more accurately – and John blessing, saying grace on it,” Mr Maffei says. “It’s not like John is always sitting back waiting to say yes or no, but he’s just got a breadth of interests.”Now, he says, Mr Malone is stepping back a little to concentrate on just three boards: Liberty Media, Liberty Global and Discovery, where he holds a large personal stake. “John doesn’t want to be burdened by a lot of the day-to-day, but no major decision gets made without John buying in,” he says.Mr Maffei, one of media’s highest-paid executives, could play an even larger role in the long term. Mr Malone, who holds 83.7 per cent of Liberty Media’s super-voting B shares, told CNBC last week his will dictates that his management teams will have the opportunity to buy his controlling stock after his death."
90;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-03-24T18:13:55Z;Charter: a bigger byte;Luckily for the cable provider it can look to high-speed internet;John Malone’s recent $2.6bn investment in Charter Communications, the fourth-largest US cable provider, is not just noteworthy because it marks the return of a legend to the industry where he first made his name (and his billions). But because it also broadcasts that the real opportunity in cable is not in television.Mr Malone’s bet seems curious given that Charter shares are expensive (up 40 per cent in the past year), and because of the deteriorating economics of distributing pay TV. At Charter, its core residential cable TV customers are down nearly a tenth in the past two years while programming costs are up a tenth.Luckily for Charter, its network has another use – high-speed internet. Revenue from its internet services has grown 16 per cent since 2010 to $2bn, which is almost a third of all of its residential revenue. SNL Kagan estimates that the operating profit margin for cable companies on internet services approaches 60 per cent compared with only 26 per cent for distributing TV.Now the scenario exists where consumers can pull the plug on Charter’s cable TV but keep its internet service to stream the TV shows from Netflix that they used to watch through Charter cable. Of course, the cable companies have caught on and the days of all-you-can-stream internet plans are numbered. Charter has limits on data, based on which plan customers select. Others have experimented with tiers of fees based on usage. With 36m US internet subscribers still choosing slower DSL (digital subscriber line) technology, according to Broadbandtrends, Charter may see the opportunity to convert those to cable internet. But look out for fibre internet choices from the likes of Google (who else?) whose 1 gigabyte per second download speed is light years ahead of what even cable can boast today.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
91;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-03-20T19:27:24Z;US heartland offers visions of cable’s future;Two announcements from Kansas and Colorado provide important pointers for the cable industry;It is 600 miles from Olathe, Kansas, to Englewood, Colorado, and both towns can seem a million miles from the media hubs of New York and Hollywood. Yet two announcements from the US heartland this week provide important pointers to the future of the cable industry and the content companies that depend on it.In Olathe, Google unveiled plans to roll out the fibre optic network it is testing in nearby Kansas City, offering broadband speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. That is roughly 100 times faster than the country’s typical download rate, for $70 a month or $120 with a video service.One day “the Google guys” might bring to mind installers in grey uniforms rather than Larry Page and Sergey Brin. But Google Fibre is for the time being a tiny experiment, much debated for what it might mean to rivals yet – so far – with no clear plan to jump to the wider market.Few people know that market better than John Malone, Liberty Media’s Englewood-based chairman, who started Tele-Communications Inc in 1973 and became the world’s largest cable systems owner before selling TCI to AT&T in 1999.Mr Malone kept overseas cable interests after that through Liberty Global, which last month agreed a $23.3bn bid for Virgin Media in the UK. This week, he returned to the US cable business with a $2.6bn investment that bought him 27 per cent of Charter Communications.Opportunism often drives Mr Malone’s investments, but when he returns to a game he has sat out for 14 years, it is worth asking what has changed.The answer, according to his chief executive, Greg Maffei, is that cable’s “pipes” are becoming more valuable. At first glance, this sounds counterintuitive. Much of the debate around the sector has been about pressure on margins after a decade of steep content cost inflation, and the possibility that Americans picking and choosing their viewing from cheaper digital providers, such as Netflix, will “cut the cord” that has attached them umbilically to cable companies for so long.SNL Kagan analysts estimate that the cable industry lost 1.66m video customers in 2012. You can quibble about whether the reasons are cyclical or secular, but this only tells half the story. First, US cable companies’ average revenues per video subscriber (video ARPUs) have shot up from about $35 to about $75 since 2000, according to IHS Screen Digest.Rising ARPUs are great for cable companies, showing that they can pass on escalating sports rights costs, but it has turned cable subscriptions into a significant expense in US household budgets. Price-sensitive consumers have every incentive to look at alternatives.Analysts think Mr Malone could make it more likely that Charter will drop weaker networks from its line-up. TV content companies collected more than $35bn from pay-TV distributors last year, according to Nomura, so much is at stake. If cable companies trim the numbers of channels they offer, they also risk accelerating the trend of consumers seeing less value in their video packages, upending the model Mr Malone helped define.The second and more important change since TCI’s day is that cable subscribers now see more value in their broadband connections than their TV offerings.Gerald Belson, head of Deloitte’s media and entertainment practice, says when it asked US consumers in previous years which services they most valued, 80 to 90 per cent put internet access and pay TV in the top three. This year, 93 per cent cent chose internet access but only 58 per cent named pay-TV. Among those aged 14 to 23, the pay-TV figure falls to 43 per cent.This question over cable’s core TV product looks worrying. Yet consumers’ attitudes towards broadband show why Mr Malone and Google may both be right.The same Deloitte survey reports that 59 per cent of consumers would pay more if they could have faster internet service, up from 49 per cent in 2009. The first thing they want to do with those faster connections is watch more video.That suggests cable operators have room to use high-margin broadband revenues to support a TV product that is under pressure. Their ability to bundle TV, broadband and phone services also gives them a growing advantage over satellite rivals without the broadband component.There are two cautionary notes, however. Competition, from established competitors such as AT&T’s U-verse and new entrants including Google Fibre, still poses a long-term risk to US cable’s pricing power. And now that US consumers have discovered an appetite for the fast broadband many other countries enjoy, their cable companies will have to invest to satisfy it.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times’ media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
92;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-03-19T23:16:58Z;Liberty Media in $2.6bn cable ‘pipes’ bet;;John Malone, once known as the king of US cable, has made a $2.6bn bet that the “pipes” owned by cable companies will increase in value as they make the switch from TV distributors to broadband providers.Confirming plans to buy a 27.3 per cent stake in Charter Communications, the fourth-largest US cable operator, Liberty Media chief executive Greg Maffei told the Financial Times: “We’ll see what will happen with video, but the pipe is only getting more valuable.“Liberty has always been about recurring cash flows and subscription businesses,” he added. In Charter, “you have a subscription business with incredible stickiness around broadband” and a chance to upgrade broadband speeds with relatively little capital, he said.Liberty bought its stake from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners, who became three of Charter’s largest investors after bondholders bought the company out of a Chapter 11 restructuring in 2009.It has secured seats on Charter’s board for Mr Malone, Mr Maffei and two other Liberty-affiliated directors, and pledged not to increase its stake above 35 per cent before January 2016 and 39.99 per cent thereafter.The agreement prevents Liberty from taking creeping control but will not stop it from making an offer to all shareholders. Liberty gradually took a majority stake in Sirius XM, but Mr Maffei said this reflected the unusual circumstances of its investment, when it rescued the satellite radio company during the 2009 financial crisis.Mr Maffei said Charter’s management, led by Tom Rutledge, a former Cablevision chief executive, would position it well for future deals. “There’s likely to be a consolidation. Whether we’re a seller or a buyer, who knows, but [Tom] Rutledge is a great operator so this creates an opportunity.”Mr Malone sold his TCI US cable business to AT&T in 1999, but kept interests in distribution through DirecTV, the US satellite TV company, and Liberty Global, the European cable business which last month agreed a $23.3bn bid for Virgin Media of the UK.Since 1999, “broadband has emerged as the profit driver in the business, while the leverage distributors once enjoyed in TCI’s day over content has completely reversed itself,” said Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.However, with cable companies under pressure from rising content costs, Mr Malone could help Charter negotiate more aggressively by dropping weak channels or pushing for sports networks to be offered in separate pricing tiers, Mr Swinburne said.Mr Maffei said the Charter investment had been driven in part by the availability of cheap capital. Liberty Media had $1.8bn in net cash before the deal and may review some other assets to reduce its debt if it can do so in a tax-efficient way, he said.The Charter deal may accelerate plans “to bring some of the capital back up from Sirius” to Liberty, he said, “but it doesn’t necessarily lead to that”. Analysts have speculated that a Sirius buyback could allow Liberty to extract some cash by selling part of its stake.
93;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-03-18T22:13:30Z;Charter soars on interest from Liberty;;Shares in Charter Communications, which emerged from bankruptcy protection just four years ago, hit new highs on reports that John Malone’s Liberty Media was in talks to acquire a 25 per cent stake in the fourth-largest US cable operator for close to $2.5bn.One person familiar with the situation confirmed the talks, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, but cautioned that the timing of any agreement remained uncertain. Spokespeople for Liberty Media and Charter declined to comment.An investment by the Denver group behind QVC and Sirius XM would mark a return to the US cable sector for Mr Malone, who turned TCI into the US’s largest cable company by revenues before selling it to AT&T for $54bn in 1999. It would come weeks after Liberty Global, the company that holds Mr Malone’s European cable interests, agreed a $23.3bn bid for Virgin Media, the UK cable operator.Shares in Charter, which had already risen by one-third since November, jumped $7.95 or 8.8 per cent to $98.04, giving it a market capitalisation of more than $9.9bn. The group had 5m residential customers and revenues of $7.5bn last year, on which it reported a net loss of $304m.Earlier this month, Apollo Global Management and Oaktree, Charter’s largest shareholders since its 2009 debt restructuring, announced plans to sell about 6.2m and 3.1m shares respectively in an offering underwritten by Goldman Sachs. Apollo and Oaktree declined to comment.Liberty Media would be buying back into the cable industry at a time when it is consolidating in the US and beyond. Charter last month offered $1.63bn for Optimum West, a cable operator sold by Cablevision that reaches more than 300,000 video subscribers in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming and Utah.Charter ended 2012 with $12.8bn of long-term debt and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $2.7bn. It has taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance borrowings.Under Mr Malone and Greg Maffei, chief executive, Liberty Media has shown a leaning towards subscription-based businesses such as Sirius XM, the satellite radio group, and an opportunistic approach to acquisitions, often taking minority stakes and then building its holding to a controlling position.Liberty Media, which has stakes in companies from Live Nation to Viacom, has used cash aggressively for share buybacks but a spin-off of Starz, the premium cable television channel, left it with about $1.8bn in cash and no debt, giving it scope for a deal of this size.Mr Maffei cited low interest rates when he told an investor conference this month: “This is an environment when it’s better to be a borrower than a holder of cash, but it’s hard to find opportunities.”Additional reporting by Dan McCrum
94;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2013-02-15T20:05:43Z;Primetime arrives in saga of TV takeovers;;Life is imitating art in the cable industry. Two years ago, in an episode of 30 Rock, the NBC comedy about a thinly fictionalised NBC, the characters watched as a Kabletown logo replaced the GE sign atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza. “It’s happening,” Alec Baldwin’s character said dolefully to Liz Lemon, played by Tina Fey, as he mourned NBC’s takeover by a giant cable company.This week, naming rights to the GE building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza passed to Comcast, as the largest US cable operator paid GE $18.1bn to buy the 49 per cent of NBCUniversal it did not already own, along with NBC properties including the studios housed in the art deco tower.The deal was one of a wave of mergers fuelled by obliging credit markets. Warren Buffett’s $28bn bid for Heinz, the $11bn American Airlines-US Airways merger and the $24.4bn Dell buyout have led to predictions of a new surge in dealmaking. Across sixth Avenue from NBC, the Time Life building was shaken by news of a planned spin-off of most of Time Warner’s magazines.But cable is enjoying a particularly notable revival in animal spirits. Comcast’s deal, struck more than a year ahead of expectations, came a week after John Malone’s Liberty Globalmade a $23.3bn offer for Virgin Media, the UK cable operator.Meanwhile, Vodafone is looking at Kabel Deutschland, Germany’s largest cable company, and Charter Communications is spending $1.63bn on Optimum West, a US cable system once called Bresnan that rival Cablevision acquired only two years ago for $1.4bn.Analysts can point to company-specific reasons for each deal, such as Comcast’s fear that NBC’s improving performance would make a buyout costlier in the long run, but sector-wide factors are also playing a role.“It’s a subset of media that benefits from scale,” one media banker says, noting the savings larger cable companies can glean when buying set-top boxes or network technology. “Couple that with the debt markets and an economic backdrop with more clarity and it’s a recipe for transactions with a bit more boldness,” he adds.Low interest rates should allow Liberty Global to price almost $8bn of debt to help finance the Virgin Media deal at yields of less than 6 per cent. “Credit markets have never been stronger for companies like ours,” one US cable executive says.Large telecoms groups are hoping to reverse the long-term decline in traditional voice revenues across Europe with innovative bundled packages of television, high speed internet access and home and mobile phone connectivity, writes Daniel Thomas.The importance placed on these “quad plays” underpins Vodafone’s interest in Kabel Deutschland. That was not a great surprise to many analysts, given clear statements in the past by management that Vodafone would develop its “converged” fixed and mobile network by borrowing, building or buying lines.If it were to buy Kabel Deutschland, Vodafone could also extract cost savings as it would own more of the fixed network that supplies its mobile masts. The emphasis by Vittorio Colao, chief executive, on convergence has increased markedly over the past year, with recent complaints that some European incumbents have refused to open up their networks to Vodafone.It has instead built or co-invested in fibre in Portugal and Italy, while its largest acquisition for several years was the purchase of Cable & Wireless Worldwide in the UK in 2012. Vodafone has also been linked with cable operators such as Ono in Spain and Ziggo in the Netherlands.Vodafone is still regarded by many investors as a purely mobile operator – the part of the telecoms market that has suffered the worst from the economic downturn and regulatory revenue cuts – even though it owns fixed line networks across Europe.Vodafone made fixed line revenues of £1.3bn in the last quarter, almost a third of which was generated in Germany.The UK-listed company could combine its 3.2m broadband and 150,000 TV customers in Germany with Kabel Deutschland’s 8.5m households should any offer succeed.A Berenberg Bank study of 1,000 households in the UK, France and Germany found that demand for bundling services was robust.The German bank’s survey found that “bundling begets more bundling” and that there was a correlation between increased levels of bundling and higher levels of customer satisfaction. That could result in lower potential churn rates.Indeed, customers are also less likely to cancel triple- or quad-play contracts because of the nuisance of replacing all three or four services.Cable companies are also finding it easier to attract capital because investors are more confident that they have a competitive advantage over satellite, telecom and online video rivals. Where cable companies once pitched their own selection of TV channels, now they market themselves increasingly on fast broadband speeds. “Superfast broadband is something most consumers really get in an intuitive way,” one US cable executive says.The Federal Communications Commission says that the average speed US subscribers sign up for has risen about 20 per cent in the last year to 15.6 Mbps, showing consumers’ appetite for faster connections.Analysts say that in Europe the high quality of cable assets in comparison to the digital subscriber line technology that telecoms incumbents typically use will prove a particular advantage as bandwidth-hungry services such as high definition video on demand becomes more popular.“We’ve always been fans of cable,” says Nick Brown, analyst at Espirito Santo. “The cable assets in Europe are of a very high quality and they now have a competitive advantage over the incumbents. Really the only thing the incumbents could do in the long term to defend themselves is invest more heavily in fibre.”In Europe, where cable evolved as a more regulated utility than in the US, average prices for cable video packages are also typically lower – about €30 per month as opposed to the $80-$100 US cable operators charge. The saving in switching to a €6-€7 monthly Lovefilm or Netflix subscription therefore looks less compelling.Fears remain that customers are “cord-cutting” and finding their video by other means. Online video viewing is soaring, with ComScore this week estimating that each month 182m Americans consume 19.2 hours of video on sites such as YouTube, Hulu, Vevo and Yahoo.Yet industry executives argue that cable can coexist with “over the top” alternatives such as Netflix, LoveFilm, Apple’s iTunes, Amazon Prime or Aereo. A new generation of set top boxes is offering on-demand video streaming and other providers’ apps, sometimes harnessing the very internet video services that threaten to take viewers away from traditional cable channels.“We already have the programming relationships, unlike Netflix and Lovefilm, who begin life subscale and have to pay up to create a catalogue of compelling content,” one cable executive says.Comcast’s takeover of NBC is a marriage of distribution and content that contrasts with Time Warner’s decision to spin off its cable business from its TV networks and film studios in 2009. Distributors’ resurgence since then has not come at content owners’ cost. Shares in Comcast have tracked content stocks such as CBS, Time Warner and Walt Disney remarkably closely over the past year.The distributors still face real threats, from the rising cost of programming and weak housing and employment figures to the risk that their lead in broadband speeds will be threatened as the likes of Verizon and BT invest in faster “fibre to the home” technology.But with a market capitalisation of $109bn, Comcast is now America’s largest media company, $10bn bigger than Disney. NBC’s satirists may not approve, but cable now has the tallest tower on the corporate media skyline.
95;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Apollo buyout strategy reaps rewards;;Apollo Management’s long history of investing in distressed debt is reaping rewards, according to an investor letter from the alternative investment manager.By taking control of companies after initially investing in their debt, Apollo has been able to acquire companies more cheaply than many of its buyout rivals, which mostly focus on equity investments.Apollo has paid an average of only slightly more than six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for its buyouts since 1990 versus the industry average of nine times, the letter states.Since its inception in 1990 until this September, Apollo’s internal rate of return after fees has been 25 per cent, a performance that fund lawyers say outstrips most of its peers.The companies that Apollo has bought through the distressed debt route include Aleris, Charter Communications, LyondellBasell Industries, and Noranda Aluminium.“People say they are aggressive, but their LPs [limited partner investors] love them,” says one long-time investor with Apollo.However, the one big Apollo deal that remains underwater is its $1.28bn equity investment in Caesars Entertainment, the hotels and casinos group previously known as Harrah’s.Apollo and TPG bought Harrah’s in early 2008 in a deal that valued the company at $30bn. While the two buyout groups have extended the maturity on much of Caesars’ debt and there are no significant repayments due until 2015, analysts are sceptical about its ability to pay off its debt load given the fact that the value of its properties is lower now than at the time of the buyout.The investor letter said Apollo planned to raise $12bn for its eighth fund, compared with its previous $14.7bn fund.
96;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2012-09-24T19:26:27Z;Wall St engineering revival of CDS;;Wall Street financial engineers have devised a new way to combat declining trading in the credit derivatives market – they are revamping an index to add financial instruments that do not exist.Indices that track the price of credit default swaps (CDS), contracts which act as insurance against a default on corporate bond payments, have become a popular way for banks and hedge funds to speculate on the creditworthiness of American companies and for bond fund managers to hedge risks in their portfolio.But underlying CDS trading has shrivelled to such an extent that there are not enough actively traded names to make up a 100-company index.This week, the index provider, Markit, will cross a Rubicon and begin to include three companies in its North American high-yield CDX index for which no bank is offering a CDS.Markit and derivatives traders hope the addition of CIT Group, Charter Communications and Calpine Corp will force banks to launch CDS on the three companies.Global trading in individual corporate CDS is down 23 per cent by volume this year, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.Some people are warning that the illiquidity of the underlying market risks a repeat of debacles such as the JPMorgan “London whale” trades in which the bank lost $5bn on a trade involving a CDX index.Ed Grebeck, chief executive of Tempus Advisors, said that traders would be able to exploit any wide disparities between the underlying CDS prices and the price of the index, while the index itself will become an increasingly imperfect hedge for the credit risks of a bond portfolio.“These indices provide a false sense of comfort,” Mr Grebeck said. “The best way to hedge your credit risk is to manage your credit risk in the first place. This provides users of the index greater opportunity to conduct arbitrage, as opposed to helping institutions to hedge their risks.”The prices of Markit’s CDX indices are set at a daily fixing using quotes provided by dealers, excluding outlier quotes, a process the company says mirrors the one used to calculate Libor – the interbank lending rate that has become the subject of a slew of regulatory inquiries into possible manipulation.Deepak Agnani, head of US credit indices at Markit, said the process for choosing additional names was transparent and conducted in consultation with dealers. “We have picked the three companies that have the highest amount of debt outstanding,” he said. “They are names that should be put in focus by the CDS community.”Barclays strategists led by Brad Rogoff, writing in a recent note to clients, said that they expected the emergence of CDS trading in CIT, Charter and Calpine after the index goes live this Thursday.“The belief is that CDX inclusion will drive single-name CDS trading through index arbitrage, thereby broadening the base of CDS liquidity that has otherwise been shrinking to an ever-smaller group of credits. We concur with this view and are excited about the prospect for enhanced liquidity in high yield derivative markets.”
97;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2012-05-17T16:09:19Z;US cable;‘Dumb pipes’ they may be – but this industry remains very big and very profitable;The US cable industry is very big and very profitable. The four large publicly traded cable companies – Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, and Charter Communications – have an aggregate enterprise value of nearly $200bn. They face limited competition, have high and stable margins and spew out cash. Yet they are accused of being “dumb pipes” – mere distributors with little power over suppliers or customers.The description fits if you consider only video distribution, which represents about half of the cable operators’ revenues. The reasons can be debated (Competition from telecoms and satellite companies? Cord-cutting? Low household formation?) but video subscriber growth is in unmistakable decline. And pricing power seems to be slipping: growth in revenue per video customer at the big four has slowed recently. And even as video revenue has flatlined, the cable companies’ programming costs have been growing a few points faster than inflation. A nasty squeeze.But these are not video companies, of course. They are video/data/voice companies. Their chief advantage is that one set of competitors (telcos) only offers video in select markets, and another (satellite companies) cannot offer data or voice. And combined revenue from all services is still growing in the mid-single digits at the big four, though the pace of growth did slacken a bit in the first quarter. The important driver is data, which now accounts for about a fourth of the companies’ revenues. As long as data subscribers keep growing at 6 per cent or 7 per cent (as they have been during the past year) and a bit of extra revenue can be wrung out of business services and advertising, the cable model will keep working. Data subscriptions will eventually hit saturation, too – the big four have 36m data subscribers, up 4m in only 2 years, as compared to 42m video subs. That will leave price increases as the last, and hardest, route to revenue growth. But until that day comes, these pipes are plenty smart enough.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
98;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2012-04-18T19:50:29Z;Content’s kingdom a worry for cable;Consumers are starting to resist ever-rising bills;Content is king, but America’s distributors still look pretty regal. Geography and lobbying have conspired to allow effective local cable monopolies across much of the country, guaranteeing profit margins and cash flow that other countries’ pay-television companies envy.The US cable and satellite sector is up 20 per cent so far this year, after an S&P-beating 10 per cent gain last year. Comcast, the country’s largest cable provider, is also its largest media group, outstripping Walt Disney, News Corp and Time Warner in market value.“I’ve not detected this kind of optimism from cable distributors for years,” says Jerry Kent, a co-founder of Charter Communications (the fourth-largest US cable company) who now runs Suddenlink (the number seven, with revenues of $1.9bn and 1.4m customers).As a $350m network upgrade reaches its end, “we’re finally on the cusp of becoming what I like to call a cash-generating machine,” he says. “Our cash flow is going to be tremendous.” That has been good news for investors. Suddenlink has been able to repay 85 per cent of the money put in by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Quadrangle, Oaktree and others through refinancings.And although an IPO is “probably not on the cards” any time soon, Mr Kent doesn’t rule out the possibility of a deal or a dividend that would allow the investors to realise further gains.But Mr Kent has one concern that media investors should pay attention to. “The single issue I worry most about,” he says, is the rising cost of content.The growth story at companies from Discovery to News Corp has been underpinned by their seemingly unthreatened ability to charge ever greater prices for their programming.The revenues that content-owners got from cable distributors grew at a compound annual rate of 11.2 per cent between 2000 and 2010, from $6.7bn to $24.9bn, according to SNL Kagan. Free-to-air broadcasters such as CBS, meanwhile, have discovered the wonder of “retrans”, or charging distributors to retransmit their channels.So far, cable operators such as Mr Kent have managed to pass along rising content costs to consumers, but as alternatives to the cable bundle proliferate, from Hulu to Netflix, they are beginning to encounter resistance. Last year, as 76 carriage agreements came up for renegotiation, Suddenlink’s retransmission costs went up 50 per cent. It tried to pass that on, but its margins in video fell and it lost 3.5 per cent of its basic video customers.“I’m concerned at some point we’ll start pricing some consumers out of the multi-channel video market, particularly when you have $4 gasoline,” Mr Kent says.Much of the pressure is coming from sports costs, pushed up by competition for rights to the few events that still draw big live audiences. If he could sell sports networks separately, Mr Kent says he could cut 20 per cent off video bills.Suddenlink is now launching a 100-channel package with little sport in it, costing $25-$30 a month, rather than $55-$60 for the usual offering of a digital box, video on demand and several hundred channels.Pay-TV subscriptions have been flat for two years, Morgan Stanley estimates, and will decline slightly from next year. Mr Kent says “cord-cutting” by video customers – cancelling TV subscriptions in favour of watching online – has been insignificant so far, “but that could change if retrans pricing goes up”.“The real cord-cutting is going on in voice,” he says: “A little over 20 per cent of US homes don’t have a landline. We estimate over the next seven to 10 years that’ll grow to 40 per cent.” That speaks to a wider shift in the cable business model that should give content companies pause.Just as consumers now see less value in the landline telephone part of their cable bill, it seems likely they will see more value in the broadband part than video. As that shift takes place, the rise in programming revenues that content-providers are enjoying looks vulnerable.Sports channels such as ESPN may still be able to name their price, but Mr Kent is bearish about the smaller channels which fewer customers would miss. “At some point, you’ve got to make some tough decisions,” he says. This is not a good moment for cable channels to be suffering weak ratings.As they report quarterly earnings in the coming weeks, US content companies will show the rich rewards of their current strong negotiating position. But investors should remember that content’s reign still depends on a balance of power that also works for distributors.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s Media Editor
99;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2011-12-16T17:22:19Z;Cablevision shares tumble after resignation;;Shares in Cablevision, one of the largest cable television operators in the US, were down as much as 15 per cent after the surprise resignation of Tom Rutledge, the chief operating officer widely considered to be the company’s most important executive.“No company in our telecom, cable and satellite coverage universe [was] as exposed to key man risk as Cablevision,” said Craig Moffett, Bernstein Research analyst. “[Mr Rutledge] is in our view the hands-down best executive in the industry.”Mr Rutledge worked under James Dolan, chief executive and son of chairman and founder Charles Dolan. The Dolan family in effect controls the publicly traded company through its extensive holdings of voting and nonvoting shares.But it was Mr Rutledge who was credited by Wall Street for orchestrating Cablevision’s growth in recent years. He has maintained Cablevision’s market share in New York while facing stiff competition from Time Warner Cable and Comcast, and oversaw the spin-offs of both Mad Men producer AMC Networks and the Madison Square Garden Group.“Tom Rutledge has played a key role in driving and shaping Cablevision’s success over the last decade, applying a rare combination of technological vision and operational excellence that has delivered results,” James Dolan said in a statement on Friday.Yet Cablevision has struggled to grow this year, largely because it has managed to achieve high product penetration in its core markets. “Unfortunately, Cablevision is indeed a victim of its own success,” Mr Moffett said in a note last month.Cablevision, which serves customers in New York and other nearby states, has performed poorly compared with its peers over the past year. Even before Mr Rutledge’s departure, shares in the company were down 60 per cent over the past year. Shares in Comcast, the largest US cable operator, are up 8 per cent this year, while Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable operator, has seen its shares dip 3.5 per cent.Mr Rutledge had recently renewed his contract with Cablevision, and analysts speculated he may have either had a falling out with the Dolans or be in line to lead Charter Communications, which is looking for a new chief executive. John Bickham, Mr Rutledge’s longtime deputy, also recently left Cablevision.The management shake-up prompted some analysts to suggest that Cablevision might be a candidate for a takeover. But Mr Moffett said that Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two most likely buyers, were unlikely to pursue the asset. Comcast is still working to integrate its acquisition of NBCUniversal this year, while Time Warner Cable is known as a disciplined buyer.Miller Tabak analyst David Joyce downgraded Cablevision from “buy” to “neutral” on Friday, saying “the heavy lifting has been done by Rutledge” and predicting that the stock would stabilise lower after taking an initial hit.“Everything I hoped for when I came to Cablevision has come true,” Mr Rutledge said in a statement.

If time is to be left for work and sleep, old ways of watching must decline as new ones arise. Heavy investment in internet video by Amazon, Google and Netflix surely spooks executives at pay TV companies. Their nightmare scenario: the internet does to pay TV what wireless phones did to landlines.Third-quarter results from the largest TV distributors should ease fears about mass cable-cutting. The big cable companies – Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, Comcast, and Charter – all lost video subscribers, but the declines were lower than in the year-ago period. Telecoms companies AT&T and Verizon added TV customers, and the satellite company DirectTV had a bumper quarter for subs, driven by American football, more than offsetting nasty losses at rival Dish. Nor does competition from the internet seem to be causing price pressure: revenue per user was up across the industry.Still, total 2011 sub growth for cable companies is likely to be less than 1 per cent. Perhaps the internet is stealing marginal subscribers. In any case, the game has hardly begun. There are still fewer viewing options on the internet – pay TV has a virtual lock on sport, for example. And content producers will work to ensure that cable and satellite distributors keep getting the best stuff first, because that is where the money is, for now. They see the internet primarily as a new way to earn revenue from back catalogues.What will happen if, as the options available on the internet increase, viewers leave pay TV in greater numbers? One likely outcome is that broadband access (also sold by the cable and telecoms companies) will get pricier. Video already consumes more than half of internet bandwidth; as that grows, someone will have to pay for it.

ENI of $315m in the third quarter of 2010 swung to a loss of $1.14bn.The drop largely reflects changes in the unrealised valuation of companies in two buy-out funds operated by Apollo.The group said that the most significant components of the $1.4bn mark-to-market loss were related to debt and equity investments such as Charter Communications, chemical group LyondellBasell and Ceva, a logistics company.Leon Black, chairman and chief executive, said: “Although volatile global equity and credit markets resulted in lower unrealised values in our portfolios during the third quarter, today’s environment plays to our strength as a contrarian, value-oriented investor.”The earnings of listed private equity groups are highly sensitive to such swings in valuation estimates, as movements in accrued carried interest – the fees that will be charged for increasing the value of private equity investments when such gains are eventually realised – must be reflected in the income statement.Apollo told investors on its earnings call that about half of the losses had been recovered as markets rallied through October, and that all funds were currently valued above cost.Volatile markets have also made buying and selling companies more difficult as debt finance became harder to raise, with net transaction and advisory fee revenues charged by Apollo’s management business falling to $17.2m, from $19.5m a year earlier.Management fees were up 15 per cent to $123m, though assets under management during the quarter dropped from $71.7bn to $65.1bn.The group reported a net loss of $467m, or a loss of $3.86 per share, compared with net income of $24m in the third quarter last year.Apollo declared a cash distribution of 20 cents per share, worth $77m, following payments of 24 cents and 22 cents in the previous two quarters. The group also indicated that the sale of an education business, and dividends from LyondellBasell and Noranda Aluminum would raise about $165m of cash available for distribution in the final quarter.The buy-out group was founded in 1990 by Mr Black, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert banker. Shares in Apollo were down 1 per cent at midday in New York at $12.99 per share, or down by about one-third of its value since listing at $19 a share in March this year.

Station owners such as Disney have historically given away channels in exchange for launching cable networks such as ESPN.But TV station owners, eyeing the dual revenue streams of fees and advertising of pay-TV networks, have begun demanding fees for carriage of its free-to-air TV stations to offset declines in advertising revenue and viewership as consumers migrate to pay-TV channels and online video services such as Google’s YouTube.
103;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2009-12-04T17:36:28Z;Reckless banks still to pay;Judicial opinions highlight fresh risks to financial sectors’ profits;Among the most interesting developments in the wake of the credit meltdown are a few recent judicial rulings that come as creditors of companies in bankruptcy protection fight over corporate carcasses that by definition don’t have enough value to go around.Two recent judicial opinions rebuking the banks offer a window into the lending practices that fuelled the boom and the tactics that banks resorted to in a belated attempt to cut their losses. These cases highlight just how reckless the banks have been and how that recklessness may come back to haunt them – and their bottom lines.Even as credit markets rally and the prices of the loans they carry on their books improve, the banks may yet have to give back some of the gains they have already booked – a warning for investors who think most banks offer considerable upside now that the worst of the downturn is over.These cases are receiving widespread attention because the issue of excessive debt prior to bankruptcy filings is an issue that is beginning to be litigated widely. The cases include Charter Communications, as well as LyondellBasell and Tribune Co. where the outcome hasn’t yet been decided.The first ruling involves Tousa, a Florida homebuilder, where a bankruptcy judge ruled that Citigroup and other banks made fraudulent transfers when they lent Tousa about $500m in 2007. The loan was made less than 6 months before Tousa’s bankruptcy protection filing in January, 2008. The loan went to refinance an earlier loan for a disastrous acquisition in 2005 and to repay some lenders on the 2005 loan.The judge, John Olson, found that the lenders “were grossly negligent” in extending the second loan and “should have known the company was insolvent or perilously close to it,” according to the ruling.Few of the parties involved look good, according to the judge. The banks, their advisors and the company itself all seemingly pursued a course that was both short sighted and careless. “Citi harbored significant doubts about Tousa’s solvency, but motivated by the prospect of substantial fee income, pressed forward nevertheless,” the judge states. Meanwhile, Tousa’s chief executive officer Antonio Mon “had outsized personal incentives to consummate the transaction,” the judge said, noting that Mr Mon’s bonus of $4.5m was partly contingent on the successful completion of the loan.Before the new, 2007 loan went through, bondholders warned that the financing, which was additional, expensive debt could put Tousa close to insolvency and imperil its survival. Citigroup then asked for a solvency opinion, but the fees for that too were determined by the opinion.Tousa retained Alix Partners, and agreed to pay $2m if Alix opined that Tousa would still be solvent after the loan but would pay only time charges and costs if it did not so opine. The banks are appealing the judgment which will cost them more than $600m if it is not overturned on appeal. A spokesman for Citigroup declined comment.The second case involves Charter Communications, the fourth largest cable company in the US, and one of the most hotly contested battles to confirm an operational plan in the wake of a Chapter 11 filing. The judge rejected the banks’ claim that their loans were impaired, and said the banks were holding up the company’s emergence from bankruptcy protection just to change the terms of their loans and earn more interest. The adverse ruling could deprive the banks of $1bn in tax savings, a lawyer for the banks said. The banks in this case were led by JPMorgan whose spokesman declined to comment.These rulings come at a time when the Federal Reserve is being extraordinarily generous in allowing the banks to make money by keeping interest rates low. But their previous carelessness may still cost them dearly. After all, when the banks helped Enron disguise its debts eight years ago, they were victims of the practices they acquiesced in. And while there is no fraud this time around, bad judgment can still be expensive.henny.sender@ft.com

Among the thorniest challenges facing the Treasury will be deciding when to exit investments without jeopardising fragile financial stability.Mr Millstein is also responsible for ideas on how to maximise returns to taxpayers. Many government support programmes have already created constituencies that will be loath to abandon that support.Mr Millstein will be joining the Treasury as the government arguably plays a more intrusive role in financial matters than ever before. Regulators are physically sitting at the banks to an unprecedented degree, monitoring decisions involving everything from asset sales to executive pay.He will also wade into the debate over repayment of funds provided through the troubled asset relief programme (Tarp). Many have argued that Wall Street firms ought to have the right to repay when they wish, while others said the withdrawal of strong financial groups from the plan would focus potentially destabilising attention on the weak.Mr Millstein is one of several former Lazard executives to join the administration of Barack Obama, US president. Both Steve Rattner, who is leading the administration taskforce on restructuring the vehicle industry, and Ron Bloom, a senior adviser in that taskforce, were formerly at Lazard.At the investment group Mr Millstein was an adviser to the United Auto Workers in its talks with GM, Ford, Chrysler and Delphi. He has also been involved in some of the largest and messiest bankruptcies both in the US and abroad, participating in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection of WorldCom and representing Daewoo, the Korean conglomerate, as it restructured $50bn of debt.He has been working recently on the restructuring of Charter Communications, a US cable group.Mr Millstein, who began his career as a bankruptcy lawyer, has long been interested in politics.He served on Mr Obama’s transition team, where he advised others who took jobs at Treasury.
105;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2009-02-13T04:01:42Z;Charter to file for bankruptcy protection;;Charter Communications, the fourth largest US cable operator, will file for bankruptcy protection on or before April 1 as part of a financial restructuring to reduce its debt by $8bn.The company, controlled by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, has reached an agreement with a group of the company’s debt holders.Saddled with more than $21bn in long-term debt at the end of September 2008 accrued through a decade of acquisitions, the company has been severely impacted by the credit crisis and recession.The company began negotiating with debt holders in December to restructure its debt load, warning that it could be forced to file for bankruptcy.Charter currently has $800m in cash and equivalents and it said it plans to continue operating its cable systems, which services about 5.5m customers in 27 states. Mr Allen will continue to be an investor and the hold the largest voting interest in the company.The restructuring package involves some debt holders exchanging existing debt for new notes, receiving a mix of cash, preferred stock or warrants to purchase common stock.Current common stockholders will not receive anything.“Charter believes its liquidity, combined with its cash from operating activities, will be sufficient to meet its projected cash needs, including the payment of normal operating costs and expenses, as it proceeds with its financial restructuring,” said Neil Smit, president and chief executive officer of Charter.In the first three months of 2008, it lost close to $1bn and has reported a loss every year since going public in 1999.For the fourth quarter, it expects revenue to rise 7 per cent and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to rise more than 10 per cent.It also plans to write down $1.5bn of its assets related to its cable franchise agreements.
106;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2008-01-16T20:17:22Z;Dream court for American business;;Corporate America has scored a hat-trick in the US Supreme Court, winning a trio of big cases that could substantially reduce the amount of cripplingly costly investor litigation faced by any company that lists on US soil.This was exactly what President George W. Bush wanted. Faced with growing concern about how litigation costs are burdening the competitiveness of US markets, he did what only a president can do to stop it: packed the country’s top court with business-friendly conservatives such as John Roberts, the new chief justice, a former corporate lawyer, and Samuel Alito, a hardline conservative who replaced the inconsistently pro-corporate Sandra Day O’Connor.He created what amounts to a dream court for American business. So it is hardly surprising that the top court delivered another big win to business this week, ruling in Stoneridge v Scientific-Atlanta that banks, lawyers and accountants can often escape being sued by investors, even if they play a fairly big part in perpetrating a securities fraud. To be able to sue, investors must prove that they relied on the third parties to make their investment decisions. And that, normally, is very hard to do.That may sound like the wrong result for investors. Certainly, the facts of the case were unsavoury: Charter Communications, a cable company, persuaded Scientific-Atlanta and another supplier to participate in sham transactions so Charter could deceive its investors.That certainly sounds like behaviour that courts should punish – and indeed, they can: the Securities and Exchange Commission can sue third parties that scheme with companies to perpetrate fraud, and it can distribute the proceeds to wronged investors. The only issue in the Stoneridge case was: should private investors also be allowed to get in on the act, or should the task of suing third parties be left solely to professionals at the SEC?It is not as though third parties that aid and abet fraud are getting off scot-free: the SEC can, and should, still pursue them. Third parties – including accountants that help cook the books – must not be allowed to escape liability. But nor should profit-driven lawyers be allowed to eat up the recoveries with huge trans­action fees.Investor advocates, and their Democratic backers in Congress, have reacted to the ruling with howls of outrage. If Congress wants private investors (and their entrepreneurial lawyers) to sue third parties, it can pass a law that says so. In the meantime, that job is better left to the SEC.
107;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2008-01-15T20:29:24Z;Supreme Court blow to investor lawsuits;;Bankers, accountants and lawyers won powerful protection against US investor lawsuits on Tuesday when a Supreme Court ruling made it difficult for shareholders to sue third parties for frauds committed by companies.The court’s 5-3 decision, in the most important securities case in more than a decade, will make it even more difficult for investors to recoup billions of dollars they lost in frauds at Enron and HealthSouth.The issue in the case was whether investors could sue the suppliers of a company that committed securities fraud, claiming that they participated in a “scheme to defraud” investors even if they did not directly deceive shareholders.The court said they could not and threw out a lawsuit by the investors of Charter Communications, a cable company, against two of its suppliers, Motorola and Scientific-Atlanta, arguing that the shareholders did not rely on anything the suppliers did to make their investment decisions.The ruling will extend protection not just to banks and other third parties, but also to foreign suppliers and business partners of US companies that commit fraud.Permitting lawsuits against third parties would “allow plaintiffs with weak claims to extort settlements from innocent companies,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority.“It would also expose to such risks a new class of defendants – overseas firms with no other exposure to US securities laws – thereby deterring them from doing business here, raising the cost of being a publicly traded company under US law, and shifting securities offerings away from domestic capital markets.”The US business community had said such lawsuits would frighten foreign issuers away from US markets and dissuade overseas groups from doing business with US corporations.“The ruling will be a comfort to investors, particularly foreign investors that were concerned about being dragged through the mud of US securities laws,” said Robin Conrad, of the National Chamber Litigation Centre, the US Chamber of Commerce’s legal arm. However, the ruling was criticised by investor advocates.“Now is the wrong time to give powerful corporations a free pass to defraud shareholders,” said Dan Newman, of Coughlin Stoia, the law firm representing Enron victims.The case’s explosiveness led to a split within the US administration, with the SEC favouring investors but the White House taking a business-friendly line.
108;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2007-10-09T23:05:18Z;US judges reluctant to expand liability;;Investors could find it harder to sue a company’s banks, accountants and other business partners for securities fraud after a majority of justices in the US Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed reluctance to expose third parties to more costly shareholder lawsuits.The justices heard arguments in Stoneridge v Scientific-Atlanta, seen by both sides as the most important investor lawsuit in a decade.The court will not decide the case for weeks or months, but several justices appeared reluctant to expand liability under US securities laws in a way that could trap almost any company anywhere that does business with a US corporation that defrauds its ­investors.The lawsuit accuses Motorola and Scientific-Atlanta, makers of cable television set-top boxes, of violating federal securities laws by engaging in sham transactions to help Charter Communications, a cable company, deceive its investors.The outcome could also determine whether Enron investors, and those involved in other big securities fraud cases, can sue lawyers, accountants and even vendors who did business with the company that defrauded them.“I see no limitation to your proposal for liability,” Justice Anthony Kennedy told Stanley Grossman, the investors’ lawyer. Three other justices expressed scepticism about allowing private investors to bring securities lawsuits against third parties, arguing that Congress did not intend to allow such suits. “We should get out of the business of expanding” the rights of investors to bring securities lawsuits, said John Roberts, the chief justice. With only eight justices sitting, four would be enough to uphold the judgment of the lower court in the case, which limited third-party liability.The issue is not whether companies that commit fraud can be sued by investors but whether banks, accountants, lawyers, vendors or others who assist in the fraud can be sued by shareholders.Both sides agree that the Securities and Exchange Commission has the power to pursue third parties in court, and even to distribute recovered funds to investors. The Stoneridge case tests whether investors can bring lawsuits too, often for much larger damages.
109;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2007-10-08T19:27:10Z;Lawyer liability;;When Steve Shapiro gets up in front of the US Supreme Court on Tuesday to argue about third-party liability in investor lawsuits, he will have more than a lawyer’s interest in the outcome.Mr Shapiro will defend Motorola and Scientific-Atlanta against claims that the two companies helped Charter Communications pump up its bottom line. The central issue in the case is whether investors burnt by accounting fraud at a public company can recover damages from third parties who participated in an alleged “scheme to defraud.” The justices are expected to use it to determine whether class action lawyers will be able to sue the investment banks, accountants and lawyers who did work for troubled companies.Among those which now have a stake in the outcome is Mr Shapiro’s law firm, Mayer Brown. A global firm with 1,500 lawyers, it was sued last week by Refco investors. They allege Mayer Brown lawyers allowed the now-bankrupt futures broker to make false statements in its initial public offering and processed a series of transactions that allegedly helped Refco hide $430m in bad debt. Mayer Brown denies wrongdoing.Legal arguments on so-called “scheme liability” may seem arcane, but Charter Communications is the most important business case in the Supreme Court this year. It will have implications for investors who lost money on Enron, HealthSouth and Parmalat and a host of others: in accounting fraud cases, the company at issue often ends up bankrupt, so third-party providers are the main – or only – ones able to pay restitution.But legally this is a tough call, and the justices will need to draw the line very carefully. Lawyers, bankers and accountants should not get a free pass if they enable fraud. By allowing claims in a tightly defined set of circumstances, the Supreme Court should be able to protect investor rights without opening the door to an indiscriminate flood of lawsuits.
110;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2007-09-30T21:11:44Z;US court to rule on third-party liability;;The post-Enron battle against corporate fraud could be about to reach an important turning point, as the US Supreme Court considers whether to extend ­liability for corporate fraud to virtually any company that does business with a US corporation that defrauds its investors.The top court, which begins a new term on Monday, could have the fate of US competitiveness in its hands as it hears its most important investor lawsuit in at least a decade.US business has hired some of the country’s most powerful lawyers to lobby the court to take its side in the case, Stoneridge v Scientific-Atlanta. The business community wants the court to protect US and foreign companies – along with accountants, lawyers and investment banks – from a new wave of costly investor lawsuits. What they would regard as the wrong ruling in the case could frighten foreign issuers away from US markets and dissuade overseas groups from doing business with US corporations, business groups say.Investor advocates say that if they lose the case, victims of corporate fraud – including those who suffered in the Enron debacle – would find it hard to gain compensation.The political explosiveness of the case – which pits humble investors against alleged corporate villains – has led to a public split within the US administration. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is favouring investors, but the justice department – which will actually argue before the court – has taken a business-friendly line.The case involves a cable company, Charter Communications, which inflated its revenues by using bogus transactions with two suppliers. Investors sued the suppliers claiming they participated in a “scheme” to defraud them. The question before the court is: do the securities laws allow shareholders to sue third parties who, knowingly or unwittingly, participate in a “scheme to defraud” – even if they did not directly mislead investors?Supreme Court precedent largely immunises secondary participants in a fraud, including investment banks, lawyers, accountants, and vendors.“The concept that third party vendors can be held liable under the securities laws just for doing deals with people who violate those laws will send shock waves through the global business community,” said Carter Phillips of law firm Sidley Austin, who is one of the US’s top business lawyers and who wrote a brief in the case for the US Chamber of Commerce.“It will not be lost on anyone doing business with a US company that they are potentially at risk of becoming a defendant in a securities class action.”The chamber’s brief says that such “scheme” liability would force US companies to “price their commercial transactions to reflect the substantial added risk of liability for their counterparties” and could cause foreign companies to prefer non-US business partners.But William Lerach, the US plaintiffs’ lawyer, whose firm represents Enron ­victims, says scheme liability is crucial in the battle to win compensation for them. He mounted a powerful crusade for scheme liability in the US media – until last month, when he pleaded guilty to federal charges in connection with a plaintiff kickback scheme.Professor Donald Langevoort of Georgetown University Law Center, who calls the case the “Roe v Wade” of securities law (a reference to the landmark abortion decision that is a milestone of Supreme Court jurisprudence), says the court could choose a middle path between shareholders and companies.Legal experts point out that the SEC has the power to sue third parties to recover for investors – the only question before the court now is whether shareholders can bring their own private lawsuits.
111;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2007-08-16T03:16:18Z;Blow for investors over US securities litigation;;Investors seeking redress from third parties accused of aiding companies to defraud shareholders suffered a blow on Wednesday when the Bush administration came down against the plaintiffs’ bar and in favour of companies in a landmark case heading to the Supreme Court.The development is also a blow for Enron investors who have sued the defunct energy company’s bankers - including Merrill Lynch, Barclays and Credit Suisse – for allegedly helping Enron executives carry out the accounting fraud that eventually destroyed the company.It is an awkward development for Christopher Cox, Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, who had urged the US solicitor general to side with investors in the case, known as Stoneridge vs. Scientific Atlanta.The issue has come to the Supreme Court because US circuit courts disagree on the scope of suing third parties – known as “scheme liability”.At stake is a decision that will determine whether securities litigation could be allowed to proliferate further, which in turn could set a precedent for future cases involving business for years.The case has created divisions between the Bush administration and business on the one hand, and key Democrats on the other. It has also thrown up the unusual spectacle of the Treasury at odds with the SEC on the issue.Mr Cox had appealed to the solicitor general to come down on the side of investors.Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary, told Congress recently a decision against companies would “create a very uncertain legal environment” that would be “very harmful for the economy” and the attractiveness of US capital markets.The Stoneridge case involves Charter Communications, a cable company, which is being sued by its shareholders.They allege that Motorola and Scientific-Atlanta, a set-top box maker later acquired by Cisco Systems, should be held liable for being part of Charter’s allegedly fraudulent inflation of its revenues through the purchase of set-top boxes from the two companies – even though the vendors may not have been aware of the misreporting.On Wednesday, the solicitor general filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court supporting Motorola and Scientific-Atlanta.The justice department said any expansion of the “inferred right of [legal] action” in a fraud case “would expose not only accountants and lawyers who advise issuers of securities, but also vendors and other firms that simply do business with issuers, to potentially billions of dollars in liability when those issuers make misrepresentations to the market”.In June, Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and John Conyers, chairman of the House judiciary committee, filed their own amicus brief in the case.They warned that if the Supreme Court decides against investors in the case “third parties will effectively be immune from suit no matter how reprehensible their conduct”.Two of Wall Street’s biggest lobby groups on Wednesday sided with the solicitor general. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Futures Industry Association filed a joint amicus brief in the Stoneridge case.Marc Lackritz, Sifma president, said: “Experts in the field of securities fraud have called Stoneridge ‘the most important case in a generation.’“If the scope of class action lawsuits is unnecessarily and improperly expanded just to capture deep-pocketed third-parties, then litigation, transaction, and compliance costs would soar – squeezing bottom lines for companies in the US and deterring foreign investment – at the expense of the American economy, its workers and investors.”

It chose March 1 to become a publicly traded company – the week stock markets around the world fell sharply.Time Warner Cable’s top management joked about their timing in a call to investors about the company’s growth prospects, led by the strong demand for its video, internet and telephone services. They also flagged up last year’s $17bn acquisition of Adelphia, the bankrupt cable operator, as a growth opportunity, which gave it a strong position in the key Los Angeles market.Since then, they have no doubt been watching the hourly moves in Time Warner Cable’s shares. Launched at just over $39 per share, a week later they were trading at just under $37. So far, just 16 per cent of Time Warner Cable shares are traded. Its parent, media giant Time Warner, retains the other 84 per cent.What will matter more than their short-term moves, however, is what happens to the shares over the next year or more. Although Time Warner Cable is the second-biggest US cable operator with over 13m television subscribers (Comcast is number one with 24m) at some point analysts anticipate the company will need to expand.Cable companies already offer many of their TV subscribers high-speed internet access. Increasingly, they are selling a third service, telephone access, and mobile phone connections could follow. The popularity of such bundles, dubbed triple play, is leading telecom rivals like AT&T and Verizon to step up investment in television.One benefit of scale is the ability to negotiate better terms for television content. For most cable companies, one of the biggest factors putting pressure on margins has been rising programming costs, and containing those is crucial.“Time Warner Cable shares will be boosted this year through the effective integration of the Adelphia systems and the success of the triple play offering. This will be a prerequisite before its newfound currency can be used to ultimately consolidate the smaller cable companies in the industry,” says Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.He adds: “Being number two in cable will be less important in a few years. Time Warner Cable will need to be bigger to have a seat at the table with Comcast, AT&T and Verizon.”Last year, cable companies such as Comcast and Cablevision were among the year’s top performers, with Comcast’s shares rising over 60 per cent. Investors, who had fled the sector amid fears of a price wars among cable, satellite and telecom giants, returned, drawn by the popularity of the service bundles.This year, values have declined, but many analysts remain positive.“We continue to be bullish on the operating fundamentals for the cable industry and believe that valuations for cable stocks have lots of upside to them,” says Katherine Styponias, analyst at Prudential Equity Group.Even if markets continue to wobble on economic concerns, she said this might not be bad for cable. “Cable businesses tend to hold up very well in tough economic times as consumers rarely turn off their cable TV subscriptions as a way to save money,” says Ms Styponias.Consolidation in the cable business is widely regarded as likely to start next year. Dick Parsons, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, recently said he thought it was a “three- to five-year process.”With many cable companies controlled by families or individuals, it is hard to predict what might trigger decisions to sell.Cablevision, based in the New York area, has been a potential acquisition target for Time Warner for decades. Although Charles Dolan, whose family controls the group, came close to selling in the past there is no sign that he is willing to cede control.There are other possibilities. Atlanta-based Cox Communications, one of the first to go private, might be a target.Charter Communications, in which Paul Allen of Microsoft fame is the biggest shareholder, would also be a natural fit for Time Warner, not least because buying it would allow it to control all of Los Angeles, a city it now dominates following the Adelphia deal. Another possible target is Insight Communications, which is focused on the Midwest.Time Warner Cable is already preparing for the battles ahead. “We are going to evaluate how we manage our capital structure,” John Martin, Time Warner Cable’s chief financial officer, said last week. “We are looking to maintain enough financial capacity to fund our current business plans, as well as keep enough flexibility to be able to go out and seize on any unique opportunities, should they present themselves.”
113;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2005-08-24T22:34:15Z;Investors cheer Charter debt exchange plan;;Charter Communications, the cable company controlled by billionaire Paul Allen, on Wednesday announced an $8.4bn debt exchange plan that analysts said could save the group from bankruptcy.Shares and bonds of Charter rose sharply in response to the plan, reflecting investor confidence that the cable group would be more viable if it could cut debt by up to $1.65bn and repay remaining debt at a later date.“This impending restructuring will make Charter more of a going concern, rather than a company facing impending financial restructuring,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, analyst at UBS.Mr Bourkoff said a stronger balance sheet might make Charter a target for other cable operators, or generate interest for parts of its operations. “The poor state of the balance sheet was acting as a poison pill.”Charter, which has about $19bn in debt, plans to exchange notes maturing from 2009 to 2012 for debt securities due in 2015. UBS estimates the exchange would reduce its outstanding bonds by up to $1.65bn.Shares in Charter, the fourth-biggest US cable company, have fallen nearly 50 per cent this year on concerns about its debt burden. On Wednesday, after the announcement, the shares rose just over 40 per cent to $1.62. In the last four years Charter has only reported one profitable quarter, according to analysts. The group has also been losing subscribers, reporting 41,700 fewer basic-cable and 9,000 digital-video subscribers in the second quarter.Mr Allen, who was a co-founder of Microsoft, owns 58 per cent of the company’s stock and 93 per cent of its voting shares. Earlier this month, Charter appointed Neil Smit as chief executive officer, a position that had been vacant since January. The group still has a vacancy for chief financial officer.Even after the debt exchange, Charter’s financial position will still be considerably weaker than that of its rivals. Comcast, Time Warner and Cox, the top three cable operators, all have investment-grade credit ratings. Charter’s ratings are in the triple-C category, almost the lowest ranking before default.Analysts at Fitch ratings said on Wednesday the extension of debt maturities would be “positive developments for Charter’s overall credit profile”. But they added that it would not improve near-term liquidity and that there were no prospects “to meaningfully delever its balance sheet over the near term”.The rating agency expects to continue to rate Charter’s debt in the triple-C category.
114;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2005-01-18T18:59:37Z;New blow for Charter as chief executive quits;;Charter Communications on Tuesday announced the departure of Carl Vogel, its chief executive, in the latest resignation from the debt-burdened US cable operator.Charter's $18.5bn in debt has restricted its ability to upgrade cable systems and deploy new services to stem customer defections to rival TV operators including Rupert Murdoch's DirectTV.As a result, Charter, which has about 6.3m subscribers, has lost customers in 10 of its last 11 quarters, including 58,600 in the third quarter of 2004. Last year, it slipped to fourth among US cable operators, behind Comcast, Time Warner and Cox. Charter named Robert May, a non-executive director and chairman of HealthSouth, the US health company, as interim chief executive. Mr Vogel is standing down ?by mutual agreement?.Industry analysts blamed his departure on differences with Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft and Charter's chairman and majority shareholder, over reducing indebtedness.Richard Greenfield, of Fulcrum Global Partners in New York, warned of more resignations following Mr Vogel's abrupt departure. ?We believe other executive contracts stipulate that if Mr Vogel leaves the company, it facilitates their ability to leave as well.? The company made no comment on the terms of Mr Vogel's departure or likely compensation. The chief executive had a contract that was due to expire at the end of 2005.Shares in Charter yesterday fell more than 6 per cent to close at $1.92 on concerns at the executive changes. Last year, the shares declined about 48 per cent.The shake-up comes nine months after Charter admitted it had overstated its revenue and cashflow for 2000, 2001 and the first nine months of 2003 prompting a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.Mr Vogel had been chief executive and president since October 2001. Mr May is expected to lead the company until a permanent successor is found.
115;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2004-11-16T21:39:07Z;Inflation fears weigh on Wall Street stocks;;"Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday as higher-than-expected producer price inflation data combined with some mixed-to-disappointing quarterly results from leading retailers, which were sold off because of expectations of a market pullback.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent at 10,488.24, while the broader S&P 500 index shed 0.7 lower at 1,175.49. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.7 per cent to 2,078.62.Tom McManus, the investment strategist at Banc of America Securities, described the recent rally in the S&P 500 as a ""round trip"" to the levels the index was at three years ago, but questioned whether it implied that the outlook for US stocks had improved.The government said producer prices rose by 1.7 per cent last month, the highest pace in 15 years because of rising fuel costs. Even the core inflation gauge that excludes volatile food and energy expenditure exceeded forecasts.Anthony Chan, managing director and senior economist at JP Morgan Fleming noted that the rise might not necessarily translate in a corresponding advance for consumer prices amid a continued climate of pricing power for US corporations.""This was a wake-up call to the markets that profit margins will shrink,"" Mr Chan said.The rise in the inflation reading also increases concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again next month. Combined with possible upward pressure on interest rates from a declining dollar, mounting inflation is acknowledged by many as a threat to the outlook for stocks.Several big retailers reported strong results but their shares declined amid concerns about the pace of sales growth with the Christmas shopping season starting next week. US consumers' spending appetite has been widely credited for the economy's rebound, however slow that has appeared at times. The sell-off in retailer shares came amid expectations for a broader retreat in stock prices after a three-week rally.Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, reported an expected rise in profits of 13 per cent and increased its full-year forecast. Shares edged off 1.4 per cent to $56.89 as investors appeared unimpressed by the retailer's weak sales growth and its chief executive's upbeat projection for the holiday shopping season.Also among Dow industrial stocks, Home Depot's shares gave up 1.8 per cent to $43 as the US' biggest home improvement goods and services retailer increased its full-year earnings forecast after reporting a profit increase above expectations of 15 per cent.Wal-Mart and Home Depot paced a broad sell-off for the sector as the retail index gave up 1.7 per cent by the close. Other notable retail stocks to fall were May Department Stores, down 2.4 per cent to $28.52, and Sears Roebuck, down 2.4 per cent to $45.20.The downward trend for retailers was evident as JC Penney shares dipped 1.1 per cent to $39.98 even after it exceeded analysts' expectations for the quarter.Saks further disappointed investors with an unexpected quarterly loss it attributed to hurricanes in the south-eastern US. Shares lost 5.9 per cent to $13.Staples, the office products retailer, saw shares give up 1 per cent to $30.87 after it reported a 26 per cent rise in quarterly profits, forecasting earnings in line with expectations for the fourth quarter. The company said strong sales in the back-to-school season and in Europe contributed to its results.Shares in Office Depot, Staples' main rival, lost 2.8 per cent to $16.68.Away from retailers, shares in Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage financing company, gave up 1.1 per cent to $69.40. Fannie delayed its quarterly results and warned that accounting problems could lead it to report a $9bn loss.Google's stock shed 6.7 per cent to $172.54 as 38.5m shares held mostly by the internet search provider's staff became available for sale, following the end of a ""lock-up"" period after the initial public offering.General Motors put further pressure on the Dow industrials, down 1.5 per cent to $39.65 after the Wall Street Journal reported the carmaker was backing away from its pledge to achieve earnings per share of $10 in the next two years.Also lower were the shares of Charter Communications, a cable company that announced plans to raise $750m in convertible bonds that are seen as diluting future shareholder value. Shares lost 20 per cent to $2.16.In merger and acquisition news, Community Banks agreed to take over PennRock Financial Services for $326m. Community shares fell 10.1 per cent to $28.28 while PennRock gained 30.1 per cent to $38.71."
116;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2004-10-07T20:19:02Z;Charter issues profits warning;;Charter Communications, the cable TV operator chaired by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, on Thursday issued a profits warning amid subscriber losses and rising programming costs.Shares in the company fell 2.2 per cent to $2.65 after it said it expected to lose up to 60,000 cable subscribers in the third quarter, compared with a gain of about 11,000 subscribers in the same period of last year.Charter, which has divested cable systems boasting more than 250,000 subscribers, said like-for-like earnings would be virtually flat before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and would be down 3-5 per cent against the earnings reported in the third quarter of 2003.The company has been hit by intense competition among cable operators and aggressive marketing by satellite rivals such as DirecTV, controlled by News Corp, and EchoStar.In a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Charter said: ?Revenue growth was primarily offset by increased programming, customer care and service-related expenditures, resulting in compression of the adjusted Ebitda margin.?Several US cable operators are labouring under heavy debt burdens, including Charter which has $18.4bn of borrowings, while Adelphia has put its up for sale after emerging from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Industry analysts warned that Charter had lost subscribers in seven of the past eight quarters. They also questioned whether Mr Allen would refinance the company or seek a merger with Adelphia.Adelphia has invited bid for its seven regional cable groups, valued at a total of $17bn-$20bn or $3,000-$4,000 per subscriber.The board of the cable company has reportedly responded coolly to the idea of a joint bid from Time Warner and Comcast for its cable assets. Time Warner and Comcast have confirmed they are in preliminary talks about a combined offer, but pointed out that the auction process had only just begun.
117;CHTR;Charter Communicatio;2004-08-27T19:39:31Z;Investors line up for Adelphia auction;;"A number of private equity groups are preparing to participate in the auction for Adelphia, the bankrupt US cable operator that is hoping to sell about $20bn worth of properties before the end of the year.Providence Equity Partners, Spectrum Equity Investors, and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, have each partnered with regional cable operators to consider entering the process, according to people familiar with the matter.Investment bankers at UBS and Allen & Co, hired by Adelphia to run the auction, are in the process of dividing the company's assets into four to seven separate geographical clusters for the sale. These, rather than the whole company, are more palatable sizes for buy-out groups to invest in.Financial data is expected to be sent out to potential buyers in the middle of next month.Also expected to participate in the auction are Time Warner and Comcast, the two media conglomerates. They are the only two possible bidders for the entire company, which is the US's fifth largest cable operator with subscribers from Los Angeles to Pennsylvania, but could also submit offers for the parts. Cox Communications is seen as unlikely to play a significant role after its parent company, Cox Enterprises, made a $7.9bn offer to buy out the 38 per cent of the company it doesn't already own earlier this month.In preparing to bid for clusters of Adelphia assets, Providence is working with Bresnan Communications, which has a significant presence in Western states such as Montana and Wyoming; Spectrum with Patriot Media, which is run by cable entrepreneur Steve Simmons; and Goldman with Cebridge Connections, the Missouri-based company run by Jerry Kent, the former chief executive of Charter Communications.Initial indications of interest for the assets are expected to come towards the end of October, and a deal could be struck by the end of the year. The outcome of the auction is only likely to be approved by the bankruptcy court if it yields a greater valuation of Adelphia than an internal reorganisation plan that fixed the company's price at about $18bn. However that number may not be the ultimate reference as valuations of publicly traded cable companies have fallen recently amid fears of competition from satellite operators.Last month, John Rigas, Adelphia's founder, was found guilty of fraud and conspiracy in the company's collapse. Adelphia is one of the most notorious examples of the wave of scandals to hit corporate America after the bursting of the dotcom bubble. It still lacks audited financial statements, which will have to be prepared ahead of any deal to sell Adelphia's assets."
