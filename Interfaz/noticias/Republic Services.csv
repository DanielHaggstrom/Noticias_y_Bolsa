Since then, the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 index has climbed 10 per cent.“The value of most currencies, including ours, is going to decline in purchasing power,” he told the Financial Times this month. “I still believe, over a 10-year period from now, I would much rather own stocks than cash.”The October 2008 statement, which struck some investors as a premature call on the stock market rally, now looks prescient.Berkshire’s per-share book value, or total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities, surged 10 per cent in the past three months and is up 15.2 per cent from the start of the year, largely because of a rise in the value of its vast stock holdings. The company’s value last year slumped 9.6 per cent, its steepest annual drop in Mr Buffett’s tenure. Its class A shares, which tumbled last year as the downturn hit profits, and investors fretted about Mr Buffett’s derivatives contracts, have rebounded this year.Berkshire, the holding company Mr Buffett has controlled since 1965, purchased more than 87,000 shares of Exxon, the world’s biggest oil producer, and added 3.4m American depositary receipts in Nestlé.Berkshire’s Walmart holdings totalled almost 38m shares at the end of the third quarter, up 90 per cent from the June period. The stake was valued at more than $1.8bn in September.The Omaha-based company also reported stakes in Republic Services and Travelers, the insurer.Berkshire’s net income tripled to $3.24bn in the third quarter, aided by strong stock markets and derivatives gains.Berkshire recorded more than $1.1bn in accounting gains on derivatives during the quarter. The gain came mostly from its $30bn-plus portfolio of credit default swaps, which rose in value as rising markets reduced the likelihood that the company would have to pay out on the insurance-like instruments.Berkshire’s operating businesses, which range from insurance to jets, had profits of $2bn during the third quarter, in line with the previous three months.
1;RSG;Republic Services;2008-12-15T16:25:51Z;Waste management: A problem that comes in heaps;;The world’s waste industry will not be swallowed by the economic black hole, but it will experience a few bumps.Half of all the 1.72bn tonnes of rubbish produced by the 27 European Union member states every year derives from construction and demolition: there will be a bit less of that in the next few years.But rising regulatory standards and consumer expectations, both in the western world and developing economies, will drive the continuing transformation of what was once a trucking-to-landfill industry into a high-technology, capital intensive resource-capture business.The consequences for the way the industry is organised are far-reaching and accelerating. In October, a bid battle between the two US industry leaders for control of the third-largest player ended only when Waste Management, the champion, was unable to raise funds to buy Republic Services, the number three.Republic now hopes to complete its agreed merger with Allied Waste, the number two. That will put a pair of $10bn turnover businesses at the head of a $43bn-a-year industry that still remains hugely fragmented.According to America’s National Solid Waste Management Association, there were about 27,000 private sector companies and public sector bodies operating in the business in 2001, of which only 45 per cent were private companies. Many cities and towns still truck their own garbage to the nearest redundant quarry.In Europe the industry is also fragmented, but consolidation has been advancing fast. Today, two players, both French, stand head and shoulders above rivals. Veolia Environnement, an environmental services company with revenues of €32bn, claims world leadership in the waste business with €9.2bn (£8.2bn, $12.4bn) of waste revenues and 100,000 employees in 33 countries.Its nearest challenger is Suez Environnement, demerged from utility group GDF Suez during 2008, which counts €12bn of turnover, of which 46 per cent comes from its waste business, Sita.The scale of their leadership across Europe is shown by the situation in the UK, according to Stephen Hazelton of consultants Ernst & Young. Although the market leader is home-grown Biffa, with 2007 revenues of £743m, Veolia and Sita come next in the ranking.The source of all this rubbish is, of course, economic prosperity. The more we consume, the more waste we produce. Setting aside construction waste, in 2004 the EU 27 produced 584m tonnes of industrial waste, 33.8 per cent of the total, and 206m tonnes of household waste, a mere 11.9 per cent, while the remaining 70m tonnes, or 4.1 per cent, was toxic waste.But dealing with old bricks or industrial scrap is relatively easy. It is this fast-growing mountain of black sacks – containing anything from rotting vegetables through polystyrene meat trays to broken iPod headphones – that poses the biggest challenge.In the US, the amount of municipal solid waste has multiplied almost three-fold from 80m tonnes in 1960 to 230m tonnes in 2007.The mess we make is extraordinary. In 2003 the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, reckoned its households chucked away an average of 2.88 tonnes of rubbish a year. An average American produces around 750kg of household waste a year, his European counterpart 520kg.And this is despite legislative intervention. The EU drafted its first waste directive in 1975, and subsequently passed a string of “vertical” directives dealing with particular waste streams including oil, electrical batteries and electronic equipment. In October this year, it added revisions to the original directive.Meanwhile US policy has been driven by individual state legislation, within the framework of the national Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 1976.On both sides of the Atlantic, legislators and enforcement agencies are increasingly trying to pursue a multiple strategy: seeking to reduce the amount of waste generated, promote recovery of as much usable material or energy as possible, and minimise landfill.The result is what Christophe Cros, executive chairman of Sita France, describes as the convergence of Europe’s €50bn waste management industry with its €50bn recycling industry. Around the continent, integrated waste management companies are scooping up scrap metal, plastics and paper merchants.Industrial recycling, based on distinct waste streams and significant volumes, is relatively easy, but now communities, or their contractors, have increasingly to extract everything of value from household waste too. Legislation has set demanding recovery targets, scarcity has driven up material and energy prices and together with rising volumes, this has improved economics.The European Environment Agency, drawing on the EU Sustainable Development Strategy 2006, defines the present objectives as being to reduce use of non-renewable resources, and to ensure renewable resources are not used at a rate that exceeds their “regeneration capacity”.But “mining” waste streams for commodities requires increasingly sophisticated technology, as does extracting biogas from rotting organic waste or building massive industrial composting plants.Gone are the days of migrant workers in filthy overalls picking plastic bottles off conveyor belts. Waste management is becoming a continent-wide, or global, business requiring big capital investments in high-technology plants, secured against long-term contracts.Local authorities are increasingly outsourcing their obligations to experts, sometimes using public-private partnerships.This western model is spreading around the globe. Rapid urbanisation, most notably in China, has brought cities in developing economies waste disposal problems akin to those of their western counterparts. Though volumes of rubbish per citizen are still much lower, and low labour costs have often led to informal recycling by poor people picking through rubbish heaps, companies including Veolia have been successful in winning contracts.Mr Cros, of Sita, highlights a second opportunity-driver in developing economies, however. While many third-world cities may lack the funds for sophisticated recycling, they still need to clear rubbish from blossoming shanty-towns to prevent health hazards.But the industry’s biggest growth driver will remain legislation and the soaring cost of landfill in developed markets. With fewer places to put the rubbish, the waste industry is increasingly obliged either to recycle it, or to burn it to generate electricity.
2;RSG;Republic Services;2008-11-25T16:33:48Z;Dealmaking on hold for the moment;;"Investment bankers advising on mergers and acquisitions spent much of this year denying the slowdown in deal activity.Up until the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September, many bankers believed that companies with strong balance sheets would take advantage of falls in the share prices of their rivals to snap up some bargains.But when the US investment bank declared bankruptcy, the mood among chief executives was transformed and conserving cash took priority over using money for acquisitions.Tom Cooper, vice-chairman of investment banking at UBS, says: “M&A activity is closely linked to market sentiment. In weak markets, corporate boards worry about the market reaction to large deals.”He adds: “This is compounded today, as many companies want to conserve cash. Next year should see a lot of recapitalisations, as companies seek to replace maturing debt with more permanent capital.”Certainly, trade buyers have struggled to finance their deals, as the cost of borrowing increased markedly during the third quarter.Electricité de France, Europe’s largest power producer, abandoned plans to make a new €4bn ($5bn) offer for Constellation of the US; Waste Management withdrew its $6.73bn offer for Republic Services; and PCCW halted the sale of a stake in its HKT unit.Richard Taylor, a managing director in Merrill Lynch’s UK investment banking, says: “The economic environment is making it difficult to forecast trading conditions.“It is not surprising that this, coupled with the tough financing markets, is expected to lead to a significant decline in M&A activity. However, there will be sector winners, and the benefits of consolidation will not be lost, especially in an environment of depressed valuations.”Concerns over short-term refinancing rates, which have become increasingly expensive, have also caused companies to be much more cautious about M&A.This was one of Xstrata’s reasons for walking away from an indicative £33 ($50)-a-share bid for Lonmin this month.Although Xstrata had commitments from banks for a $15bn loan to cover the acquisition, a large portion of this debt was offered in the form of one-year facilities, leaving Xstrata exposed to refinancing risks.“While debt financing continues to be available for selected transactions, a stretched debt market alongside macroeconomic uncertainty and high share price volatility continue to weigh negatively on activity levels,” observes Wilhelm Schulz, co-head of mergers and acquisitions for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Citigroup.But some of the deals being put in the deep freeze now, could be thawed out once the credit markets stabilise and investor confidence is restored.Bidders such as Xstrata have left the door open by buying large blocking stakes in their target companies.The Anglo-Swiss miner now holds almost 25 per cent of Lonmin, which prevents other bidders from gaining control.For others, being forced to abandon a deal in the current economic climate has actually proved to be beneficial for their share price.JCDecaux, for example, was rewarded by investors when it ended talks to acquire News Corp’s eastern European billboard business in October, because of difficult market conditions.Shares in the French outdoor advertising group shot up 14 per cent on the announcement.But for the companies selling, withdrawn bids can mean that their own expansion plans are delayed.News Corp, for instance, was depending on the JCDecaux deal to fund expansion of its pay television interests in western Europe.Almost all companies will try to conserve their cash during the downturn, rather than spend it on acquisitions.Jeremy Cohen, a partner in the M&A practice at Denton Wilde Sapte, the international law firm, says: “Next year looks likely to continue to be depressed for UK M&A, with larger corporates conserving their cash and with those private equity funds that do have cash being wary of the markets and focused on portfolio management.”One of the few bright spots for M&A bankers, is offered by financial institutions. This area has been booming, as banks and insurers continue their capital-raising activities, restructuring and asset disposals to repair damaged balance sheets.The sector witnessed extensive consolidation in the third quarter, with deals announced totalling some $173.9bn, accounting for 55 per cent of all global banking M&A volume during that period. That made it the third highest banking quarterly volume on record, behind the second quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 1998.The largest deals were the $44.4bn acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, followed by Lloyds TSB Group’s proposed acquisition of HBOS for $21.9bn.Many of these deals are being struck at bargain prices. For example, the acquisition of BankWest, the Australian arm of HBOS by Commonwealth Bank of Australia, represents 0.8 times book value. Meanwhile, Bank of America’s takeover of Merrill equates to 1.8 times the stated tangible book value.By contrast, in 1998, one of the busiest years for banking consolidation, the average multiple paid was 2.88 times book value.For instance, Bank of New York’s unsolicited stock swap offer for Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh that year valued the target at 5.71 times its book value.Bankers expect to see continued consolidation in the sector, next year, driven in principal by capital adequacy demands.Mr Schulz said that defensive, cash-generative sectors such as utilities and healthcare will also continue to show healthy deal momentum, as they have done throughout 2008.He says: “In addition, we anticipate liquidity-driven M&A – which has fuelled much of the recent activity in the financial sector – to accelerate and branch out into cyclical industry segments.”Banks are also focusing on the mid-market as a potential source of fees. This is in part because such deals are typically financed by individual banks without the need to club together or syndicate.Mr Cohen says: “M&A in the small- and mid-cap sectors seems likely to revive ahead of large caps.“In terms of deal finance, there is likely to be an increased proportion of equity and a greater amount of vendor financing, whether by way of deferred consideration, loan notes or earn-out structures, as well as a return to share-for-share deals.”"
3;RSG;Republic Services;2008-10-16T17:06:47Z;M&A deals hit by caution;;"In M&A, there has never been a more apt time for Patrick Bateman’s slip of the tongue in American Psycho. The character says he works in Murders & Executions.For the first time in five years, more deals are being killed than being unveiled as companies cite financing uncertainties and the economic downturn as the main reasons for walking away.In less than a week, the roll call of dead mergers has notched up companies in Europe, the US and Asia.These include EDF’s abandoned plans to make a new €4bn ($5.3bn) offer for Constellation of the US; Waste Management withdrew its $6.73bn offer for Republic Services; and PCCW halted the sale of a stake in its new HKT unit.“A lot of transactions are falling over not because of the lack of financing per se, but because of the difficulties of refinancing in a short time scale, for example through bond issues or disposals,” said Tom Cooper, vice-chairman of investment banking at UBS.Short-term refinancing rates have become increasingly expensive in recent weeks, causing companies to be much more cautious about the risk of M&A in the short to medium-term.This was one of Xstrata’s reasons for walking away from an indicative £33-a-share bid for Lonmin earlier this month.Although Xstrata had commitments from banks for a $15bn loan to cover the acquisition, a large portion of this debt was offered as one-year facilities, leaving Xstrata exposed to refinancing risks.However, not all these deals will be left in the deep freeze. Bankers expect some bidders to revisit their acquisition plans once financing costs ease and investor confidence is restored.Bidders such as Xstrata have left the door open by buying large blocking stakes in their target companies.The Anglo-Swiss miner now holds almost 25 per cent of Lonmin, which prevents other bidders from gaining control.“M&A is about careful timing. At the moment, chief executives are reluctant to bid until they can see some consistency, and less volatility, in the markets,” said Henrik Aslaksen, co-head of global M&A at Deutsche Bank.“If the performance of a target company is going to deteriorate and multiples collapse, then CEOs will wait to buy the same target later for a better price.”It is a shrewd tactic, but it does not always ensure the bidder will return. An example is Vinci’s abandonment of its £517m offer for TBI, the UK airport operator, in the wake of the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks.Vinci had a 14.9 per cent stake in TBI, but when markets stabilised it never returned with another bid because it had changed its outlook on the attractiveness of airport assets.Choosing to abandon a deal in the current economic climate can also be advantageous for the bidder.JCDecaux was rewarded by investors when it ended talks to acquire News Corp’s eastern European billboard business this week, because of difficult market conditions. Shares in the French outdoor advertising group shot up 14 per cent on the announcement.For News Corp, however, the loss of the sale means the loss of cash it needed to fund its expansion of pay-television interests in western Europe.General Motors also found itself without a source of much-needed cash last month after Navistar International, the world’s fourth-largest truckmaker, walked away from its planned acquisition of GM’s medium-duty truck unit.Conserving cash now may be a smart move for these companies as they reduce their cost bases while trying to protect shareholder value.The deals that have been abandoned so far have yet to trigger any heated arguments between buyers and sellers.This is in sharp contrast to the deals that were pulled in 2001 after the collapse of telecoms, media and technology stocks, when companies behaved more aggressively in testing the value and limitations of material adverse change clauses.These allow a buyer or seller to walk away from a deal in the event of a material adverse change in the business, operations or financial conditions of a company.Yet invoking such clauses is notoriously difficult, as Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the global media and advertising group, found out.Just days after the September 11 attacks, Sir Martin tried to terminate his acquisition of rival advertiser Tempus, claiming a material change had occurred that would affect the target.However, the Takeover Panel, the UK watchdog, ruled that WPP could not prove that such a momentous event would have a long-term effect on the industry."
4;RSG;Republic Services;2008-10-15T17:36:11Z;Dealing with the crunch;;The financial crisis has been like a wildly speeded-up version of natural selection. The weak have disappeared at an astonishingly fast rate and the strong are getting bigger and fatter. But not everyone can be a bulky predator like Philip Green or Santander.In the real world, the accelerating markets meltdown has led to a slowdown of corporate activity. Mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, asset sales and rights issues are being shelved, delayed or “reconsidered”. Volatility in the global capital markets provides the perfect excuse to scrap deals that have lost their economic rationale.But what about the good deals? They are being forced on to the slow lane too, starting with the mega ones. BHP Billiton’s $82bn proposed takeover of rival Rio Tinto, set to create a mining behemoth, is proceeding at a snail’s pace, as is Rio’s defence. Rio on Wednesday warned it may delay its plans to sell at least $10bn worth of assets to pay back debt, blaming the financial crisis. The same reason was given by Xstrata for throwing in the towel on its proposed £5bn ($8.7bn) acquisition of Lonmin.Belgian brewing giant InBev has postponed a $9.8bn rights issue meant to finance its $52bn takeover of Anheuser Busch. InBev says the acquisition, the biggest ever in the beer industry, is on track. Investors fear it may still be delayed. In the American telecoms market, there are doubts whether Verizon Wireless will be able to obtain funding for its $28bn acquisition of Alltel. A slide to 2009 is the best-case scenario.Altria, of Marlboro fame, is postponing its $10bn purchase of UST, the leading chewing tobacco manufacturer. The slowdown is affecting all sectors. Waste Management, the biggest rubbish collector in the US, has just binned its $6.7bn offer for rival Republic Services, saying “it would not be prudent”. Indeed. Caught between financial institutions in turmoil and slowing consumer demand, companies have very little room for manoeuvre.

Uncertainty that hung over the deal for days had weighed on the wider market even after both parties insisted it would go ahead. Morgan topped S&P 500 leaderboard, up 85.1 per cent to $17.92, while peer Goldman Sachs climbed 25 per cent to $111.The benchmark index surged 11.6 per cent to 1,003.32 points, ending an eight-session losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average leapt 11.1 per cent to 9,387.61 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 11.8 per cent to 1,844.25 points.Some observers said it was difficult to draw conclusions from the thinned trading and put much of the gains down to short covering. Bond markets were closed owing to the Columbus Day holiday.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 20.4 per cent on Monday, although at 55.65 it continued to indicate signs of severe distress.Among the winners in financials, Citigroup, which last week withdrew from talks to buy parts of Wachovia, rallied 11.6 per cent to $15.75. Wells Fargo also gained, up 7.4 per cent to $30.40, after the Federal Reserve approved its $12.2bn takeover of the embattled investment bank, which jumped 13.6 per cent to $5.85.Sovereign Bank fell 3.4 per cent to $3.68 ever after it emerged Banco Santander of Spain was in talks to acquire one of the nation’s few remaining independent thrifts.Insurers also recovered after being routed in previous sessions. Hartford Financial Services, XL Capital and Prudential Financial climbed 28.1 per cent to $24.63, 36.8 per cent to $7.43 and 38.3 per cent to $49.95, respectively.Fox-Pitt Kelton said XL, which slumped 63.8 per cent last week, might have to consider a “hasty sale”.The energy sector, which lost 22 per cent last week, recovered 18.5 per cent and led the gains on hopes the forthcoming economic slowdown would not be as bad as last week’s brutal sell-off implied.“This is not a Great Depression II,” wrote Merrill Lynch in a note to clients. “Bank failures, evaporation of disposable income, industrial production decl­ines and risk premiums for bonds were significantly worse then versus now.”General Motors, which last week sank to its lowest since 1950, recovered 33.1 per cent to $6.51 on reports that the carmaker had held merger talks with Ford Motor and Chrysler. The former jumped 20.1 per cent to $2.39, also helped by reports that the group was considering selling its controlling stake in Mazda, Japanese counterpart.Telecoms was another big winner, up 9.6 per cent. AT&T rallied 16.3 per cent to $26.07 after the group agreed its first retail distribution arrangements to sell its high-speed internet and video service. Wal-Mart and Circuit City, with which it struck the deals, added 7 per cent to $54.50 and 8.1 per cent to $0.40, respectively.Qwest Communications jumped 25.7 per cent to $2.74 after the phone company reached an agreement with its largest union over a pay dispute.King Pharmaceuticals was among the leading winners in the healthcare sector, which was also hit hard last week in spite of its defensive qualities yet recovered 12.4 per cent on Monday. King jumped 18.6 per cent to $9.26 after the group extended by more than a month the deadline for its $37-a-share takeover bid for Alpharma, which rose 10.4 per cent to $33.80.The cash-rich technology sector also did well, up 12.1 per cent. Apple rose 13.9 per cent to $110.26 after Sanford C. Bernstein raised its recommendation on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”.Elsewhere, Waste Management added 18 per cent to $30.39 after the trash hauler walked away from its $6.73bn hostile takeover of Republic Services, which rose 8.9 per cent to $24.50.
6;RSG;Republic Services;2008-10-13T19:40:12Z;Waste Management pulls Republic bid;;Waste Management, the largest waste removal company in the US, has pulled out of a $6.73bn hostile bid for Republic Services, the third largest, saying that credit market turmoil made it impossible to secure appropriate financing.The withdrawal of Waste Management’s takeover attempt, after it earlier had two offers rejected, opens the way for Republic to complete its merger with Allied Waste, the second-largest trash hauler.“As lending markets contracted and contracted …the pricing went up,” said David Steiner, chief executive of Waste Management.Waste Management first bid for Republic in July in an attempt to break up the agreement it had to take over Allied, which threatened to create a more formidable competitor.Republic rejected the offer saying it was risky, faced tough regulatory hurdles and responded with poison pill terms to deter the unwanted takeover. Republic also rejected a later sweetening of the bid. In recent weeks, the chances of a deal were hit further as pumping up leverage just as the US economy deteriorated looked increasingly risky.Mr Steiner said that banks would only agree “flexi terms” that would vary according to market interest rates, rather than one Waste Management could lock in until closing the deal.“We had the risk of not knowing what the specific terms of the debt would be,” he said. “We didn’t feel it was prudent to risk a great business model in such uncertain times.”But he admitted that: “We never got to the point of serious discussion where we could do due diligence.”Republic and Allied are continuing with their deal, an all-stock agreement that offers Allied shareholders 0.45 shares in Republic for each share in Allied they hold. “The hostile takeover proposal from Waste Management did not deter us or slow down [the merger with Allied] in any way,” Republic said.The combination will better be able to challenge Waste Management, whose annual revenues last year of about $13bn dwarves that of Republic, which made $3bn, and Allied, which brought in $6bn. Together the three control about 42 per cent of the market, according to S&P analysts.Its shareholders will vote on the deal on November 14. Allied said it expected the deal to close in mid-December.Waste Management said it has $500m cash and liquid investments and that its third-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates. Shares in Waste Management rose 13 per cent to $29.09, Allied was up 17 per cent at $9.95 and Republic rose 4 per cent to $23.31 by midday in New York.

Mark Mahaney, a Citigroup analyst, reiterated his “buy” call on the online retailer, pointing to stronger-than- expected sales of the Kindle, Amazon’s electronic book reader. “Turns out the Kindle is becoming the iPod of the book world,” Mr Mahaney said. Amazon rose 9.4 per cent to $88.09.Sentiment was positive throughout the retail sector as oil wallowed below $114 a barrel for much of the session. Gap, Dillard’s and Kohl’s climbed 8.8 per cent to $19.68, 6.9 per cent to $11.60 and 8.8 per cent to $51.01 respectively.The information technology, consumer staples and healthcare sectors also advanced, reinforcing their strong comeback as investors have moved away from energy stocks and into more defensive areas. Over the past six months the three sectors are the only ones to have made ground, adding 6.6 per cent, 4.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively.Brian Belski, US sector strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the sectors “offer US investors the most stable growth properties at current levels and going forward in terms of earnings and sales growth, margin expansion and cash flow”.On Monday, financials stocks were another standout, climbing 1.9 per cent as investors bought into heavily sold stocks and stalwarts alike. Washington Mutual added 3.5 per cent to $4.74, Wells Fargo climbed 4.8 per cent to $31.61 and American Express rose 3.6 per cent to $39.17.The benchmark S&P 500 gave up early gains of as much as 1.3 per cent but still closed 0.7 per cent ahead at 1,305.3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 11,781.78 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.1 per cent to 2,439.95.Those gains followed a strong showing last week, when the S&P 500 advanced 2.9 per cent, buoyed by some decent results, a sharp drop in the oil price and the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates on hold.Still, analysts believe the major indices could move higher. Claire Collingwood, a dealer at CMC Markets, said: “Oil prices continue to be the main driving force behind the markets . . . as commodity prices continue to weaken then we can expect this to lead to a degree of movement back into equity markets.”With earnings season winding down, S&P 500 companies have posted second-quarter profit declines of about 23 per cent on average. Excluding financials, average earnings grew about 4 per cent.The energy sector lost 0.4 per cent after oil prices hit their lowest level since May. But coal stocks retreated. Massey Energy fell 5 per cent to $56.07, Consol Energy lost 4.4 per cent to $60.19 and Peabody Energy slid 5.8 per cent to $55.19.Among materials groups, a dip in industrial and precious metal prices shaved 0.4 per cent off the sector, making it the second worst performer of the day.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 3.8 per cent to $82.30, US Steel fell 6.7 per cent to $128.46 and Titanium Metals gave up 3.5 per cent to $10.63.Some deal news had a mixed impact. Waste Management, the rubbish hauler, raised its bid for Republic Services, a rival, by about 10 per cent to $6.73bn. In July, Republic rejected a $6.2bn offer from Waste Management. Waste Management shares rose 0.3 per cent to $36.10 while Republic shares rose 0.6 per cent to $35.05.United Parcel Service was in focus after the UK’s Sunday Telegraph said the parcel delivery company had held talks to buy TNT for €10bn ($14.9bn). UPS dismissed the report, but it slid 0.3 per cent to $65.51.
9;RSG;Republic Services;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Waste management;;Will investors be given the right to refuse? In June, the second and third largest trash handlers in the US – Allied Waste and Republic Services – agreed to merge in an all-stock deal. Then the largest, Waste Management, waded in to try to upset the party. It approached Republic with a cash offer valuing the company at $7.8bn. That was rejected and Republic hastily adopted poison pill measures to prevent a predator building a stake. Waste Management returned on Monday with a new, but only modestly improved, cash proposal.Consolidation makes sense. Picking up the trash is based on logistics – similar to mail delivery – and works most efficiently when every customer is on the same network. The mooted point for either deal is to take out costs – at least $150m annually, it is claimed – by rationalising routes and making better use of landfill sites.Cutting the number of competitors would improve pricing power as well. Collecting trash is a local business, but Waste Management already controls just over a quarter of an industry that had revenues of $52bn last year, and owns about half of America’s landfill sites. So antitrust authorities would be alert to any whiff of anti-competitive potential. Indeed, Republic owns some assets that Waste Management was forced to sell in 1999 as part of an earlier deal.The larger company argues that regulators would approve, given some asset sales, but it is hard to avoid the suspicion that a tactical game is under `way. Waste Management raised its indicative offer price by just 9 per cent, to $37 per share, and the market remains unconvinced, with Republic shares trading at $35. Distracting competitors’ management and delaying any integration process makes sense. Meanwhile, forcing Republic’s board to open its books could provide valuable information on routing and pricing. The garbage men are fighting dirty.Post and read comments on this Lex
10;RSG;Republic Services;2008-08-11T18:13:27Z;Republic to consider rival’s improved offer;;Republic Services will retrench this week to weigh a sweetened takeover bid from top waste hauling industry rival Waste Management, after calling the initial offer an opportunistic attempt to disrupt its deal to buy the industry’s second-largest company, Allied Waste.The agreement with Allied bars Republic from holding talks over a different deal or providing another party with financial information unless its board of directors determines that a competing proposal is superior – or could potentially lead to a superior transaction.In mid-July, Republic’s board unanimously voted that it did not expect Waste Management’s first proposal to lead to a better outcome for shareholders than its deal to buy Allied.Republic said it was not for sale and that Waste Management’s $34-per-share cash bid included too much regulatory risk and undervalued the company.Waste Management’s decision to bump its bid to $37 a share, which values Republic’s equity at $6.73bn, appeared to underwhelm Republic’s shareholders, who pushed the company’s share price down by a fraction of a per cent on Monday to $34.75 by mid-day.Republic has cited concerns over the stance US antitrust regulators would take on a deal between it and Waste Management.Waste Management attempted to address some of those concerns in its new proposal by pledging to pay Republic $250m if regulators nix the deal, and to pay a rate of interest on top of its per-share bid if the transaction takes a lengthy period of time to close.Waste Management also said it was “clear that financing is available” for its proposal, but offered no details on terms and said it had not yet executed commitment letters with banks.Republic’s board will have to determine whether such assurances are worth the risks it could run, both to the Allied deal and its own business, by opening its books to a formidable rival.The company’s board will hold talks with its advisers this week over whether the new proposal could represent a better path for shareholders.
11;RSG;Republic Services;2008-08-03T17:05:57Z;US ruling on swaps bolsters defences;;US companies that fear unwanted takeovers are increasingly counting derivatives as beneficial share ownership when they install “poison pill” anti-takeover devices, a move that could become more common in the wake of a landmark legal ruling on the matter.A poison pill is triggered if any one shareholder buys up enough shares of a company to reach a certain threshold, usually set at 10 to 20 per cent.Ownership of derivatives backed by shares in the company, including “swaps” and other instruments, have generally not counted towards that total.However, a legal decision reached in June is changing that. A judge in the Southern District of New York said that two hedge funds had tried to evade the spirit of disclosure law by building up a stake in railway operator CSX through swaps, a type of derivative instrument.The judge did not rule outright that derivatives should be counted as beneficial share ownership but a few takeover-wary US companies have decided to define the issue as it applies to their own shareholders, and corporate attorneys expect that number to grow.Republic Services, a US waste hauler whose bid to buy a rival sparked a third-party bid for its own assets, became the third known US company to address the issue of derivatives as beneficial ownership when it adopted a shareholder rights plan last week.The plan will be triggered if a shareholder buys 10 per cent or more of Republic’s stock – including derivatives – flooding other shareholders’ wallets with new shares and diluting the stake of any unwanted acquirer.Semiconductor maker Micrel and building materials supplier Louisiana-Pacific had already enacted shareholder rights plans prior to the ruling that included derivatives in their tally of beneficial ownership.Other companies that are nervous about getting hit with an unsolicited bid are also dusting off their shareholder rights plans to add a derivatives clause, say corporate attorneys.
12;RSG;Republic Services;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Republic launch defence plan;;Republic Services, the third-largest US waste hauler, adopted a “poison pill” shareholder rights plan on Monday to ward off accumulations of its stock, in an effort to fight an unsolicited bid from rival waste hauler Waste Management and instead pursue its $6.24bn plan to buy Allied Waste.Republic’s move, which flew against a broader trend toward fewer corporate anti-takeover protections, suggested the company felt it should shore up its defences and establish clear procedures in case Waste Management or another party decided to buy up shares or take an alternate proposal directly to Republic’s shareholders.The shareholder rights plan will make it incredibly expensive for any shareholder to acquire more than 10 per cent of the company’s outstanding stock.Republic excluded Cascade Investment – a fund owned by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust – from the restriction by declaring that shareholders who already own 10 per cent or more of its stock will be bound to a 20 per cent limit.The investors who manage Cascade, which owns about 15 per cent of Republic’s outstanding shares, have said Waste Management’s $34 per share cash bid “significantly undervalues” Republic and presents significant regulatory and financing risk.Waste Management, in reply on Monday, said it would continue to focus on buying Republic and was “working diligently to prepare a response” to concerns raised by Republic’s board. The top US waste collector had said it would try to buy shares of Republic after its offer was rejected.Republic’s shares closed 2 per cent lower on Monday at $32.05. Shares of Waste Management also sank nearly 2 per cent, while shares of Allied Waste dropped 1.2 per cent.Republic also added stricter rules to its bylaws to address situations in which a shareholder may want to solicit other shareholders’ consent on particular proposals. The plan will not prohibit Republic from accepting an offer that the majority of its shareholders, other than the potential bidder, approved.
13;RSG;Republic Services;2008-07-21T20:01:58Z;Private equity woes disrupt M&A plans;;Corporate acquirers and their takeover targets are finding it harder to step down the aisle these days, as they are tailed by spurned rival suitors and disapproving shareholders.This is in part due to diminished competition from buy-out firms.Corporate buyers, suddenly seeing an opportunity in the private equity drought, have started to target industry rivals that they see as ideal complements to their businesses.However, instead of clearing the way for smooth takeovers, the absence of free-spending buy-out firms has raised the stakes between industry rivals, often provoking turf wars.Cleveland-Cliffs, a US iron ore miner, took a hit from its biggest shareholder last week, possibly throwing its proposed acquisition of coal miner Alpha Natural off track.Harbinger Capital, which owns 18.36 per cent of Cleveland-Cliffs’ shares, said the deal was not in shareholders’ best interests.Without Harbinger’s blessing, Cleveland could struggle to win the two-thirds shareholder vote it needs to close the transaction.Now, Alpha Natural and Cleveland-Cliffs, which had also been viewed as a takeover target, both lie exposed.Steel group ArcelorMittal, which sources say had bid for Alpha Natural, would have the capacity to swallow both companies if it wanted.“You have to be conscious in this environment about interloper risk, because other corporate buyers may also view it as a unique opportunity,” Michael Boublik, co-head of Americas mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, said.“We tell all our clients you’re not just putting the target into play, you’re also putting yourself into play,” he said.This is a situation waste hauler Republic Services, which recently agreed to buy rival Allied Waste, knows all too well. Since striking a deal for Allied, Republic has received – and rejected – a takeover approach from Waste Management, the industry-leading competitor it is trying to beat by acquiring Allied.And, as in affairs of the heart, some are putting faith in a pre-nuptial agreement. Cleveland-Cliffs and Alpha have each agreed to pay the other a $100m termination fee if their shareholders do not approve the deal.That could hit $350m if either company’s board withdraws its support for the deal, or if it is scrapped under certain circumstances and either party inks a deal with another company.
14;RSG;Republic Services;2008-07-14T20:57:34Z;Wall Street falls on fears over financials;;Stocks fell on Monday as US government measures to shore up confidence in mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failed to impress equity investors, and regional banks came under pressure.The government sponsored enterprises, which buy or finance almost half of the $12,000bn US mortgage market and have long been seen to have an implicit guarantee from the US government, have been a drag on equity markets.Speculation that they needed more capital but would be unable to raise it had sent their share prices tumbling and again raised the spectre of systemic financial collapse.Barclays Capital said: “While we believe that this removal of short-term systemic risk is likely to improve sentiment and support GSE credit and equity in the short term, in the longer term we believe that GSE capital requirements will likely increase as credit losses are likely to be sizeable.” Fannie Mae fell 5.1 per cent to $9.73 while Freddie Mac lost 8.3 per cent to $7.11.By the close, eight of the 10 leading industry groups were in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,228.29 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.4 per cent to 11,055.19 points and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.2 per cent to 2,212.87 points.US stock markets ended last week in bear market territory. The S&P 500 posted its sixth successive weekly decline as investors rushed to sell Fannie and Freddie on speculation that a government bail-out could wipe out shareholders while oil prices spiked above $147, pummelling consumer-facing stocks.With the former threat off the table, financial stocks were expected to rally strongly. But the reverse happened as regional banks came under heavy selling pressure after the collapse of IndyMac Bancorp last week.Analysts noted that while the GSEs were more or less explicitly backed by the government, smaller banks were not “too big to fail”.Goldman Sachs added Zions Bancorp to its “conviction sell” list and predicted that a number of other regional banks might cut their dividends.M&T Bank said its second-quarter profit fell 25 per cent due to credit losses related to residential real estate.Zions fell 23.2 per cent to $19.73, M&T Bank dropped 15.6 per cent to $58.82 while trading in National City shares was temporarily halted. The shares closed down 14.7 per cent to $3.43.Washington Mutual was the biggest faller, down 34.7 per cent to $3.23. The larger banks and brokerages came under fire. Citigroup fell 6 per cent to $15.22, JPMorgan lost 4.4 per cent to $31.69 and Bank of America dropped 7 per cent to $20.15.Lehman Brothers, the whipping boy in the current round of the credit crisis, came under renewed attack in spite of a cautiously positive report from Bernstein Research that argued that thanks to Fed support and deleveraging “the firm should be able to survive any confidence crisis ahead”.Investors were less sure and shares in Lehman Brothers fell 14.1 per cent to $12.40.The sector as a whole slumped 6.1 per cent while the KBW banking index fell to its lowest level since October 1996.There were some bright spots and outside the financials only the utilities sector was down more than 1 per cent. InBev said it would buy Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser beer, for $52bn. Anheuser-Busch shares rose 0.6 per cent to $66.87.Waste Management, the largest US waste disposal company, said it would bid $34 a share to buy Republic Services in a deal valued at $6.19bn. Waste Management lost 5.8 per cent to $34.49 while Republic jumped 13.8 per cent to $31.76. Positive earnings forecasts helped boost a handful of stocks. Allegheny Technologies surged 9.7 per cent to $55.21 after the specialty metals producer said second-quarter profit would be higher than previously forecast.Energy and consumer staples stocks were the only gainers, boosted by elevated oil prices and some analysts upgrades respectively.Schlumberger rose 2.7 per cent to $101.79 and National Oilwell Varco rose 5.4 per cent to $87.59. Dean Foods climbed 2.6 per cent to $18.45 while Molson Coors added 2.2 per cent to $55.42.
15;RSG;Republic Services;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Waste Management offers $6.2bn for Republic;;Waste Management, the largest waste disposal company in the US, on Monday made an unsolicited $6.19bn offer to take over Republic Services, the third largest.The all-cash bid is aimed at derailing Republic’s $6.07bn all-stock deal to buy Allied Waste, the second largest US garbage clearance company, agreed at the end of last month.“We certainly weren’t looking to make an unsolicited bid for Republic,” said David Steiner, chief executive of Waste Management. “But once they did a transaction with Allied . . . we decided that it was something we had to take a look at.”Waste Management’s $34-a-share offer comes at a 22 per cent premium to the closing market price for Republic on Friday. It controls about 25 per cent of the waste disposal business in the US, while Allied controls 11 per cent and Republic about 6 per cent, according to Stewart Scharf, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s.An acquisition of Republic by Waste Management would create a company with sales of $16.5bn last year, compared with $9.24bn for a Republic-Allied merger.The combined entity would own 327 landfill sites and about 28,000 garbage trucks, according to Mr Steiner.Any deal between Waste Management and Republic would require regulatory approval. Waste Management said it would be happy to dispose of some assets to ensure a deal would go through.Republic’s business, which is based in Florida, is focused on the sun belt. Allied has a stronger presence in Nevada.Waste Management said a deal would provide cost savings of $150m, most of which would be available in the first year after a deal closed. The company said it hoped to close the deal by early 2009 and that it would add to earnings within the first year.A Republic spokesman said it would “carefully review the proposal . . . consistent with our fiduciary responsibilities”. He would not comment on which deal the company favoured but said it had “previously agreed a definitive merger agreement” with Allied and that it was “already moving forward” with that. That deal carries a $200m break-up fee.Allied was not available to comment.Credit Suisse is Waste Management’s financial adviser.Shares in Waste Management fell 6.6 per cent to $34.19 by midday in New York. Shares in Republic rose 11.8 per cent to $31.20 and shares in Allied fell 3.8 per cent to $11.53.
16;RSG;Republic Services;2008-06-23T20:41:00Z;Oil groups defy flat mood on Wall Street;;"US stock markets fluttered around the unchanged mark on Monday as rising oil prices lifted energy companies but hurt consumer-facing stocks while more analyst
downgrades weighed on the financial sector.Oil rose about $2, helping all 39 members of the S&P 500 energy sector to advance.ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil added 3 per cent to $95.54 and 3.3 per cent to $87.70, respectively, and the sector gained 3.7 per cent as a whole.As the second-quarter earnings season gains momentum, analysts have high expectations of the energy sector, predicting earnings growth of about 23 per cent. That would represent the third consecutive quarter of at least 20 per cent growth for the sector.That strength has come at the expense of oil-dependent companies and has also hit consumer-facing stocks. Investors worry that rising fuel costs will cut into disposable incomes, limiting spending on non-essentials.On Monday, the consumer discretionary and staple sectors fell back as oil advanced, dropping 1.6 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively.Even some deal news from the agriculture and waste management sectors could do little to improve market sentiment.Bunge, the oilseed processor, agreed to buy Corn Products International for $4.4bn in stock. Bunge fell 9.4 per cent to $110.70, while Corn Products jumped 18.3 per cent to $50.75.Meanwhile, Republic Services said it would buy rival waste-removal company Allied Waste Industries for $6.1bn in stock, concluding nearly two years’ worth of discussions. Allied fell 2 per cent to $13.29. Republic slipped 0.7 per cent to $31.29The benchmark S&P 500 closed roughly flat at 1,318.01 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average held steady at 11,842.36. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.9 per cent to 2,385.28.Last week, US stock markets slumped to their worst levels since March on the back of weak housing and manufacturing data and a flurry of downgrades and announcements from the beaten down banking sector.Analysts at Thomson Reuters said: “There hasn’t been a back-to-back weekly advance in the DJIA since the May 2nd week and . . . investor confidence is under duress with market technicians making unabashed calls for a 9,400 Dow and 965 S&P.”While many would see those predictions as too pessimistic, the leading indices are likely to come under pressure as the second-quarter earnings season progresses. This week, 16 S&P 500 groups announce quarterly earnings.Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&P Equity Research, said: “You could say that we are in a period of range-bound optimism: optimism that the 1,270 [S&P 500 March] lows were the lows for this corrective action but range-bound until we get a better handle on earnings growth, energy prices and on what the Fed might be doing next.”With little in the way of economic data released on Monday, markets took their cues from the usual suspects – oil and financials.Carmakers were among the leading fallers in the consumer discretionary
sector. Fordlost 9.1 per cent to $5.28 while General Motors slipped 6.4 per cent to $12.91.In the consumer staples sector, Supervalu fell 4 per cent to $30.44. Walgreen the US drugstore chain, also lost ground, dropping 1.1 per cent to $34.70 after reporting a smaller-than-expected increase in third-quarter profit.Financials were the biggest drag on the S&P 500, however, dropping 2.7 per cent and setting new lows for the year.Lehman Brothers fell 5.8 per cent to $22.80, Bank of America dropped 4.5 per cent to $25.88, JPMorgan lost 2.6 per cent to $36.87 after a number of analysts cut their earnings forecasts and ratings for the industry. Goldman Sachs, for example, recommended selling financials, admitting that its May upgrade of the industry was “clearly wrong”.In other corporate news, US Steel rose 4.5 per cent to $191.02 after Goldman Sachs added the company to its “conviction buy” list.According to analysts at Barclays Capital, sentiment is likely to be muted prior to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which starts on Tuesday.The US central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold."
17;RSG;Republic Services;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Republic Services to buy Allied Waste;;Allied Waste and Republic Services, the second and third-largest US waste services companies, said on Monday that they had agreed to combine in a $6.1bn stock-for-stock transaction.Republic and Allied said the deal should save the combined companies $150m per year by reducing duplicate hauling facilities and headcount, consolidating back office functions and boosting efficiency, among other efforts.The deal will also allow Allied, which has been working to reduce its debt levels for several years, to capitalise on the benefits of Republic’s stronger balance sheet.Allied shareholders will receive 0.45 shares of Republic common stock for each Allied share. Republic will issue 198m shares of common stock to Allied shareholders, which will give them ownership of 52 per cent of the company.“Equity is the only way this transaction could come together,” said James O’Connor, Republic chairman and chief executive. “Burdening the company with any more debt was out of the question, and would not have been attractive to anyone.”Mr O’Connor will be chairman and CEO of the new company, which will be named Republic Services. He said that he and Allied chairman and chief executive John Zillmer had spent a good deal of time evaluating each other’s operations and the benefits that combining them might bring.Allied and Republic, together, would control more than 250 landfills, which should allow the companies to re-calibrate their trucks’ routes more efficiently.“Vertically integrating this business is critical – it’s the main barrier to entry,” Mr O’Connor said. “John and I have talked regularly over two years, and became serious here in the last four or five months.”The proposal, which would create a stronger competitor against top-ranked US hauler Waste Management, is likely to face a review by US antitrust regulators.The groups, which analysts said may be forced to divest operations to complete the deal, expected regulators to review and approve the deal within four to six months. Executives from both sides said it was too early to comment further on how the process might progress. Republic said it was committed to maintaining its investment-grade credit rating, and said it expected to continue to pay its annual dividend of $0.68.
18;RSG;Republic Services;2008-06-16T20:53:18Z;Wall St pares losses as oil retreats;;Wall Street stocks were mixed on Monday after a range bound day of trading, as oil prices retreated, helping to overturn early losses in consumer-facing stocks, while a rally in financials offset new data showing continued weakness in US manufacturing.Oil prices hit a record high close to $140 a barrel in early trading but as prices fell back a wave of relief buoyed the consumer discretionary sector. By the close, it had pared losses of as much as 1.1 per cent to end down 0.1 per cent.A gloomy morning session was compounded by the latest “Empire State” survey from the New York Federal Reserve, which showed that manufacturing activity in New York State contracted in June – the fourth time in five months. Still, a rally in financials and strong gains for technology stocks helped offset losses in the consumer staples, telecoms and industrial sectors.The S&P 500 closed about where it began at 1,360.13 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 12,269.65 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 per cent to 2,474.78.Last week the S&P 500 posted its first consecutive weekly declines since March, although a rally on Friday pared losses. Analysts pointed to fears that the Fed would raise interest rates, a $2.8bn loss at Lehman Brothers, and speculation banks faced more writedowns.Financials are likely to stay in the spotlight this week as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley release second-quarter results. Analysts predict that financial sector earnings will slump almost half compared with the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters.Luca Cazzulani, at UniCredit, said low expectations might backstop the sector and wider markets.“The market already expects negative news from Lehman and even some writeoffs from Goldman. All in all, it does not appear very likely that earning announcements will lead to a resurgence of risk aversion and flight to quality,” he said.Lehman gained 5.4 per cent to $27.20, after confirming its second-quarter results and significantly reducing its exposure to problem assets. Bank of America gained 1.8 per cent to $30.32, helping the broader sector gain 1.1 per cent.AIG was an exception, falling 0.5 per cent to $34.01 after replacing Martin Sullivan, chief executive, at the weekend. It has lost more than 50 per cent of its market value in the past year, after record losses and writedowns of more than $30bn.In the consumer discretionary sector, retailers Limited Brands and Amazon, were among the leading gainers, up 2 per cent to $19.04 and 3.2 per cent to $81.70. Moody’s analysts said the pair were among a handful of companies likely to benefit from increasing internet retail sales.Industrials came under selling pressure. GE lost 0.6 per cent to $28.97 after a JPMorgan analyst cut 2009 earnings estimates for the company, noting the challenging operating environment and suggesting it should sell off chunks of its businesses to restore investor confidence.Allied Waste and Republic Services also fell back after the waste management companies confirmed it was in discussions about a $6.59bn merger. The pair dropped 7.7 per cent to $13.84 and 7 per cent to $31.49 respectively.The consumer discretionary sector was a significant laggard, dropping 1.1 per cent. Hershey led the way. The shares gave up 6.4 per cent to $35.87 after Leroy Zimmerman, the chairman of the trust that is the biggest shareholder in the confectioner, said it did not plan to give up control.Gains for Teva Pharmaceutical and Research in Motion gave the Nasdaq a boost. Teva stock jumped 5.3 per cent to $44.74, after it reported positive results for a treatment for Parkinson’s disease.RIM gained 6.1 per cent to $141.02 after rival Nokia released two new smartphones, which analysts said were unlikely to challenge the dominance of its Blackberry handset.Technology stocks more generally made notable gains, led by companies such as Apple and Intel, which added 2.6 per cent to $176.84 and 0.9 per cent to $22.86 respectively.Verizon and AT&T fell 2.9 per cent to $36.24 and 1.4 per cent to $36.17 after UBS downgraded the stocks, citing weak economic fundamentals.
19;RSG;Republic Services;2006-06-08T16:02:21Z;Monaco diary: Lessons from Wayne’s world;;Monaco diary: Jonathan Guthrie reports from the Entrepreneur of the Year World SummitIn Monaco, it is possible for the owner of a $10m leisure craft to feel financially inadequate while tying up among the floating Krug palaces in the harbour. Not a bad venue, therefore, for an event that brings together heavyweight wealth creators from 32 countries, including Home Depot founder Arthur Blank, laptop tycoon Barry Lam and Stelios of EasyGroup.This is the Entrepreneur of the Year World Summit, organised by professional services firm Ernst & Young. Now in its sixth year, it combines an awards contest with a conference and claims to be the “Davos of enterprise”. But I have yet to spot Bono or that actress with lips resembling a startled sea anemone.However, this morning I did catch up with Wayne Huizenga, the extraordinary serial entrepreneur who was World Entrepreneur of the Year in 2005. Mr Huizenga is the only person in corporate history to have built up and floated six companies on the NYSE, three of which made it into the Fortune 500.Probably best known as the man behind the Blockbuster entertainment chain, Mr Huizenga said he had been “lucky”. This sounded a bit like false modesty. At one stage Blockbuster, which Viacom eventually bought for $8.5bn, was opening a store every 17 hours. Mr Huizenga later founded AutoNation, the car retailer now capitalised at $8bn, and Republic Services, a waste business worth around $9bn.The deal he professed himself most tickled by was the $55m purchase of the Florida Panthers, an ice hockey team which he later sold for $88m. No great shakes, you might think – except that he used shares in the Panthers to buy five hotels he later sold for $1.3bn, making a hefty profit.“We are never smarter than the competition, so if we want to grow twice as fast we have to work twice as hard,” said Mr Huizenga of his vehicle Huizenga Holdings, adding: “No-one ever drowned in their own sweat.” He also quoted two rules of business espoused by Jack Welch, formerly of General Electric: “Rule One: never lose money. Rule Two: do not forget rule one.”Mr Huizenga made his billions through service innovation in established industries. Blockbuster benefited from growth in VCR ownership, he told FT.com, “but there were already 25,000 video stores [in the US] when we started, so we built bigger, better stores with a bigger range of titles and did not rent out adult movies”. With AutoNation he released value trapped in the cosy relationships between privately owned car dealers and big manufacturers, sharing it with customers.Earlier Thursday morning, Erich Joachimstaler, chief executive of Vivaldi Partners, a branding consultancy, told delegates that “it’s OK to be disliked”. His point was that branding in crowded markets should be about differentiation. One of his illustrations was a Harley-Davidson ad showing a biker’s back emblazoned with the slogan “if you can read this the bitch fell off”. Um, yes. Crikey.Mr Joachimstaler quoted this comment from Harley: “What we sell is the ability of a 43-year-old accountant to ride through a small town in black leather and have people feel afraid of him.” According to the consultant, companies need “to explore brand as a personality or a belief system”. Mr Joachimstaler – an ex-pat German living in New York – cited efforts by Germany to shed some brand associations as “safe”, “confident”, “arrogant” and “cold close”. The target perceptions were “flexible”, “warm”, “tactful”, and “spontaneous”. Perhaps Germany is reserving “hilarious sense of humour” for Phase Two.Chris Patten, rather than the powerful air conditioning at the Grimaldi Forum building, sent a cold draft down the back of European delegates’ necks earlier in the day. The former UK government minister, diplomat and EU Commissioner gave a realistically chilly assessment of the state of the EU. Progress on the Lisbon Agenda, an ambitious plan to make it “the most dynamic economy in the world by 2010”, had been “patchy though not non-existent”, Lord Patten said.Improvements have been on the North West fringe, he said, in the UK, Ireland and Nordic countries, while progress has been poor in Germany, France and Italy. In France the international competitiveness of its businesses was at sharp odds with the country’s growing protectionism, Lord Patten said. French politicians appeared to believe they could “protect against global competition by [shielding the food group] Danone as they once attempted to shield themselves militarily with the Maginot Line.”There was little chance, Lord Patten suggested, of the EU closing its growth gap with the US, partly because while “Americans take risks, Europeans take holidays”. Annoyingly for politicians, EU citizens use little of that time to reproduce, thereby constraining labour supply and straining retirement systems. Lord Patten did not push the point, but the conclusion is that west Europeans have reason to feel grateful for those oft-resented Polish plumbers, Algerian fruit pickers and Indian IT specialists.Paul Ostling, chief operating officer of E&Y, pointed out that the EU is not the only economic power facing a demographic crisis. China will too, in time. A survey published on Thursday by E&Y shows that the unwillingness of Europeans to make babies has meanwhile failed to dent foreign direct investment. The lightly regulated, euro-free UK proved to be the most popular destination.
