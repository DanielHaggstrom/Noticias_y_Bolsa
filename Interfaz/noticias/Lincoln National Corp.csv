0;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2016-06-27T21:35:41Z;Brexit fears also batter US insurers with limited UK exposure;Investors worry interest rates will stay lower for longer;US insurers with limited exposure to the UK have been among the hardest hit stocks in the Brexit markets rout, as investors fret there is now no end in sight to the very low interest rates that are hurting their profits.Since Friday morning, MetLife, Prudential Financial and Lincoln National have all been hit harder than banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, even though the latter group’s UK businesses are expected to be heavily disrupted by Britain’s departure from the EU.Brokers and asset managers have also been caught in the two-day sell-off, which has knocked $160bn off the value of the biggest 92 US-listed financial companies.The UK referendum result has led many investors to believe that central bankers will respond to the uncertainty by extending the extraordinary period of loose monetary policy, including quantitative easing and ultra-low or even negative interest rates.The wave of cheap money has been making it harder for insurers to produce adequate returns on their multibillion dollar investment portfolios, which are dominated by bonds.Since Thursday, shares in MetLife, whose UK exposure is not material to its global business, have tumbled 17 per cent. By the close on Monday, its share price was within 4 per cent of the lows it touched during the markets meltdown in February.Prudential Financial, which makes about half of its profits in Japan, was off 13 per cent, while Lincoln National was down 20 per cent after a second consecutive day of heavy selling.John Heagarty, insurance analyst at Atlantic Equities, said the sell-off in the sector had been driven largely by concerns about lower-for-longer interest rates. “The likelihood now of a rate rise this year has plummeted.”Randy Binner at FBR Capital Markets said insurers might need to add to their reserves, hitting profits. “The risk of that has increased,” he said.“Everything will be fine from a policyholders perspective . . . [but] the companies have to set aside more money to pay claims.”Also hard hit have been electronic brokerages including Charles Schwab and E*Trade Financial, whose shares are down 19 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively.Such companies earn profits from lending to clients to make investments, and lower interest rates cut into the margin between lending and borrowing costs. Brokers also generate income on securities purchased with client cash balances.E*Trade has 60 per cent of its revenues tied to the interest margin, according to Christopher Harris, analyst at Wells Fargo. “We expect Brexit to keep the Fed on hold for a long while,” he wrote in a note to clients.More investors now believe that the US Federal Reserve will hold off on raising interest rates this year. Before last Thursday’s referendum, financial markets showed a greater than 50 per cent chance of a rate increase in 2016, but in early trading this week, the probability had fallen below 10 per cent.
1;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2012-03-29T20:59:43Z;US equities fall as jobless claims miss estimates;;Shares in Best Buy sank by as much as 10 per cent Thursday as the world’s largest consumer-electronics retailer led US equities lower on the back of disappointing labour market figures.Best Buy said falling sales would force it to close 50 big box stores this year and cut 400 jobs in order to save $800m over the next three years.The US electronics retailer reported like-for-like revenues up 3 per cent from a year ago to $16.6bn but came below market consensus of $17.2bn for the period.The company’s shares dropped 7 per cent to $24.77 and have lost nearly 15 per cent over the past year.Kate McShane, analyst at Citigroup, said of her “sell” rating and price target of $21 for shares: “We continue to see downside risk from current levels: likely further market share losses, continued [gross margin] pressure driven by a commoditising product channel [and] competitive pressures, and long-term concerns …on international prospects.”Overall, the S&P 500 finished down 0.2 per cent to 1,403.28, edging back above the 1,400 threshold after retreating from it earlier in the day as the main US market limps to the end of an otherwise strong first quarter.Fresh economic data released Thursday by the US Department of Labor suggested to investors that the labour market is not improving as fast as previously thought.New jobless claims for the week ending March 24 were 9,000 higher than analyst estimates of 350,000.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 13,145.82 while the Nasdaq Composite index was worst among the three major US indices. The tech-heavy index declined more than 0.3 per cent to 3,095.36.Volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, increased by as much as 10 per cent before finishing the day down marginally to 15.42.Natural and organic food companies were also among the day’s most active stocks.Supermarket group Whole Foods Markets was hit by a downgrade of its shares by Goldman Sachs, who said the company lacked upside, having gained 35 per cent in the year.Shares in the upmarket food retailer fell 3.5 per cent to $82.61 as analysts reduced their rating from “buy” to “hold”. “Whole Foods Markets is a secular winner with significant opportunity to grow its store base, expand margins and improve its return on capital,” said Stephen Grambling, analyst at Goldman Sachs.“However, with only 2.8 per cent upside to our upwardly revised price target, after increasing our estimates, we see better opportunities elsewhere in our coverage, prompting a ‘hold’ rating,” he added.Annie’s, a natural and organic foods company, climbed another 5.6 per cent to reach $37.92.Shares in the company, which opened to the public on Wednesday, have nearly doubled from its initial offering price of $19.Nike, the world’s biggest sporting goods maker by sales, gained 0.6 per cent to $107.85 as the company said it had sued rival Reebok for the use of quarterback Tim Tebow’s name on the back of New York Jets jerseys.Nike will launch its new uniforms for the National Football League under a new sponsorship deal.JetBlue, a US passenger airline, lost 4.2 per cent to $5 as the carrier tried to deal with the fallout from an emergency landing of one its aircraft on Tuesday after the captain of the plane was forcibly subdued.News Corp, the international media company, lost 1.5 per cent to $19.44 as the company run by Rupert Murdoch hit back at claims that a technology company it once controlled was used to facilitate piracy of private documents.The S&P 500 financial index was the biggest faller among the major sectors on the benchmark US index, which were all down on the day, and fell 1.1 per cent.Insurance companies were among the hardest hit financial stocks with Genworth Financial down 2.3 per cent to $8.45 and Lincoln National Corporation off 3.2 per cent to $25.75.Morgan Stanley fell by 2.5 per cent, the worst among the big banks, to $19.74. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America were all down over 2 per cent on the day.Homebuilders, which have outperformed US equities by nearly three times in the year to date, also declined on Thursday.PulteGroup was down 2.3 per cent to $9.26 and rival DR Horton dropped 3.3 per cent to $15.39.The S&P 500 homebuilders sub index, which is comprised of two companies and a third Lennar Corp, is still up 32.5 per cent since the start of 2012 while the main US index has risen just under 11 per cent in the same period.
2;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2012-02-05T22:26:32Z;Share prices signal optimism for US banks;;The S&P financials sector in the US has begun trading above the book value of its assets for the first time since July in a sign of a turn in investor sentiment towards banks.Historically, if bank shares have traded below one times their book value, they have attracted buying from value-hunting investors. If US financial shares trade above a book value of one, analysts say it means investors are valuing the sector at more than the sum of its stated assets.They say thist could boost confidence among banks and encourage them to lend more money to the wider economy.Catherine Seifert, director of financial institutional equity research at Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, said: “One aggregate metric can’t paint an exact picture [of the financial sector] and there are some disparate valuations within the group. But the improvement is noticeable.”The price to book value ratio of financials in the S&P 500, which includes insurance groups and big banks, hit 1.01 on Friday, according to Bloomberg data. The sector had ended 2011 at 0.88 – a discount of 12 percentage points. It dipped as low as 0.50 in early 2009, in the depths of the financial crisis.The rise in price to book value conceals a wide variation. Wells Fargo trades at a ratio of 1.21, after its shares rallied 5 per cent so far this year. Citigroup lingers at a ratio of 0.53 and Bank of America has slid to just 0.36. Their shares have risen 18 per cent and 37 per cent this year, respectively. For value investors, these discrepancies are ripe for exploitation.“It’s now a stock-picking atmosphere,” said G. Russell Croft, portfolio manager at Croft Funds, which has $900m in assets under management.Investors say the rise in financial stocks has been driven by the improving US economic outlook, as well as easing financial pressures in the eurozone.The sector – which accounts for more than 14 per cent of the S&P 500 – is up 30.6 per cent since hitting a cyclical low in October. All of the 81 stocks in the group rebounded from that low, with insurers doing particularly well. Genworth Financial and Lincoln National, for example, have both seen their market capitalisation increase by two-thirds since then.Bank stocks have benefited from the return of retail investors. Mutual and exchange-traded funds that invest in US financials saw inflows for eight consecutive weeks until the end of January – the longest run of inflows in 12 years, according to data from Lipper, which provides information on funds.“US banks are riding the wave of improving investor optimism and the fund inflows really are striking,” said Lipper’s Matthew Lemieux. “But I would caution that the last time we saw large, sustained, inflows to financial funds was in January 2011, which is a warning that optimism can evaporate quickly.”In fact, caution already abounds among crisis-scarred financial investors.“There’s still a lot of political and regulatory uncertainty looming, and given the European debt crisis is far from resolved,” said Oliver Pursche, fund manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services. He prefers to look at basic revenue growth as a better measure of how well banks may be coping with rapidly changing rules and financial environments.The strongest-performing bank stocks this year are those that have also seen market expectations of their future earnings fall the most, according to KBW equity strategists. That may indicate the degree to which value investors have been chasing certain financial stocks.“Many investors have resorted to book value as a basis for valuation,” KBW’s Frederick Cannon and Matthew Dinneen wrote in a note to clients. But, they warn, “declining earning estimate revisions can turn value stocks into value traps”.
3;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2012-01-26T22:10:35Z;Netflix climbs on global prospects;;Netflix surged 22.1 per cent to $115.84 as the video-streaming and DVD delivery business said it had added 600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter to reach 24.4m paying customers.Shares are now trading at their highest levels since late October, when investors deserted the company after price hikes led to 1m subscriber defections.Analysts were impressed by the company’s update on international operations after a recent launch in the UK. “One can buy Netflix at less than 20 times [earnings] for its domestic business and get a ‘free’ call option on its international segment,” Mark Mahaney told Citigroup clients as he reinstated his “buy” recommendation.Netflix shares are now up 68 per cent for the year, although part of that may be a result of short-sellers closing out positions as the share price has climbed – Netflix was the fifth most shorted stock in the S&P 500 as of January 13, according to the most recent data from Factset.“This stock has been highly volatile. Our calls have been highly volatile,” conceded Mr Mahaney.The S&P 500 started higher, up 0.6 per cent to 1,333.47, almost 15 points into bull market territory. But data on December new home sales, which came in below the November number and expectations, sparked a reversal. The benchmark index closed at 1,318.145, outside bull territory, with a loss of 0.6 per cent for the day.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 2.4 per cent to $7.80 on the home sales data, with DR Horton off 2.6 per cent to $14.12 and Lennar down 2.9 per cent to $22.13.Caterpillar provided some cheer for the sector, predicting real terms spending on US construction will increase in 2012 for the first time since 2004, but analysts warned against excessive optimism.“Sellers of new single-family homes face a similar challenge as one might have selling ice to Eskimos. The market is awash with plenty of existing homes and the supply is likely to increase as banks proceed with more foreclosures,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not have any homebuilders constituents, dropped just 0.2 per cent to 12,734.63, as Caterpillar shares climbed 2.1 per cent to $111.31 on the earthmover’s strong results.AT&T fell 2.5 per cent to $29.45, as the mobile phone network posted a fourth-quarter loss despite surging smartphone sales, as a hefty charge relating to its failed bid for T-Mobile weighed heavily.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 2,805.28, as poor results from SanDisk weighed on semiconductor stocks.SanDisk shares closed 11.4 per cent lower at $46.39, as the afterglow from Apple’s blockbuster results earlier in the week faded for smartphone suppliers. SanDisk said weak demand from mobile device manufacturers would hurt revenue in the first half of the year, and put a new production facility on hold.Electronic broker E Trade Financial slumped 14.6 per cent to $7.99, as it reported weak fourth-quarter results on low trading volumes.Keith Murray at Nomura retained his buy recommendation, arguing “several noisy items related to credit and expenses” contributed 10 cents a share of the miss.JC Penney shares surged 18.8 per cent to $40.72 as the company forecast strong 2012 earnings, and said it would stop relying on heavy discounting and promotions to attract customers.Time Warner climbed 7.8 per cent to $74.51 after the company used a strong earnings report to announce a $4bn share buy-back scheme and raise its dividend.Investor choices continued to be guided by the Federal Open Market Committee’s forecast of low interest rates until the end of 2014. As was the case on Wednesday, utility and material stocks were among the best performers in the S&P 500.Utilities, which are considered a carry-trade by some investors, because low interest rates reduce the cost of infrastructure investments, were up 0.5 per cent.Materials climbed 0.6 per cent, suggesting some investors are nervous of the inflationary impact of a prolonged low-interest rate environment: commodity prices tend to rise with inflation, offering some protection to materials stocks.Financials sold off led by insurers and regional banks, with lower long-term interest rates expected to put pressure on lending margins, and investment returns.Insurer Lincoln National fell 5.7 per cent to $20.69, while SunTrust Banks was off 5.2 per cent to $20.50.Greenhill & Co bucked the trend as shares surged 12.3 per cent to $49.36. The boutique investment firm posted better than expected revenue. It also followed the lead of large investment banks by cutting compensation – only 50 per cent of revenues were paid out in salaries, down from 73 per cent a year ago.“We are at a juncture where there is opportunity for advisory boutique firms like Greenhill to take away business from big companies,” Dick Bove of Rochdale Securities is reported to have said.
4;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2011-11-11T21:53:21Z;Apple under pressure on talk of cut to iPad output;Rare bad week for Apple weighs on Nasdaq;A rare bad week for Apple weighed on the Nasdaq Composite index, which ended the week in negative territory even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 recorded gains.Apple shares, which are by far the most heavily weighted in the Nasdaq, fell 3.9 per cent to $384.62 over the week as Ashok Kumar, a tech analyst at Rodman and Renshaw, said the company was scaling down iPad production because of moderating sales.Reports that Apple had reduced iPad orders to China-based suppliers first emerged in late September, but Mr Kumar’s note rekindled investor anxiety.“If moderate macro growth rates persist, tablet demand may fall further,” Mr Kumar said. “Consumers might opt for Ultrabooks, which combine notebook functionality and tablet portability, rather than buying yet another device.”But other analysts said the sell-off in Apple shares was overdone.“All of our store visits continue to suggest strong demand for iPads,” said William Power, a tech analyst at Robert W Baird.Apple’s problems meant the Nasdaq slipped 0.3 per cent over the week to 2,678.75.Europe’s debt crisis was once again to the fore throughout the week on Wall Street.Just as Greece’s political crisis appeared to be nearing resolution, the S&P 500 suffered its worst day in three months on Wednesday and US investors were left scrambling as the Italian government neared collapse.“We’ve got to respect the European overhang,” said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Federated Investors. “And scale back expectations for a rebound in US equities accordingly.”The S&P 500 did rally on Thursday and Friday as Italian bond yields eased, ending the week up 0.8 per cent, hanging on to positive territory for the year at 1,263.85.But despite the improving news from Europe, financials fell 0.5 per cent. Citigroup was off 3.3 per cent to $29.33 after a judge threatened to tear up the bank’s settlement with the SEC over allegations of mortgage mis-selling.Bank of America, whose Merril Lynch unit faces similar lawsuits, was down 4.3 per cent to $6.21.Insurers fared much better as concerns eased about losses on their European equity holdings.Lincoln National Corp was up 4.9 per cent for the week to $20.22.Even Genworth Financialrose 6 per cent on Friday to end the week at $6.95, after a ratings upgrade from Citigroup.Colin Devine, Citigroup’s insurance analyst, told clients that a planned partial initial public offering of Genworth’s Australian operations “could shore up GNW’s balance sheet while simultaneously improving financial flexibility”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4 per cent to 12,153.68, helped by a flurry of strong earnings releases and a 5.7 per cent gain for Merck after the drug manufacturer raised its dividend for the first time since 2004. Merck shares closed the week at $35.97.A deteriorating outlook for federal government spending knocked Computer Sciences, an IT outsourcing company, which relies on the public sector for most of its contracts. Its shares fell 18.3 per cent over the week to $26.48.But Cisco reported surprisingly robust demand from the government as it beat analyst estimates and its own guidance on earnings for the second quarter running. Its shares rose 5.5 per cent to $19.02.Signs of enduring strength from US consumers helped Walt Disney to a 30 per cent year-on-year increase in profit as spending on its cable services and at its US resorts surged.Disney was up 5.6 per cent for the week to $36.70.Viacom was the standout performer in the S&P 500, its widely traded class B shares rising 9 per cent to $44.90 after a strong quarterly earnings report.Box office revenues of $1.12bn from the latest Transformers blockbuster helped Viacom’s film unit post a 46 per cent increase in revenue compared with the same quarter in 2010.E-Trade Financial fell 14 per cent to $9.09 as the online broker’s board dashed takeover speculation by announcing that it would not bow to shareholder pressure to put the company up for sale.The stock had been trading at a premium on acquisition hopes.Delays to approval of the Keystone XL pipeline project hurt Quanta Services, the infrastructure contractor that had been trading at a premium after announcing it had been awarded a large contract for work on the pipeline.Its shares fell 12.6 per cent to $19.16. Andrew Whittmann at Robert W Baird downgraded the stock to a “hold” equivalent, from “buy”.“Without Keystone soaking up base-level industry capacity, we would expect Quanta’s pipeline business to head into 2012 with industry conditions not materially better than its difficult 2011,” he told clients.
5;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2011-10-31T14:40:24Z;US stocks down as financials suffer;Trading of MF Global shares suspended;Trading in shares of MF Global was suspended after the broker-dealer, which has been weighed down by exposure to European sovereign debt, filed for bankruptcy on Monday morning. Attempts to sell the company to Interactive Brokers failed over the weekend.MF Global’s market capitalisation had fallen by two-thirds last week, with the shares valued at $1.20 when trading was suspended.The S&P 500 index fell 2.5 per cent to 1,253.30, its second worst day of the month. European concerns returned to the fore as Italian bond yields approached euro-era highs. Monday’s losses left the benchmark US index up 10.7 per cent for October, still the best month since December 1991.Half of Monday’s losses came in the last hour as the Euro fell against the dollar.“It was a day of profit taking that accelerated at the end of the day,” said Ryan Detrick, chief investment strategist at Schaeffers. “That makes sense given the strength of last week’s rally. I’m not too worried as long as the market holds here.”Utilities and consumer staples held up best. Cyclical energy and material stocks suffered the worst, down 4.4 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively.Solar stocks were left particularly bruised after the UK government proposed a 55 per cent cut in its solar subsidy scheme.First Solar was off 7.8 per cent to $49.77 and MEMC Electronic Materials was off 9.8 per cent to $5.99.“The entire solar industry is subsidised and, when you look at any region, subsidies are under threat everywhere apart from China,” said Ben Pang, alternative energy analyst at Caris and Company.Oil driller Nabors Industries fell 3.8 per cent $18.33, although it had traded in positive territory most of the day, despite revealing it had paid $100m to chairman Eugene Isenberg after he relinquished his post as chief executive.The company, which is based in Bermuda, has faced shareholder rebellions in the past over compensation paid to the estates of deceased executives and executive pay.“It’s a huge payout and again Nabors shareholders are the losers,” said Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, a shareholder activist group, which holds Nabors stock. “It seems that Isenberg has absolutely no regard for appearances, even when corporate excess is under scrutiny.”Nabors did not comment on the payout.Financials, which had benefited most from improving sentiment towards Europe, were also sold off.Insurers were worst hit. Lincoln National was off 11 per cent to $19.05 and Genworth Financial fell 6.9 per cent to $6.38.Asset managers and investment banks also suffered. Money manager Janus Capital was off 9.1 per cent to $6.56, while Morgan Stanley dropped 8.6 per cent to $17.64 and Goldman Sachs was off 5.5 per cent to $109.55.Yahoo fell 5.6 per cent to $15.64 on reports the company may dispose of Asian assets, rather than be acquired as a single business.Humana was the stand-out performer in the S&P 500. The health insurer jumped 5.7 per cent to $84.89 after forecasting full-year earnings of between $8.35 and $8.40 a share, which would represent a 20 per cent jump on last year’s profit and is a big improvement on a previous estimate of $7.50 to $7.60 a share.Humana benefited from having a higher proportion of customers covered by Medicare – the government healthcare programme for senior citizens – and from low customer claims.The company predicted 2012 earnings per share will moderate to $7.40 to $7.60.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.3 per cent lower at 11,955.7 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.9 per cent to 2,684.41.But despite scepticism about the sustainability of last week’s rally, some strategists at big US banks advised clients to position for further gains.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, urged clients to hold more material stocks, arguing valuations remain “in the cheapest quintile versus history”, despite last week’s rally.Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou at JPMorgan Chase said the rally could gather further steam as hedge fund managers “increase their equity exposure given their poor performance this year, as they attempt to recover their losses”.Electronic broker Charles Schwab released a survey showing the majority of its clients still expect the S&P 500 to rise through to the end of the year.Diversified energy and commercial property holding company Loews was down 3.8 per cent to $39.70 despite reporting third-quarter profits of $162m, or 40 cents a share, compared with only $36m in the 2010 third quarter. Analysts had been expecting 54 cents a share.Healthcare real estate investment trust HCP Inc fell 0.9 per cent to $39.88 after funds from operations in the third quarter rose to 63 cents per share, up 16.7 per cent from the same quarter in 2010.
6;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2011-10-15T03:42:53Z;Wall St enjoys best week since July 09;;The S&P 500 enjoyed its best week since July 2009 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index moved into positive territory for the year, as the start of earnings season suggested US corporate revenue held up over the summer.Aluminium company Alcoa closed the week up 5.7 per cent to $10.26, despite reporting earnings per share of 15 cents, far lower than expected.“[Foreign exchange] translation adjustments accounted for a good portion of the miss,” Fraser Phillips, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets told clients.Late on Thursday Google reported quarterly profits that showed the company is growing at a pace not seen since before the financial crisis.Pro forma earnings per share – which exclude certain items but are used by analysts to assess the company’s performance – climbed to $9.72, much higher than the $8.76 average of analyst forecasts polled by Bloomberg.Results were driven by a near 30 per cent rise in “paid clicks”, the number of times its users clicked on adverts.Google jumped 5.9 per cent on Friday leaving it up 14.9 per cent for the week at $591.68, almost into positive territory for the year. That helped the tech sector of the S&P 500 to gains of 8 per cent for the week, bettered only by highly cyclical energy stocks.The broad S&P 500 was up 1.7 per cent for the day on Friday to 1,224.57. That left it up 6 per cent for the week, its best weekly performance since July 2009.“US corporate earnings continue to confound the market with their strength,” said Doug Cote, chief investment strategist at ING Investment Management, who also said Wall Street was “in for an explosive rally”.But previous rallies in the S&P 500 this summer have peaked around the 1,220 mark and others were more restrained. “Stagnation may be better than recession but it’s not all that great either,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, while Channing Smith, a fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors, said he was “selling into the rally”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.9 per cent for the week to 11,644.49 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 7.6 per cent to 2,667.85.JPMorgan reported quarterly earnings per share of $1.02, 10 cents higher than average analyst expectations. But the figures were flattered by a $1.9bn accounting adjustment, while investment banking income fell quarter on quarter. JPMorgan, up 3.9 per cent for the week to $31.89, lagged behind the S&P 500, while Goldman Sachs, the biggest US investment bank also lagged behind the broad index, up 4.4 per cent to $96.73. The big universal banks prospered. Citigroup was up 15.3 per cent for the week to $28.40, its best weekly performance in 18 months, while Bank of America rose 4.9 per cent to $6.19.However, insurers were the standout performers among financials, as fears eased about losses on their European assets. Lincoln National Corp was up 19.1 per cent for the week to $17.99, while Genworth Financial, which is particularly sensitive to European news because it sells a consumer debt insurance policy on the continent, was up 14.4 per cent to $5.87.Sprint Nextel ended a tumultuous week up more than 15 per cent.The market capitalisation of the third-largest US mobile network had fallen more than 30 per cent in two sessions by the close of trading on Monday, after the company told analysts it planned $10bn of capital expenditure, but did not lay out a plan to fund it.Yields on Sprint debt spiked above 11 per cent and Moody’s downgraded Sprint debt on Friday, fuelling analyst speculation the company would have to issue new equity, diluting existing shareholders. But the stock rallied, eventually closing up 15.8 per cent for the week at $2.79.“It is time to buy Sprint again,” Jonathan Chaplin at Credit Suisse told clients on Friday, arguing the company would be able to fund capital expenditure by issuing bonds.The Nasdaq was powered by strong performing semiconductor stocks. Micron Technology was up 15.2 per cent for the week to $5.70 and Jabil Circuit was up 7.9 per cent to $20.07, after Fairchild Semiconductor kicked off earnings season for the sector.Despite reporting a 7 per cent quarter on quarter decline in sales, and revising down guidance for the fourth quarter, Fairchild was set to end the week up 8.4 per cent to $13.09, after predicting a turnround in 2012.
7;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2011-10-13T20:56:32Z;JPMorgan pulls banks on Wall Street lower;;Bank stocks fell Thursday after JPMorgan kicked off the sector’s quarterly results season.Earnings per share of $1.02 were flat for the year but a full 10 cents higher than the average forecast of analysts polled by Bloomberg. But the figures were flattered by a $1.9bn debt valuation adjustment, which saw the company benchmark its own debt to a lower market valuation.“Excluding the various ‘one offs’, we think the numbers are about in line,” Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, wrote to clients. Mr Staite had forecast earnings per share to be as low as 77 cents.JPMorgan fell 4.8 per cent to $31.60, Bank of America was down 5.5 per cent to $6.22, and Citigroup was off 5.3 per cent to $27.64.JPMorgan’s investment banking division reported net income of $1.6bn, down from $2bn in the second quarter of 2011.But investment bank stocks did not suffer as much as the universal banks. Morgan Stanley was down 4.4 per cent to $15.14, while Goldman Sachs, fell 3 per cent to $96.15.JPMorgan set aside 15 cents a share for litigation costs in a sign that various mortgage-related cases pending against the big US banks may impact on the sector’s earnings.The bank only released $96m of loan loss reserves, down from $1.3bn in the second quarter, suggesting it is cautious about the outlook for credit quality.Safeway, the supermarket chain, was down 0.2 per cent to $17.93, reversing strong early gains, after quarterly earnings rose to 38 cents a share, from 33 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. Sales rose from $9.4bn to $10.06bn.The S&P 500 reversed early losses to close down just 0.3 per cent at 1,203.85. The financial sector of the benchmark index was down 2.4 per cent, significantly more than any other sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which briefly moved into positive territory for the year on Wednesday afternoon, fell 0.4 per cent to 11,478.13.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.6 per cent to 2,620.24, helped by a strong performance by semiconductor stocks.Fairchild Semiconductor, the first company in the sector to report results, was up 10.2 per cent to $13.49. That was a dramatic reversal after the stock fell 7 per cent in the first minutes of trading after reporting third quarter sales of $403.2m, a fall of 7 per cent from the previous quarter, while margins were also squeezed.“Investors always want to buy the last estimate cut,” said Bobby Burleson, semiconductor analyst at Canaccord Genuity, “and Fairchild is calling a bottom in demand.”The group reduced fourth-quarter revenue guidance by 11 per cent to between $350m and $370m, but forecast a turnround in 2012.That helped push Nvidia Corp up 5.8 per cent to $15.46, while SanDisk rose 3.3 per cent to $45.93 and Micron Technology was up 6.2 per cent to $5.52.But JPMorgan analysts suggested demand for D-Ram memory, a big product for many semiconductor firms, would continue to fall.“Given the PC industry’s shift from high-performance-oriented devices to adequate specification and low-cost products, we believe D-Ram content growth will decelerate further,” JJ Park told clients.A closely watched industry survey by Gartner found worldwide PC shipments rose only 3 per cent in the third quarter, 2 per cent less than Gartner had previously forecast.Akamai Technology, an internet service provider, was up 4.8 per cent to $24.49 on reports that Google might launch a bid for the company.Google, which was set to report results after the market closed, was up 1.9 per cent to $558.99.Yahoo was up 1 per cent to $15.93 on reported acquisition interest from the private equity arms of Blackstone and KKR.Insurers suffered as Citibank analyst Colin Devine said life assurers may be designated systemically important financial institutions, requiring them to hold more capital.Lincoln National Corporation fell 3.8 per cent to $16.70 and Genworth Financial fell 5.6 per cent to $5.56.Asset managers had another tough session, after Legg Mason revealed assets under management fell 5 per cent during September to $611.8bn as a result of investor redemptions and falling asset prices.Legg Mason was down 4.7 per cent to $25.62, and Blackstone Group fell 5.4 per cent to $13.55.Sprint Nextel was up 8.2 per cent to $2.78. Citigroup analysts said the third-largest US mobile network could “raise additional funds, even at the current implied yields for bonds”, which rose above 11 per cent on Friday. The company needs to fund $10bn of capital expenditure.Apple was up 1.6 per cent to $408.43, after Sprint and Verizon stopped taking pre-orders for the new iPhone because of strong demand.
8;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2011-10-12T03:19:03Z;Franklin leads fall in US money manager stocks;;US money manager stocks fell on Tuesday after Franklin Resources, parent of Franklin Templeton Investments, revealed an unexpected decline in fixed income assets under management during September.Overall assets under management at Franklin Resources fell from $716.4bn at the end of August to $659.9bn at the end of September – principally due to falling asset prices, with Barclays Capital estimating investor outflows from equity funds were only $2.4bn and outflows from fixed income funds less than $1bn.Equity withdrawals had been expected, but the fall in fixed income assets under management from $314.6bn to $297.7bn worried some analysts.“We had previously factored in a much lower growth rate in global fixed income [but] now we expect negative flows [in the last quarter of 2011],” Chris Spahr, an analyst at CLSA wrote to clients. Mr Spahr lowered 2012 and 2013 earnings estimates for Franklin Resources by 12 per cent “to reflect much lower average AUM than expected”.Franklin Resources fell 2.9 per cent to $96.85. Legg Mason fell 1.3 per cent to $26.80. BlackRock fell 1.4 per cent to $153.06 and Federated Investors fell 2.4 per cent to $17.72. But some analysts said Franklin Resources’ woes might not be mirrored at other firms.“Asset declines at Franklin were mainly down to the performance of the Templeton Global Bond Fund, mainly invested in international bonds, which have been hit by emerging market currency weakness,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “There’s really not much read-across to domestic fixed income funds,” he added.The broad S&P 500 eked out a 0.1 per cent rise to close at 1,195.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 11,416.3 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.7 per cent to 2,583.03.But after hours, Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, marked the start of the quarterly earnings season by missing forecasts for the first time in four quarters. Alcoa reported earnings per share of 14 cents excluding restructuring costs, compared with analyst expectations of 22 cents. The stock was down in after-hours trading.Insurers were among the biggest beneficiaries of another Europe-fuelled rally. Genworth Financial, which sells a consumer debt insurance product in Europe, was up 3.1 per cent to $5.62. Fears that Europe’s financial crisis could herald a spike in unemployment, and lead to pay-outs on the policy, have weighed on Genworth’s stock price.Lincoln National rose 1.9 per cent to $16.34, and MetLife was up 0.6 per cent to $30.58, as the insurance sector rallied on hopes that European equity assets may recover in value.Derivative exchanges sold off, with CME Group down 3.4 per cent to $257 and IntercontinentalExchange off 2.3 per cent to $123.10, though analysts struggled to explain the moves.The New York Stock Exchange was up 2.3 per cent to $26.46, tracking its potential merger partner, German exchange Deutsche Börse, which rose 1.4 per cent while German markets were open.Fashion group Nordstrom was down 2.8 per cent to $49.26, after a filing showed executives had sold shares last week.Video streaming service Netflix continued its downward momentum, falling 2.7 per cent to $108.66. On Monday the company reversed a previous decision to hive off its DVD delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster, but did not row back on a 60 per cent price rise for the joint DVD and streaming service.Fertiliser maker Mosaic Company rose 4.3 per cent to $55.77 after Credit Suisse increased its estimates for fertiliser prices, citing strong demand for grain.Reits fell, with Equity Residential down 3.1 per cent to $52.91 and AvalonBay Communities falling 2.2 per cent to $118.50.Store chain 99 Cents Only Stores rose 4.4 per cent to $21.39 after agreeing to a $1.6bn cash takeover by alternative asset manager Ares Management and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The deal values the group at $22 a share.Citigroup was up 5.1 per cent to $27.84, outperforming peers. Bank of America was up 1.4 per cent to $6.37 and Morgan Stanley was up 0.7 per cent to $15.39.Solar panel maker First Solar fell 6.5 per cent to $55.91 after a sharp fall in the spot price of polysilicon.Sprint rose 7.2 per cent to $2.38 after FBR Capital’s David Dixon made the stock his “top pick”, saying the group could meet its capital needs by issuing debt.
9;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2011-09-29T14:18:46Z;Wall St surges on German vote and GDP figures;;A flight to the safety of big name stocks seemed to be the only clear trend on a volatile day which saw strong divergence between the different US indices.The benchmark S&P 500 swung more than 3 per cent during the session, before closing 0.8 per cent up at 1,160.38. It was sandwiched by the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 1.3 per cent to 11153.91, and the smaller cap Nasdaq Composite index, which fell 0.4 per cent to 2,480.76.“Investors are heading to the safety of names offering quality and yield,” said Andrew Wilkinson, Chief Economic Strategist at Miller Tabak.“Risks appear to be rising as the month ends: Not something that was on the cards first thing this morning,”In the first minutes of trading the S&P had surged 2 per cent on news that the latest eurozone bailout packaged had passed a key vote in the German parliament, and an upward revision to second quarter growth data.Financials led the way, eventually closing up 2.8 per cent with life insurers faring particularly well.Genworth Financial closed up 7.8 per cent to $6.00 and Lincoln National Corporation up 5.6 per cent to $16.46.Investment bank Morgan Stanley jumped 6.6 per cent to $15.09 and rival Goldman Sachs was up 3.7 per cent to $99.87, although Deutsche Bank predicted Goldman would delcare a loss this quarter.Discover Financial Services, the Illinois-based credit card company, fell 1.2 per cent to $23.60 after revealing regulators plan to bring an enforcement case over its marketing of fee-based products.But it was a strange rally, with defensive utility stocks the second best performing sector in the S&P 500, ending the day up 1.5 per cent, and cyclical consumer discretionary and tech stocks down, 0.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.Advanced Micro, a semiconductor manufacturer, which supplies personal computer companies, fell 13.7 per cent to $5.31 after the California-based company reduced its forecast for quarterly revenue and gross margins.“We believe AMD had a tremendous opportunity to gain revenue share in notebooks this year,” Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote to clients. “However, a lack of component supply has been a major impediment to growth and will probably not be resolved in the near term.”Fellow semiconductor stock Micron Technology, which was set to declare results after the bell Thursday, was also down 4.1 per cent to $5.87.Consumer discretionary stocks were led down by internet stocks Amazon, off 3.2 per cent to $222.44 and Netflix, down 10.9 per cent to $113.19.James Cordwell, tech analyst at Atlantic Equities, said Netflix was suffering a “slow bleed” because of investor uncertainty over the company’s strategy, in the wake of a decision to separate the physical DVD delivery and streaming businesses.Several traders speculated that mutual funds were dumping small cap and less well known stocks ahead of the quarter end, when they will have to reveal holidings to clients.But others said the move to more liquid, highly traded stocks, made strategic sense.“It’s much more difficult to get out [of small caps] in a really bad market. It’s telling you the market is by no means assured that Europe has a handle on things.” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap.US-listed Chinese stocks had a rough day after the Securities and Exchange Commission said the Justice Department is looking into allegations of accounting fraud.Sina Corporation, the e-commerce and social networking site, fell 9.7 per cent to $73.23. Youku, the recently listed video-streaming website fell 18.3 per cent to $16.25.Edwards LifeSciences tumbled after the administrator of the government’s Medicare and Medicaid programmes dealt a blow to hopes of a rapid roll-out for its new cardiovascular device.The medical device manufacturer is banking on strong revenue from its transcatheter aortic-valve implant (TAVI) device, a treatment for aortic stenosis – a heart disorder – that does not involve an operation.On Thursday, the Centre for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) began the process for considering covering TAVI under the government’s health programmes.CMS approval would normally lead to private insurers following suit.But CMS suggested that trials be limited to patients deemed inoperable rather than include patients seeking an alternative to operations.“We think TAVI will deliver very good growth for Edwards in the long-term,” said Jason Mills, medical devices analyst at Cannacord Genuity. “But we think the consensus expectations on Wall Street have been too agressive on rollout in the first few years and that’s what’s suggested by CMS today.”Edwards shares fell 6.6 per cent to $70.87.Mosaic, the phosphate and potash producer, fell 5.2 per cent to $54.20 after reporting earnings of $1.17 a share for the quarter ended August 31.
11;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2011-09-15T21:36:13Z;S&P 500 tops 1,200;;The S&P 500 closed above 1,200 for the first time since September 1 as the rally stretched to four days.The benchmark closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,209.11, though bearish investors warned that it was unlikely to top 1,250 with fears about Eurozone debt still elevated.“There’s a limit to how far any rally can go without a resolution to the crisis in Europe,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Financials rose 2.6 per cent, with big bank stocks to the fore.Morgan Stanley was up 7.2 per cent to $16.59 after the company paid a regular dividend on news that Wall Street veteran John Mack will step down as Chairman. The bank also paid a regular dividend on its preferred stock.Goldman Sachs also rose 3.7 per cent to $107.97.Earlier, European banks stocks had soared after central banks committed to action to provide dollar liquidity.But Capital One Financial was down 0.2 per cent at $43.46 on fears that weak macroeconomic data had not filtered through to a reduction in spending by its credit card holders.New England bank People’s United Financial was flat at $12.43 as Goldman initiated coverage of north-eastern banks with a “sell” rating on the stock.Goldman said north-eastern banks were “as good as it gets” in the financial sector, given the low mortgage and default rate in the prosperous region, but worried that People’s United’s stock price implied optimistic capital deployment and value creation.Netflix fell 15.6 per cent to $176.20 after the online group cut its forecast for physical DVD subscribers, as a change in pricing structure took effect.The group projected that DVD-only subscribers would reach just 2.2m by the end of September, 25 per cent fewer than the forecast it made in July. It also lowered its forecast for streaming-only subscribers from 10m to 9.8m.The fall in projected customer growth pushed the stock beneath $200 for the first time since March.“Management have clearly underestimated the impact of the price hike for the combined service,” said James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities. But he said the stock price fall might be an overreaction, as “the vast majority of Netflix growth came from its streaming-only package”.Aircraft manufacturer Textron rose 4.1 per cent to $17.44 as investors continued to be impressed by the potential for earnings-per-share growth from a debt-juggling operation announced on Wednesday.Textron will issue debt to buy back outstanding convertible bonds. Credit Suisse calculations suggest the diluted share count will fall 12 per cent if Textron is able to retire all of the outstanding convertible bonds.That would raise earnings per share at the cost of a hit to earnings per share this year from higher interest payments on the newly issued debt.But Credit Suisse analyst Julian Mitchell said the group, which relies heavily on defence spending, was unlikely to deliver sales growth. “Our scenario work indicates that Textron has less than average upside in a low growth scenario, which investors seem to believe is the most probable, and higher than average downside in a bear scenario,” he told clients.The strong run in semiconductor shares, which has seen stocks such as Micron up as much as 15 per cent this week, ran out of pace just as JPMorgan urged investors to buy into the momentum.“Semis starting to – finally – break out. Time to gas up the minivan and climb on board,” JPMorgan analyst Christopher Danely wrote to clients, but the Philadelphia semiconductor index underperformed the S&P 500 on Thursday, and Micron dropped 2.2 per cent to $7.04.Life insurer Lincoln National Corporation, up 8.2 per cent at $19.78, rose more than any other stock in the S&P 500. But the stock is still underperforming peers, down 31 per cent in the quarter to date, compared with 23 per cent for the group, as its portfolio makes it sensitive to equity markets and low interest rates, according to Andrew Kligerman at UBS.Tenet Healthcare bounced 6.2 per cent to $4.77 but remains in the red for the week, after poor earnings results.Higher than expected inflation figures for August led to concerns the Fed might delay further easing. There were also signs weak macro data were working their way through to earnings expectations.
12;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2011-08-30T14:48:26Z;Retail shares buffeted in Irene’s aftermath;;The S&P 500 index closed at its highest level since August 4, despite poor consumer confidence data and a rough day for department stores.Retail stocks were volatile as analysts picked winners and losers from Hurricane Irene.Kohl’s was down 2.2 per cent to $46.63 and JC Penney shares were off 1.8 per cent at $26.97.“We believe the department stores were negatively impacted by the hurricane as consumers stocked up on consumables ahead of the storm, rather than focusing on back-to-school items,” Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, told clients.That also hurt Staples, the stationery retailer, which was down 1.7 per cent to $14.60.But Edward Kelly said drug stores probably experienced heavy traffic in preparation for Hurricane Irene. CVS Caremark was up 0.6 per cent 35.76, although shares in Walgreen and Rite Aid were both flat.Overall, consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 were up 0.4 per cent, outperforming consumer staples stocks by 0.2 per cent in what is normally a sign of heightened expectations for economic growth.But it was hard to discern that much confidence from retail movers, with defensive stock, discount store Family Dollar, the biggest retail riser, up 4.2 per cent at $51.06.Randal Konik, retail analyst at Jefferies, said he was cautious about calling a strong rally in retail.“But it is hard to recommend going short on many [retail] stocks, simply because expectations for the back end of the year have already been downgraded and a lot of bad news priced in.”Overall, the S&P 500 index was up 0.2 per cent at 1,212.89, its third consecutive day of gains rise, ending the day above 1,200 for the second day running.Although stocks have bounced back from lows, previous rallies this month have fallen back after 1,200, and traders were relieved that the latest rally had not shrivelled.“The next stop is whether there is a major breakdown at 1,250. I think there will be major resistance if we get there,” said Paul Zemsky, head of multi-asset strategies at ING.The rally was again based on light trading volumes. Aggregate volume in US markets on Monday was the second lowest this month. Only Monday’s aggregate level had been lower.Monster Worldwide, which operates the job-search site Monster.com, led gainers, jumping 21.5 per cent to $9.91, after SEC filings revealed three executives had exercised options to buy more than 85,000 shares shares between them.The shares were purchased at $8.17, one cent higher than Monday’s closing price. Monster shares had hit a 28-month low of $7.00 on Friday.PulteGroup, the homebuilder, was up 7.1 per cent at $4.95 after better-than-expected house price figures. The Case-Schiller home price index was down only 0.1 per cent month on month in June.Pulte’s share price – an indicator of confidence in the construction sector – had briefly topped $5 for the first time since August 5.Insurers fell as financial stocks in the S&P 500 dropped 0.8 per cent, one of only two sectors to fall on the day. Hartford was off 0.3 per cent to $19.26, a partial correction to a strong rally on Monday, when Hartford had gained 10 per cent on relief that insurance companies would not have to make big pay-outs after Hurricane Irene inflicted less damage than expected.Bank of America shares dropped 3.2 per cent to $8.12. But the stock remains strongly up on the week after the shares rose 8 per cent on Monday on news of the $8.3bn sale of a 5 per cent stake in China Construction Bank.On Tuesday, analysts weighed in positively on the deal. Baird estimated that, when combined with other recent disposals, the CCB sale would increase BofA’s Basel I tier one capital, an important tool regulators use to measure the financial strength of banks, by 50 basis points to 8.75 per cent.Regional bank First Horizon was down 4.1 per cent at $6.99.Alpha Natural Resources was down 2.6 per cent at $34.02. JPMorgan initiated coverage on the coal supplier, giving it a neutral rating. But the stock was also retreating from the $35 mark that it reached yesterday, a level at which the stock has faced resistance all month.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent at 2,576.11, despite shares in NuPathe falling 34.6 per cent to $2.65. At one point, NuPathe stock had lost more than half its value after the company failed to win regulatory approval for the first skin patch to treat migraines. The Food and Drug Administration asked for more information.The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was tracking up 0.2 per cent to 11,559.64, closely following the S&P 500.
13;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2010-12-08T22:11:39Z;Financials help Wall Street edge higher;Regional banks lead financial sector;Rising bank stocks helped US equity markets edge higher as rising bond yields heralded higher profitability for financials.The S&P 500 financials index added 1.8 per cent, the most among sector components, with Bank of America up 3.7 per cent to $12, Morgan Stanley gaining 3.2 per cent to $26.47 and Goldman Sachsrising 2.8 per cent to $166.14.The rises in regional banks were more pronounced with the sector jumping 3.4 per cent on hopes that lending will become more profitable as US Treasury yields rise.Zions Bancorp added 5.5 per cent to $22.45, Fifth Third Bancorp climbed 6.5 per cent to $13.93, and Regions Financial surged 5.3 per cent to $6.33.Shares in life insurers also advanced after Standard & Poor’s lifted the industry’s outlook from “negative” to “stable”, saying the companies may be able to avoid credit rating downgrades next year after stock and bond sales. Lincoln National Corp jumped 7.5 per cent to $27.24, Hartford Financial Services added 3.5 per cent to $25 and MetLife gained 3.9 per cent to $42.79. AIG sunk 3.9 per cent to $42.23 before trading was halted just before the closing bell.Investors feared dilution when the US Treasury said it plans to sell about one-fifth of the insurer. It was reported that the sale, which would take place in the first half of 2011, could total more than $10bn.The company also struck a deal to repay its Federal Reserve credit line as it seeks independence from the government.The wider market’s gains were limited by the rising dollar and climbing bond yields after Tuesday’s agreement to extend the Bush-era tax cuts.Investors tried to gauge what was the primary cause of the rising rates – expectations of stronger economic growth or the resurfacing worries about inflation and the government deficit.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,228.28, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,372.52 and the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.4 per cent at 2,609.16.The materials sector lost 0.9 per cent with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold down 1.8 per cent to $108.60 and Cliffs Natural Resourcesdropping 2 per cent to $71.18.Elsewhere, Fortune Brands – which owns brands ranging from golf balls to Jim Bean whisky – gained 1 per cent to $61.76 after it said it planned to split itself into three separate businesses.The conglomerate will be divided into companies specialising in golf, home products and alcoholic drinks.Details of the plan, which is the result of a four-year strategic review, are expected to be finalised in the next several months.3M edged up 0.6 per cent to $84.05 as analysts weighed up the outlook given by the company on its investor day. On Tuesday shares in the industrial conglomerate declined after it forecast sales volumes at existing businesses would rise more slowly in 2011 than this year.Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation from “buy” to “neutral” and JPMorgan reiterated its “underweight” rating for 3M.“This is not about management as the durable 3M franchise is intact and has been enhanced through investment since chief executive [George] Buckley came aboard,” analysts at JP Morgan said. “This is more about an ongoing high level of expectations from a bullish sell side that has maintained stubbornly high estimates. We need to see some capitulation here.”In technology, Texas Instruments added 1 per cent to $33.75 after the US chipmaker narrowed its fourth-quarter profit and sales forecasts. But the reductions brought the company’s forecasts in line with analyst estimates and it said a recent correction in demand for its chips would be short-lived.Netflix’s chief financial officer, Barry McCarthy, resigned and will be replaced by David Wells, an internal appointment. Shares in the mail order online film rental service, which have soared 234 per cent so far this year, sank 0.8 per cent to $188.23.In retail, Home Depot edged higher by 1.4 per cent to $34.03 even though the home improvement retailer increased its full-year profit forecasts.
14;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2010-07-08T22:04:22Z;Police arrest former Finmeccanica consultant;;Police in Rome on Thursday said they had detained Lorenzo Cola, a former consultant to Finmeccanica, the Italian defence conglomerate, suspected of involvement in money laundering.Mr Cola was detained as he was preparing to leave Rome for the United States.Italian media and legal sources said Mr Cola was detained as the result of a wider investigation into a group of politicians and businessmen suspected of tax evasion and money laundering involving broadband operators Fastweb and Telecom Italia’s Sparkle unit.The investigation led to over 50 arrest warrants issued in February. Fastweb and Sparkle deny wrongdoing and say they were also victims of the alleged €2bn scam.Among those arrested was Gennaro Mokbel, a right-wing politician and businessman. According to investigators, Mr Cola is believed to have been involved in the purchase by Mr Mokbel of a holding company, Lincoln Financial, which had a majority shareholding in Digint, a software company which had sold a 49 per cent stake and operational control to Finmeccanica.Francesco Guarguaglini, Finmeccanica chief executive, confirmed in a recent interview with Panorama magazine that Mr Cola had worked as a consultant for Finmeccanica and for accountants Ernst & Young. Neither company had an immediate comment following Mr Cola’s detention.Earlier this week police arrested two men suspected of smuggling money for Mr Mokbel.Police intercepts obtained by the media also reveal claims by Marco Toseroni, who was arrested in February, that he met in May 2008 with Giorgio Zappa, a senior Finmeccanica executive, to discuss possible arms sales to central Asia.

The soft-drinks maker also gained market share during the period, both in the carbonated and non-carbonated segments. The stock rose 2.6 per cent to $54.01.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, McDonald’s reported that sales had risen 2.6 per cent at restaurants open for more than a year. While revenues continued to decline in the US, sales rose in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Shares in McDonald’s the rose 1 per cent to $63.57.Caterpillar added to the market’s gains after Morgan Stanley boosted its rating on the world’s largest manufacturer of construction equipment to “overweight” from “underweight”. Analysts at the bank also upgraded the US industrial sector to “attractive” from “in-line”, citing stronger than expected order books. Caterpillar added 5.4 per cent to $53.53, while the S&P 500 industrials index rose 1.7 per cent.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, also benefited from an upgrade and was up 2 per cent at $75.72. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised their rating on the group to “buy” from “neutral”, saying it was well-positioned to gain market share in US corn seed.It emerged that India’s government rejected the country’s first genetically modified food after protests by farmers. Monsanto had supplied the gene for the test vegetable, and the government’s decision to halt production was considered a blow to the group’s prospects for growth in India.NYSE Euronext climbed 5.1 per cent to $23.65 after the transatlantic exchange operator posted a higher profit for the last quarter than analysts had been expecting. Cost-cutting had helped offset declining trading volumes and a diminishing share of the equities market.ADC Telecommunications also surprised the market by reporting a quarterly profit. Analysts had expected the telephone equipment maker to break even. Its shares surged 21.4 per cent to $6.53.Electronic Arts weighed on the market, tumbling 8.8 per cent to $15.96, after the video game publisher gave a disappointing forecast for next year. The group, which is the world’s second-largest player in the sector, blamed its lowered guidance on the lack of blockbuster titles, poor demand in Europe and the adverse impact of foreign exchange movements.Pulte Homes, the country’s largest housebuilder, posted a smaller loss for the last quarter thanks to tax benefits. Revenues rose 5 per cent in the period but the results were worse than expected. Shares in the Michigan group lost 0.5 per cent to $11.08.In the pharmaceutical sector, Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, reported encouraging results from trials of a bone-strengthening treatment. After early strength, the shares lost 0.4 per cent to $57.21.While financial stocks rebounded from the previous session’s lows, the sector still lagged behind the market.Lincoln National, one of the country’s largest life insurers, climbed 4.3 per cent to $24.50 after reporting a higher-than-expected profit for the last quarter.The group suffered from investment losses in the financial crisis but was given a $950m cash injection by the government and has also raised additional funds through a share offering.
16;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-10-16T14:23:34Z;Opportunities in risk;;If there is one message the insurance industry has been trying to hammer home in the past few months, it is this: insurers are not banks.The biggest single concern of the industry is being caught up in the drive to re-regulate the wider financial services industry. Its main defence is that insurers did not cause the financial crisis and – in most countries – did not require taxpayers’ support to survive it.Yet it is in such regulatory changes, and in the effects of the crisis on markets, pension schemes and public finances, that insurers are likely to find the seeds for potentially dramatic developments in their industry.Insurers face high costs and complexities in dealing with changing regulatory demands. Yet the same changes are also likely to bring opportunities for growth in the use of financial engineering that could help insurers recycle capital more quickly – boosting returns.A reassessment of the size and volatility of the liabilities borne by corporate pension schemes and the public purse could also stimulate demand for new or nascent markets, such as longevity swaps.A recent “blue sky” report from an industry group co-chaired by Alistair Darling, UK chancellor, highlighted the potential for private provision of more forms of welfare, such as the risk of unemployment.It was the US insurance industry that saw the worst fallout from the market meltdown. While AIG was the most high-profile, Hartford and Lincoln National also received government cash.However, it is in Europe that the industry faces the most immediate threat from stiffer regulation. A pre-existing process to overhaul capital requirements and create a common European standard is, according to insurers, being used to increase the industry’s financial requirements. The CEA, the European insurance federation, has complained that the latest version of the so-called Solvency II rules has abandoned the initial economic approach “in favour of crude ratcheting up of financial requirements”.Meanwhile, the UK industry has warned that it will be especially hard hit because of the effect on annuity businesses, which provide retirement income to pensioners. According to the Association of British Insurers, UK groups could be forced to double their greater than £50bn ($80bn) equity capital base if the rules are implemented in their current form.That said, the industry generally supports the idea of aligning capital requirements with risks. Regulators in Bermuda are expected to follow Europe and create a similar set of rules, while Asian regulators are watching closely.It is hoped that an explicit link between capital and risk will encourage greater use of risk management and risk transfer tools. Industry professionals also expect the new rules to be a catalyst for growth in capital market instruments such as catastrophe bonds, catastrophe and weather-related derivatives and longevity and mortality swaps.So-called “cat bonds” have been around for some time. While they have suffered in the wake of the financial crisis, this is mainly because of concerns over the financial strength of counterparties rather than the risks themselves.Torsten Jeworrek, chief executive of Munich Re’s reinsurance business, is one who believes that capital markets can diversify extreme risks better than the insurance or reinsurance industries. He told a seminar in Monte Carlo last month that securitisation and derivatives should in the longer term offer a cheaper price for such risks than traditional reinsurance.But the market with the greatest potential to grow rapidly, according to Swiss Re, among others, is the market for mortality and longevity swaps. This area has long been heralded as a potentially huge market, but has always suffered from the difficulty of matching the demands of buyers and sellers.Yet, Swiss Re says, interest in longevity swaps is growing as pricing comes down – partly because of more competition among investors – and as insurers and pension funds become more aware of the cost and volatility of their liabilities.Rothesay Life, part of Goldman Sachs, recently completed the biggest-ever such deal – a $3.1bn swap to take longevity risk from the pension fund of UK insurer RSA, which took the volume of deals done since February 2008 to about $9.5bn.JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and RBS, and less well-known reinsurers such as Pacific Life Re, Partner Re and Toa Re were the leading investors taking on the longevity risks in these deals. Deutsche Börse, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have also launched index products based on life expectancy that, it is hoped, will make it easier and more attractive for investors to trade such risks.If this markets gain enough liquidity, a new generation of bankers will almost certainly look to repackage groups of this kind of risk into sliced and diced structured products.Regulators would be well advised to keep a close eye on developments in this area in years to come.Paul J Davies is the FT’s insurance correspondent
17;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-07-02T21:54:31Z;Independent F&C free to seek targets;;"F&C Asset Management becomes a fully independent listed fund manager for the first time in its 140-year history as Friends Provident distributes its 52 per cent stake to shareholders.The distribution by the the insurer frees F&C, which launched the UK’s first investment trust in 1868, to join the select band of mid-sized listed groups – Schroders, Aberdeen and Henderson – vying to pick off the best of their rivals.F&C was seen as a target as Friends sought to offload its stake. But it has turned the tables on its would-be acquirers, such as Aberdeen and Henderson, to become a hunter itself.Alain Grisay, F&C chief executive, hopes to steal a march on rivals still digesting recent purchases and use F&C shares to buy up opportunities.Aberdeen is assimilating its recent purchase of Crédit Suisse’s traditional long-only business and Henderson is absorbing this year’s acquisition of New Star Asset Management.In contrast, F&C can move fast if it spots the right target, suggests Mr Grisay, and there may be plenty of them. He believes that more than 15 European banks no longer regard asset management as a core business and want to raise what cash they can to boost weakened capital ratios following the financial crisis.Insurers are doing the same, say other chief executives, because the rationale for buying asset managers – a stable earnings stream and opportunities for cross selling – has not delivered.Revenues based on funds under management have been hit hard by falling markets and costs have proved inflexible. Gerhard Fusening, head of asset management for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region at Crédit Suisse, which has just sold SFr75bn (£42.2bn) of funds to Aberdeen, says in the first quarter when markets were at a low, cost-to-income ratios exceeded 100 per cent in some parts of the industry.Worse, clients, backed by regulators, are demanding access to products from several managers rather than being confined to taking inhouse funds from one.The result is a long-term shift towards independent fund managers. The latest manifestation is BlackRock’s purchase of Barclays Global Investors to create the world’s biggest asset manager. But about half the assets managed by the world’s 50 largest asset managers are held by independent managers, up from about 30 per cent a decade ago.Mid-sized independent fund managers also feel the need to bulk up. Mr Fusening says: “Mid-size groups need to consolidate.” Any group with less than £200bn will struggle to maintain the infrastructure to manage funds and sell them across several borders, he says. Much less than £50bn “and the costs kill you”.Malik Karim, head of Fenchurch Advisory Partners, says two things are driving mergers and acquisitions: “The first major strategic issue is how financial conglomerates redefine their relationships with asset managers as a result of capital pressures, government ownership or structural repositioning.“Second, tough operating conditions are forcing transformational and bolt-on M&A as participants strive to protect margins, acquire new capabilities or sell underperforming units.”F&C, with £93bn under management, has set its sights on building distribution in Europe; Aberdeen, which manages about £140bn, is high on the list of would-be buyers of Delaware, the US money manager owned by Lincoln Financial with about $120bn under management. Henderson, with about £45bn in funds, is also hungry for more deals.The gap between what sellers want and what buyers will pay remains wide. As Mr Grisay says: “There are [relatively] few buyers and even fewer sellers at the right price.”Acquirers are aware that merger synergies can be outweighed by staff defections, falling performance and client withdrawals."
18;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-06-17T20:48:21Z;Wall Street afternoon rally peters out;;"US equities fluctuated on Wednesday as bullish healthcare stocks balanced a flagging financial sector, which fell as the government released details of proposed new regulations.The Obama plan would mean tighter regulation of derivatives and stricter controls on capital reserves. This was part of the reason for the decision by S&P to downgrade 22 banks.The rating agency said: “We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions.”This sent bank shares sharply lower. And although the market took some reassurance from the president’s speech, banking shares remained lower.Wells Fargo, which was cut by one notch to AA-, lost 5.4 per cent to $23.09, while Fifth Third, which S&P cut by two notches to BBB, dropped 5.2 per cent to $6.81.“The effect of the regulation is a little bit worrying,” said Stephen Auth of Federated Investors. “But even though it could reduce returns, it may be helpful in damping risk also.”The effect of those falls was outweighed by a strong performance from drug makers. Pfizer gained 3 per cent to $14.58, while Merck rose 1.4 per cent
to $24.77.The sector had been sparked into life by news that Watson Pharmaceuticals was to buy the privately owned Arrow, which makes generic drugs. The deal will cost Watson $1.75bn in cash and shares, and its stock gained 5 per cent to $30.27.Although shares rallied in the afternoon as investors took confidence from positive words about the outlook for the US AAA credit rating from S&P, they fell back again shortly before the close.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 0.1 per cent down at 910.71 and 8,497.18 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.7 per cent to 1,808.06 however.Equities had spent the early part of the morning in negative territory after results from FedEx gave rise to concerns about the health of corporate spending.The second-largest US package delivery company, whose results often indicate the health of the wider business community, beat analysts’ forecasts with its quarterly earnings.But FedEx’s shares fell 1.4 per cent to $50.70 as it said first-quarter earnings could be less than half analysts’ estimates.Consumer stocks rallied strongly during the afternoon, however, with Abercrombie & Fitch a stand-out performer after the clothing retailer said it would close its struggling Ruehl chain. The shares rose 4.5 per cent to $26.97.The strength in the sector came as figures showed inflation is not a near-term concern, with consumer prices rising less than analysts forecast.This followed Monday’s producer price numbers, which revealed a much more moderate rise than some had feared.Wall Street also took solace from results from Adobe, the software company, whose revenues and profits dropped sharply compared with a year ago but remained ahead of analysts’ estimates. The shares gained 1.8 per cent to $28.68.Lincoln National avoided the worst of the sell-off in the financial sector after it said it had completed a $600m capital raising, having sold 40m shares at $15 each. The stock closed 1.1 down at $14.90.E-Trade, the struggling online broker, dropped 11.5 per cent to $1.46 after the company said it would look to raise $1.2bn in fresh capital to boost its balance sheet by selling new equity and launching a debt exchange.Commodity stocks continued their falls of the previous few sessions as metal prices fell further from last week’s peaks. Alcoa, which produces aluminium, lost 3.8 per cent to $10.49, while Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 3.7 per cent to $50.48.Steelmakers also continued their recent falls as metal prices dropped. Nucor dipped 1 per cent to $46.38.Steel Dynamics managed to hold steady however after it received temporary waivers for two financial requirements on $1.5bn of bank loans. The shares were flat at $15.26."
19;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-06-17T14:34:48Z;Wall Street hit by business spending fears;;Wall Street stocks slipped on Wednesday morning as news from FedEx suggested business spending was not improving.The second-largest US package delivery company, whose results often indicate the health of the wider business community, managed to beat analysts’ forecasts with its quarterly earnings. But its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $50.35 as the company said first-quarter earnings could be less than half of analysts’ estimates.Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan Private Bank said that results from Best Buy and FedEx demonstrate that earnings are not the problem. ”Revenues are falling and companies still need to cuts costs, which push other company’s revenues lower. There is no consumer spending power in this economy and equities face a considerable period of consolidation.”This knocked futures and the markets opened in negative territory. After half an hour of trade the benchmark S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index were both down 0.3 per cent at 909.21 and 1,791.94 respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a fraction to 8,501.72.Wall Street was took some solace in results from Adobe, the software company, whose revenues and profits both dropped sharply compared to a year ago, but remained ahead of analysts’ estimates. The shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.80.Concerns over business spending were exacerbated by worries over the consumer sector after consumer confidence was shown to have dipped last week. There were further negative signs on individuals’ financial health from figures showing mortgage applications fell 15.8 per cent last week compared with the previous week as mortgage rates rose.There were encouraging signs, however, that inflation is still not a near-term concern after the consumer price index was shown to have risen by 0.1 per cent in May compared with April, which was less than analysts’ predictions. This followed Monday’s producer price numbers, which showed a much more moderate rise than some had thought.All this came on a day when the government was set to unveil an overhaul of financial regulation, which would give the Federal Reserve much more power to monitor financial companies that pose systemic risk.The increased regulation was one of the factors in the decision by S&P to cut its credit rating on 22 banks, saying, “We believe the banking industry is undergoing a structural transformation that may include radical changes with permanent repercussions.” This sent banking shares tumbling. Wells Fargo, which was cut by one notch to AA-, lost 3.9 per cent to $23.45, while Fifth Third, which S&P cut by two notches to BBB, dropped 8.4 per cent to $6.58.Lincoln National was one of the few financial companies to find gains after it said it had completed a $600m capital raising, having sold 40m shares at $15 each. The stock was up 0.3 per cent at $15.10 by mid-morning.E*Trade, the struggling online broker, dropped 13.9 per cent to $1.42, however, after the company said it would look to raise $1.2bn in new capital to boost its balance sheet by selling new equity and launching a debt exchange.Commodity stocks continued their falls of the previous few sessions as the price of materials fell further from last week’s peaks. Alcoa, which produces aluminium, lost 4.2 per cent to $10.44 while Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, gave up 4.1 per cent to $50.25.Steelmakers also continued their recent falls as metal prices dropped, and Nucor lost 3 per cent to $45.45. Even Steel Dynamics fell in spite of received temporary waivers for two financial requirements on $1.5bn of bank loans in exchange for higher interest rates. The shares gave up 3.7 per cent to $14.70.There was further consolidation in the healthcare sector as Watson Pharmaceuticals said it would buy the privately owned Arrow Group, which makes generic drugs. The deal will cost Watson $1.75bn in cash and shares, and its stock gained 5.2 per cent to $30.33.European stocks were lower early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was down 2 per cent at 845.60. Asian equity markets closed mainly lower, with the FTSE Asia Pacific index 0.1 per cent lower at 193.66.Bond yields were generally lower and the yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 4 basis points to 1.143 per cent. That on the 10-year Treasury note fell 3bp to 3.63 per cent.The dollar was stronger against major currencies early in New York, gaining 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.63.Gold was trading $0.37 lower at $931.42 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York.

20;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-06-15T21:29:09Z;Lincoln reduces its bail-out needs;;Lincoln Financial will draw less than half of the US bail-out money it has approval for after selling a UK life assurance business for more than $300m to Canada’s Sun Life and announcing plans to raise $1.4bn in stock and bond sales.Lincoln expects to draw $950m from the troubled asset relief programme, much less than the $2.5bn in capital injections it was offered.The company is only the second US life assurer to take bail-out cash. The Hartford Financial Group said on Friday it would take its full $3.4bn allowance.Six big US life assurance groups with banking subsidiaries gained approval to receive billions of dollars in US government bail-out funds in May, after concerns grew about the financial stability of the sector.However, four of these groups turned down the funds after raising capital through other routes – Principal Financial, Prudential Financial, Allstate and Ameriprise Financial.The US life industry has been hard hit by a combination of tumbling stock and bond markets, which have hurt the value of investments, and the high cost of making good on guarantees promised to individual policyholders in variable annuity products.These are long-term savings products where the consumer is able to reap some of the benefit from rising investment values, but is protected against steep declines.Lincoln said on Monday that it intended to pay $1bn of the proceeds of its capital-raising exercise into its principal insurance unit, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, and keep the remaining $1bn for general corporate purposes, including repaying short-term debt.“These actions supplement dividend reductions, cost cuts, and other actions previously taken to strengthen the company’s capital,” Lincoln said.The company will issue $600m of new shares in a public underwritten offering and up to $500m of senior debt.The sale of its Lincoln National UK life insurance operations to Sun Life Financial of Canada has already secured about $320m in its capital raising efforts.Both the Sun Life and Lincoln National operations in the UK are in effect closed books of life assurance business, which means they sell few new policies.However, such businesses can still generate strong cash flows, which has attracted some colourful entrepreneurs to the sector in the UK to buy up such businesses.Sun Life said the deal would increase its UK assets under management by about 60 per cent to £10.6bn ($17.2bn) and add between C$0.08 and C$0.10 to earnings next year.“The combined operation is expected to generate attractive returns and serve to position Sun Life for future growth in one of the world’s largest life insurance markets,” said Donald Stewart, Sun Life chief executive.
21;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-06-15T20:28:46Z;Commodity and consumer groups suffer steep falls on Wall Street;;US stocks dropped sharply on Monday as commodity prices weakened and investors worried about the pace of economic recovery.Commodity stocks surged during the first four sessions of last week, as the price of oil rose and the dollar dropped amid rising fears of inflation.However, they fell back on Friday and continued to give up those gains on Monday. ConocoPhillips lost 2.9 per cent to $43.10 while Schlumberger dropped 2.8 per cent to $58.59.Steelmakers, which were some of last week’s biggest beneficiaries, also dropped sharply. AK Steel gave up 8.1 per cent to $18.32 while US Steel declined 5.7 per cent to $37.10.Commodity producers were hampered by a strengthening dollar, which was boosted when the Russian finance minister said there was “no alternative” to the dollar as a reserve currency.Data showing that manufacturing in the New York area was falling much more than expected during June and that sentiment among homebuilders had dipped exacerbated the falls.These factors added to cautious words over the weekend from Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, who warned that discussions about “exit strategies” from stimulus plans might be premature.Mr Strauss-Kahn said: “We haven’t exited the crisis yet.”Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: “Things are so weak we would expect them to continue to improve for quite a few months, but in some cases the improvement is petering out already, which is quite disappointing.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2.4 per cent down at 923.72 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 per cent to 8,612.13 points and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.3 per cent to 1,816.38 points.The Vix index, a measure of implied volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge spiked nearly 10 per cent back over the 30 level. Consumer stocks also suffered. Wal-Mart fell 2.8 per cent to $48.46, hurt by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which said sales growth at the retailer would begin to fall.Although Goldman said investors could move into more discretionary stocks as the recovery continues, others warned that the consumer sector would continue to suffer.“People are starting to realise that even when the economy recovers, certain sectors such as consumer spending are going to remain under pressure,” said Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital. “This is a realisation stage for the markets.”There were negative signs on the amount of loan losses that financial companies still face. Capital One, the credit card lender, said the number of card defaults had risen in May compared with April. Its shares lost 2.3 per cent to $23.40.Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities, warned that Bank of America was experiencing “horrific” loan losses. BofA shares fell 2.8 per cent to $13.33. Also in the sector, shares in Lincoln National dropped after the company became the second large insurer, after Hartford Financial, to say it would take government bail-out money and raise further capital by issuing shares.The company said it would sell up to $900m of new stock, and its shares dropped 10.8 per cent to $15.83 on fears of dilution.Housebuilders were some of the day’s biggest fallers after the homebuilder confidence figures. Centex sank 3 per cent to $8.23 while KB Home, which also suffered a downgrade by Goldman Sachs, dropped 6 per cent to $13.24. There was further bad news for the airline industry after executives at European aircraft maker Airbus warned that output at its European factories could fall by as much as a quarter over the next two years.Shares in Airbus’s US rival Boeing fell 3.7 per cent to $49.52 but shares in other major airlines were worse affected, as research suggested business class flights on Delta Air Lines and American Airlines had halved in price.Delta lost 4.7 per cent to $6.10, while AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, gave up 2.6 per cent to $4.43.
22;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-06-11T21:29:21Z;Bankers keep close eye on BGI;;"Across the world, M&A advisers are keeping their fingers crossed that the prospect of BlackRock’s acquiring Barclays Global Investors – billed as the second-biggest asset management deal ever – will open the floodgates to similar moves.It is a big change from two or three years ago, when bank boards were proclaiming how diversifying into asset management would provide the ballast to offset the volatility of investment banking earnings.But the landscape has altered in two key ways. Banks have found the attractions of asset management arms less than they expected, and have in turn largely proved indifferent owners.Meanwhile, regulators are highlighting the need for strong capital ratios, driving most banks to look at how selling their asset management arms might boost their capital cushions. The ties are loosening.Owning fund management arms was supposed to bring banks steady earnings streams. Instead, the experience has been that these revenues themselves have been volatile.Stock market falls have fuelled fund outflows, and triggered falls in fees based on assets under management and revenues. Add in the trend to levy performance fees, and the mix can vary very widely. Analysts’ rule of thumb is that a 1 per cent move in equity prices equates to at least a 1 per cent move in managers’ earnings.As the former head of one bank-owned asset manager says: “What were supposed to be annuity businesses turned into beta businesses.”The investment arms of UBS, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley reported first-quarter pre-tax losses this year and continuing net outflows from their funds.A second issue is that the scope for cost-cutting has not been what the banks had hoped.The economic downturn has given executives a freer hand to reduce costs than they have had before, but most banks admit that they have “over-estimated the cost synergies”, says one US-based consultant.Nor does active management bring economies of scale. In contrast to passively managed low-cost index-tracking businesses that become more profitable as assets rise, size for many fund managers is an obstacle to efficiency, say analysts, causing performance to tail off as funds get bigger.Even when markets were strong, bank-owned asset managers were overshadowed by other divisions. In 2008 BGI’s pre-tax profits of £595m on revenues of £1.8bn were equivalent to less than half the pre-tax profits of £1.3bn from Barclays Capital, the bank’s investment banking operations. In 2007 and 2006, BGI’s profits were the equivalent of about a third of BarCap’s profits. “Asset management is not core business for these banks,” says a consultant.And it shows. Investment consultants such as Mercer worry that fund managers do not benefit enough from being part of a financial conglomerate. The culture is different, they say: banks are focused on asset gathering, earnings growth and cross-selling products rather than on clients and fund performance. Meanwhile, the pressures on banks and fund managers to separate sales, distribution and advice from the management of funds are mounting. Cross-selling products between bank divisions, even BGI’s, are subject to strict arms-length agreements. Regulators and increasingly savvy clients are pushing banks to widen the range of products they offer to include externally managed funds.As the banks’ enthusiasm for owning fund managers has dwindled, the attractions of selling these businesses have become more apparent. In Europe, a plethora of Spanish and Italian banks such as UniCredit have put a for sale sign over their asset management arms.Analysts say banks have cut their prices, partly to reflect worries about businesses dependent on complex in-house contracts.Yet because the list of potential buyers is several times shorter than the list of sellers, transactions remain rare.Aberdeen Asset Management, which bought the traditional long-only fund management business of Credit Suisse in December, is one of just a handful of buyers confident of achieving the economies of scale that have eluded others. BlackRock, the world’s ninth-largest asset manager with about $1,000bn under management after it successfully integrated Merrill Lynch’s fund management business in 2006, is another.But other would-be buyers, such as Schroders, are haunted by past – failed – efforts at asset management integration, where cost-cutting destabilised staff, hurt performance and undermined client confidence.Index-tracker businesses, whose success does not rely on human skills to outperform indices, are relatively resilient, and can produce economies of scale. Here the difficulty for prospective buyers is the sheer size of those that might be attractive. In short, there are few financial services companies like BlackRock with a history of successful acquisitions and deep enough pockets to buy one of BGI’s rivals – however much M&A bankers might wish it.………………………………
Aberdeen chief saw deal with Credit Suisse as a downturn opportunityA year ago Santander, the Spanish bank, offered part of its asset management business with €130bn in funds under management, to Martin Gilbert, Aberdeen Asset Management’s chief executive.Mr Gilbert eschewed the offer and instead picked off Credit Suisse’s lossmaking traditional long-only fund management business for about £250m in shares. The deal has since been described as a blueprint for BlackRock’s mooted acquisition of Barclays Global Investors.Aberdeen merged Credit Suisse’s £50bn of assets with its own £90bn in funds, and also got the ability to distribute its products through Credit Suisse’s private banking clients.In return, Credit Suisse gained a 25 per cent stake and a seat on Aberdeen’s board.While the Swiss bank paid some of the cost of redundancies, it also gets a share of future profits as markets recover without the hassle of running an asset management business with all the associated headaches and costs.Meanwhile, both Credit Suisse and Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan’s largest financial group, own minority stakes in Aberdeen.The company also has a distribution agreement with Mitsubishi.Mr Gilbert, known by his peers as something of a deal junkie, says that the current downturn is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pick up businesses on the cheap and make a group big enough to survive whatever markets throw at it.He is one of the possible buyers of the Delaware money management unit owned by Lincoln Financial in the US, which has about $120bn under management."
23;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Lack of cash delays industry consolidation;;"The financial crisis was expected to spur a wave of consolidation in the asset management sector, but only a trickle of deals has emerged since the economic meltdown.The lack of mergers and acquisitions is very simple, says Dan Dolan, director of wealth management strategies at Select Sector SPDRs Trust: “Plenty of firms are looking to sell, but very few out there have the capital to acquire.”Lincoln Financial is selling its Delaware money management unit, with bids expected at $350m-$450m (£281m, €323m). Last week, the auction was in the second round with interest from bidders such as Aberdeen Asset Management, Advent International, Schroders and Hellman & Friedman, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.Bank of America is also selling its Columbia Management unit, which is reportedly attracting interest from BlackRock. American International Group, meanwhile, is auctioning off its investment business and Franklin Resources and Crestview Partners are reported to be bidding.Still, there have been fewer deals in 2009. According to Dealogic, this year has seen 40 transactions involving US asset managers,
valued at $4.76bn as of May 22. This compares with 53 deals valued at $3.2bn for the same period in 2008. Barclay’s sale of iShares, valued at $4.4bn, is the largest transaction this year.One factor keeping the number of transactions down is a lack of strategic buyers. Most strategic buyers are facing capital constraints that are keeping them out of the M&A hunt. One exception is BlackRock, the nation’s largest publicly traded asset manager, with $1,300bn in assets. Private equity shops still maintain a strong presence in transactions, but many are holding off on deals until the market environment improves, private equity executives say.“Private equity firms have dry powder while many other traditional buyers don’t,” says Rose DiMartino, a partner with Willkie Farr & Gallagher.There is a significant amount of private equity money sitting on the sidelines waiting for market conditions to stabilise, says Holden Spaht, a principal at Thoma Bravo, a private equity firm. Blackstone, for example, raised a mammoth $21.7bn fund in August 2007 – just before the credit markets slammed shut – of which it has $5bn left to invest.Private equity firms are attracted to asset managers because of their high returns on capital, secular long-term growth trends and recurring revenues. “Traditional strategic buyers of money management firms, such as banks and insurance companies, are capital constrained,” says Mr Spaht.Both Mr Dolan and Mr Spaht point to the iShares auction as an example of a deal dominated by private equity. In April, Barclays inked a deal to sell the world’s largest ETF provider to CVC Partners, a UK private equity firm, for $4.4bn. Hellman & Friedman, the Carlyle Group and Apax Partners were also bidding for the unit. To aid cash-strapped buyers, Barclays offered during the auction to provide favourable financing and is lending CVC 81 per cent of the amount it would receive.The agreement with CVC allows Barclays to search for a higher bid until June 18. BlackRock is expected to submit a proposal to buy Barclays Global Investors, which would include iShares and make the CVC agreement moot. Such a deal could be valued at more than $10bn.The rebounding stock market has dealt another blow to prospective deals. Some banks and insurers have seen their share price climb and are no longer interested in “dumping any assets,” says one private equity
executive.Mike Kelly, a partner with Willkie Farr & Gallagher who specialises in reorganisations and restructurings, says some sellers are retaining stakes in the businesses, so they can profit in the future.He points to Credit Suisse’s sale of its UK asset management division and the management buy-out at Neuberger Berman. Earlier this year, Aberdeen Asset Management bought all Credit Suisse’s traditional fund business. While no cash exchanged hands, the Swiss bank received a 24.9 per cent stake in a holding company that owns Aberdeen’s asset management business. With Neuberger Berman, management bought a majority stake in the business in December 2008, but Lehman Brothers Holdings, which is now bankrupt, owns a minority.Mr Kelly says the motto has become: “Sell now if you absolutely have to, but try and get a piece of the upside when the market rebounds”.A “disconnect” still exists between buyers and sellers, several experts say. Sellers are still seeking traditional valuations. A high quality asset manager would typically sell for 10 to 12 times cash flow. With leverage still expensive, company earnings lower and capital structures less efficient, buyers are looking for deals at mid-to-high single digits in terms of cash flow multiples. “Sellers have to get comfortable selling at lower multiples on lower earnings,” according to one private equity practitioner. Another sign of stress in the M&A market can be seen in changes to the debt-to-equity ratios. In the high-flying days of 2006, private equity typically put in roughly one-fourth equity per transaction. That has risen to about 50 per cent, private equity sources say.Stock sales may also be dampening the number of distressed sales. Many companies are opting to sell stock, via a secondary offering, to pay off funds they received through the US government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program. Still, most believe the environment for asset management M&A is improving. Discussions are more positive, bankers say, but the go-go days of earlier this decade are likely to remain only a memory.Luisa Beltran is a reporter with Ignites, a Financial Times publication."
24;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-05-16T01:43:12Z;Life assurers to receive bail-out cash;;Life assurance groups with banking subsidiaries will receive billions of dollars in US government bail-out funds, officials confirmed on Friday, a move experts hope will damp concerns about the financial stability of this sector.Six companies have been approved for capital injections: Hartford Financial Services, Prudential, Allstate, Ameriprise, Lincoln National and Principal Financial, although Ameriprise turned down the money on Friday. Officials said the insurance groups could receive much of the $22bn (£15bn) remaining in the capital purchase programme, part of the wider $700bn troubled asset relief programme, but cautioned that not all the money would necessarily go to them.“This has the potential to be a meaningful, material contribution to capital for certain companies,” said Kevin Ahern, an analyst at Standard and Poor’s, the credit rating agency.The companies eligible for bail-out funds all own or have recently acquired banks. They applied for capital months ago and received approval through the normal process for bank recapitalisation. Nonetheless, the capital injections, which can be used to support their insurance operations as well, come as policymakers are paying increasing attention to risks emanating from the life assurance sector, as well as property and casualty insurers and pension funds.Officials have no specific or immediate cause for concern. But while they think they have a very good handle on risks within the banking system following the stress test of the top 19 US banks, they are less confident that they have identified all the dangers within the insurance and pension industries.Insurance groups are regulated state-by-state by 51 regulators, meaning that federal authorities do not have as good a line of sight into their operations as they do with the biggest banks.Moreover, they operate under actuarial principles that allow them to smooth their operating performance and do not need to mark all their assets to their current market values – practices that make them less vulnerable in the short term to market disruptions but also mean that problems may take longer to come to the surface.Opinions differ on how opaque these groups are. Matt Carroll, a second analyst at S&P, said there was “pretty good visibility in real time on both the asset side and liabilities side”.Nonetheless, a number of policymakers believe that if there is a further relapse in the financial system, it is more likely to be caused by problems at the insurers than at the banks.Many life assurance groups issued a lot of annuities that offered clients the better of a fixed return or a rise in the stock market. Analysts suspect that some of these were imperfectly hedged. Meanwhile, life assurance groups – and other insurers, as well as pension funds – face losses on their portfolios of commercial mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate whole loans and corporate bonds.In a report published in February, S&P said the economic downturn would put “unprecedented stress” on these portfolios. Since then, analysts have become even more concerned about commercial real estate loans in particular.Lower credit ratings and counterparty concerns in turn have raised the cost of financing for life insurers and made it harder for them to raise capital if needed to shore up their finances.The rally in the stock market since its March lows has provided a strong boost to life assurance companies, other insurers and pension funds. But concerns about asset quality remain.Life assurers are historically very stable, with predictable outgoings and a strong cash flow from the sale of new business. However, in theory at least, they could be vulnerable in extremis either to a funding crisis or to a fear-induced rush to cash out policies with surrender values early.Life assurers do not have access to Federal Reserve liquidity, though their banking subsidiaries do.With defined-benefit pension funds, meanwhile, the main danger is that large accumulated losses could create a need for large top-up payments from the sponsoring companies. That would put a drag on profits, in effect forcing an increase in corporate saving that is likely to come at the expense of some investment, sapping growth. Losses on defined contribution plans fall directly on households.In depth: US banks

They failed to recover fully during the rest of the week as moderate gains on Thursday were followed by another dip on Friday.Further worries about consumer activity came on Friday after two leading clothing retailers announced worse results than expected.JC Penney reported profit marginally below consensus estimates and lowered its full-year estimates, saying it expected consumer spending to remain weak. The shares lost 0.4 per cent to $26.54.Designer brand name Abercrombie & Fitch lost ground after posting a steeper than expected first quarter loss. Its shares fell 4.2 per cent to $26.10.Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, bucked the trend, beating analysts’ estimates in spite of falling sales. It raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up 7.8 per cent to $22.58.Analysts warned that sales figures gave a more accurate picture of consumer behaviour than surveys on confidence.The economic outlook saw equities markets fall on Friday, on a day of raised volatility, as many investors moved to cover their positions on options, which were about to expire.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.1 per cent to 882.88 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 8,268.64 points.The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed, finding relative strength in technology stocks, which fell during the early part of the week. The index dropped 0.5 per cent to 1,680.14 points, taking it to its first weekly loss in 10. The three main market measures fell between 3.3-5 per cent in the week.Energy stocks were some of the heaviest fallers on the day as the price of oil fell
3 per cent. Chevron lost 2 per cent to $65.88 and ExxonMobil gave up 0.9 per cent to $69.11.Industrial and materials stocks outperformed after figures showed that manufacturing output in New York state is falling at a slower rate than expected.Financial stocks were weak on worries over the economic outlook. This weakness affected insurers even after several companies were approved for bail-out funds from the government’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).After early gains, insurers fell during the broader sell-off. Hartford, which has approval for $3.4bn, fell 1 per cent to $14.60, while Lincoln National which may take $2.5bn, lost 0.7 per cent to $16.12.Technology companies have proved stable this year, and have outperformed every other sector.That changed during the week as investors banked profits and shares fell, but the sector held up amid the wider sell-off on Friday, losing 0.1 per cent to 262.15 points."
26;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-05-06T20:30:27Z;US stocks jump ahead of stress tests;;"US banking stocks jumped on Wednesday amid a flurry of reports about how well companies had fared in the government’s stress tests on banks’ balance sheets, the results of which are due on Thursday.Reports said that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, American Express and Bank of New York Mellon would all pass the tests without needing to strengthen their balance sheets. That sent KBW index of banks up 10.8 per cent.Bloomberg reported that Citigroup needed $5bn, half the level reported on Monday. Its shares leapt 16.6 per cent to $3.86.Meanwhile, the New York Times said the government had asked Bank of Americato raise nearly $34bn, more than triple the figure previously reported.But the bank overcame this to find gains after Citigroup said it was unlikely to need to issue new shares. Its stock jumped 17.1 per cent to $12.69, taking its weekly gains above 45 per cent.Wells Fargo, which Bloomberg said would need $15bn, rose 15.6 per cent to $26.84.Regions Financial provided a microcosm of the volatility in the market, slumping 11 per cent in eight minutes after the Wall Street Journal said it also needed new capital. But its shares then surged, and closed
6.2 per cent up at $5.83.“The fact that Timothy Geithner [the Treasury secretary] waited three months after announcing the stress tests to give us more details worked out well. They have been able to come up with some solutions so banks are not going to have to go out and issue new shares,” said Andrew Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers.But Robert Loest, fund manager at Integrity Mutual, said: “Investors are deluded. The stress tests were done by the banks themselves, and any rational person would be suspicious of that.”The reports helped extend early gains which came after labour market data from ADP said that companies laid off nearly 25 per cent fewer workers in April than expected.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Lincoln National, the life insurer, soared after its quarterly results. The company made a loss after writing off some of the value of its annuity business, but investors focused on unexpectedly strong operating profits, sending its shares up 33 per cent to $15.57.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 1.7 per cent higher at 919.53 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to 8,512.28 points.But the Nasdaq Composite index, which has outperformed the other two this year, gained only 0.3 per cent to 1,759.10 points as some investors looked to bank profits.Energy companies were behind financial stocks as the day’s biggest gainers as the price of oil rose to new highs for the year. Chevron gained 3.6 per cent to $68.11.The better-than-expected data from ADP matched a report from outplacement group Challenger that also suggested the rise in unemployment was slowing.It also added to confidence the economy might be slowing its contraction after figures showed mortgage applications rose last week.But Pulte Homes and Centex, the rival homebuilders that are due to merge, announced heavier losses than expected amid rising unemployment and foreclosures. Pulte lost 8.1 per cent to $11.31, while Centex slid 8 per cent to $10.78.The homebuilding sector took another knock after a report from Zillow.com said nearly a quarter of US homeowners owe more than their properties are worth.There was some good news for consumer stocks however as Disney reported a narrower fall in earnings than expected. The company’s profits dropped as it had to offer discounts to attract visitors to its US theme parks, but the fall was not as bad as analysts had predicted, and its shares rose 11.8 per cent to $25.87.Dow Chemical also fell after it announced it was offering $1.63bn in common stock to pay back debt owed following its acquisition of rival Rohm & Haas. It slid 7 per cent to $15.19.General Motors was one of the day’s heaviest fallers ahead of its earnings report on Thursday. The company is expected to make an eighth straight quarterly loss, and is reportedly facing opposition to its restructuring plans from the United Auto Workers union. Its shares tumbled 10.3 per cent per cent to $1.66."
27;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-04-21T20:39:42Z;Financials rise as Geithner calms bank fears;;US stocks rebounded on Tuesday as Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, allayed fears over the health of the banking industry.Mr Geithner told a congressional panel that “the vast majority” of banks had more capital than needed, which encouraged buyers to enter the market after Monday’s bruising sell-off, during which the financial sector dropped 11 per cent.Citigroup picked up 10.2 per cent to $3.24, helped by comments from its chief executive Vikram Pandit that it would “repay every dollar” of bail-out money. Bank of America, which fell nearly 25 per cent on Monday following warnings in its results about deteriorating credit conditions, gained 9.2 per cent to $8.76.US Bancorp was another significant riser, jumping 20.9 per cent to $19.27 after making better profits than expected.State Street reported operating earnings marginally ahead of estimates as mark-to-market losses declined following a change in accounting standards from the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Its shares gained 17.9 per cent to $36.15.Lincoln National, the health insurer, surged after Bank of America recommended investors buy its stock and Reuters reported it would sell its Delaware Investments asset management unit. Its shares rose 20.3 per cent to $10.56.This helped the benchmark S&P 500 index rise 2.1 per cent to 850.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index gained 1.6 per cent to 7,969.56 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.2 per cent to 1,643.85.The overall rise in the financial sector masked falls from some companies as they missed earnings estimates, however.Keycorp, the Ohio-based bank, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent per share as it reported its fourth straight quarterly loss. Its shares fell 4.7 per cent to $7.05.Bank of New York Mellon also cut its dividend, reducing it to 9 cents per share, after feeling the effects of falling global stock markets, which put potential customers off investing with the bank. Its stock lost 0.2 per cent to $27.98.“Much of Monday’s trade was technical, with short-sellers betting that the six week rally could not continue. A lot of the most bearish estimates were factored in to the share price already,“ said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The Nasdaq’s gains came as IBMand Texas Instruments announced better earnings than predicted.IBM climbed 1.9 per cent to $102.31 after surprisingly good earnings.This helped Microsoft which gained 1.9 per cent to $18.97. Oracle, which on Monday announced a deal to buy Sun Microsystems, a former IBM target, also rose, gaining 3.8 per cent to $19.53.Texas beat expectations and raised its forecast for full-year profits gave up its early gains, following other chip makers downwards, and fell 1.2 per cent to $17.11.Some of the biggest Dow components added to the morning’s flurry of corporate news. Caterpillar reported earnings ahead of predictions, helping its shares gain 3 per cent to $31.39 even though this equated to a loss once the cost of making redundancies had been factored in.AK Steel offered further strength to the industrial sector as lower costs helped it report a narrower loss than Wall Street had expected. Its shares jumped 13.8 per cent to $11.66.Du Pont also gained as it reported earnings in line with estimates. Even though the chemical maker cut its full-year outlook, predicting further weakening of demand, its shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $28.06.Merger partners in the drug industry Merck and Schering-Plough both fell after Merck missed estimates for its first-quarter earnings. Schering’s earnings came in ahead of expectations, but both companies declined as Merck cut its full-year outlook. Merck lost 6.7 per cent to $23.54 while Schering Plough gave up 4.1 per cent to $22.11.Coca-Cola lost initial gains after reporting earnings in line with estimates. Investors worried about disappointing sales numbers though, sending its shares down 2.8 per cent to $43.09.“Today’s moves are a confluence of bargain hunting, Geithner’s comments assuaging fears over banks and short-covering after yesterday’s falls,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.
28;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-04-16T21:03:45Z;Tech and media stocks lift Wall Street;;Technology and media stocks staged a late rally on Thursday to take the equity markets higher after a day spent struggling for traction despite good results from JPMorgan.Investors bet on good results after the bell from Google, taking the company 2.4 per cent higher to $388.74. The company then reported better than expected profits. Google was joined by Apple, which rose 3.2 per cent to $121.45 and Microsoft, gaining 4.9 per cent to $19.76.Hewlett-Packard was another major gainer in the sector, rising 5 per cent to $36.60 after research firm IDC said the company had taken top spot in the US PC manufacturing market last quarter from Dell.Media companies also benefited from the bets on Google, as well as better than expected results from publisher Gannett.Gannett, which publishes USA Today, gained 3.2 per cent to $3.60 despite profits falling 60 per cent. Later in the day it was joined by bigger media conglomerates. Time Warner rose 6.8 per cent to $23.73 and Disney lifted 4 per cent to $20.51.“Media companies have been very beaten up and we would expect them to see some gains as the economic data improves,” said Tuna Amobii, an analyst at S&P.This helped take the Nasdaq Composite index to new highs for the year, up 2.7 per cent at 1,670.44 points. The benchmark S&P 500 index also rallied, rising 1.6 per cent to 865.30 points, as did the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which picked up 1.2 per cent to 8,125.43 points,.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Sun Microsystems bounced on news that it had asked IBMto resurrect takeover talks, but pared those gains when CNBC said IBM rejected the approach. Sun finished 4.4 per cent up at $6.40. IBM was 2.6 per cent higher at $101.43.Earlier, positive job figures and better than expected earnings from JPMorgan struggled to boost investor confidence.The country’s second-largest bank by assets reported earnings that beat expectations by about one-third, helping the stock gain 2.1 per cent to $33.24. But JPMorgan’s results were counterbalanced by Lincoln National after the insurer’s debt and financial-strength ratings were cut by Moody’s, which said it might downgrade the company again unless it received the $3bn in federal money it is seeking. The stock fell 4.6 per cent to $9.62.Figures showing US housing starts fell by 10.8 per cent in March, more than analysts had predicted, also weighed on financials.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “I think a lot of the gains from JPMorgan were already priced in and financials are focusing on the data on housing starts.”Regions Financial, the regional bank, surged 34 per cent to $6.70, however, after Dowd Ritter, the chief executive, said the company would make a profit for the first quarter, with analysts having previously predicted a loss.Data showing initial jobless claims fell less than expected in the week ending April 11 failed to spark a major rally. Investors were more concerned that the number continuing to claim such benefits had risen above 6m for the first time since records began.There was good news from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve which said that manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region had slowed its decline in April.But confidence was tempered when General Growth Properties, the second-largest US owner of shopping centres, filed for bankruptcy protection. This exacerbated fears that commercial property would be the next shock for the market. Real estate companies initially tumbled before being caught in the late buying. Prologis gained 1.9 per cent to $8.61.Harley Davidson made better earnings than expected and reaffirmed its full-year outlook on shipping numbers. Its shares rose 5.7 per cent to $18.11.Southwest Airlines took some of the sheen from the airline industry, however, after AMR’s narrower than expected losses. Southwest lost more than expected, as low demand took its toll. Its shares fell 7.1 per cent to $7.10.Rosetta Stone provided confidence for stocks after it beat estimates for its initial public offering. The language instruction company sold shares at $18 after expectations of a maximum $17, and then rose 39.6 per cent during the day to $25.12.
29;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-04-09T08:52:31Z;Wall St looks to brush off earnings gloom;;A reported extension of the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp) and a major deal in the homebuilding sector on Wednesday morning managed to ease the gloom on Wall Street on brought by a disappointing beginning to earnings season.Life insurers surged after reports said that the Treasury was ready to extend Tarp, the scheme aimed at recapitalising distressed banks, to banks and thrifts owned by those insurers.Lincoln National leapt 38.5 per cent to $9.54 on the news, while Principal Financial gained 28 per cent to $12.99 and Hartford Financial picked up 25.2 per cent to $10.58.“An injection of capital similar to the banks would provide enough capital for even the most thinly capitalized institutions to weather a prolonged and protracted credit cycle if the S&P 500 does not drop below 600,” wrote Thomas Gallagher at Credit Suisse.Meanwhile Pulte Homes announced it was to buy Centex in a $1.3bn deal that would create the country’s largest homebuilder by sales. The deal, which would be paid for using Pulte stocks, valued Centex's shares at $10.50, a significant premium to Tuesday’s closing price. Centex jumped 27.6 per cent to $9.72, while Pulte fell 4.3 per cent to $10.31.This gave further confidence to the sector after the number of mortgage applications was shown to have risen 4.7 per cent during the week ending April 3 as low interest rates begin to take effect. Lennar benefitted from that strength, gaining 10.9 per cent to $7.91.The benchmark S&P 500 index managed to find moderate gains after two loss-making sessions, rising 0.7 per cent to 821.26 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.6 per cent to 7,832.97 points and the Nasdaq Composite index lifted 1.5 per cent to $1,584.31.Alcoa was the first major company to report its first quarter earnings, and the aluminium maker made a loss of $0.59 per share from continuing operations as a lack of demand for the metal, especially from the ailing car industry, drove down prices. This was slightly worse than analysts had predicted and the company fell in post-market trade on Tuesday. But it recovered during Wednesday morning’s trade, with many analysts saying the results could have been even worse. Its shares rose 0.9 per cent to $7.86.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said that the disappointing results from Alcoa were unlikely to spook investors. “The company tends to disappoint and is unlikely to move the market,” he wrote.Alcoa was followed by Constellation Brands, the owner of several big alcoholic brands including Robert Mondavi wines, which also reported mildly disappointing results. The company made a loss of $1.88 a share, hurt by disappointing demand in Europe and Australia over the winter festivities. Its shares lost 3.4 per cent to $11.24.Family Dollar Stores was able to increase its profits in line with expectations as cash-strapped consumers shopped in its budget stores. The company made $0.60 per share, as forecast, but the shares rose after the company said it would make better profits than previously predicted for the fiscal year. They gained 5.8 per cent to $34.55.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, made a profit of $0.55 per share, which was lower than its previous quarter, but far outstripped consensus expectations of $0.44 per share. Its shares picked up 19.2 per cent to $30.41.“It’s not earth shaking, and there is still a lot of uncertainty out there,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “But if we see several companies report in line with expectations, we may see support come into the market.”Mr Cook also said the results for consumer companies were encouraging, even though ABC figures showed that consumer confidence declined during the week ending April 5. “We are seeing consumer spending increase even if incomes are falling. People are still buying,” said Mr Cook.The agricultural company Mosaic reported particularly disappointing results however, although it did not prove a major drag on the equities market as it is not listed on any of the best known market measures. The company made $0.18 per share compared to analysts’ estimates of $0.22 after prices tumbled last year. Its shares lost 1.2 per cent to $42.42.Many analysts are scrambling to lower their estimates on companies before the earnings season gathers pace next week. Wednesday saw Morgan Stanley fall after Oppenheimer slashed its forecast for the company’s first quarter earnings from $0.37 in profits per share to $0.59 in losses. Morgan Stanley’s shares fell 2.5 per cent to $22.73.Energy stocks were the major drag on the index however, as the price of oil continued to fall. Early in New York, oil was trading $0.89 lower at $48.26 per barrel of US crude. Exxon Mobil and Chevron both dropped 0.8 per cent to $68.18 and $67.84 respectively.European stocks were mixed early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index 0.1 per cent higher at 761.15 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly down, with the Nikkei 225 average closing 2.7 per cent lower at 8,595.01 points.Bond yields were down. The yield on the two-year Treasury note dropped 1 basis point to 0.899 per cent and that on the ten-year note fell 4bp to 2.858 per cent.The dollar was up against most major currencies except the yen early in New York. It gained 0.5 per cent to $1.3202 against the euro.Gold was trading $0.89 higher at $880.15 per troy ounce.
30;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-04-08T20:22:09Z;US life insurers rally on bailout hopes;;Shares of US life assurance companies surged on Wednesday on hopes the US Treasury would soon approve a number of the sector’s troubled companies for access to government bailout funds.The Treasury is nearing a decision on whether to provide funds to several life assurance companies with bank subsidiaries, and announcements could come in the next week or two.A Treasury spokesman said: “There are a number of life insurers who met the requirements for the capital purchase programme because of their thrift or bank holding company status.”Lincoln National led the sector’s gains on Wednesday, soaring 36.2 per cent in morning trade to $9.39. Principal Financial Group rose 23.15 per cent to $12.50, while Hartford Financial Services rallied 21 per cent to $10.23 and Genworth Financial rose to 12.9 per cent to $2.36. Phoenix rose 15.3 per cent to $1.73. All have bank holding company or savings and loan status, or own a thrift.The decision to open the bailout programme to insurers with bank subsidiaries was made by the Bush administration. The Obama administration has maintained this position.Since then some life insurers that did not have a bank decided to acquire one to become eligible for bailout funds, including Genworth Financial, Hartford Financial and Lincoln National. Seven insurers have announced they have applied for the funds. Officials indicated the total number of applications was less than 10.“These companies are among the hundreds of financial institutions in the [capital purchase programme] pipeline that will be reviewed and funded as appropriate on a rolling basis,” said the Treasury spokesman.While there is a general expectation that the bank subsidiaries of life assurance groups will receive some share of bailout funds, officials cautioned that final decisions on individual applications have not been made. Administration officials said there was no additional allocation of bailout money for life assurers – and any amount given to their banks would come from funds already set aside for banks in general.The Treasury is sticking to its estimate that it will allocate about $218bn under the capital purchase programme inherited from the Bush administration. It has already allocated $198.5bn, but it also expects about $25bn in capital will be returned and could be reallocated to new recipients.The prospect of a near-term injection of Troubled Assets Relief programme capital comes as the sector has suffered from losses related to guarantees on investment products, as well as losses from portfolios that were heavily exposed to the financial sector and equity markets in general.The losses have eroded capital, leading to a string of rating agency downgrades that have made it more difficult for some insurers to raise new money.

21.3 per cent to $12.31 and Hartford Financial picked up 13.5 per cent to $9.59.“An injection of capital similar to the banks would provide enough capital for even the most thinly capitalised institutions to weather a prolonged and protracted credit cycle if the S&P 500 does not drop below 600,” wrote Thomas Gallagher at Credit Suisse.Meanwhile, Pulte Homes said it was to buy Centex in a $1.3bn takeover that would create the country’s largest homebuilder by sales. The deal valued Centex’s shares at $10.50, a significant premium to Tuesday’s closing price. Centex jumped 18.9 per cent to $9.06, while Pulte fell 10.5 per cent to $9.64.This gave further confidence to the sector after the number of mortgage applications was shown to have risen 4.7 per cent during the week ending April 3, as low interest rates begin to take effect. Lennar also benefited, gaining 5.1 per cent to $7.49.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.2 per cent up at 825.16 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.6 per cent to 7,837.11 points.The Nasdaq Composite index, up 1.9 per cent to 1,590.66 points, continued to outperform on strength from the technology sector, which some analysts have said will lead the market out of the downturn. Microsoft was the exerted the greatest pull, gaining 2.3 per cent to $19.19.Alcoa was the first leading company to report first quarter earnings, and the aluminium maker made a loss of 59 cents per share from continuing operations as a lack of demand for the metal, especially from the ailing car industry, drove down prices.That was slightly worse than analysts had predicted and the company fell before recovering some ground on Wednesday, and closed 3.5 per cent up at $8.06.Alcoa was followed by Constellation Brands, the owner of several big alcoholic brands including Robert Mondavi wines, which also reported mildly disappointing results.The company made a loss of $1.88 a share, hurt by falling demand in Europe and Australia over the Christmas period. Its shares lost 5.1 per cent to $11.05.Family Dollar Stores was able to increase its profits in line with expectations as cash-strapped consumers shopped in its budget stores.

The stock gained 6 per cent to $34.63.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, made a profit of 55 cents per share, which was lower than its previous quarter, but far outstripped consensus expectations of 44 cents per share. Its shares picked up 24.3 per cent to $31.70. “It’s not earth shaking, and there is still a lot of uncertainty out there, but if we see several companies report in line with expectations, we may see support come into the market,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “We are also seeing consumer spending increase even if incomes are falling. People are still buying.”The non-essential consumer goods sector was the S&P’s strongest.Many analysts are hurrying to lower estimates before the earnings season gathers pace. Morgan Stanley fell 2.7 per cent to $22.69 on Wednesday after Oppenheimer slashed its forecast for the bank’s first quarter earnings from a profit per share of 37 cents to a loss of 59 cents."

Its shares slipped further after the market closed when it reported a net loss of $0.61 a share, or $497m, on revenue of $4.1bn.Worries over earnings also weighed on Caterpillar, the machinery maker, which dropped 5.9 per cent to $29.45 after Andrew Obin, a Bank of America analyst, said the company was likely to make a wider first quarter loss than expected.“Investors are taking a little bit of profit off the table ahead of earnings,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management. “The financials have managed to rally over 60 per cent in the last few weeks. But I do not think anyone knows what their earnings are going to be like, so some of that money is coming back out.”This followed a subdued session on Monday, during which volumes were low and the market adjusted to the views of Mike Mayo, one of the first analysts to turn bearish on the banking sector, that banks might suffer the worst loan losses since the Great Depression.Those fears were exacerbated on Tuesday after it was reported that the International Monetary Fund is set to forecast global losses on toxic assets of up to $4,000bn.Citi added to the gloom when its analysts cut the US equities market as a whole to “underweight”, saying valuations did not look “particularly attractive”.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 2.4 per cent down at 815.55 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3 per cent to 7,789.56 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.8 per cent to 1,561.61.“The market overextended on the way up and we’re seeing it correct itself a bit now,” said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “Equities have a tendency to overshoot in both directions.”But Lincoln National provided a bright spot amid a falling financial sector after the life insurer said it was considering selling assets to build capital as it pays down $700m in debt. Its shares gained 8.2 per cent to $6.89.Health insurers also performed well after Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a government agency, said that it would increase its basline payments to those companies by 0.8 per cent, higher than originally proposed.Humana gained 6.1 per cent to $27.92, while UniteHealth picked up 6.9 per cent to $23.45 and Coventry Health lifted 3.5 per cent to $14.26.General Motors fell, giving up all of the gains made during the previous session, after Bloomberg reported that the company was speeding up preparations for bankruptcy. Its shares lost 11.9 per cent to $2.Ford fell 7.4 per cent, meanwhile, to $3.49 as investors took profits after its shares jumped 16 per cent during the previous session on the news that it had swapped $9.9bn worth of debt for cash and shares.Sun Microsystems, the previous session’s heaviest faller, continued to lose ground as analysts predicted the technology company would find it difficult to find another suitor after IBM withdrew its offer for the company over the weekend. Sun’s shares fell 4.3 per cent to $6.28.Elsewhere in the technology sector, Applied Materials shed 8.7 per cent to $10.55 after the computer chipmaker said a $1.9bn solar power contract had been cut to $250m.In oil, Exxon Mobil retreated 1.9 per cent to $68.71 after Barclays cut its 2009 and 2010 earnings estimates for the energy company, having lowered its estimates for natural gas prices.Archer-Daniels-Midland, the agricultural conglomerate, lost 10.6 per cent to $25.66 after Citi recommended selling the shares, saying the decline in its agricultural services business had been extremely fast.Utilities was the only sector briefly to find gains during the day, pulled upwards in part by PG&E, the Californian energy provider, which was upgraded by Credit Suisse. Analysts at the Swiss bank said the Californian regulatory environment would help the company maximise its earnings. PG&E shares rose 2.8 per cent to $37.83.
33;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-04-01T20:53:38Z;Wall St buoyant on economic data;;US stocks rallied on Wednesday to take Wall Street towards its second consecutive session of gains as good economic data countered early fears about the state of the economy.Equities dropped steeply in the morning as figures showed that 742,000 jobs had been lost from the private sector during March, about 100,000 more than had been expected.But shares recovered and moved into positive territory after data from the Institute of Supply Management showed that manufacturing output and prices slowed their declines during March.That helped commodities stocks find gains after early losses triggered by falling commodity prices.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, lifted 4.2 per cent to $39.71, while Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer gained 3.5 per cent to $7.60.Steel companies performed especially well, with US Steel lifting 7.1 per cent to $22.62 and AK Steel gaining 9.1 per cent to $7.77.The manufacturing data along with figures showing that mortgage applications had also risen, helped financial companies find gains.Citigroup rose 5.9 per cent to $2.68 and Bank of Americagained 3.4 per cent to $7.05.Investors were also keen to buy banks ahead of Wednesday’s announcement from the Financial Accounting Standards Board on mark-to-market accounting, which has been blamed for exacerbating banks’ capital problems.Insurers performed well, with Prudential gaining 7.8 per cent to $20.50, Lincoln National picking up 5.7 per cent to $7.07 and Metlife lifting 2.9 per cent to $23.43.Aflac was one of the only insurers to fall after S&P downgraded hybrid debt issued by more than 60 European firms. Aflac said in February that downgrades of such securities could force it to take more writedowns this year. Its shares lost 3.2 per cent to $18.75“The jobs data spooked the market, but there are now some indications that we are starting to see a levelling off of the economic slump,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.7 per cent to 811.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 2 per cent to 7,761.60 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.5 per cent to 1,551.60.Telecoms were the biggest risers on the S&P, led higher by QWest which is considering selling its long haul network, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. With Verizon and AT&T said to be possible buyers, QWest’s shares rose 9.7 per cent to $3.75.General Motors fell for a third consecutive session, however, weighed by further talk of bankruptcy, as the New York Times reported that the Obama administration was looking to lead the company into a “controlled” bankruptcy. GM’s shares lost 0.5 per cent to $1.93.But Jerry Webman, chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds, said that while the possible bankruptcy was not good news for GM shareholders, the increased certainty about the status of the company had helped calm the wider market.“There has been more clarity from Washington over automotives, and that is lending some stability to stocks,” he said.Healthcare stocks proved the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P 500 index, after Celgene the drug maker, warned about revenues coming in at the lower end of forecasts, saying it expected 2009 profits of about $2.05 per share. It lost 13.4 per cent to $38.47.Many investors were waiting for further news from the G20 meeting in London.Taro Aso, the Japanese prime minister, warned in an interview with the FT of the serious consequences of not agreeing another globally co-ordinated stimulus plan. But Mr Cardillo of Avalon said he believed that Wall Street would only move if there was a total breakdown of relations at the meeting.“The market is not going to hang its hat on the G20. Unless there’s an indication that protectionism might come into play the market will ignore it.”Apollo Group, the University of Phoenix’s parent company, fell in spite of better-than-expectesd quarterly earnings. Investors were spooked by warnings of slowing margin growth and of the university facing increased regulatory oversight. Its shares lost 15.2 per cent to $66.46.
34;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The S&P gained 8.5 per cent during March, the best monthly gain in over six years. But it finished the quarter more than 11 per cent lower.“In a bear market, the rallies are the most violent but in a bull market the falls are the most violent. The fact that we saw a fierce drop on Monday, but have risen again today shows we are in a bull move,” said John Brady, chief investment strategist at MF Global.The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed the other market measures after Davenport upgraded Microsoft to “buy” from “neutral”, saying there was increased PC demand in China and the US.Microsoft gained 5.1 per cent to $18.37 and the Nasdaq as a whole rose 1.8 per cent to 1,528.59 points.“There has been some strengthening in consumer orders across the technology sector, and we’ve also noticed a bit of a pick-up in the supply chain,” said Ben Reitzes, an analyst at
Barclays Capital.Fords shares fell 4.7 per cent to $2.63 as the automotive sector continued to struggle. The company announced yesterday it would cover 12 months’ worth of payments from customers who lost their jobs “for economic reasons”.GM also continued to slump, losing 28.2 per cent to $1.94 after Fritz Henderson, the company’s new chief executive, talked openly about bankruptcy.Another of Monday’s heavy fallers, Alcoa rose after Deutsche Bank upgraded its shares, saying fears had receded that the company would need to refinance after it generated about $2bn in asset and equities sales in March. Alcoa’s shares rose 9.7 per cent to $7.34. But Deutsche Bank was less positive about
fellow metal producer,
Freeport McMoRan.The bank said the copper miner was likely to suffer after a recent rally on the prospect of lower copper prices. Its shares fell 1.1 per cent to $38.11.In the housing sector, homebuilder Lennar reported a wider loss than had been expected, at $0.98 per share for the first quarter.

KB’s shares fell 4.2 per cent to $13.18.Investors found some relief from the level of consumer confidence, which rose off its historic lows for February, although by less than predicted.But business activity fell during the month, according to data from the Chicago Purchasers Index, against expectations of a modest rise.Ingersoll-Rand, the industrial services company, fell 1.3 per cent to $13.80 after slashing its dividend to 7 cents per share in order to save $140m a year.."

Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, exacerbated those fears when he said some US banks would need “large amounts” of assistance.Bank of America was one of the heaviest fallers, down 17.9 per cent to $6.03 while Citigroup fell 11.8 per cent to $2.31 and Wells Fargolost 14.2 per cent to $13.37.The insurance sector also suffered, and Lincoln National fell 38.2 per cent to $6.41 after it withdrew an application to sell debt with a government guarantee, saying it did not meet the necessary conditions. Credit Suisse downgraded the company to “neutral” on the news, saying: “We expect tension between liquidity needs at the holding company as well as likely further pressure on subsidiary capital levels.”There were also fears that signs of discord from leaders of countries attending the G20 in London this week could hamper attempts at global economic recovery.Marc Pado, chief investment strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “The G20 really achieved something in November when they agreed to work towards financial stability. But this time some countries, like Germany, are pushing against further stimulus packages, and that is worrying the markets.”The financial sector as a whole fell 9.4 per cent, which wiped out almost all of the gains made after Mr Geithner announced his plan last week to clear up banks’ balance sheets.A couple of financial companies avoided the gloom. Fifth Third gained 5.5 per cent to $2.48 after it generated $561m in cash by selling its payment processing division to Advent International, a private equity firm.Visa, the credit card company, outperformed the market after Barron’s, the investment magazine, said its steady growth should attract investors.

It shows the growing power of Washington in US business.“But we think this sell-off is a bit of an over-reaction as the GM restructuring had already been factored into its share price.”Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, fell 14.2 per cent to $6.69 after China’s Aluminium Corp reported a 99.9 per cent decline in 2008 profit and forecast a first quarter loss as the company felt the effect of lower prices.Other industrial companies fell, with Caterpillar losing 9.3 per cent to $27.53. General Electric dropped 7.9 per cent to $9.93 even though Nani Beccalli, chief executive of GE International, told the Financial Times he saw “signs of life” in the US and European economies.Bristol Myers Squibb was a rare gainer, its shares lifting 1.7 per cent to $21.02 after the US Food and Drug Administration said analyses of its experimental diabetes drug showed it met the agency’s guidelines.Oil prices fell below $50 for a barrel of US crude, and energy companies followed.

The most serious problem will be the pricing of assets, but for now, the equities market is relieved just to see some detail.”But Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said: “This is something that could have ended this much, much earlier, but now it’s just a mild positive.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 7.1 per cent up at 822.92 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.8 per cent to 7,775.86 points, while the Nasdaq Composite index gained 6.8 per cent to 1,555.77 points.The last time the S&P gained as much was on the back of a cut in interest rates from the Federal Reserve last year. Financial stocks staged their biggest rally since November.President Barack Obama also helped calm nerves on Wall Street when he sounded less than positive about a bill passed by the House of Representatives on Friday to impose a 90 per cent tax on the bonuses of high earners at bailed-out banks. Mr Obama said the government needed to find ways of reacting “that are both legal, that are constitutional”, fuelling hopes he may veto it if it passes the Senate.“The movement to tax the bonus of Tarp [troubled asset relief programme] players has put a cloud over the financial industry, and risks slowing the recovery of the financial sector and economy,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Energy stocks rose, following the oil price, which reached new highs for the year. Chevrongained 6.9 per cent to $69.15 and Exxon Mobil rose 6.7 per cent to $70.53.Investors also took confidence from better figures on sales of existing homes in February.

The falls on Friday came after several pieces of bad news, including a lack of interest in the latest Federal Reserve lending plan, fears over plans to tax high-earners at bailed out banks 90 per cent, and the news from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that banks had made a heavier loss in the fourth quarter than originally reported.Bank of America was one of the biggest losers, dropping 10.7 per cent to $6.19.

Shares fell 18.7 per cent to $4.34.Several companies have successfully raised cash through bond sales, or are moving to do so as investors turn to corporate bonds as the yield on government debt falls after the Fed’s plan to buy Treasuries. The activity in the debt markets has helped fuel stock price rises too.Philip Morris advanced
3.1 per cent to $38.36 after raising €2bn in bonds. Merck also rose after it said it would issue a $1bn bond ahead of its planned $41bn takeover of rival Schering-Plough. Its shares climbed 2.6 per cent to $26.72.Johnson & Johnson gave further support to the healthcare sector after UBS advised long-term investors to buy its shares. The stock rose 3.2 per cent to $51.67.The three main market measures were set to finish 0.7-1.8 per cent higher for the week, the first time this year that the S&P 500 has put together two consecutive positive weeks this year.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned that the S&P would find it difficult to push past 800. “The market doesn’t usually trade well the week after equity options expire, so we are likely to remain flat,” he said."
39;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-03-04T22:04:32Z;Wall Street lifted by Chinese stimulus plans;;General Electric, once the biggest company in the world by capitalisation, on Wednesday saw its share price dip to a low not seen since 1991 during an otherwise positive day on Wall Street.GE was forced to issue a statement tackling rumours it would have to raise fresh capital as the cost of insuring against the company’s finance arm defaulting on its debt spiked.After falling steeply in early trade it the company’s shares bounced slightly when the company said it had “acted aggressively” to adapt to the current recession and had ”no plans to raise additional equity”. They ended the day down 4.6 per cent at $6.69.That went against the general trend of the day, which saw all three major indices rising on hopes that China could shore up global demand, with a fresh stimulus package from Beijing widely expected.Metal producers were amongst the biggest gainers, with Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, picking up 13.4 per cent to $32.21. Nucor, the steel manufacturer, and Alcoa, the aluminium maker, also saw gains, rising 8.1 per cent to $34.73 and 12.8 per cent to $6.24 respectively.The news from Beijing also helped had an effect on oil prices, and US crude rose $3.51 to $45.16 per barrel. This was followed by energy companies, including Chevron, which rose 2.7 per cent to $59.28 and Exxon Mobil, which gained 2.1 per cent to $65.68.Caterpillar, which supplies machinery to domestic mining markets and to China directly, was a big gainer, rising 13.2 per cent to $25.44.A potential uptick in demand from Asia also helped technology stocks, which have been heavily sold during the first couple of months of 2009. Applepicked up 3.2 to $91.17 while Cisco rose 6 per cent to $15.25.“The sector got badly beaten up at the start of the year, but the news out of China has encouraged some buyers,” said Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman.The S&P 500 rose 2.4 per cent to 712.87, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.2 per cent to 6,875.84 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.5 per cent to 1,353.74.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, however, despite further details from Washington on the Obama administration’s $275bn plan to help homeowners avoid defaulting on their mortgages. Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary, said that mortgage providers could start reducing borrowers’ payments immediately.“The mortgage plan is a great idea,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial. “It will allow some homeowners to refinance and so should relieve pressure on financial stocks.”But others have warned that the administration is not being sufficiently friendly towards equity markets, in spite of President Obama’s reassurance on Tuesday that “buying stocks is a potentially good deal”.“The market will find selling pressure until Washington decides to address the market’s decline via policies which are friendly toward capital formation and investment,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Banks were down, with Citigroup falling 7.4 per cent to $1.13, and Bank of America dropping 1.4 per cent to $3.59. US Bancorp added significant pressure to the sector after becoming the latest large company to cut its dividend, reducing it from 42.5 cents to just 5 cents per share. Its shares fell 12.5 per cent to $11.01.This leaves Wells Fargo as the largest traditional commercial bank not to cut its dividend, and fears that it would soon do so sent the company’s stock down 9.5 per cent to $9.66.Insurers rallied after Tuesday’s falls on news that 12 life insurers have applied for capital injections from the Treasury in order to buy local lenders.MetLife rose 7.3 per cent to $14.72, while Lincoln National and Prudential gained 9.2 per cent to $7.16 and 7.1 per cent to $13.82 respectively.But the overall fall in the financial sector reflected fears in the credit markets about the security of those companies’ debts.The CDR Counterparty Risk Index, a measure of the counterparty risk in the sector, was at its highest level this morning since September last year, went Lehman Brothers went bust.
40;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-03-03T21:53:13Z;Insurers and financials foil Wall Street;;"The benchmark S&P 500 index closed the day below the 700 points level for the first time since October 1996 in a choppy trading session dominated by news coming from Washington.Share prices fluctuated as President Barack Obama, Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the federal reserve, all spoke in what appeared to be a concerted effort to calm the markets after heavy sell-offs during the last week.But the effort appeared to have failed in the short term, with all three major indices closing down on Tuesday. The S&P lost 0.6 per cent to 696.33 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 6,726.02 points and the Nasdaq dropped 0.1 per cent to 1,321.01 points.Insurers led the afternoon’s retreat during Mr Bernanke’s testimony to a senate committee. Mr Bernanke said that the stricken insurer AIG had been a “hedge fund basically that was attached to a large and stable insurance company”. His words triggered fears about how exposed other insurers were to AIG.Metlife fell 16.9 per cent to $13.72. Lincoln National, which was hit by a ratings downgrade from Fitch, closed 14.9 per cent down at $6.56. Prudential lost 12.6 per cent to $12.90.After an early rally as bargain hunters looked to take advantage of low prices after Monday’s heavy falls, there was a mixed picture for the banks by the closing bell.Citigroup finished 1.7 per cent higher at $1.22 while Bank of America rose, in spite of being downgraded by S&P, the rating agency. It finished 0.6 per cent up at $3.65. Wells Fargo lost 1.6 per cent to $10.67.The early gains were eroded during Mr Bernanke’s testimony.Dave Rovell, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams, said: “It was the aggressive questioning from senators that weighed especially heavily. One spent a long time calling for nationalisation, putting pressure on financial stocks.”In the afternoon, Tim Geithner launched the term asset-backed securities loan facility, but the markets were left hungry for further details, and his words failed to spark a recovery.Mr Obama was even moved to give his own bullish assessment of stocks during the afternoon, saying, “Profit and earning ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal.”Industrial stocks rose on speculation that China, the world’s biggest metal purchaser, could soon start to buy in large quantities.Metal companies performed particularly well. Freeport McMoRan, the copper producer, gained 7.3 per cent to $28.41, while Nucorp, which makes steel, rose by
4.5 per cent to $32.12.Energy stocks followed the price of oil higher. Consol Energy, which suffered in the previous session after announcing the temporary closure of its Buchanan coal mine in Virginia, gained 4.4 per cent to $32.57. Chevronalso picked up, rising 0.2 per cent to $57.73.GE, which dropped sharply on Monday after the announcement last week of the company’s first dividend cut since 1938, continued to lose ground, falling 7.8 per cent to $7.01.“GE looks relatively cheap but the company has
really very little in tangible assets,” said Steve Lehman from Federated Investors. There were also concerns that the company would soon have to raise capital.In the technology sector, Apple announced it would release a new Macbook laptop computer. Its shares rose 0.5 per cent to $88.37.Dell gained, in spite of a report on Monday from technology researcher Gartner that forecast an 11.9 per cent drop in personal computer sales this year. It gained 8.5 per cent to $9.15.There was more bad economic news as the number of pending US home sales, those for which contracts have been signed but the purchaser has not yet moved, fell by 7.7 per cent in January, more than twice as much as expected.The home building sector fell 7.5 per cent on the pending sales figure, and real estate stocks followed. Developers Diversified was the biggest loser, down 17.1 per cent to $1.94.There was no major spike in volatility, which analysts said would have to come before equity markets bottomed out. The Vix index, which measures volatility, fell 0.4 per cent."
41;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-02-27T21:34:52Z;Citi deal hits US financials;;US stocks plummeted again on Friday to levels not seen since 1996.Details of a government plan to take a 36 per cent stake in Citigroup and more negative economic data caused the heavy falls, which took shares below Monday’s level, when they tested 1997 lows.Investors balked at the dilution of Citi’s shares by the government holding as well as the news that the company would suspend all dividend payments.But an annualised 6.2 per cent fall for the fourth quarter in US gross domestic product, the sharpest since 1982, meant that the whole market was hit.The benchmark S&P 500 index dropped 2.4 per cent for the day, finishing at 735.09.Citigroup saw 39 per cent of its share price wiped out, finishing at $1.50. It was joined by Bank of America, which shed 25.8 per cent to $3.95 and Wells Fargo, which lost 16 per cent to $12.10. Banks fell 8.7 per cent, and the financial sector overall lost 7.4 per cent.Insurers, meanwhile, fared even worse, hit not only by general fears over the financial sector but also by the fact that Standard & Poor’s cut its rating for 10 companies in the sector.Principal Financial lost 24.6 per cent to $7.99, Metlife dropped 23.1 per cent to $18.46 and Lincoln National fell 20.1 per cent to $8.59.“The insurers have been big backers of commercial securities and that area is getting weak as well,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial. “The whole financial sector is going to continue to show weakness,” he added.General Electric slumped in afternoon trade after the group cut its quarterly dividend from 31 cents to 10 cents per share. Even though the news had been widely expected, its shares fell 6.5 per cent to $8.53.It was a mixed day for healthcare stocks, which fell in afternoon trading after early gains as the market continued to digest the government’s healthcare plan.Humana recovered to gain 0.1 per cent to $23.67, but other companies lost out, such as Johnson & Johnson, which fell 4.7 per cent to $50. Overall, the sector lost 4.2 per cent, contributing to a total fall of 11.4 per cent for the week.“When people started looking at the details of the Obama plan, it got even more frightening for healthcare companies,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Dell did well after its earnings beat analysts’ predictions and it announced it would seek to save an extra $1bn as part of ongoing cost-cutting efforts. Its shares were up 3.9 per cent to $8.53.Heavy selling was also seen on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index. The Dow fell 1.7 per cent at 7,062.93, while the Nasdaq fell 0.98 per cent to 1,377.84 The Dow has now seen six straight months of falls.The sell-off capped a turbulent week, which saw the equities market breaking through November’s lows after heavy selling on Monday which some analysts called “capitulation” and “a technical breakdown”.Despite a mid-week rally, all three indices finished around 4 per cent down for the week, with different sectors having pulled in opposite directions throughout on announcements from Washington.On Tuesday and Wednesday, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped trigger a surge in banking stocks when he reassured the market that the government had no plans to nationalise banks.His message was boosted when Mr Obama announced that, as part of his budget, he wanted to put aside $250bn into a reserve fund in case the financial sector needed further bail-outs.These announcements meant that financial stocks remained one of the week’s big winners, even after Friday’s selling, finishing the week 2 per cent up.“The government is starting to realise it needs to either nationalise the banks or be very clear that it will not,” said Mr Paulsen. “But it could still have been more explicit this week.”
42;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-02-25T21:49:22Z;BofA stages turnround amid the gloom;;Banking stocks swung violently between spectacular losses and gains on Wednesday as traders scrambled to assess where the Obama administration’s rescue plans leave shareholders.The KBW bank index lurched from losses of as much as 7.6 per cent to gains of 7.1 per cent. The index finished 2.4 per cent higher on hopes that existing equity would at least not be wiped out altogether under further intervention from Washington.The wider market had a downbeat start to the wild session after National Association of Realtors data showed an unexpectedly steep fall in sales of previously owned homes as low prices failed to attract buyers.Yet stocks later rallied after Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, again sought to calm nerves that a leading bank would be nationalised. “He has reinforced the message,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The government wants to take preference shares rather than common shares because it wants to give banks an easy way out if the worst doesn’t happen.”However, a strong afternoon rally gave way to a significant sell-off in the last half hour of trading and the wider market finished in the red.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “The bottom line is that we are still lacking any confidence and there is a fear factor the markets can’t seem to get rid of. On top of that, the market just isn’t buying the message coming out of President Obama’s White House at the moment.”At the end of the wild session, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index all closed 1.1 per cent lower at 764.90 points, 7,270.89 points and 1,425.43 points, respectively.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said: “People are buying on a rumour and selling on the subsequent news.”Among the volatile performers, Bank of Americaat one point was down 11.2 per cent after Merrill Lynch disclosed that ineffective internal controls had caused the bank to understate losses last year by $500m.The shares closed up 9.1 per cent at $5.16, as investors focused on the pledge from its chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, that the lender would pass the government’s so-called stress test.Citigroup lost 16.9 per cent in the morning session, but rallied to stand 3.1 per cent lower at $2.52.The energy sector – down as much as 2.7 per cent in the morning session – later rallied to close 0.7 per cent lower.Although banking stocks finished higher, the financial sector overall lost ground, weighed down by insurers.Lincoln National reported its first loss in six years and slashed its quarterly dividend from 21 cents to 1 cent. The shares sank 14 per cent to $11.21.The news had a knock-on effect on the rest of the life assurance sector.Prudential fell 2.7 per cent to $19.86, while MetLife lost 5.4 per cent to $22.05.Allstate shed 5.7 per cent to $17.57 after the home and car insurer also slashed its dividend by more than half, after two consecutive quarterly losses.But even though the market fell, the Vix – an index of anxiety – also eased 1.9 per cent to 44.6.Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “Would lower equity index prices be synonymous with a higher degree of investor fear? The answer turned out to be a resounding ‘no’.”Earlier in the session, the market had sold off heavily after investors overlooked the speech by President Obama the previous evening and focused on data that showed home purchases fell by 5.3 per cent to an annual rate of 4.49m, the fewest since 1997. The S&P fell 1.2 per cent in the 10 minutes after the figures were issued.Homebuilders shed 0.8 per cent overall in choppy trade.Industrials was the worst performing sector of the day, off 2.9 per cent overall. Boeing lost 4.3 per cent at $33.91 and Lockheed Martin 5.4 per cent at $70.46.Telecommunications was the only sector to find positive territory after JPMorgan analysts upgraded their view of AT&T to “overweight”.“Wireline guidance assumptions are conservative,” they wrote. The shares bucked the downward trend, up 2 per cent to $23.71.
43;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-02-10T21:53:00Z;Wall Street falls on Geithner announcement;;"Big name banking stocks were among the heaviest losers on Wall Street on Tuesday after Tim Geithner’s much-awaited financial sector rescue proposals failed to instil investors in the stricken sector with confidence.The S&P 500 fell by 2.1 per cent in 10 minutes just before the Treasury secretary set out how the Obama administration would use the remaining financial
sector bail-out fund.The sell-off worsened as Mr Geithner spoke and continued throughout the day. Senate approval of the economic stimulus bill failed to halt the widespread decline, which wiped out much of the previous week’s strong gains.“There was a very long drum roll leading up to this,” said Stephen Wood, senior portfolio strategist at Russell Investments. “It didn’t happen.”Financials led the retreat, hurt by persistent fears of outright nationalisation of key institutions in which equity holders would be wiped out. The sector lost 10.9 per cent overall.JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, now the two largest US banks by market capitalisation, fell 9.8 per cent to $24.62, and 14.2 per cent to $16.35, respectively.Bank of America dropped 19.3 per cent to $5.56, while Citigroupdropped 15.2 per cent to $3.35.Regional banks – key winners in the previous session – suffered some of the heaviest losses. Insurers also did particularly badly, off 9.1 per cent overall on concerns of the need for fresh capital raising.Standard & Poor’s and Fitch cut their credit ratings on Hartford Financial Services, which fell 13.2 per cent to $13.05.Lincoln National fell 18.9 per cent to $14.42 after the group reported its first loss in six years and Moody’s warned it may cut its credit ratings.The S&P 500 closed down 4.9 per cent at 827.16, paring the gains since President Obama’s inauguration day to just 2.7 per cent.The benchmark index stands 4.8 per cent below its 50-day moving average and less than 10 cent away from an 11-year low hit last November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 4.6 per cent weaker at 7,888.88 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 4.2 per cent lower at 1,524.73. The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 6.9 per cent to 46.7.Traders had remained reluctant to place bearish bets on banks before the administration unveiled its plans. But all 10 sectors were sharply in the red on Tuesday. Commodity stocks gave the market some support early in the session but finished sharply lower. The material and energy sectors finished off 4.5 per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively.Alcoa was one of the highest profile victims outside the financial sector, pushed 10 per cent lower to $7.65 after S&P cut the aluminium producer’s credit rating to the lowest investment grade.Meanwhile, a glut of other downbeat developments once again underscored the extent of the recession and the toll it was taking on US corporations.Food retailers were sold off after Citigroup highlighted the risk of a “modern day price war” and cut its target price on a host of stocks in the sector. Safeway shed 6.4 per cent to $20.50 after Deborah Weinswig, analyst, downgraded her recommendation on the stock to “sell”.Commerce Department data showed US wholesale inventories fell by a record 1.4 per cent in December, twice as much as forecast.Meanwhile, General Motors unveiled proposals to cut 10,000 salaried jobs and impose pay cuts on other workers as part of its restructuring plan. GM shares fell 4.6 per cent to $2.70.Molson Coors lost 7.9 per cent to $37.30 after the brewer disclosed worse-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings.Only nine S&P 500 stocks found positive territory. Among them, Qwest jumped 2.4 per cent to $3.45 on well-received results, but the telecoms sector took scant comfort from its figures, off 4.8 per cent overall.Intercontinental-Exchange edged 1.3 per cent lower to $61.44. Investors had looked beyond a 24 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profit to focus on a jump in commissions but the shares succumbed late in the session. The sell-off also took in erstwhile defensive consumer stocks such as Procter & Gamble, off 2.8 per cent to $51.45."
44;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-01-28T21:42:31Z;Wall Street buoyed by bank rescue hopes;;"US banking stocks enjoyed spectacular gains on Wednesday, helping the wider market extend its winning streak to four straight sessions – the longest since the government rescued Citigroup last November.Citigroup and Bank of America were among the key winners, up 18.6 per cent to $4.21 and 13.7 per cent to $7.39, respectively, as the sector rallied on that Washington could set up a so-called bad bank to take on the toxic assets that lie at the heart of the
financial crisis.Wells Fargo leapt 30.9 per cent to $21.19 as investors overlooked its first quarterly loss since 2001 and focused instead on the disclosure that it would not seek additional capital from the government’s troubled asset relief programme and that it would maintain its quarterly dividend.Regional lenders also did well, up 14.3 per cent overall. Among custodian banks, State Street leapt 31.4 per cent to $25.77.“We’ve had all that public chatter about possibly nationalising banks . . . that would totally destroy the equity,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital. “What the market wants is less uncertainty every day [and] it seems like we’re solidifying on a good bank / bad bank approach.”Insurers were key winners after a group of state insurance regulators endorsed industry proposals to ease capital requirements.MetLife and Lincoln National jumped 20.2 per cent to $33.27 and 21.8 per cent to $20.64, respectively.Financials dominated the leaderboard as the benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 3.4 per cent at 874.09, leaving it more than 16 per cent away from an 11-year low it hit in November.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.5 per cent higher at 8,375.45 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 3.6 per cent stronger at 1,558.34.The market hit session highs after the Federal Reserve indicated it was ready to push ahead with the unconventional move to buy long-term Treasuries.During the morning, the S&P rose above its 50-day moving average – a key technical level – for the first time in nearly three weeks.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 6 per cent to hit its lowest level since the first full week of the year.The S&P had already enjoyed a three-day winning streak, only the third such run of gains since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, according to Bespoke Investment Group.Financials have been the key winners. The sector overall has climbed 28.1 per cent since hitting its lowest level since 1995 last week.Outside the financial sector on Wednesday, most stocks enjoyed more modest, but nevertheless strong, gains.Technology rallied 3.7 per cent overall, given a boost from better-than-expected figures from Yahoo and Sun Microsystems. Shares in the search group and server manufacturer jumped 7.9 per cent to $12.24 and 21.8 per cent to $4.86, respectively.Most earnings continued to be downbeat. Boeing, among the most high-profile, edged 0.1 per cent higher to $43.24 despite worse-than-expected figures. Bulls have argued that the market has stopped reacting adversely to bad news.Negative earnings surprises – when companies miss forecasts – are now at a 10-year high, according to Merrill Lynch.Still, Richard Bernstein, strategist, wrote: “Investors do not seem to realise that credit problems so far have largely manifested themselves in traditional ‘early cycle’ sectors…and seem unaware of the risks to mid- and late-cycle sectors [such as energy, industrials, materials and technology].”Telecoms was the worst performing sector and spent much of the session in the red in the wake of a fall in profit at AT&T, which dipped 0.1 per cent to $25.91 Still, by the wider sector found positive territory, up 1.3 per cent overall.Verizon, which fell 3.3 per cent in the previous session as the group’s fourth-quarter profit trailed some expectations, recovered 3.2 per cent to $30.92 after Citigroup reiterated its “buy” recommendation on the stock, highlighting opportunities in its wireless division.Energy stocks, up 2.3 per cent, tracked the oil price higher. Defensive sectors underperformed as investor risk appetite returned. Healthcare, consumer
staples and utilities rose 1.3 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively."
45;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2009-01-07T21:46:00Z;Wall St falls on downbeat company news;;"Sweeping layoffs and profit warnings from a range of blue chips on Wednesday sparked the steepest Wall Street sell-off for more than a month and wiped out nearly all of the market’s new-year advance.All 10 of the S&P’s main sectors lost ground after glum corporate developments from the likes of Alcoa, Time Warner and Intel – coupled with a bleak labour market survey – heightened concerns that the year-long recession was deepening.The financial sector led the declines, down 5.1 per cent overall. Regional banks such as Regions Financial, off 10.4 per cent at $7.91, were among the hardest hit after Credit Suisse warned of the risk of more equity raising and dividend cuts. “The vast majority of regionals remain vulnerable to thinning core equity levels and outsized credit concentrations,” wrote Todd Hagerman, analyst.A rally in life insurance stocks came to an end after Keefe, Bruyette & Woods cut its price target on a host of companies in the sector. Lincoln National, which had rallied by about half over the prior month, gave up 14.4 per cent to $21.22.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley lost 4.8 per cent to $84.50 and 7.6 per cent to $18.10, respectively, after Sanford C Bernstein analysts highlighted expected lower revenue from lucrative equity underwriting both this year and next.“Virtually all the high-margin businesses of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are now declining or moribund – M&A, IPO, convert arbitrage, risk arbitrage, asset management and retail brokerage,” wrote the analysts, led by Brad Hintz.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 3 per cent at 906.65 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.7 per cent weaker at 8,769.70 points and the Nasdaq Composite index 3.2 per cent lower at 1,599.06 points.The Vix, a closely watched technical measure known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, which last week fell to its lowest level since September, leapt 12.5 per cent to above 40 for the first time this year. The technology sector was one of the worst performing after lower revenue and margin guidance from Intel, whose shares shed 6.1 per cent $14.44.In the previous session, technology stocks had led the S&P to its highest level since November as investors snapped up cash-rich names, but the sector lost 3.7 per cent overall.Material stocks were also in focus after Alcoa became the latest company to unveil plans for job cuts – it intends to cut about 15,000 positions to cope with the recession.The market came under pressure from the outset after a report by ADP Employer Services showed that private sector US companies cut an estimated 693,000 jobs last month.The worse-than-expected figures sparked fears that Friday’s closely-watched non-farm payrolls report would show greater losses than already bleak forecasts.Alcoa shares were the worst performing on the Dow, off 10.2 per cent to $10.89 after the materials group also disclosed its third production cut in as many months.Monsanto helped pare the losses in the materials sector when it lifted its full-year earnings outlook after first-quarter profit more than doubled.Its shares rose 17.7 per cent to $86.16, but although the materials sector outperformed the wider market, it still dipped 1.6 per cent.The energy sector tracked the oil price sharply lower to end an eight-session winning streak, down 3.9 per cent overall.Offshore drillers came under further pressure after Citigroup issued a more bearish view of the sector.Pride International and Hercules Offshore lost 6.4 per cent to $17.88 and
4.4 per cent to $5.50, respectively, as the broker recommended clients sell the shares.Media stocks came under pressure after Time Warner warned that it expected to suffer a non-cash impairment charge of about $25bn in the fourth quarter and slashed its full-year financial outlook for 2008.Its shares dropped 6.3 per cent to $10.29, while Viacomlost 4.6 per cent to $20.97.Elsewhere, Harley-Davidson shed 12.4 per cent to $17.35 after Raymond James downgraded its view on the motorcycle stock to “underperform” after the analysts surveyed dealers to gauge demand."

Bank of America rose 27.2 per cent to $14.59, while Morgan Stanley leapt 33.13 per cent to $13.38 and Goldman Sachs climbed 26.5 per cent to $65.42 by the close in New York.

Hartford Financial Services leapt 26.1 per cent to $6.24, while Genworth Financial climbed 88.9 per cent to $1.70 and Lincoln National was up 10.5 per cent to $7.03.All three leading stock market indices posted healthy gains on the back of the Citigroup rescue.The S&P 500 ended up 6.5 per cent to 851.81 points; the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.3 per cent to 1,472.02 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.9 per cent to 8,443.39 points.The Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 11 per cent to 64.70, still indicating high levels of distress but some way down on recent highs of more
than 80.The S&P 500 plunged to an 11½-year low last week before rallying strongly on Friday as details emerged of the likely choices for key positions in President-elect Obama’s administration.Mr Obama confirmed the nomination of Timothy Geithner, chairman of the New York Federal Reserve as Treasury Secretary and several other members of his economic team. Tobias Levkovich, US equity strategist at Citigroup, pointed out the inopportune timing of the transition period given the economic crisis.“While politically understandable, the lack of policy clarity at this critical juncture (including auto industry aid) is leaving equity investors uncertain about many initiatives such as approval for the second tranche of the Tarp [Troubled Asset Relief Programme], the use of Tarp money, the details of a new stimulus package, taxes and national energy strategy.”The auto industry remained in sharp focus with General Motors up
17.3 per cent at $3.59 and Ford up 9.1 per cent at $1.56.“Equity investors remain unwilling to commit new capital in view of attractive high-grade corporate debt options, awful news in housing, declining commodity prices, growing uncertainty about international economies, and widespread losses after making previous investments that proved premature,” said Mr Levkovich. The result was “extraordinary risk aversion”.Several items of economic data are due this week and stock market investors will look for direction from reports on consumer confidence and gross domestic product on Tuesday and Wednesday’s reports on unemployment claims, personal income, new home sales and durable goods.After Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday, investors will watch the retail sector on Friday in the traditional kick-off to the holiday shopping season. David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said: “In a normal year, the week of Thanksgiving should be a quiet one on Wall Street. This is not a normal year.”He added that, as the third-quarter earnings season wound down, operating earnings for companies in the S&P had fallen by more than 20 per cent for the fourth consecutive quarter.“Once the economy finally begins to recover, profits should rebound strongly reflecting subdued labour costs and solid productivity gains,” Mr Kelly said."
47;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2008-10-05T19:49:21Z;Fund managers turn to institutions for pointers on DC;;"As defined contribution plans become the primary resource for funding the retirement of millions of Americans, asset managers and DC plan sponsors have been adopting concepts that have proved successful in the institutional space.That trend is playing out in target-date funds, which have taken 401(k)s by storm since they were selected as one of the investment vehicles employers could use to automatically enrol their employees into their plans.Now, plan providers like Old Mutual, SEI, Nuveen, Lincoln Financial and Payden/Wilshire have added target-date funds that take a decidedly institutional approach to managing DC assets.All of those firms’ target-date funds are using some form of liability driven investing (LDI) approach.While there are different interpretations and applications of this investing technique, in general it describes an approach where portfolio construction takes into
consideration the size and behaviour of the liabilities
as opposed to focusing solely on the growth of the asset base.“The idea behind LDI is taking a more holistic view of your entire portfolio,” says Tom Idzorek, chief investment officer and director of research and product development for Ibbotson Associates, a Morningstar subsidiary. “It is a broader vision of the portfolio or balance sheet . . . that also includes the unseen liabilities.”In defined benefit plans the liabilities are not only explicit – they are the dollar amount that these plans have to pay participants – but they are also legal liabilities. In using LDI in the DC space, retirement income need is considered the liability. It is what plan participants will need to pay for living expenses after they retire.It is the difference between the value of the assets and the liabilities that will determine an individual’s ability to pay for retirement.If a DB plan goes from fully or even overfunded to underfunded status, which happened in 2000 when the stock market plummeted and liabilities skyrocketed, pension plans had to reach into their coffers to put more money into the plan to make up the deficit.“If you are an individual investor, you don’t have that luxury,” Mr Idzorek says. “You have to immediately decrease your expenses moving forward.”The passing of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which sanctioned auto-enrolment and auto-escalation of employee contributions, has driven the industry to develop investment products for the accumulation phase. Thus target-date funds took the market by storm and are projected to continue to garner a significant chunk of DC assets.The target-date fund asset base is expected to grow from an estimated $277bn (£155bn, €196bn) at the end of 2008 to $1,100bn in 2012, according to Cerulli Associates. But the market is still scrambling to produce efficient solutions for the so-called decumulation phase in which retirees draw down their accumulated assets.So far, the greatest challenge in applying the LDI framework to target-date funds is to assess the liabilities. While in DB plans the liabilities are prescribed by a formula, in the DC space they are not as clearly defined.One of the guiding principles for target-dates that use LDI is that inflation poses one of the greatest threats to secure and predictable income in retirement.The funds that are already incorporating LDI techniques tend to invest in inflation hedging assets such as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (Tips), real estate and commodities. “One potential implication of embracing an LDI format is that you may favour fixed income asset classes over equity asset classes,” Mr Idzorek says.s “[These] are considered some of the better relative performers.”Still, adapting an LDI investing approach for the average 401(k) investor has a way to go, says Cleo Chang, director of research for
Wilshire Funds Management, a subsidiary of Wilshire Associates.“The DB space is much more disciplined in carrying out the investment policy,” she says. “There is a lot to be learned about how DB plans have employed LDI.”Estimating liabilities in DC portfolios is a major stumbling block since income, risk tolerance and needs in retirement vary widely. “Just because there is not an explicit liability to pay out of the plan, it doesn’t mean people don’t have income needs in retirement,” says DJ Lucey, senior analyst at Cerulli Associates.Technology is helping bridge that gap, though, Mr Lucey says. “Some fund companies have developed technology geared towards showing preparedness for generating retirement income.”Within the LDI structure in DC, asset growth relevance becomes relative to the behaviour of the liabilities, he adds. “That is why you are seeing elements of LDI come into play in DC.”The recent market turmoil has put a dent in the savings of those who are closer to retirement.Participants invested in a 2010 target-date fund will not possibly have the time to make up the losses suffered by their portfolios. Therefore, while market specialists do not see a direct effect of the current financial crisis on the adoption of LDI techniques, they might prove more appealing in the near future.“The concept becomes more valid when people see there are risks in the financial system,” says Andy Hunt, a strategist with the client solutions business at Barclays Global Investors.Mariana Lemann is retirement reporter on Ignites, a Financial Times publication"
48;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2008-05-14T03:43:30Z;Variable annuities carry assurers’ hopes;;British life assurers, under attack from nimbler rivals, are fighting back. Their weapon: a more flexible retirement savings product that has already taken the US and Japan by storm.Life assurers hope that selling these products, known as variable annuities, will take off in the UK too and stem the tide of customers saving for retirement through rival operators, from banks to fund managers.“This is the natural space of insurance companies,” says Mark Laidlaw, finance director of Aegon UK. “It is a reminder of what insurers can do.”After taking off in the US about five years ago, VAs now have about $1,500bn (£769bn) in net assets.Over the past couple of years, US insurers MetLife, Hartford and Lincoln National have begun selling VAs in the UK, while the UK arm of Aegon, the Netherlands-based insurer, introduced a non-pension VA in 2006. But the product has had a low profile until now.With some of Britain’s biggest names, including Aegon, Standard Life and Prudential, preparing to launch VAs, the product is set to hit the mainstream.The UK versions of VAs provide customers with exposure to riskier but higher returning assets, such as equities, but with explicitly priced guarantees, either to protect their capital or provide a minimum level of income.VAs are expected to appeal to those in or approaching retirement. Facing perhaps 20-30 years as pensioners, they need their pension pots to continue to expand, but are also worried about outliving their savings or having them eroded by market movements.But the guaranteed income provided by a VA comes at a cost.Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, the independent financial adviser and broker, says the cost of the guarantees, fund management, administration and the services of an IFA, can be up to 4 per cent.“If you are getting investment growth of 7 per cent, that is a pretty big chunk being taken out,” he says.All the same, some analysts are excited about the scope for VAs. Roman Cizdyn, analyst at Oriel Securities, recently likened the development of the market to the introduction of unit-linked policies in the 1960s, which he described as “the greatest transformation of UK life assurance over recent decades”.He said in a note: “We believe we are about to see a major development in the UK that may not be of the same scale as unit linking, but is likely to introduce a fresh approach in the savings market.”If insurers can provide the guarantees for less than they charge the customer for them, and also hold on to clients’ money for longer, then the products could prove lucrative.Most important of all, the development of VAs gives insurers a chance to reassert their role in the long-term savings market.Life offices tout their ability to provide guarantees, which require complex financial management as well as their core actuarial skills to determine how long people will live.“This is what insurance companies should do, and do well, which is take risk on behalf of the individual,” says Gary Shaughnessy, managing director, retail life and pensions, at Prudential UK. “[We] have been doing this for the last 150 years.”According to Ned Cazalet, the independent life assurance analyst: “Definitely [life assurers] are saying, ‘if we do anything at all we should be there to take the sharp edges off of life for people’.“But it is also the sheer numbers of people entering the retirement zone. This is a big new market.”According to Watson Wyatt, the consultants, the market for converting invested assets, such as pension savings, into income, was worth almost £14bn ($27.2bn) in 2007. This market is expected to more than double to above £30bn a year within five years.Mark Joannes, a senior consultant at Watson Wyatt, estimates that VAs could account for 10-15 per cent of the market, or close to £5bn, within this period.The big challenge will be to sell the products effectively. VAs, with their array of guarantee options and associated charges, could prove baffling to customers and life assurers have been maligned in the past for marketing opaque and expensive products.New entrants to the market will have to overturn the current insipid level of VA sales, says John Lawson, head of pensions policy at Standard Life. “They are not exactly flying off the shelves yet.”
49;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2006-05-10T18:05:53Z;New Issues: Lottomatica in hybrid sale;;Lottomatica, the Italian lottery company, sold the largest ever sub-investment grade hybrid bond out of Europe on Wednesday and priced the deal at the tight end of its expected range with a coupon of 8.25 per cent.The bonds, which have a 60-year maturity and a 10-year call option with a coupon step-up, saw heavy demand according to bankers involved. But though it was permitted to be sold in the US, demand there was limited.The investor roadshow for the sale, which was managed by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs, did not go to the US, principally because of the surprise decision by regulators there in March to classify a Lehman Brothers hybrid as equity, which discouraged insurers from buying it.There were further developments on the regulatory stance in the US on Wednesday when Lincoln National, a US insurer, received an advance ruling on a coming hybrid issue classifying it as equity.The company is understood to be going ahead with the $500m-$1bn sale in spite of the ruling, in a sale being managed by Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.Renault, the French carmaker, priced a €500m 7-year bond at the tightest level it has ever seen. The sale, led by JPMorgan and SG CIB, priced at 39bp over mid-swaps, inside the guidance of 40-42bp.Telecom Italia is set to price a dual tranche euro and sterling issue on Thursday, according to one banker involved.The company is expected to price about €500m in eight-year bonds in the low-70s bp over mid-swaps and about £300m of 17-year bonds at gilts plus 130bps.BNP Paribas, Calyon, HSBC and Deutsche Bank are lead managers.French highway operator Cofiroute is in the market with a €750m 15-year bond deal scheduled to price on Thursday. Pricing guidance is for mid-swaps plus 70bp on strong demand, bankers said. BNP Paribas, Calyon and RBS are leading.
50;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2006-05-10T15:06:21Z;Hybrid security market regaining momentum;;The US market for the latest types of hybrid securities is again gathering steam in spite of a new regulatory ruling likely further to discourage insurance company buyers, which until recently were buying about 20 per cent of new hybrids.The willingness of issuers and bankers to launch new deals suggests strong institutional appetite even without insurers, who have steered clear of the instruments since a surprise decision by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in March made it expensive for them to own certain hybrids.The NAIC’s Securities Valuation Office, or SVO, underscored its earlier decision with an advance ruling on a new Lincoln National hybrid, unveiled by the US insurer on Tuesday.In its preliminary prospectus for the deal, the insurer said the SVO had decided it would “preliminarily designate [hybrids of the type being offered] as common equity for purposes of calculating the statutory risk-based capital requirements of US insurance companies that hold such capital securities.” Insurers have to hold more capital against common equity investments than other types.The decision echoes the SVO’s March ruling on a Lehman Brothers hybrid with similar features, which sent ripples through the market and held back what some on Wall Street had expected to be a flood of issuance.Tax authorities and most investors consider recent hybrid structures to be more like risky debt or preferred shares than common shares – an important factor in their cost-effectiveness for issuers.Rating agencies and regulators, however, recognise equity-like features in the securities - the dilemma that led insurance regulators to examine the Lehman hybrid in the first place.In spite of the ruling, Lincoln is going ahead with its $500m-$1bn hybrid issue, coordinated by Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, to help refinance its acquisition of Jefferson Pilot. The insurer recently sold a similar $275m hybrid to the retail market, partly because of uncertainty over institutional demand.That changed last week when Swiss Re, the reinsurance group, found strong demand among institutions for a $750m hybrid in spite of the participation of very few insurance companies and the absence of any guidance from the SVO.
51;LNC;Lincoln National Corp;2005-10-10T19:06:27Z;Lincoln National buys Jefferson Pilot for $7.5bn;;"Lincoln National, one of the biggest life insurers in midwestern US, has agreed to buy Jefferson Pilot Financial, its smaller southern rival, for about $7.5bn in cash and stock.Following the merger, yet to be approved by regulators and shareholders, the Lincoln Financial Group will become the fourth-largest life assurer in the US with assets of $151bn.It will offer a range of life insurance and retirement products and be a top provider of fixed and variable annuities.In addition, the company will control Delaware Investments, Lincoln’s asset management group, and
Jefferson Pilot Communications, which operates a string of television and radio stations.Analysts yesterday praised the merger and said it was a way for the two insurers – which are facing difficulties in some of their businesses due to low interest rates – to overcome the challenges of their operating environment.Tamara Kravec of Banc of America said: “It’s just what the doctor ordered. Given the challenging operating environment for life insurers, we believe this merger makes perfect sense. The products and distribution channels of both companies are and there is little overlap.”She forecast that further similar deals “could be on the way”.Under the terms of the transaction, shareholders in Jefferson Pilot will receive 1.0906 Lincoln shares or $55.96 – representing a 9 per cent premium over Jefferson’s closing price on Friday. Lincoln shareholders will control about 61 per cent of the group.The group would like to see yearly cost savings of about $180m before tax within three years.Jon Boscia, Lincoln chairman and chief executive, will head the merged group and Dennis Glass, president and chief executive of Jefferson Pilot, will serve as president and chief operating officer.Suneet Kamath, analyst with Sanford Bernstein, said: “The merger will allow the combined company to create more earnings diversity.” Standard & Poor’s and AM Best, two insurance rating agencies, yesterday placed Lincoln National on review with positive implications.In early trade, Jefferson Pilot shares rose 6.6 per cent to $54.14 while Lincoln National shares inched down 2 per cent to $49.70."
