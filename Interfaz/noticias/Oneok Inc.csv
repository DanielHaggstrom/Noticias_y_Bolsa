0;OKE;Oneok Inc;2016-12-23T21:22:59Z;Energy poised to be year’s big winner in turnround;Dow Jones fails to hit 20,000 before Christmas;What a difference a year makes. Having ended 2015 as the worst performing sector on the S&P 500, energy stocks are on track to become this year’s biggest winners as this month’s rally in crude prices further extended the sector’s gains.Despite falling 0.2 per cent on Friday, the S&P 500 energy index is still up more than 25 per cent this year, making it the top gainer among the 10 main sectors tracked on the S&P.The index has jumped 12 per cent since early November after it appeared increasingly likely that Opec would be able to reach an agreement to cut oil production.News this month that the cartel had managed to persuade major non-Opec oil producers to get on board with the output curbs has only added to the attractiveness of the sector’s once beaten-down stocks.Indeed, four of the 10 best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 this year hail from the energy sector, with oil and gas producer Oneok up 138 per cent and Texas-based Spectra Energy clocking in a near-75 per cent rise.Oil and gas support services provider Quanta Services and Chesapeake Energy were the other big movers, rising 72 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively.The strong run is expected to continue. After two years of slumping sales and profits, analysts say they expect the sector to finally return to earnings growth in 2017.Factset is projecting a 477.3 per cent jump in earnings per share for the sector in the second quarter and a 183.4 per cent and a 149 per cent rise in EPS for the third and fourth quarter.The forecasts dovetail with recent comments made by the big energy companies, in which they signalled that the worst of the industry’s slump could be over.“Corporate profits look poised to increase in 2017 and 2018 due in part to easing bank lending standards, a rebound in small business optimism, tax cuts and energy sector recovery,” said Citi in a note earlier this week.Elsewhere, Weight Watchers gained for a fifth straight session. The weight-loss company’s shares had surged by as much as 18 per cent on Thursday after it announced that Oprah Winfrey, its celebrity spokeswoman, had lost 40 pounds using its programme and would share her personal experience in a new marketing campaign.Although the stock later pared its gains to close up 5.3 per cent, it tacked on another 8.8 per cent on Friday, taking its total gains this week to more than 19 per cent.Red Hat, the developer of open-source software, bounced back to trade 3.4 per cent higher on Friday, a day after suffering its biggest sell-off in 10 years.The stock fell 13.9 per cent on Thursday after the company reported disappointing revenues and said that its chief financial officer was leaving.In the wider market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average failed to hit 20,000 before Christmas. Trading thinned out ahead of the holiday and there was little news on the deck to jolt the gauge out of its lethargy on Friday. It ended the day 0.1 per cent higher at 19,933.81.The S&P 500 gained 0.1 per cent to 2,263.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 per cent to 5,462.69.
1;OKE;Oneok Inc;2015-06-22T16:05:52Z;M&A activity kicks off week driving S&P 500 towards record;Energy and healthcare sectors buoyed by M&A;Merger and acquisition activity dominated the start of the week for US equities, with the prospect of deals propelling the S&P 500 index within sight of a record high.Shares of US oil and gas storage companies were in focus after pipeline operator Energy Transfer Equity confirmed that it had made a $48bn unsolicited offer for rival Williams Companies.Williams, which operates large-scale natural gas infrastructure in the US, rejected the $64-a-share, all-stock offer, saying it significantly undervalued the company. But investors appeared to think a deal could get done, with shares in Williams surging 26 per cent to an all-time high of $60.90.Speculation that a possible deal between ETE and Williams could spark a wave of consolidation in the oil and gas pipeline industry, boosted share prices for other companies in the sector.Spectra Energy, a large pipeline operator, gained 1 per cent to $33.05, giving the company a valuation of more than $22bn. Oneok, a company that owns one of the country’s premier natural gas liquids systems, jumped 4 per cent to $40.79.Merger and acquisition activities were not limited to the energy sector.Health insurer Cigna climbed 5 per cent to $162.60 on hopes that rival Anthem could sweeten its $184-a-share bid for the company. Although Cigna has rejected the offer, which values the business at roughly $53bn, the company said it was open to a deal “under the right circumstances”.Humana, the smallest of the main insurers, which has put itself up for sale in an auction that could fetch roughly $30bn, fell 6 per cent to $189.98 on reports that Aetna, the industry’s number three player, has made an approach.Aetna shares were up 3 per cent at $128.07 while UnitedHealth Group, the market leader, remained unchanged at $120.25.Fitbit continued to muscle its way higher. The maker of wearable fitness tracking devices extended its gains on its third day of trading, jumping 14 per cent to $37.06 after surging more than 50 per cent on its market debut last Thursday. The San Francisco-based company, along with selling stockholders, sold 36.6m shares in an initial public offering at $20 apiece last week.Netflix, this year’s best performing stock on the S&P 500, was poised to close at a fresh high after analysts at BTIG raised its price target on the stock. Analyst Richard Greenfield boosted his price target on the stock from $600 to $950, the highest among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The stock rose 3 per cent to $675, putting it on track for its best close ever.Elsewhere, the broader US equity market extended its bullish run from last week.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 2,122.85, putting the benchmark US index closer to the record intraday high of 2,134.72 reached in May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.6 per cent higher at 18,119.78, while the technology heavy Nasdaq Composite hit another all-time high after advancing 0.7 per cent to 5,153.97.
2;OKE;Oneok Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
