0;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Chipmakers slide on Huawei DoJ investigation report;;The chips are down for semiconductor makers on Wednesday after a media report said the US Department of Justice is investigating whether China’s Huawei Technologies has violated sanctions related to Iran.The report from the Wall Street Journal sent shares in Nvidia 3 per cent lower, while Advanced Micro Devices shed 3.4 per cent. Xilinx and Qualcomm were both down about 0.5 per cent apiece.The wider Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.7 per cent, marking its fifth straight day of decline. The index has dropped more than 9 per cent over the past week.Huawei is one of the world’s largest smartphone makers alongside Apple and Samsung, and the company sources some of its components from US chipmakers.The Chinese group declined to comment directly on whether it was under investigation. It said in a statement: “Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including the applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU.”The report of the probe comes just a week after the US hit Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE with a denial of export privileges over violation of US export laws to North Korea and Iran. A denial of export privileges would, among other things, prohibit ZTE from sourcing US components, on which it is highly dependent for its phones and other products.
1;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2017-11-09T19:45:49Z;Semiconductors poised for worst day since June;;Semiconductors were in investors’ line of fire on Thursday, with the sector poised for its worst day in nearly five months and the sell-off dragging the broader technology sector lower.The S&P semiconductor and semiconductor equipment index fell 2.8 per cent — leaving it on track for its biggest one-day decline since June 9. The decline weighed on the wider technology sector, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.8 per cent for the day.Advanced Micro Devices led the decline among chipmakers, falling 5 per cent to $11.15. The slide came after Intel confirmed late on Wednesday that it had poached Raja Koduri, head of AMD’s fast growing graphic chips unit Radeon Technologies — to head up its newly formed core and visual computing group. Interestingly, Mr Koduri’s jump also comes after Intel recently teamed up with AMD to build chips in a move that was perceived as taking on rival Nvidia.Mr Koduri announced his departure from AMD on Tuesday, raising questions about the growth prospects at Radeon and sparking chatter that the move could boost Intel’s competitiveness in the graphic chips business at the expense of Nvidia and AMD.However, Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities disagrees. He notes that while Mr Koduri is a “rock star” in the world of graphics processing chips and his departure from AMD is a “strategic loss” for the company, it may not provide enough of a boost for Intel, which is in its”third or fourth serious effort in graphics”.“The Intel move in our view is a no-win situation for him as it is way too late in the game for him to change things and innovate,” said Mr Mosesmann.Still that did not prevent shares in semiconductors from lurching lower. Nvidia, which is slated to report results after the bell, saw its shares down 3.4 per cent to $202.02, Xilinx slid 3.5 per cent to $71.04, KLA-Tencor declined 4.3 per cent to $102.47 while Analog Devices shed 3.9 per cent to $88.45.Despite Thursday’s decline, the S&P 500 semiconductor and equipment index is up 38 per cent so far this year helping technology lead the broader benchmark index with a 36 per cent year-to-date gain.
2;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2017-10-26T01:45:10Z;Semiconductors/Bitcoin: shovelling chips;Chip investors enthused about cryptocurrencies should demand more detailed information;"Supplying picks and shovels is supposed to be a safer way of profiting from a gold rush. Does the same apply to cryptocurrency mining? For months now, as Bitcoin has surged to new highs, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has surged along with it. “Miners” need high-powered chips and processors for the computations which underpin cryptocurrencies.Those who think this is all a bubble or one of the other epithets flung by Wall Street luminaries in the last few weeks should also worry about the price of chip stocks. The Sox has risen almost 40 per cent this year; it is only 10 per cent away from its March 2000 peak.Even chip investors enthused about cryptocurrencies should be concerned about the information gap. A favourite question from analysts during this earnings season is “do you make any revenues from cryptocurrency?” — which seems a little late. The spread of answers ranges from acknowledgment that it has become significant to denial of any detail.On Wednesday United Microelectronics, the Taiwanese semiconductor, was in the latter camp, citing customer confidentiality. Xilinx, the US chipmaker, acknowledged that it had been maybe “too elliptical” in pointing to growth in its consumer division without flagging the contribution to that line from miners.Nobody seems willing to predict the future effect. Mark Liu, chief executive of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, was good enough to divulge the precise impact from cryptocurrencies, $350m-$400m of revenues in the quarter, which is about 5 per cent of the total. He said he could not predict sustainability “but we don’t see it drop either”.AMD, though, saw its stock tumble 13 per cent on Wednesday after it offered weak fourth-quarter guidance. One headwind idenitified by the chipmaker: expected weaker demand from miners.By now, this is too big to ignore and more data needs to be provided next quarter. It may be that the Sox finally overtakes its 2000 peak, only to be undone by the bursting of another bubble.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Will chip stocks blow up with Bitcoin?"
3;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2016-04-28T20:52:32Z;Xilinx slides on downbeat sales outlook;But S&P 500 tech sector under pressure as US stocks fall;Investors soured on shares in US chipmaker Xilinx after the company issued downbeat sales outlook for its current quarter.Shares in California-based Xilinx fell 8.7 per cent to $43.23 after the company said it expected sales to be “approximately flat sequentially”, which would put its revenue forecast at about $571m in the June quarter.The news came alongside better than expected fiscal fourth-quarter results.Xilinx said profits climbed to $145m, or 54 cents a share, from $135m, or 50 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose 1 per cent to $571m. Analysts had forecast earnings of 52 cents a share on sales of $566m.The semiconductor industry has seen a wave of consolidation and earlier this year some analysts had speculated that Xilinx could become an acquisition target after the company introduced a “change of control” clause for a handful of top executives, which offers financial protection if their contracts are ended “without cause”.With Thursday’s sell-off, Xilinx shares are off 8 per cent so far this year.Shares in Facebook bucked the otherwise downward trend for tech stocks as the group reported net profits had jumped to $1.5bn in the first quarter from $512m in the same three-month period in 2015.Sales climbed 51.9 per cent to $5.4bn compared with estimates of $5.3bn. Adjusted profits, which exclude certain items, of 77 cents a share handily beat expectations of 63 cents a share.The number of people who actively use the platform each month rose to 1.65bn, representing a 15 per cent year-on-year increase. Analysts forecast 1.62bn.The world’s biggest social network benefited from a 56.8 per cent year-on-year jump in advertising sales.It has also been successful in selling mobile ads, with mobile advertising accounting for 82 per cent of ad sales from 73 per cent in the first quarter of 2015.Facebook’s shares rose 7.2 per cent to $116.73, bringing the California-based company’s market value to $334bn. The shares are up 45 per cent over the past 12 months.At the close of trade, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite had fallen 1.2 per cent to 4,805.3. The broader S&P 500 shrunk 0.9 per cent to 2,075.8, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 1.2 per cent to 17,830.8.Elsewhere, St Jude Medical, a maker of devices for the heart-care industry, surged by 25.5 per cent to $77.78 after Abbott Laboratories said it agreed to buy the group for $25bn.The tie-up is the first mega deal in the healthcare sector and breaks a three-month lull after a busy year for merger and acquisition activity. Abbott’s shares were down 7.8 per cent to $40.42.DreamWorks Animation was also lifted by M&A. The company’s shares rallied by 24.1 per cent to $39.95 after Comcast said it would buy the group for $3.8bn. Comcast’s shares were 0.2 per cent lower at $61.15.The pact will combine one of Hollywood’s biggest animation studios with the parent company of Universal Studios.Meanwhile, Symantec shares fell 6.9 per cent to $16.86 after the cyber security company cut its quarterly guidance and said chief executive Michael Brown was stepping down.
4;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2016-03-07T08:35:48Z;Shares in China’s ZTE suspended amid US probe;US looking into whether Chinese telecoms equipment maker violated controls on exports to Iran;Trading of shares in ZTE was suspended in Hong Kong and Shenzhen on Monday after news of a US investigation into whether China’s second-largest telecommunications equipment maker violated US controls on exports to Iran.ZTE said it was co-operating with the relevant US authorities. Reuters reported at the weekend that the US Commerce Department was set to place export restrictions on the company. ZTE sells 8-10 per cent of the world’s telecoms equipment, according to Nomura, and counts Iran as a customer.“ZTE has been working with relevant US government departments on investigations, maintaining constant communication with relevant departments and is committed to fully address and resolve any concerns,” it said in a statement.The company added that it would continue with normal operations while it conducted its own internal assessments.“As a responsible business, ZTE strives to ensure all operational activities adhere to international trade practices and the laws and regulations of host countries,” it said.The company on Monday suspended trading in its shares, according to statements to the Hong Kong and Shenzhen stock exchanges, but did not explain why.ZTE’s Hong Kong-listed shares closed up 3.5 per cent on Friday, but are down 20 per cent so far this year.Leping Huang, telecoms and technology analyst at Nomura in Hong Kong, said official notice from the US Department of Commerce, expected on Tuesday, should make clear the scope of the restrictions.Nomura does not expect any impact on product sales in the US, but says restrictions would probably require any company shipping US-made parts or equipment to ZTE to first obtain a licence from the Commerce Department.In an analyst note, Nomura estimated that 10-15 per cent of the components used in ZTE’s telecom equipment and smartphones were supplied by US-based vendors as of last year. It said major suppliers include Qualcomm, which supplies smartphone chips, and Xilinx and Altera for base station chips.A person briefed by ZTE on the situation said the company does not foresee an immediate impact on production because it has just finished procurement of US parts for 2016. However, if restrictions remain in place over the long term, ZTE may experience some supply-chain disruption.This is not the first time the company has run into trouble with US authorities. In 2012 ZTE and Huawei, its larger domestic competitor, were informally blocked from selling telecoms infrastructure in the US and barred from investing in US companies after the House Intelligence Committee accused both of spying on behalf of Chinese authorities.Both companies have long rejected the spying accusations.While the 2012 restrictions meant that ZTE cannot sell its telecoms equipment in the country, they did not affect the company’s smartphone business. In the four years since, ZTE has quietly grown into the third-largest seller of Android smartphones in the US.
5;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2016-01-21T22:02:53Z;Xilinx shines among semiconductor stocks;Crude oil rally propels S&P 500 energy index higher;Investors sweetened on shares of programmable chipmaker Xilinx after the company reported better than expected third-quarter sales and received an upgrade from analysts at BMO.Shares in Xilinx, which makes programmable logic chips that are used in communications infrastructure, automobiles and industrials, jumped 8.59 per cent to $46.78 by the close after BMO said the company could be an acquisition target.The San Jose, California-based company reported profits of $130.8m or 49 cents a share, compared with $168.5m or 62 cents a share in the year ago period. Sales slid 4.6 per cent to $566.2m. Analysts had forecast earnings of 49 cents a share, on sales of $554.6m.Alongside its results, Xilinx also indicated a change in control provision — which allows for some protections for employees in the event of a change in ownership — for its key executives, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.“We believe the change in control provision significantly raises the probability of Xilinx being acquired by another company,” said Ambrish Srivastava, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “The last time we saw such a provision in our coverage was by Xilinx’s rival Altera, which ended up getting acquired by Intel, for a significant premium.”He noted that Qualcomm and Tsinghua Holdings could be potential acquirers but that Qualcomm would be the more likely buyer and that such a deal could help it diversify away from handsets.The semiconductor industry has seen a wave of consolidation as companies try to boost growth and cut costs in the wake of weaker PC demand and increasing competition.Xilinx was upgraded to “outperform” from “market perform” by BMO Capital which raised the price target on the stock to $57 from $44. Xilinx shares advanced 9 per cent last year.Union Pacific fell 3.55 per cent to $71.00, after the railroad operator reported fourth-quarter results that missed analysts forecasts amid weakening freight demand.Net income fell to $1.1bn or $1.31 a share, compared with $1.4bn or $1.61 a share in the year ago period. Sales fell 15 per cent to $5.2bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.43 a share, on sales of $5.4bn.Shares in FireEye, which sells cyber security products, climbed after the company said it would pay $200m in cash to acquire iSight Partners. “This acquisition extends FireEye’s intelligence lead with an offering no one else in the industry can match,” chief executive David DeWalt said. By the close its shares were off 0.54 per cent at $14.79.A rally in crude prices sent the S&P 500 energy index 2.8 per cent higher.Kinder Morgan shares jumped 15.57 per cent to $13.88, even as the company said it had swung to a loss in the fourth quarter.Shares in Southwestern Energy jumped 19.24 per cent to $8.80, while Transocean shares climbed 7.05 per cent to $9.72.The rally in energy stocks helped US markets rebound on Thursday, following a tumultuous session the previous day, although they lost some of their gains in later trading.The S&P 500 was up 0.52 per cent to 1,868.99, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.74 per cent higher to 15,882.68. The Nasdaq Composite was flat at 4,472.06.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
6;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2016-01-21T18:30:14Z;Xilinx shares jump on consolidation hopes;;More consolidation in the semiconductor industry?A couple of analysts reckon so after US chipmaker Xilinx introduced a ‘change of control’ clause for a handful of top executives which offers financial protection if their contracts are ended “without cause.”BMO Capital Markets’ analysts speculated the move suggests the company, which makes programmable logic chips that are used in communications infrastructure, automobiles and by industrial companies, may prove an acquisition target in the quickly consolidating chipmaking sector, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.“We believe the change in control provision significantly raises the probability of Xilinx being acquired by another company,” said Ambrish Srivastava, an analyst at BMO. “The last time we saw such a provision in our coverage was by Xilinx’s rival Altera, which ended up getting acquired by Intel, for a significant premium.” That view was echoed by analysts at FBR.Qualcomm and Tsinghua Holdings could be potential acquirers, Mr Srivastava said, adding Qualcomm is the more likely buyer of the two as a deal could help it diversify away from handsets.The semiconductor industry is consolidating as a shrinking PC industry forces companies to cut costs and find new demand for chips. Those that are exposed to Apple’s supply chain have also been hurt because of concerns over weakening demand for iPhones.BMO Capital upgraded Xilinx to “outperform” from “market perform,” raising the price target on the stock to $57 from $44.The change of control provision came alongside better than expected third-quarter sales from Xilinx. Shares in Xilinx, which advanced 8.5 per cent last year, jumped 10 per cent to $47.32 in early afternoon trading in New York.
7;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2014-07-20T12:57:48Z;Huawei backs British tech company XMOS;;Huawei has made its first equity investment in a British technology company as the Chinese networking and telecommunications group looks to grow its operations in the UK while facing hostility in other markets around the world.The Chinese company is among a group of corporate investors that includes Bosch, the German industrial supplier, and Xilinx, an American technology maker, which has taken a “strategic” stake in XMOS, a Bristol-based semiconductor company.The trio have joined in a $26m funding round in the chip designer. People familiar with the deal said the investment values XMOS at over $100m. The company declined to comment.One person familiar with the Chinese group said it has created a team dedicated to seeking similar investment opportunities with the aim of making two such deals a year in Europe.Huawei’s expansion plans have often been met with suspicion around the world. In October 2012, a US congressional report branded Huawei and ZTE, its smaller Chinese peer, a threat to national security.Huawei has struggled to gain a greater foothold in some countries because of concerns over the military background of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, a former People’s Liberation Army officer. Authorities in India have voiced concerns while it has been blocked from bidding on some contracts in Germany and Australia.Huawei has always maintained it is independent from the Chinese government.Britain has provided a warmer welcome. In 2012, David Cameron, prime minister, said that Huawei’s commitment to invest £1.3bn into its operations in the country proved that the UK is “open for business”.Huawei has previously bought two European companies – CIP Technologies in the UK in 2012 and Belgium’s Caliopa in 2013 – though financial terms for those deals were not released.This year, the company said it will invest £10m in UK university research and has plans to open a research and development centre in Bristol.XMOS, a semiconductor designer founded in 2005, has particular expertise in high-performance chips used for products in the “internet of things”, such as personal electronics and home appliances which are embedded with sensors able to connect to the internet.Nigel Toon, XMOS chief executive, said that the new investment would allow it to establish strong ties with the likes of Huawei and Bosch, groups that are also likely to be large customers in the future.“This is a massive opportunity to have close contact with these companies and build a big business,” said Mr Toon.Steven Chu, chief strategy officer and vice-president at Huawei’s silicon division, said: “We have a very high regard for the team at XMOS and will be working closely with them on a number of exciting new projects.”
8;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2014-06-02T21:16:14Z;Gold miners under pressure from price falls;;Gold mining stocks remained under pressure as the precious metal tumbled for a fifth consecutive day, touching its lowest level since February.Strategists with several investment banks said they expected gold prices to remain weak, despite a still depressed 10-year Treasury yield.Shares of Newmont Mining fell 1.35 per cent to $22.58 while Goldcorp declined 2 per cent to $22.90 and Barrick Gold slipped 1.30 per cent to $15.90.Gold prices were “intent on trading lower but in a very orderly fashion”, UBS strategist Edel Tully said.“There’s no rush from physical buyers here, rather they’re happy to wait for lower levels in what is seasonally a quiet time for physical demand,” Ms Tully added.Compounding the move in gold were conflicting reports on manufacturing activity in the US this May.Figures from the Institute for Supply Management at first showed an unexpected decline in growth – before the group was forced to issue a correction.The final report indicated manufacturing activity that was nearly in line with Wall Street expectations, the latest is a stream of data indicative of a firming US economy.Shares of semiconductor maker Broadcom bounced higher after the company said it wanted to sell or wind down its cellular baseband chip business.The move reflected rival Qualcomm’s dominance in the sector.While Qualcomm maintains a lead over rivals in areas such as its 4G LTE mobile broadband chips and has increased its market share, Broadcom’s baseband modem share has shrunk.Broadcom said it had engaged investment bank JPMorgan, sending its shares 9.32 per cent higher to $34.84.Qualcomm shares inched less than 1 per cent higher to $80.48.Allergan shares continued to rise after activist investor Bill Ackman filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission seeking a special meeting of Allergan shareholders.Mr Ackman, who is Allergan’s largest investor and a supporter of a $53bn takeover of the company by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, intends to remove some of Allergan’s board directors and force the board to begin discussions with Valeant.Shares of Allergan climbed 2.86 per cent to $172.25, a new record high, while Valeant rose 2.26 per cent to $134.17.Semiconductor company Xilinx fell 1.26 per cent to $46.37 after Goldman Sachs dimmed its view on the industry, warning that orders for communication equipment could decline in the second half of the year.Overall, US equity markets continued a slow march higher after a correction to the monthly ISM manufacturing report.The survey of American manufacturing in May starts a busy week for US economic data that ends with the monthly jobs tally.Investors and economists have hoped that reports from May will offer a clearer snapshot of the US economy than April when a number of indicators, including the jobs tally, were buoyed by the post-winter rebound.The S&P 500 nudged slightly up to 1,924.97 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched higher to 16,743.63. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down a touch, to 4,237.20.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
9;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
10;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2011-10-03T16:43:58Z;Semiconductors’ bell;Revenue expectations are trimmed;In the debate about the world economy’s degree of shabbiness (utterly dreadful or just dreary?), any firm data points are welcome. Semiconductor companies, therefore, may provide some much-needed help. Processors and memory chips go mostly into computers, but other flavours of semiconductors are used all across the global economy. For example, analysis by MKM Partners finds that semiconductor company revenues have a very high long-term correlation with America’s gross domestic product. In addition, semi revenues have accounted for a stable portion of global output (about half a per cent) for the last 15 years, if the 2000 technology bubble is excluded.Unfortunately, recent news from the semiconductor industry has been pretty bad. In September, five big companies that sell to a variety of global industries – Texas Instruments, Freescale, Altera, Xilinx, Cavium and Integrated Device Technology – pre-announced cuts to revenue expectations for the upcoming quarter. Most of the five expect their top lines to decline in a range from about mid-single digits to 10 per cent. Memory-chip maker Micron met sales targets but weak pricing pinched margins.Investors have responded by selling semiconductor company shares. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index hit its highest level since 2007 in February. Since then it has come down by more than a quarter, while the broader market has dropped 15 per cent.Nor might this underperformance be at an end. Analysts’ revenue expectations for the upcoming quarter have been trimmed, thanks to the pre-announcements. But the numbers for many of the biggest companies for this year and next still imply fairly solid growth – and that is on top of a strong base set last year. MKM’s analysis suggests that 2012 and 2013 industry forecasts may too high by as much as one fifth. Barring a dramatic change in fortunes, semiconductor stocks may continue to hold a mirror to a global economy that is getting uglier.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
11;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2011-03-29T01:47:28Z;Prosecutors to focus on Galleon notebooks;Focus switches to trading in Xilinx;Prosecutors are fighting to question a former trader at Galleon Group over statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he saw notebooks being removed by the brother of Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of the hedge fund group on trial on insider trading charges.Prosecutors say government witness Adam Smith will testify that the notebooks are similar to ones Raj Rajaratnam used to record notes from conversations he had with company insiders. But they are sparring with defence lawyers over what questions can be posed to Mr Smith about the statements he gave to the FBI about the removal of notebooks by Rengan Rajaratnam from Galleon’s office on the day of his brother’s arrest.The defence has objected on the grounds that the government has not charged Mr Rajaratnam or his brother with obstruction charges. Rengan Rajaratnam is not facing any charges but prosecutors have called him an unindicted co-conspirator. His brother has also denied wrongdoing.Raj Rajaratnam’s lawyer argued that the removal of documents was at the instruction of a lawyer and the documents related to Mr Rajaratnam’s charitable donations and property holdings, which were used by the court in considering his bail.The defence submitted to the court a copy of Mr Smith’s interview with the FBI in which he said Mr Rajaratnam was emotional when he addressed Galleon staff the Monday after his October 2009 arrest, calling himself “a fighter”.According to FBI interview notes, Mr Smith said he met with Rengan Rajaratnam at his request at a Starbucks in midtown Manhattan, where Rengan told him that someone mentioned that he had left Galleon with “little black books” of information and he wanted to confirm that Mr Smith would not discuss them.Mr Smith also said that Rengan sought to have Mr Smith agree that if someone mentioned ‘Kamal’, it was in reference to an investment banking analyst, not Kamal Ahmed, a Morgan Stanley investment banker, who prosecutors allege tipped Mr Smith about several technology deals.During a subsequent meeting at the bar of a sushi restaurant in Manhattan, Rengan Rajaratnam sought to establish an alternative explanation about why McKinsey partner Anil Kumar had opened a Swiss bank account for payments he received from Galleon, according to the FBI notes.In December 2010, according to the FBI notes, Mr Smith attended a dinner with an investor who had spoken with Raj Rajaratnam. The investor allegedly said Mr Rajaratnam “sensed he was going to lose the case and end up appealing,” according to the notes.The judge said he would also rule on Tuesday on whether the defence could play a wiretap recording of a conversation between Mr Smith and Ian Horowitz, a Galleon trader, in which Mr Horowitz avoided any admission of insider trading.As the fourth week of the trial got under way, prosecutors focused on new stocks in the trial.An investor relations official from Xilinx, a computer chipmaker, testified about the release of confidential information.The official’s testimony was used by prosecutors to set up the allegation that Kris Chellam, a former Xilinx executive, passed secret information about Xilinx quarterly earnings guidance to Mr Rajaratnam.After leaving Xilinx in early 2007, Mr Chellam joined Galleon. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing, however prosecutors have called him a co-conspirator too.Rick Muscha of Xilinx testified that in October 2006, the company projected revenues to grow 2-5 per cent in the following quarter, to between $476m and $490m. The company said it would issue updated guidance to investors on December 7 2006.Internal Xilinx documents showed the company’s outlook turned negative soon after that initial projection. On December 4, three days before the public update, the chief executive held a staff meeting at which Mr Chellam was present where there was a discussion about revenue expectations being lowered to a range of $455m to $470mAfter the market closed on December 7, the company issued a warning about expectations of a revenue decline of 2-5 per cent in the quarter, rather than the increase which had been projected. The following day Xilinx stock fell nearly 10 per cent. Lawyers for the government and those for Mr Rajaratnam both offered analyst reports to support their arguments. Defence lawyers presented comments from four industry analysts who had predicted weaker earnings or downward pressure on the company.Prosecutor Jonathan Streeter, however, introduced four analyst reports issued in the same three-month period. These reports anticipated Xilinx would meet or exceed its revenue targets.
12;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2011-03-02T21:36:48Z;US stocks rebound in late trading;;"Shares in Yahoo rose following unconfirmed reports that the internet search company was in talks to sell or trade its stake in Yahoo Japan, while the broad market rebounded from mid-session losses to close modestly firmer.Yahoo might be looking to exchange its 35 per cent stake in Yahoo Japan and give the majority owner Softbank a stake in the US company, according to a report in the Financial Times citing people familiar with the discussions.Any negotiations however, according to sources, were in the formative stages and the talks could still go nowhere. Yahoo rose 3.3 per cent to $16.63, one of the biggest gainers on the S&P 500.Softbank, which holds a 41 per cent stake in Yahoo Japan, on Wednesday said there was “no truth” to the media reports. Yahoo declined to comment.Other technology stocks were also in focus. Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by sales after Intel, gained 3.3 per cent to $36.14 as JPMorgan raised its recommendation on the shares to “overweight” from “neutral”.Another semiconductor company, Xilinx, rallied 5.6 per cent to $34.54 while Altera gained 3 per cent to $42.46. The Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 1.4 per cent while the S&P technology index rose 0.5 per cent, the strongest gainer along with energy of all 10 major S&P indices.That helped stem losses on the S&P 500, which closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,308.44, trimming some of its 1.6 per cent loss in the previous session.The index is still off 2.6 per cent from its mid-February high, because of fears that sustained high oil prices due to political instability in north Africa and the Middle East may
hamper economic growth.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.1 per cent to 12,066.80 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4 per cent to 2,748.07.Sentiment was lifted somewhat by the ADP national employment report which suggested that job creation had been strong in February. The report estimated that private non-farm payroll employment had risen by 217,000 last month, ahead of the 180,000 expected by economists.This was a positive leading indicator for the official non-farm payroll figures which will come out on Friday, although the ADP number is not always a successful predictor of these widely watched numbers.“ADP has not exactly covered itself in glory recently in terms of accuracy versus the government data, so we don’t look for any change to the published median forecast of 193,000 for total non-farm payrolls and 200,000 for private payrolls,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Worries over oil prices, which edged up in the session, continued to weigh on sentiment in the wider markets.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in the previous session that higher oil prices were “a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability”.Some economists appeared more worried about the inflationary risk of the higher oil price than the chance of it damaging growth. “I think fears are overblown of a sharp oil-related downturn in global growth. I worry more about the inflationary consequences,” said Joachim Fels, co-head of Morgan Stanley’s global economics team.Las Vegas Sands, the casino resort company which fell 6.3 per cent in the previous session after announcing in its annual report that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, bounced back slightly, rising 1.2 per cent to $44.24.Some analysts suggested that this might be an opportunity to buy the stock. “We believe this news will have limited fallout given the huge successes that LVS has had in Macau and Singapore and its ability to execute on a true integrated resort,” Citigroup said.Costco Wholesale reported a 16 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings but this failed to impress investors. The stock fell 2.5 per cent to $71.76.Elsewhere in the sector, BJ’s Wholesale Club, a membership-only warehouse retail store, reported an 81 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profits on charges related to store closures. But the company also reported that same-store sales had risen by 5.5 per cent. Its shares rose 2.8 per cent to $49.66.Apple was in focus as it unveiled the second edition of the iPad. Shares rose 0.8 per cent to $352.12."
13;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2011-01-22T00:31:46Z;Morgan Stanley named in Galleon case;;A Morgan Stanley banker allegedly leaked details of a takeover deal, which was ultimately passed to Galleon Group co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, prosecutors say.The new allegation, which was revealed in a letter sent to Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyer, is the first time the government has identified Morgan Stanley in connection with the Galleon probe.Prosecutors said the banker tipped the details of Advanced Micro Devices plan to buy ATI Technologies to someone, who then shared the information with Mr Rajaratnam. The names of the banker and intermediary were redacted.“We have placed the banker on leave and are fully co-operating with the government’s investigation,” said Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley.Federal prosecutors also announced new charges against Mr Rajartnam on Friday, expanding the number of companies that he allegedly traded on based on inside information.According to the indictment, Mr Rajaratnam provided an unnamed co-conspirator with inside information about Goldman Sachs in October 2008. The previous month Warren Buffett agreed to make a $5bn investment in the bank.The superseding indictment released on Friday by the office of the US Attorney in Manhattan also named Integrated Circuit Systems, Xilinx, Vishay Intertechnology and Spansion.A spokesman for Mr Rajaratnam declined to comment on the indictment. In court papers his lawyers asked a judge to deny a separate government request to subpoena Galleon for information about other stocks.In the subpoena, prosecutors are seeking information from Galleon concerning trading in Procter & Gamble, as well as compensation information about Mr Rajaratnam and three other Galleon employeesThe new allegations come weeks before Mr Rajaratnam’s trial is scheduled to begin on February 28. They follow a guilty plea this week by Danielle Chiesi, a former Bear Stearns hedge fund trader who prosecutors allege was a key co-conspirator in the insider trading scheme. Ms Chiesi is not co-operating with the government, her lawyer said. With Ms Chiesi’s case resolved, lawyers say it allows the government to focus squarely on Mr Rajaratnam’s trial.“The government’s view now becomes we’re going at him with all guns blazing,” said Jacob Frankel, a defence lawyer. “What started out as simply a large and significant investigation really has spawned and anyone identified as a tipper or potential tippee” could be charged, he said.It’s not clear whether Mr Rajaratnam will seek to postpone the trial date to deal with the new allegations, although lawyers say it is likely.
14;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2010-12-10T23:38:38Z;Equity X factor often spells exasperation;X doesn't often mark the spot;Investors should be wary when companies show more flair for marketing their shares than their products. In his 1989 bestseller One Up on Wall Street, investing legend Peter Lynch warns that “a flashy name in a mediocre company attracts investors and gives them a false sense of security”, and he specifically cautions against buying stocks that have an x in their name.Though I am inclined to give a man who generated average annual returns of 29 per cent for Magellan, the world’s largest mutual fund, the benefit of the doubt, Mr Lynch’s acolytes have no way of knowing whether his warning was the investing equivalent of an old wives’ tale. Until now, that is.There are 109 stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index, among the broadest measures of US equities, that either begin or end with an x, and a few that do both. One obvious measure of how speculative such “x stocks” are is their price-to-earnings ratios but, in the first hint that Mr Lynch was on to something, only 49 of them made a profit in the past year. A way around this is to aggregate the market value and net earnings of the entire group. The results are not pretty. “X Inc” trades at a steep 29 times trailing earnings versus 18 for the entire index. On price-to- book, a measure that cannot be negative, the average “x stock” trades at 4.9 times, nearly, more than double the index. They are also twice as volatile on average.Unsurprisingly, the list is packed with futuristic-sounding names like GigOptix, Cytrix, Keryx Biopharma, Affymetrix and Oncogenex that offer technological promise but scant profits. Some that are profitable like Netflix must keep growing rapidly to justify current multiples. Partially making up for this are some large, profitable companies in the relatively dowdy logistics and retail industries such as FedEx, CSX and TJX. And then there are those like Idexx and Xilinx that break the stereotype by adding a gratuitous second x while sporting pedestrian valuations. The company that blazed the trail for double-x stocks was Xerox, a blue-chip that appreciated by 5,000 per cent during the 1960s after changing its name from Haloid. Inventing the photocopier probably helped too.Still, an x can often spell even worse trouble than a frothy valuation. A disproportionate number of “x stocks” have been embroiled in scandal, with Canada’s Bre-X being perhaps the largest. The company was on the verge of being bought by Freeport-McMoRan after supposedly discovering the world’s largest gold mine in Indonesia. When it emerged that ore samples had been infused with jewellery shavings, Bre-X’s lead geologist became the fall guy – literally – plunging to his death from a company helicopter.Another “x stock,” the futuristic-sounding YBM Magnex, lured investors with purportedly surging industrial magnet sales. After being valued at $1bn in 1998, it was exposed as a money-laundering front for Russia’s leading mafia kingpin.Weirdest of all was Solv-Ex. The company, which claimed to have developed a novel way to extract Canadian oil sands, so impressed British fund manager Peter Young that he set up unauthorised offshore accounts to magnify his exposure to the firm. When it emerged that its plant and technology were a sham, it cost his employer Morgan Grenfell an estimated £400m. Mr Young became a tabloid sensation by coming to court in a dress, pleading insanity.One does not have to be a Scrabble star to grasp how rare the letter x is in the English language – Samuel Morse did so when developing his code – so modern-day telegraph operators would surely notice that listed companies with an x in their name show up about 17 times more than common words.Lynch retired a decade before the dotcom bubble burst. It would have been interesting to see how he steered the billions at his disposal when confronted with glamour stocks such as Pets.com. Retiring in the prime of his career, he avoided the dilemma of ignoring his instincts or facing outflows to rivals claiming he “just didn’t get it”. His seemingly throwaway comment about x stocks is yet more evidence that he most certainly did.
15;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2009-07-16T20:40:46Z;US stocks rise in choppy trade;;"US stocks rose close to their highs for the year on Thursday after a late rally pulled the markets out of a range following a choppy morning.The afternoon’s gains were fuelled in part by words from prominently bearish economist Nouriel Roubini that the recession would end this year.That helped overcome early nervousness about the ramifications of a possible bankruptcy by CIT Group, the commercial lender.CIT, which is struggling to fund itself, said there was no “appreciable likelihood” of a government bail-out, leaving the company facing a bankruptcy filing.The shares collapsed 75 per cent to 41 cents, and the effects were felt on the rest of the market.“We might not see the effect of a CIT bankruptcy straight away but, if somebody doesn’t step in to fill the gap they will leave in the market, it will have an effect on medium-sized businesses and so on unemployment,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.This was enough to keep markets subdued during the morning, in spite of a record drop in the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits.Even impressive profits from JPMorgan were not enough to spark an early rally.The bank reported revenues and profits easily above what analysts expected on record income from its investment banking side.The shares fell 0.4 per cent to $36.13 after a weekly gain of over 12 per cent.But stocks pulled out of their range after Mr Roubini’s comments and data showed sentiment among homebuilders rose in June.Homebuilders jumped on the data, with Lennar gaining 4.4 per cent to $9.55 and Pulte Homes picking up 3.9 per cent to $9.02.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.9 per cent at 940.74, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 8,711.82 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.2 per cent to 1,885.03.There was support for the markets from the technology sector, with IBM rising 3.2 per cent to $110.64 as investors bet correctly the company would beat profit estimates when its results were released after the bell.Biogen Idec rose 0.9 per cent to $47.10 after the company managed to increase revenues by 10 per cent from the previous year, boosted by strong sales of its multiple sclerosis drugs.Rival Baxter also beat expectations with its earnings. The company raised its earnings forecast for the year and the shares rose
3.1 per cent to $54.74.The healthcare sector also showed strength, triggered by positive earnings from two biotech companies.But microchip maker Xilinx knocked confidence in the sector after its results disappointed after Tuesday’s strong showing from market leader Intel.Shares in Xilinx fell 1.9 per cent to $20.26 after it warned that profit margins could be squeezed this year even though it beat its estimates for the past quarter.Marriott International also disappointed investors even as it reported net income above what analysts had forecast. The hotel operator’s shares were down 6.2 per cent to $20.44 as the company refused to provide guidance for the next quarter, saying the “current global economic and financial climate continues to make predictions very difficult”.This also knocked shares in rival Starwood Hotels, which dropped 2.8 per cent to $21.13.Mobile handset maker Motorola was a heavy faller, losing 4.2 per cent to $6.33 after European rival Nokia warned of shrinking profit margins amid continued declines in global sales.Harley-Davidson shares were volatile in the morning after the release of its quarterly earnings, dropping to $16.65 before climbing 8.4 per cent to $18.96 as it beat bearish estimates and said it would cut 1,000 more jobs.The gain came even as profits fell 90 per cent and the company warned of “continued weak” consumer spending for discretionary purchases.Meanwhile shares in Mosaic, the fertiliser company, leapt 12.2 per cent to $49.98 after a Brazilian newspaper reported that Vale, the Brazilian iron ore miner, may bid for the company at $56 per share."
16;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2007-05-02T22:26:31Z;Banerjee to head research at HP;;Hewlett-Packard, the world’s biggest IT company, on Wednesday appointed a Chicago software engineer to head its research and development arm, ending a months-long search.Prith Banerjee, dean of the college of engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago, will take over as head of HP Labs on August 1. He will replace Richard Lampman, a 35-year HP veteran who announced his retirement last year.The appointment of Mr Banerjee, who in addition to his academic career has also launched two startups, reflects HP’s shifting research priorities.The company, which spends $3.6bn a year on research both inside HP labs and inside the company’s other business units, has said it intends to spend less money on basic research, focusing instead on solving more practical problems than can lead to new sales growth.Shane Robison, HP’s chief strategy officer, said Mr Banerjee’s background in academics and entrepeneurship made him an “oustanding choice to lead HP labs.”In 2000, Mr Banerjee founded AccelChip, a specialty software company that sold to Xilinx, a chipmaker, last year. In 2004 he started Binachip, another software group.Mr Banerjee will lead a team of HP scientists working in labs in California, India, China, England, Israel, Russia and Japan.
17;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2006-09-14T20:51:10Z;Wall Street dips on fears over inflation;;US stocks dipped slightly on Thursday after retail sales data rekindled inflationary fears and pulled the main indices away from four-month highs.Commodities also resumed their slide, with oil, copper and gold all slipping after a minor rally on Wednesday.The 10 worst performing stocks in the S&P 500 were all oil or mining groups.Hess sank 2.6 per cent to $40.30 and oil services group BJ Services slid 4.2 per cent to $30.48. Gold miner Newmont Mining fell 3.5 per cent to $44.14, while copper producer Freeport McMoran slumped 4.3 per cent to $52.00.Microsoft announced that its Zune digital music player – a rival to Apple’s iPod – would be available for purchase at Christmas, which helped push its shares up 1.4 per cent to $26.33.Sovereign Bancorp jumped 3.2 per cent to $21.21 after the company’s chief executive said at a conference that he expected to sell the bank.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent, or 1.79 points, at 1,316.28, while the Nasdaq Composite was flat, up 1.06 points, at 2,228.73. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent, or 15.93 points, lower at 11,527.39.Stocks turned lower after the latest economic data from the Commerce Department. Retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2 per cent in August, compared with most analysts’ expectation of a 0.1 per cent decline in sales.Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors, said the retail sales news was still not enough to change investors’ mindsets.“Today, I don’t think we had news that was surprising enough to get the fence-sitters off the fence,” he said. “That big question of whether we are heading towards a hard or soft landing is still very much unanswered. What is needed is news that is going to get investors committed to the bull case or the bear case.”Bear Stearns beat analyst expectations when it reported a 16 per cent rise in quarterly earnings.Its shares rose 2.5 per cent to $139.68. Bear Stearns is the third investment bank this week – after Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers to report better-than-expected results.Defence and aerospacegroup General Dynamics rose 2.4 per cent to $70.88, after it said it would increase aircraft production by 15 per cent next year due to rising international orders.The lower fuel costs were a boon to industrial chemical makers, and DuPont gained 2.3 per cent to $41.43.Genzyme gained 2.7 per cent to $68.35 after it said interim results from a drug trial showed that its multiple sclerosis drug performed better than Serono’s Rebif.XM Satellite Radio leapt 9.4 per cent to $13.69 after Credit Suisse raised its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “outperform”.Shares in chipmaker Xilinx fell 4 per cent to $22.41.
18;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2006-08-16T20:35:41Z;Wall Street gains as inflation slows down;;Wall Street notched up more gains on Wednesday as investors were cheered by a second round of weaker-than-expected inflation data, that pushed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average to their highest levels in three months.The five biggest gainers on the S&P 500 for the day were chipmakers. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange’s semiconductor index has risen more than 7 per cent in the past three days.Broadcom leapt 8.9 per cent to $30.38 on news that the International Trade Commission had extended by 50 days an investigation into the alleged infringement of a Broadcom patent by wireless technology group Qualcomm.Qualcomm was not adversely affected, instead jumping 6.7 per cent to $37.83 following bullish comments by Merrill Lynch.Another chipmaker, Xilinx, announced late on Tuesday that it had uncovered no evidence of fraud in its stock options grants. Its shares rose 10 per cent to $22.71.PMC-Sierra gained 9.5 per cent to $6.11 after a Taiwanese company said it would use PMC processors for its internet telephony service.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent, or 9.85 points, at 1,295.43, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.6 per cent, or 34.53 points, at 2,149.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent, or 96.86 points, at 11,327.12.However, Merrill Lynch’s Mary Ann Bartels sounded a cautionary note about recent gains in equity markets.“We continue to believe that while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are positioned for a rally that could carry these indexes to or through their May highs, the technical underpinnings for the rally are weak,” she said.“The possibility exists that the highs for the year and the bull market are in, and that a cyclical correction that could approach 15-20 per cent has begun, with the Nasdaq at risk for a 25-30 per cent pullback.”The only main sector to show weakness was oil, which sank as crude fell to its lowest level in six weeks. Chevron tumbled 1.4 per cent to $65.11, and Hess dropped 2.2 per cent to $49.20.Energy’s one bright spot was coal, which steamed higher after television stock commentator Jim Cramer said the sector was poised for a bounce. Peabody Energy leapt 7.1 per cent to $47.83 and Arch Coal rose 5 per cent to $36.42.Lower oil buoyed transport stocks. United Parcel Service added 4.5 per cent to $72.13, and the S&P airlines index had its best day in a month, with Continental Airlines gaining 6 per cent to $24.50.In spite of data showing a slowdown in new housing starts for July, homebuilders rallied. The stocks were boosted by a fall in 10-year bond yields to four-month lows. Pulte gained 5 per cent to $29.75, while Toll Brothers added 3.9 per cent to $25.49.
19;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2006-01-20T22:05:45Z;Dow tumbles 200 points on earnings gloom;;Wall Street endured its worst one-day session for almost three years on Friday as a sharp jump in the oil price and badly received figures from Citigroup, General Electric and Motorola robbed the market of what was left of its early-year gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points or 2 per cent to 10,666.99, its worst single-day performance since March 2003.The broader S&P 500 lost 1.8 per cent to 1,261.43 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plunged 2.4 per cent to 2,247.70.“It is a domino effect of negative news,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The chief reason was a further undermining of already-dented investor confidence in corporate earnings. The culprits were some of the country’s leading blue-chip companies, including financial services giant Citigroup, whose fourth-quarter earnings fell short of what the market had expected.Citigroup was the biggest faller on the Dow, down 4.7 per cent to $45.69, closely followed by conglomerate General Electric, off 3.8 per cent to $33.37. GE’s earnings came in largely as expected, but revenues were less than hoped.At the same time, Motorola, the telephone equipment maker, failed to raise guidance for the first quarter, and guidance from maker Xilinx also disappointed. Motorola and Xilinx lost 7.7 per cent to $22.48 and 8.1 per cent to $27.39 respectively.Google, the search engine, endured its worst day as a listed company, falling 8.5 per cent to $399.46 amid concerns over the possibility of a legal threat concerning how people use its search technology.The cocktail of bad news came at the end of an already difficult week during which JPMorgan Chase reported figures that even the bank’s chief executive admitted were disappointing and guidance from Apple Computer and Ebay left investors unsatisfied.“Companies tend to put their best feet forward in the fourth quarter, so coming up short is more meaningful than at other times,” said Mr Pado.He also noted that Friday saw the monthly expiry of stocks options, which added to volatility and uncertainty.Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, agreed that cuts in earnings guidance were disappointing, but said the market’s main concerns were geopolitical.“The real problem here is the oil price,” he said, as uncertainty about the possibility of conflict with Iran pushed crude over 2 per cent higher to more than $68 a barrel, its highest level for four months.Friday’s slump took the fall in the Dow over the truncated four-day week to 2.7 per cent and took it below the level at which it began the year. Over the week, the S&P 500 lost 2 per cent while the Nasdaq slumped 3 per cent.Sentiment was not helped by Wednesday’s events in Japan, where a sharp rise in trading volumes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange overloaded the market’s computer systems and forced trading to halt early.The week’s other big story concerned contrasting fortunes of two leading chipmakers.Shares in Intel, the global leader, came under pressure as it admitted earnings in the first quarter would be less than expected. A day later, Advanced Micro Devices, its rival, reported record fourth-quarter sales.Joshua Osha, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said it was clear “how much competitive ground [Intel] has lost to AMD.” Over the week, Intel slumped 15.6 per cent to $21.76 while AMD rose 4.6 per cent to $35.70.In the market on Friday, McDonald’s, up 1.9 per cent at $35.86, was the only Dow stock to making gains. Shareholder activist Bill Ackman continues to push for corporate restructuring at the fast food group.Amid the gloom, it was a good day for Schlumberger, the oil services group. It jumped 6.4 per cent to $122.25, an all-time high, as its quarterly profit doubled and beat even the most optimistic of Wall Street estimates.Halliburton, its oil services peer, gained 5.3 per cent to $74.50.There was also some takeover talk, as a rumour circulated the market that Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, was looking to buy a controlling stake in BlackRock.Shares in the money manager rose 6.4 per cent to $127 , while Morgan Stanley lost 2.5 per cent to $57.85.
20;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2006-01-19T23:58:59Z;Chip companies give strong data;;Semiconductor companies continued to report strong quarters on Thursday despite disappointing results this week from industry bellwether Intel.Freescale, the spin-off of Motorola’s chip arm, reported net profits of $192m or 45 cents a share, compared with $164m or 38 cents in the third quarter, and $5m or 1 cent a year ago. Analysts had expected sales of $162.8m or 37 cents a share.Sales increased quarter-on-quarter in its Wireless and Mobile Solutions and Transportation and Standard Products divisions to contribute to net sales of $1.48bn, up from $1.45bn in the third quarter and $1.43bn a year ago.Freescale, which specialises in chips for mobile phones and the automotive industry, forecast revenues of $1.435bn to $1.535bn in the current quarter. Its shares rose more than 1 per cent in after-hours trading.Xilinx reported broad-based demand for its programmable chips and said profits rose more than a quarter, from 18 cents or $64.1m a year ago to 23 cents or $80m in the last quarter. Sales rose 27 per cent, from $355.4m to $449.6m.Xilinx had raised guidance twice in the past two months but the results fell short of Wall Street expectations, causing a 6 per cent fall in its share price in after-hours trading. Earlier, shares in Fairchild Semiconductor rose 10 per cent on the day after it reported strong revenue growth and improved profit margins. Sales were 7 per cent higher than the third quarter at $370.8m.“We had a strong finish to 2005, a year of major transition for Fairchild, by delivering solid fourth-quarter sales and gross margin growth,” said Mark Thompson, chief executive.Rambus, whose patented technology is used by many memory-chip makers, reported earnings of 9 cents a share, compared with 6 cents in the third quarter and 14 cents a year ago.
21;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2005-12-08T21:38:17Z;Wall Street follows semiconductor sector lower;;Chipmakers fell victim to the old market adage “buy on the rumour, sell on the news” on Thursday after a rosy mid-quarter update from Texas Instruments prompted more sell-offs in the semiconductor sector.Texas, the second-largest US chipmaker behind Intel, fell 2.8 per cent to $32.63 after it increased the low end of its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue forecast.The fall in Texas shares was largely expected. The chipmaking sector has enjoyed a healthy rally in November on reports of strong demand for consumer electronics goods in the run up to the holiday shopping season.Overall, the Amex semiconductor index shed 1.7 per cent as the other chip stocks also lost ground to the consolidation.Intel pulled back 1.7 per cent to $25.70 ahead of its mid-quarter guidance report, due after the close, while Xilinx fell 1.7 per cent to $26.02 after it too improved its forecast for the current quarter.The losses weighed on the wider market, which closed decidedly lower after having hovered around its Wednesday closing level throughout much of the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell 0.5 per cent, or 55.79 points, to 10,775.12, dragged down by General Motors’ precipitous 4.5 per cent decline.The broader S&P 500 also backtracked, easing back 0.1 per cent, or 1.53 points to 1,255.84, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.3 per cent, or 5.56 points to 2,246.45.The Amex oil index gained 1.5 per cent after crude futures rebounded as cold weather in the US northeast bolstered demand for heating oil.Homebuilders, which have seen heavy speculative activity in recent weeks as investors gauge the likelihood of a bursting of the housing price bubble, found respite in a drop in bond yields.The Philadelphia Homebuilding index bounced back 0.8 per cent, after slumping 2.3 per cent in the previous session on concerns over interest rate rises.Toll Brothers rose 3.6 per cent to $35.55 after unveiling a 72 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profit on a 40 per cent rise in revenue.

31;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2004-10-14T10:33:59Z;Toshiba to make programmable chips for Xilinx;;Toshiba said on Thursday it would supply Xilinx, a US semiconductor manufacturer, with programmable microchips, under a strategic alliance that highlights the Japanese electronics group?s strength in high-end chip manufacturing.Xilinx, the world?s largest supplier of programmable logic devices, will make an advance payment to Toshiba of $100m, which the latter will use to fund a Y25bn ($228m) programme aimed to beef up its state-of-the-art fabrication plant in Oita, southern Japan.The deal will give Xilinx a steady supply of high-end programmable microchips, used in digital electronics products, and enable Toshiba to raise its capacity utilization rate at the Oita facility.It highlights the strength of Japanese semiconductor manufacturers in high-end process technology. Fujitsu recently clinched a similar deal with Lattice, another leading US maker of programmable devices.Japanese semiconductor groups, which have been shifting focus to high-end chips, can?t compete with their Taiwanese rivals on price, but ?at the very leading edge, they can do things that the Taiwanese cannot do,? says one analyst.Xilinx has relied on UMC, the Taiwanese foundry, for supplies of programmable chips, known as field programmable gate array (FPGA) products. These are chips that can be reprogrammed by the user even after they are shipped from the factory and are used increasingly in digital cameras and telecom devices.Xilinx said using Toshiba as a second supplier would reduce the risk of relying just on one source. UMC will continue to supply Xilinx.However, it is believed that Xilinx turned to Toshiba because ?UMC could not obtain sufficiently high yields at 90 nanometres,? says the analyst, referring to a leading-edge process technology.Toshiba and Xilinx were among just a few companies capable of delivering 90 nanometer products last year, the companies said.?Toshiba?s process technology is better. The Taiwanese should worry because they are losing leading deals. They have to improve their leading-edge technology,? the analyst says.Xilinx is a pioneer of the fabless semiconductor business model. It designs and develops semiconductors but outsources the manufacturing.Toshiba will start volume manufacturing of the programmable logic chips for Xilinx in the first quarter of next calendar year.
32;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2004-09-17T20:46:58Z;US stocks stand firm as traders seek direction;;"As Hurricane Ivan lashed at the southern US, Wall Street did not stray too far from the flat line for most of the week amid continued uncertainty over the economy and a fluctuating oil price, resisting the pressure from several downbeat earnings pre-announcements.By late morning Friday, stocks were modestly higher for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent at 10,294.26, and was 0.2 per cent lower for the five-session stretch. The broader S&P 500 index had added 0.5 per cent to 1,128.62, for a weekly showing of 0.4 per cent to the upside. The Nasdaq Composite managed a 0.7 per cent weekly gain by late morning, when it was 0.2 per cent up at 1,907.59.Trading volumes continued to be light, reflecting the markets' inability to shake off the summer torpor. Market watchers have attributed this to an unclear view of economic activity in the medium term and two events this week: quadruple witching and the Jewish New Year.Quadruple witching, or the simultaneous expiration of options and futures for indices and stocks, is known to increase volatility in the markets.Also clouding the perspective on this week's activity was the Jewish New Year holiday that took many Wall Street practitioners away from their desks. Between it and the quadruple witching, many investors appeared to wait until a clearer outlook for stocks would emerge.In addition to this, traders watched the track of Hurricane Ivan amid fears it would inflict severe damage on oil production in the Gulf of Mexico and dramatically impair economic activity in the surrounding region, which has already ben affected by two prior hurricanes.Office Depot shares fell 6.9 per cent on Tuesday after the retailer cited hurricanes among the causes of slower sales sending its earnings below forecasts. It added that hurricanes forced it to shut down its Florida-based corporate headquarters.Kroger, the grocer, also warned of tough times ahead as it announced a 25 per cent decline in profits, which sent its shares down 4.3 per cent on Tuesday.On Friday, Knight-Ridder also mentioned hurricanes as it warned of below-estimate quarterly earnings owing to poor advertising at its Miami Herald flagship title and other newspapers in the region.Anthony Chan, managing director and senior economist at JP Morgan Fleming Asset Management, said ""the steady-as-she-goes message of economic data"" was the main cause for the relatively subdued mood in the markets.""We see no striking evidence that we're moving in one direction or the other in the economy …nothing out there is telling us we should to break out of a trading range in the near term,"" Mr Chan said.As the summer lull threatens to spill well into the autumn, many analysts have predicted a fourth-quarter rally for US stocks, while others warn that possibility might have more to do with hope than with reason.The bullish voices point out that the market have essentially ignored positive earnings news so far this year as Corporate America achieved earnings growth well into the double digits. However, less upbeat observers note that earnings growth has decelerated, the fear is that the slowdown will continue next year to reach single digits.The club of technology companies beset by slowing demand for their wares added some new members this week, notably LSI Logic, whose shares on Tuesday fell 9.5 per cent. A day later Xilinx shares gave up 5.3 per cent as it also warned of slow demand owing to its customers' high inventories.This news came as Goldman Sachs also warned of ""moderate performance"" for technology in the next 12 months, amid some scoffing from bulls that its estimates were too conservative, accompanied by adamant comments that US corporations will have to replace obsolete equipment sooner rather than later.Technology was not the only sector afflicted by low demand for its wares. Coca-Cola, the soft drinks giant, said declining demand in key markets would cause it to miss second-half analyst forecasts. Shares lost 4 per cent during the session on the news, pulling down shares of Coke's key bottling companies."
33;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2004-09-15T20:45:21Z;Coke warning and Ivan hit Wall Street;;"A profit-warning from Coca-Cola, obstinately high crude prices and the prospect of a large-scale disaster due to hurricane Ivan beat up Wall Street stocks on Wednesday.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.8 per cent to 10,231.40 while the broader S&P 500 index eased 0.7 per cent to 1,120.35. The Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent lower at 1,896.52.Weather forecasts saw the most attention as hurricane Ivan, packing winds of 140 mph (225 km/h), approached the Gulf of Mexico coast where more than 1.2m people were urged to evacuate. The storm could lead to heavy insurance claims if there is significant damage to populated areas.Ivan's potential impact on Gulf of Mexico oil production sent crude futures initially higher in spite of a decision by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase output by 1m barrels per day starting November 1. Traders said the decision would have no impact because the cartel is already exceeding its self-imposed quotas.In spite of Wednesday's morning's downward momentum in trading, market observers such as Brian Bush, director of research at Stephens Inc, reiterated their belief that US stocks could rally in the final quarter of the year.""If we get through September and it turns out to be better than it has been historically, I think the stage is set for good earnings announcements and good outlook projections,"" Mr Bush said.On the other hand, Tobias Levkovich, the equity strategist at Smith Barney, told reporters on Tuesday that ""the fourth-quarter rally seems to have more to do with hope than with reason"".Coca-Cola, the leading soft drinks group and a component of the Dow industrials, said its second-half earnings would not meet analyst estimates, citing weak demand in key markets. Shares fell 4 per cent to $41.16.Coke's news weighed on the shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest US bottler of Coke soft drinks, which were off 2.3 per cent at $19.07. Coca-Cola Hellenic, the largest international bottler of Coke products, saw its shares lose 2.5 per cent to $22.95. So far this year Coke shares have lost 19.3 per cent while those of its two bottlers are 12.7 per cent lower and 8.8 per cent higher, respectively, since January.A bright spot came from the retail sector, where Best Buy shares rose 4.6 per cent to $52.61 after the consumer electronics retailer beat analyst estimates when it reported quarterly results. Circuit City, its main competitor, was 0.6 per cent higher at $13.92, off earlier highs.In the technology sector Oracle shares rose 7.4 per cent to $11.33 after the company beat analyst estimates when it announced results after the close on Tuesday.Oracle bucked the downward trend in tech shares, which saw losses across the board after Laura Conigliaro at Goldman Sachs issued a sobering outlook for technology spending in 2005. While pointing out the potential for a rally in tech stocks in the fourth quarter, she said: ""We see nothing in the tech capital spending outlook for [next year] that would suggest anything other than a moderate performance for tech stocks over the next twelve months.""As a result Microsoft shares were 0.9 per cent lower at $27.19 while Dell lost 1.7 per cent to $35.41. Hewlett-Packard was 0.7 per cent off at $18.28.The Soxx semiconductor index was 3.2 per cent lower, driven by a 5.3 per cent drop in Xilinx shares, to $27.50. It was the latest chipmaker to warn of slowing revenue growth due to customers' high inventories.In a reflection of a broader trend of rising inventories in the US, the Commerce Department said business inventories in July grew faster than expected and revised June's inventory growth upwards. While also seen as a sign of confidence among companies about future demand, high inventories lately appear to reflect slowing demand catching companies with too many goods in the warehouse."
34;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
35;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2004-09-03T16:23:27Z;Wall St shrugs off bad news in a quiet week;;Wall Street took some disappointing corporate news in its stride this week, with the weaker oil price tipping the balance in favour of the bulls.There was also relief that the summer's final “big event” the Republican National Convention in New York had passed without a terrorist attack.But it was the last week of the summer and activity was muted, in part because many investors and traders went on holiday to avoid the Republican gathering.But while markets were up over the week, they dipped on Friday amid disappointment over a warning from Intel late on Thursday and because solid job creation figures suggested the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates again later this month.By the close, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 10,260.20. However, the benchmark index was still up 0.6 per cent on the week. The S&P 500 had slipped 0.4 per cent to 1,113.63 on Friday, but it made a 0.5 per cent gain on the week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.6 per cent to 1,844.48, for a 0.9 per cent weekly loss.Several strategists said the week's gains should be taken with a pinch of salt, because volumes were paper-thin.The week's economic data were largely tepid. August retail sales were extremely disappointing, with the much-anticipated back-to-school season stirring only modest interest in consumers.The data front took a turn for the better on Friday, with the eagerly awaited August non-farm payroll figures coming in at 144,000 just shy of analysts' expectations of 150,000 new jobs. But June and July figures were revised upwards by a combined 59,000.Although the figures suggest growth is more robust than feared, investors seemed to focus more on the implications for further interest rate rises.The closely watched mid-quarter update from Intel, the technology bellwether, was more than disappointing. The company said demand was weaker than expected and cut its forecasts for third quarter revenues and profit margins. Shares skidded 7.3 per cent yesterday to $20.05, making a new 52-week low and dragging down much of the chip sector with it. Semiconductors scored the week's worst performance on the S&P 500, down 7.2 per cent.Other losers included Advanced Micro Devices, off 6.6 per cent to $10.90 by the close, Xilinx, down 6.1 per cent to $25.59, PMC-Sierra, down 6.9 per cent to $8.69 and Applied Micro Circuits, 4.3 per cent weaker at $3.15.Intel's warning was only one of Thursday's disappointments. Wal-Mart, the retail giant, reported its weakest August sales in four years on the same day.Nonetheless, shares in the world's biggest retailer gained 0.7 per cent to $53.02 on the day, as investors were relieved that the 0.5 per cent same-store sales increase was not smaller.Gap, the clothing retailer, also reported a slimmer-than-expected drop in August sales. Shares climbed 5.7 per cent to $20.08, helping to lead the retailing sector to the session's best showing up 2.8 per cent. Taking the “glass-is-half-full” view to the extreme, markets sent shares of Ross Stores up 9.9 per cent to $23.53 after the company's August sales fell 8 per cent, rather than the 8.8 per cent investors had feared.Costco Wholesale, the membership warehouse chain, slid 1 per cent to $40.41 after the company reported August sales grew 4 per cent, missing analysts' expectations of 7.3 per cent growth by a wide mark.Energy stocks continued to prosper, in spite of the broader markets' relief at the recent pause in the crude rally.The S&P 500 energy group gained 3.9 per cent, the best performance on the week. Winners included Transocean, up 7.6 per cent on the week, Noble 7.9 per cent stronger and Occidental Petroleum, up 5 per cent.Woody Dorsey, a technical analyst at Market Semiotics, said investors' thinking about energy stocks had begun to shift, as they come round to the idea that oil prices may stay relatively high for some time.Although energy stocks have notched the S&P 500's best performance of the year, up 16.9 per cent, they have not kept pace with the soaring price of crude oil.
36;XLNX;Xilinx Inc;2004-09-01T17:31:46Z;Book review: The classic innovator's dilemma;;"SEEING WHAT’S NEXT
Using the theories of innovation to predict industry change
By Clayton Christensen, Scott Anthony and Erik Roth
Harvard Business School Press, $29.95What does Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft maker, have in common with semiconductor company Xilinx and the University of Phoenix Online? According to Seeing What's Next, the latest opus from Clayton Christensen, all three are changing the basis of competition in their respective industries.What is more, they are doing so in ways that make it difficult for market leaders to respond. They are “disruptive innovators”.The concept is not new. Prof Christensen, a star turn on the faculty of Harvard Business School, has specialised in “disruptive innovation” since the early 1990s.This is his third book on the subject, following on the heels of The Innovator's Solution, published last year, and The Innovator's Dilemma, the 1997 blockbuster that made his name. Along the way, there have been countless journal articles, conference presentations and web-based seminars. So does Prof Christensen's audience of managers and corporate strategists need another 300 pages of tightly-woven argument, frameworks and matrices?The simple answer is no. Only Christensen groupies will feel compelled to have Seeing What's Next on their shelves alongside its forerunners.If the whole disruptive innovation genre somehow passed you by, however, Seeing What's Next is an excellent place to start.The first 100 pages amount to a recap of the theories developed in The Innovator's Dilemma and The Innovator's Solution: the distinction between sustaining and disruptive innovations, the “resources, processes and values” framework and the theory of “value chain evolution”.While purists will argue that you should start with the original texts, most readers will be satisfied with the highlights offered here.The later half of the book is made up of case studies that apply Christensenian thinking to five industries: health, education, aviation, semiconductors and telecommunications.In his previous books, Prof Christensen drew heavily on his research into the hard disk drive industry - the subject of his doctoral thesis. Here, in conjunction with co-authors Scott Anthony and Erik Roth, both former graduate students, he ranges widely.The case study approach is useful partly because the conclusions are often counter-intuitive.Embraer and Bomardier are marked out as true disruptive innovators because their small, cheap, regional jets could undermine the business models of industry leaders Boeing and Airbus.This is classic “low-end” disruption, serving customers that market leaders have neither the inclination nor the cost structure to address.Yet US discount airlines such as Southwest and JetBlue - also would-be low-end disruptors - are reckoned to stand little chance of usurping the big carriers.The reason? Incumbents such as American Airlines, United and Delta cannot afford to cede the leisure travel market to the discounters.The high fixed-cost nature of the airline business, it is argued, means that every passenger mile counts. So discount airlines always run into rough weather as big carriers cut fares and launch their own discount operations.Not all the case studies presented here are as easy for lay readers to digest. You need to be profoundly versed in lithography - or willing to climb a near-vertical learning curve - to get through the 20-odd pages on semiconductors. Suffice to say that chipmakers have been so successful at making faster, more powerful chips that the needs of many customers have been overshot.The companies that build electronic devices around chips are starting to yearn for something different: flexible, modular solutions that will allow them to get their products to market sooner.This is where companies such as Xilinx, a maker of multipurpose chips that can be programmed and reprogrammed by users, step in. Xilinx chips may be slower but they are hugely flexible. In higher education, meanwhile, traditional universities (including business schools) are seen as facing powerful, disruptive threats from companies that use the internet to deliver learning.Needless to say, prestigious universities tend to view outfits such as the University of Phoenix Online, a listed company, as a joke.If Prof Christensen is right, however, the Ivory Tower crowd will not be laughing when disrupters start to make serious inroads in undergraduate education - universities' main money-spinner.A further question is where Prof Christensen goes from here. Like Intel or Harvard, he is undoubtedly a market leader. But, like these organisations, he has arguably overshot the needs of most of his customers.So does the great man retreat upmarket into consulting, serving that portion of his audience that is most demanding? Or does he try to build a new theory, competing head-to-head with the myriad business academics intent on taking his place?Think of it as a classic innovator's dilemma. Truly, life imitates art."
