Residents of the glistening 71-storey tower in Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen have access to a basketball court, a private art collection and a billiards lounge. The luxury lifestyle does not come cheap: one-bedroom apartments are on the rental market for as much as $6,500 a month.High-earning New York professionals who live in the building take the rents in their stride, though they may be surprised to discover who financed it.Last summer, Freddie Mac, the home loans guarantor propped up by US taxpayers a decade ago after the subprime housing crisis, backeda $550m loan to the building’s owners — Moinian Group, among New York’s largest private landlords, and SL Green Realty, an S&P 500-listed real estate investment trust.It was the latest in a series of deals to support top-end commercial property developments by Freddie Mac and its counterpart Fannie Mae, the twin pillars of US mortgage finance.For critics, it is projects such as Sky Residences that highlight questions over what role the two institutions should be playing in the housing market — 10 years after the property bubble and subsequent financial crisis they were accused of helping to create. Established to make mortgages more affordable and expand US home ownership — Fannie during the Great Depression and Freddie in 1970 — the Treasury propped them up with about $188bn in bailout funds after the housing market meltdown. While Fannie and Freddie have private shareholders, they send most of their profits to the Treasury.Since then, far from being reined in as critics demanded in the aftermath of the crisis, the two “government-sponsored enterprises” remain as important as ever; even more so for commercial real estate markets.Fannie and Freddie are best known for their principal role as the leading source of financing for owner-occupied mortgages. But for decades, they have played another role in supporting the market for rental housing, by helping finance property companies that acquire or refinance investments in apartment blocks. This second, lower-profile, part of their business has boomed since the crisis.By the end of last year the pair had a financial interest in almost $500bn of commercial mortgages, equivalent to 38 per cent of the total outstanding across the US. That compares with almost $200bn, or 25 per cent of the market, a decade ago. Last year alone, the pair financed almost 1.6m rental units.The expansion has raised eyebrows in the industry. Competitors that provide this type of finance — banks, life insurance companies and other institutional investors — say the taxpayer’s backing allows Fannie and Freddie to offer borrowers better terms than they can.Sam Chandan, real estate economist at New York University, says there is evidence that the government guarantees were crowding out some private sector capital.“They play a critically important role in the underserved, affordable segment,” he says. “But do they compete in the segments of the market where we see robust competition? I think those are legitimate concerns.”In keeping with their mission to support “workforce” housing, most of the apartments that Fannie and Freddie finance are designed to be affordable to tenants on low and moderate incomes.A quarter of the almost 1,200 units at Sky were set aside for such households, who competed for tenancy in a lottery. Overall, more than four in five of the units that Fannie and Freddie funded last year had rents that cost less than 30 per cent of the local area’s median monthly income, a widely used measure of affordability.Fannie and Freddie do not lend directly to apartment investors. Instead, they shoulder financial risks on loans that are underwritten by commercial mortgage companies. In a process known as securitisation, the agencies buy the loans, package them up and sell them on to investors. If borrowers default, Fannie and Freddie potentially have to cover big chunks of the losses.For critics, their involvement in commercial real estate means that just as US taxpayers back individual homeowners through Fannie and Freddie mortgages, so they also subsidise some of the largest investment groups in the world.Blackstone Group, Starwood Capital, the Canadian pension fund manager Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC are among the biggest borrowers on GSE commercial loans, according to Real Capital Analytics.The investors pay cheaper rates because of the federal insurance afforded by Fannie and Freddie, says Jim Costello, senior vice-president at Real Capital Analytics. Mortgages on rental apartments are on average about a tenth less expensive than those for other types of commercial real estate, such as offices and shopping malls.How much of the lower funding costs provided by Fannie and Freddie trickle down to residents — and how much is captured by the property owner — is open to question. “With owner-occupied homes, the subsidy is direct,” says Prof Chandan. “On the multi-family side [large apartment complexes], it’s less clear how you provide subsidy for the renter.” Although they remain a small part of the total, the proportion of more expensive apartments financed by the pair has risen over the past decade. Last year, almost one in five units in which Fannie acquired a financial interest had rents that cost more than 30 per cent of the area’s median income. In 2006, little more than one in 10 were so expensive.Other apartment complexes supported by the pair charge even higher rents than Sky. Among the New York properties that Fannie Mae has helped finance is 456 Washington Street, which overlooks the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan. The building is owned by Related Companies, founded by Stephen Ross, the billionaire and Miami Dolphins American football team owner. About 20 of the 107 units were reserved for low-income households. The rest were let at market rates — several for more than $30,000 a month, according to listings website StreetEasy.For decades, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have helped Americans secure cheaper mortgages. They buy the loans from lenders then either hold them or sell them on to investors in financial markets — making good on payments if the borrower defaults. The system was credited with enlarging the pool of homeowners but came unstuck in the 2008 housing slumpFannie and Freddie finance such developments in part because they are one of the main ways cheaper properties are made available in expensive markets. To help deal with a shortage of affordable housing, policymakers in urban centres including New York give developers tax breaks if they reserve some units for lower-income residents.“It’s not because we’re trying to do more high end or more expensive properties,” says Manuel Menendez, Fannie Mae’s multi-family chief credit officer.The group also needs to “balance” affordable units with apartments that generate higher returns to ensure “prudent credit risk management”, adding: “From time to time there will be certain assets that you might consider to be higher end.”During the financial crisis, Mr Menendez says, the agencies were a crucial source of funding for multi-family housing when commercial lenders retreated.Supporters say the pair have also helped stave off an affordable housing crisis, especially as a new generation of renters has been locked out of the post-crisis recovery. “If they didn’t exist, there would be a major problem for multi-family housing,” says Shekar Narasimhan, managing partner at the real estate group Beekman Advisors, who was the first chair of Fannie Mae’s advisory committee on this type of housing.Shortly before she stepped down as chair of the Federal Reserve this year, Janet Yellen sounded the alarm about US commercial property. High valuations, she said, were “a source of some concern”, adding that “prices are quite high relative to rents”.It was the latest warning about a frothy market. In its 2017 annual report the Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, pointed to concerns over “inappropriate risk pricing” in the asset class. Price rises for rental apartment properties had outpaced other parts of commercial real estate, it noted.Neither Ms Yellen nor the FSOC mentioned the role played in the sector by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two groups do not fund construction, although they do finance purchases or refinancings by investors once the buildings are completed.For critics, the pair have played a central role in financing the boom. Developers have completed about 1.3m rental units in the US over the past five years, according to RealPage data, including a record 365,000 in 2017. “Apartment developers and investors have overdone it in a very big way — fuelled by Fannie and Freddie,” says Douglas French, a real estate consultant who advises building companies in Nevada. “We’re definitely seeing it in Las Vegas. This apartment market is extremely hot.”Demand has risen in part because millennials have put off starting families, making them more likely to rent downtown than settle in the suburbs. Still, there are signs of a supply glut in popular markets. Landlords in some parts of New York are offering one or two months rent-free on high-end properties.“Aggressive lending practices by the GSEs this cycle have been an important factor in the degree of over-investment and over-valuation of multi-family properties in certain key markets,” says Michael Shaoul, chief executive of Marketfield Asset Management.“I do not think that the GSEs have been as critical in commercial real estate as they were in traditional mortgages a decade ago — but they have perhaps allowed some of the more marginal projects to minimise equity capital this time around.”David Brickman, head of multi-family at Freddie Mac, says: “I firmly reject the notion that we are contributing to a bubble. The growth we’ve seen is largely fuelled by strong demand drivers and healthy fundamentals. Even though we have supply growing, we are still not producing enough affordable housing.”Fannie and Freddie’s difficulties in 2008 were caused not by rental properties but owner-occupier mortgages, in which their interests are far bigger. Apartment default rates remain low. Yet if losses do rise, taxpayers should have some protection. Fannie and Freddie share chunks of the risks they take on with the private sector: in a typical Freddie Mac rental transaction, for instance, known as a “K-Deal”, private investors would have to pick up the first 20 per cent of losses.Instead of limits on each deal, the GSEs’ commercial real estate businesses are subjected to overall limits imposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The restrictions are a sign that policymakers recognise the risk that the taxpayer guarantee could crowd out private capital from the market, and the cap for each agency is tightening this year from $36.5bn in 2017 to $35bn.Several types of properties are exempt from the FHFA’s cap, however. Last year more than half the rental apartment debt that Fannie and Freddie took on — 54 per cent, or $75bn — was not subject to the restriction.The complex set of restrictions make it look like Fannie and Freddie could “game” the system, says Mr Narasimhan. “I don’t think that’s what going on, but you can get that perception,” he says. “Are they doing a good job in making sure they serve affordable housing in underserved markets? Yes. Should they be given a different set of rules? Yes.”A decade since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s multibillion-dollar losses prompted the Treasury to seize control, Washington is still ruminating over what to do with the pair. With a combined $5.4tn in assets, their status is the biggest piece of unfinished business from the crisis.Neither fully public nor private, Fannie and Freddie pay most of their profits to the Treasury to compensate taxpayers for the risk they bear in providing a financial backstop. Investors who own the shares claim the arrangement is unfair and untenable, and several have taken legal action against the government.Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary, has repeatedly said that a shake-up is on the Trump administration’s agenda. Some lawmakers in Congress have also drawn up proposals to inject more competition into the market.But reform has yet to be delivered. “There’s no appetite to take it up,” says Beekman Advisors’ Shekar Narasimhan. “It’s pretty much a dead duck at this point.”For all their ideological misgivings about the central role of the government, Republicans know the agencies provide relief to millions of voters. The taxpayer’s support of Fannie and Freddie underpins the unique US system of fixed 30-year mortgages, which allows homeowners to pay back home loans over decades without worrying about interest rates.“The dirty little secret is that the GSEs largely work,” says Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research. The Treasury has more than recouped what it spent on bailing them out 10 years ago.Another crisis could spur action, Mr Narasimhan adds. But for now, they are making money that goes into the public coffers. “Who looks free money in the face and thinks that’s not a good thing?”"
1;SLG;SL Green Realty Corp;2008-12-29T22:29:36Z;Wall St stocks suffer on collapsed Dow deal;;Wall Street stocks began the final week of one of their worst years on record with another retreat, as the collapse of Dow Chemical’s deal with Kuwait heightened concerns over the difficulties companies face in securing funding during the credit crisis.Dow Chemical sank to its lowest level since 1991, off 19 per cent to $15.32, after Kuwait pulled the plug on a proposed $17.4bn petrochemicals joint venture, which prompted fears that it could put its merger with rival Rohm & Haas – one of the bigger mergers of the year – at risk.Shares in the speciality chemicals group tumbled 16.1 per cent to $53.34. Richard O’Reilly, Standard & Poor’s analyst, maintaining his “hold” recommendation on Dow’s target, said the Kuwait cancellation “calls into question” the planned $78-a-share acquisition.Citigroup warned that the move had “negative implications for [the] industry”, as it was a sign that North American ethylene assets were “less attractive” to Middle East suitors.Nova Chemicals, which Citi analyst PJ Juvekar highlighted as an example of the above, shed 3.3 per cent to $4.36.DuPont was one of the biggest losers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 2 per cent to $24.49.“The biggest worry in the world today is the drying up in credit markets,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at Wachovia Securities. “It’s ‘when is it going to end?’ type of thinking.”Still, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average finished off their lows, each down 0.4 per cent at 869.42 and 8,483.93, respectively, in holiday-thinned trading. The Nasdaq Composite index closed down 1.3 per cent at 1,510.32.The energy sector provided support as escalating violence in the Middle East prompted a jump in oil prices. It was the only sector to find positive territory, up 1.9 per cent overall, as Israeli war planes continued their attacks on the Gaza Strip for a third day.Hess, Murphy Oil and Baker Hughes were the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500, up 6.5 per cent to $52.25, 6 per cent to $44.24 and 5.3 per cent to $31.18, respectively.Although the materials sector was the worst-performing, off 2.1 per cent, some stocks in the sector enjoyed reasonable gains.Newmont Mining was up 4.8 per cent to $40.70 as gold rallied.Elsewhere, Ford dropped 3.1 per cent to $2.22 on reports that Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor who had invested about $1bn in the motor group, had sold his remaining stake.Real estate investment trusts, which have recently rallied from their lows, were among the biggest losers after SL Green Realty cut its quarterly dividend by more than half to 37.5 cents a share. Its shares tumbled 10.3 per cent to $24.42.Financials finished 1 per cent lower. Some observers said the sector, down 60 per cent overall in 2008, was particularly hard hit by year-end tax loss selling.The higher oil price put retailers under pressure, also pushed down amid concerns over the extent of poor sales performances. Gamestop and JC Penney were the hardest hit, down 5.1 per cent to $21.95 and 4.6 per cent to $17.84, respectively.Analysts continued to debate the outlook for US stocks, set for their worst annual performance since the Great Depression.Todd Salamone, of Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said technical indicators were a sign “that this is not a prudent time to be overly bullish”.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose 1.1 per cent to 43.87 on Monday, which indicated heightened levels of distress. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell by 2.2 per cent to 466.15.“We have seen earnings for the small caps and the mid caps hold up better than the large caps, but it looks as if the fourth quarter might be a turning point,” wrote Merrill Lynch analysts in a small-cap strategy note to clients.The analysts, who forecast a drop of 14.6 per cent in fourth quarter earnings for small-cap stocks, added: “If the numbers come in as anticipated, it would mark the first time since the second quarter [of] 2007 in which the large caps’ earnings held up the best.”
2;SLG;SL Green Realty Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
