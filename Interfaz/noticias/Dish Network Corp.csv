It amounts to aggregation in many forms.Disney has assembled its Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and Disney stables to rival Netflix in alluring content, while coming to within 100m of its subscribers by aggregating Disney+ (28.6m), Hulu (30.4m) and ESPN+ (7.6m) to give it rapid growth to nearly 67m customers by this month. Amazon is increasing the reach of its video service by making it part of its Prime offering, while Apple's TV+ comes free for a year with any new Apple device. Here in the UK, BritBox combines content from broadcasters ITV, Channel 4 and the BBC. For those less fortunate, the other kind of aggregation is consolidation. Viacom, home to MTV, Paramount and Showtime, has recombined with CBS, but ViacomCBS shares fell 18 per cent on Thursday as the new entity recorded a quarterly loss and failed to inspire investors with its streaming plans. Its new service will expand on its CBS All Access in what is being described as a “House of Brands” product.Earlier this week, Dish Network chairman Charlie Ergen reported sliding subscriber numbers for Dish and its Sling TV service and said a merger with its biggest satellite rival DirecTV was “inevitable”. “You just can’t swim upstream against a real tide of big players,” he said. If aggregation fails, the answer may be to look for an exit through diversification — Dish's big greenfield idea is to deploy a 5G network later this year. It's definitely the future, when traditional TV provision looks like heading into the past.1. SoftBank's share of new US carrier is cut
Dish has got a leg-up as a US mobile player through the approval of the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. However, that deal has just been renegotiated. The recut deal will give Deutsche Telekom, the parent of T-Mobile US, 43 per cent ownership, up from 42 per cent. SoftBank will own 24 per cent of the merged business, down from the 27 per cent it had earlier accepted.2. Facebook pays for your data input
Facebook is offering to pay its users for personal information including recordings of their own voice to help train speech recognition systems, in a rare example of internet companies directly compensating people for collecting their data. The social network’s Viewpoints app, which was first released three months ago to test new features and survey users, this week began to invite users in the US to say “Hey Portal” and the names of up to 10 friends. Going through the recording process five times would earn points that can be converted into a $5 cash reward.

Educational publisher Pearson has revealed the extent of the downturn in its US textbooks business as it attempts to show it has reached “the bottom of the valley” in adjusting to students switching to ebooks and rentals. Revenue from its US textbook business fell 12 per cent last year, while print revenue was down 30 per cent. Outgoing CEO John Fallon said Pearson was selling 20m books a year when he became chief in 2013. This year, it expects to sell 2m.4. Coronavirus compendium

New data-sharing principles laid out by the EU this week seek to crack open the data silos that have helped to reinforce the power of the dominant tech companies. But past experience suggests that, when it comes to limiting the power of Big Tech, it might be best not to expect too much, writes Richard Waters. Marietje Schaake, the international policy director at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center,reasons that if technology companies want to act like governments they need to start treating their consumers as citizens. The UK’s national weather service is to get a £1.2bn computer to help with forecasting. Tim Harford’s response: when do economists get one? Weather forecasters make hypotheses and test them daily. Could economists do likewise?Microsoft this week tried out its ElectionGuard technology in an actual election for the first time. In voting in Wisconsin for Supreme Court candidates, ElectionGuard provided an encrypted digital tally that allowed voters to confirm their votes had been counted and not altered. Cnet says this could be Microsoft's most important product in 2020. It was announced in May 2019 as open source software that would make elections more secure and end-to-end verifiable. It sounds a bit better than the app used by Democrats in the Iowa caucuses."

What they want to avoid is creating a rival. The third and fourth-largest mobile operators are trying to clinch a merger that so far has been held up by the US Department of Justice. The DoJ has consistently held that it does not want the US wireless phone industry to become a trio.The deal risked being blocked but a settlement is in the works. T-Mobile will sell its Boost Mobile unit to a new market participant who will use it along with the T-Mobile/Sprint wireless network to ensure there are four US wireless providers.Amazon had been floated as a possible Boost acquirer. However, news reports peg Dish Networks, the satellite TV provider put together by Charlie Ergen as the likely buyer in a deal that might be days away. Dish has been an odd package of a declining legacy entertainment business combined with a huge portfolio of wireless spectrum. That spectrum may finally be put to use with Dish’s shares up 57 per cent on the year. Investors seem to like its chances of diversifying away from the cord-cutting phenomenon.At the end of 2018, Dish had roughly 10m subscribers for its satellite TV service. Four years earlier that figure was 14m as Americans have steadily warmed to digital consumption. Dish had started its own streaming service, Sling TV, but it has just 2m subscribers, and more importantly, its pricing is so cheap that profits are scant. Despite this year’s rally, Dish shares are off by roughly half from four years ago.Dish has spent $21bn accumulating various spectrum bands. Guessing if and how Mr Ergen was going to deploy these has been a longstanding parlour game on Wall Street. The merging companies need the sign-off from the DoJ but are also keen that Dish does not quickly build a competitor that could challenge them. The awkwardness is that the goal is exactly what the DoJ desires. While cable and broadband companies now offer limited mobile phone services, Dish may be the first full-fledged start-up in years.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
2;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2019-06-20T21:08:46Z;T-Mobile and Sprint try to clinch merger with spectrum sale;Wireless groups locked in talks over proposed deal to win US approval for $26bn tie-up;T-Mobile and Sprint are locked in talks over selling spectrum to a smaller rival to win US approval for their $26bn merger, people familiar with the matter said, with just days left before a key regulatory deadline.T-Mobile is seeking permission from the US Department of Justice for its proposed purchase of its smaller telecoms rival. But DoJ officials are demanding the two companies sell assets to help create a fourth rival in the wireless market before they allow the deal to go ahead, according to people close to the talks.Sprint is in talks to sell its Boost Mobile brand to Dish Network as part of a package worth around $6bn designed to satisfy the DoJ demands.But three people close to the talks have told the Financial Times the parties have not been able to agree the specifics of a proposed spectrum sale as part of that deal, despite facing a deadline of Monday for the DoJ to rule on the merger.The people briefed on developments said the talks are likely to continue into next week, which would mean either closing the deal without approval and fighting a DoJ lawsuit, cancelling it or seeking a further extension from the department.One person said they expected the DoJ to grant such an extension, but only if officials felt negotiations with Dish were moving in the right direction.The Federal Communications Commission, the other agency with jurisdiction over the deal, is set to give its approval after its chairman Ajit Pai said he would recommend his fellow commissioners do so.The DoJ and Dish declined to comment. Sprint and T-Mobile, which is controlled by Deutsche Telekom, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.One person close to the talks said: “The outlines of a deal are there, but Dish wants more spectrum, while Sprint and T-Mobile are trying to hold on to as much as they can.”If the deal goes through, it will shake up the US wireless market and create a third major company to compete with AT&T and Verizon. It also has the potential to become a political dispute, as some high-profile Democratic candidates for US president have pledged to be tough on antitrust issues.Some staff at the DoJ have opposed approving the deal, according to people familiar with the matter. But the final decision will rest with Makan Delrahim, the chief of its antitrust division, who was appointed by US president Donald Trump.John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile US, has been criticised by Democrats in Congress for spending $200,000 staying at the Trump Hotel in Washington while his company sought approval for its Sprint deal.According to one person briefed on the process, Mr Delrahim is likely to give his approval if he is satisfied that the asset sales are sufficient to empower a fourth competitor, and also if the newly-merged company agrees not to overcharge Dish to use its network once Boost is sold.After the deal is complete, the person said, Boost will temporarily have to use the T-Mobile network, which would give T-Mobile the opportunity to raise prices and push customers back towards its brand.But with no agreement reached on the spectrum sale, T-Mobile is unlikely to have approval by the DoJ deadline, or in time for a court hearing on Friday to hear arguments from 10 states that are trying to block the deal.T-Mobile and Sprint had hoped to agree on their asset sales before that, in the hope that a judge would then require the state attorneys-general to refile their complaints based on the new terms, according to two people close to the deal.
3;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Inmarsat/EchoStar: back down;Hopes of bidding war and revival of Inmarsat’s share price are likely over;What made EchoStar, the US satellite operator, think its British rival Inmarsat would accept its earthbound bid? Speculation about an earlier approach pushed Inmarsat’s share price above 600p last month. EchoStar’s mixture of cash and shares added up to just 532p per share.This may be well above the three-month average, but it ignores the speed with which Inmarsat’s share price has recovered amid a spate of buyer interest. Inmarsat now trades at 23 times next year’s earnings, well up from last summer.EchoStar’s retreat puts a six-month freeze on future approaches unless the Inmarsat board decides to engage, or Inmarsat receives a firm offer from another company.Hopes of a bidding war and the sparky rejuvenation of Inmarsat’s share price are likely over. Shares fell 8 per cent on Friday. But Inmarsat is unlikely to return to its recent lows, when it dropped out of London’s FTSE 100 index.Ligado Networks, a US satellite company that uses Inmarsat’s spectrum in North America, was the culprit for this fall from grace. Uncertainty about cash payments led Inmarsat to cut its dividend. Ligado was also responsible for EchoStar’s offer. If Ligado regains its license it will be a competitor to EchoStar’s Dish Network. Buying Inmarsat neutralises this competition.Nor is Ligado’s future certain. The company awaits a crucial US licence to expand its services. If regained, Inmarsat shares are likely to jump. Until then there is no reason to think that another bidder will be waiting in the wings to take EchoStar’s place. Eutelsat wanted to use Inmarsat’s marine and aerospace business but the combination would have carried high net debt of 3.6 times ebitda (a cash earnings measure).EchoStar’s interest had given Inmarsat’s share price a confidence boost. But gravity has taken its toll.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters.
4;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2017-12-05T15:19:16Z;Dish Network names new chief as Charlie Ergen steps aside;;US satellite-TV provider Dish Network said Tuesday that co-founder Charlie Ergen would relinquish his chief executive title in order to focus on the company’s emerging wireless business.The new chief executive will be Erik Carlson, who has worked at Dish since 1995 and is currently the company’s chief operating officer. Mr Ergen will retain his job as chairman.Mr Ergen said in a statement:“With more than 20 years’ experience at Dish, Erik brings a complete understanding of the business opportunities both Dish TV and Sling TV possess. I have every confidence that under Erik’s leadership our new organizational structure will deliver value for Dish TV and Sling TV and will aid our entry into wireless.”The move comes amid a shake-up in the pay-TV sector as more consumers opt to “cut the cord” and get their content from an array of sources, including internet and mobile. During the past few years, Mr Ergen has attempted to head off those pressures by diversifying Dish’s business, launching Sling TV and acquiring tens of billions of dollars of spectrum — the airwaves needed to deliver wireless telecoms services.Dish shares, down 10.8 per cent year-to-date, rose about 1.2 per cent after the announcement before dipping back to trade roughly flat.
5;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2017-03-09T17:56:50Z;Stronger signal for US telecoms M&A;Resurgent T-Mobile USA seen as kingmaker in next leg of industry consolidation;"T-Mobile USA has oscillated between being a problem child and a wunderkind for its German owner Deutsche Telekom since it entered the US market at the turn of the century. Yet 17 years on, the decision to pay $51bn in 2000 for Voicestream — then the sixth largest wireless company in the US — has left the German telecoms group as a potential kingmaker in a US communications sector already in upheaval.The two largest US telecoms groups are already making their moves. AT&T wants to create the world’s largest owner of content and distribution with the $85bn takeover of Time Warner. Rival Verizon is betting on the continued growth of digital platforms with the combined $8.9bn acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo.But more consolidation is expected by bankers and analysts, triggered by the conclusion of the $19.6bn sale of new airwaves that can be used for mobile services.“Every telecom and cable company in America feels like they have a golden opportunity to strike deals under [the Trump] administration,” says a senior banker who advises one of the largest US operators.President Donald Trump’s decision to elevate Ajit Pai to chairman of the Federal Communications Commission was the clearest indication that the Obama administration’s block on telecom mergers was over, adds a senior US telecoms executive.Roslyn Layton, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and FCC adviser to Mr Trump’s transition team, says that Mr Pai would focus more on regulating the industry rather than blocking deals.“The network business is squeezed by technological competition, so the only way that network companies can survive is to merge,” Ms Layton adds.Companies are currently prevented from talking to each other during the auction of government-owned spectrum. But once the process draws to a close in April — helping settle the value of businesses — analysts expect talks between telecoms and cable executives to resume.Verizon, fresh from its revised deal to buy Yahoo, has been linked with cable company Charter. France’s Altice, which owns the fourth-biggest cable player in the US, Cablevision, has said it will look for deals.Comcast, the cable company and owner of NBCUniversal, is also being linked with various assets should the AT&T-Time Warner deal succeed. Senior executives in the US telecoms sector believe the cable giant could look to mobile as its rivals consolidate. Dish, the satellite group that owns a slug of mobile spectrum, could also play a part.But it is T-Mobile USA, the fast-growing mobile player disrupting the telecoms market under the leadership of John Legere, that has become the centre of much of recent speculation.Dominik Klarmann, an analyst with HSBC, notes that the German company committed $10.5bn of funds to its US arm, well above the funding needs for the spectrum auction. “Deutsche Telekom is preparing to maximise its flexibility for M&A opportunities in the US,” he says.T-Mobile’s position of strength is somewhat unexpected. Five years ago Deutsche Telekom was nursing a hangover after a $39bn sale of its US business to AT&T was blocked by competition regulators.Three years later, merger talks with larger rival Sprint, which is controlled by Japan’s SoftBank, also faltered as the FCC, led by the more liberal-minded Tom Wheeler, publicly championed the benefits of a four player mobile market. The election of Mr Trump as president is set to change the scenario entirely, according to multiple bankers, lawyers and industry players, as his administration is expected to be more lenient on antitrust regulation.The most likely outcome, according to analysts, remains a renewed attempt at a Sprint merger with T-Mobile. Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank, is keen to take a much larger slice of the US telecoms market, which generated revenue of $285bn last year, according to Statista. Folding the two smaller networks together would create a more profitable three-player market.Braxton Carter, chief financial officer of T-Mobile, stoked speculation of a deal this week at a Deutsche Bank conference. He argued that the odds of a merger with Sprint had increased — with the caveat that antitrust lawyers would still stand in the way given previous mobile mergers have been blocked. As a result, a “very significant break-up fee” would be necessary for T-Mobile to come to the table, he said.But Mr Son is unlikely to be deterred by a break fee, given his history of bold dealmaking. The question that analysts are puzzling over is how the deal would be structured, given the desire of all parties to retain a significant stake in the consolidating US market.Sprint may have wanted to buy T-Mobile USA three years ago but now the German-controlled business is likely to be the dominant party in a merger, according to Exane BNP Paribas’s Sam McHugh.Sprint, which is 83 per cent owned by SoftBank, is worth $34bn but is highly leveraged and generating little cash. T-Mobile has a $51bn market value and is growing fast.The “Uncarrier” strategy of Mr Legere has paid off, as the decision to do away contract limitations and hidden fees played well with customers. T-Mobile has added 15.6m subscribers in the past three years as a result, while Sprint has lost 5.4m subscribers. T-Mobile’s momentum is reflected in its share price, which has risen 77 per cent over the past year. In contrast, its parent company’s shares are flat compared with a year ago. Deutsche Telekom’s 65 per cent stake in the fourth-largest US mobile player now represents 55 per cent of the value of Europe’s largest telecoms company. Mr Son told analysts in February that “we may buy, we may sell. Maybe a simple merger; we may be dealing with T-Mobile, we may be dealing with totally different people, different company.”Sprint is not the only potential suitor for T-Mobile, however. Mr Carter argued that convergence between mobile and cable groups was “a question of when, not if”, fuelling speculation that T-Mobile could be a partner for Comcast or Charter.That leaves the Germans with a “high-quality problem”, according to one senior banker, as it plots the best course to prepare for the 5G upgrade. Like its rivals, T-Mobile is facing network upgrade costs runnings to tens of billions of dollars and the prospect of synergies — estimated at $48bn by HSBC analysts in the case of a Sprint merger — will ensure that the main players keep their options open.The next steps in the US will be determined partly by Deutsche Telekom’s ambitions in Europe, where it has long been linked with an attempt to merge telecoms groups.Deutsche Telekom owns a 12 per cent stake in BT, which could have been used as the basis for a full takeover of the group, but telecoms executives with knowledge of the situation says that its interest has cooled over the past year because of Brexit, a plunging share price and a lengthy regulatory dispute. The US, meanwhile, has rarely looked more attractive as a place to invest.“The question is whether Deutsche wants to exit and pursue its long-held ambition of European consolidation. If it sells out, that could bring in $40bn, but there aren’t a lot of things it could buy,” the banker says. Dish, the satellite group led by billionaire Charlie Ergren, is the wild card in any US telecoms consolidation triggered by the end of the spectrum auction.Dish controls about 15 per cent of the industry’s spectrum capacity despite not owning its own wireless network. “Dish needs to do something,” John Legere, chief executive of T-Mobile USA, has said.Dish, and sister company EchoStar, have been linked with rivals in the satellite communications market such as Britain’s Inmarsat as it races to buy up more spectrum. It failed with a $2.2bn bid to buy LightSquared, the wireless broadband company now called Ligado, in 2014.Yet analysts argue that another option would be to sell Dish, or even just its spectrum, to a company that needs it more, such as Verizon.“Dish is [Verizon’s] best path to getting the capacity they need fast,” said Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research, noting that Verizon’s reintroduction of an unlimited data plan offering “will only hasten their need for additional capacity”.Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on Dish to “overweight” in January on the basis that it could be in Verizon’s sights, although there remains the issue that Mr Ergen’s voting shares control the satellite company. He has 80 per cent of Dish voting shares, which could be parlayed into an 8 per cent stake in Verizon.JPMorgan says Verizon and T-Mobile are the satellite company’s most likely buyers but argues that “we don’t see a Dish deal as anyone’s first choice”."

The changeover will take place prior to market open on March 13.Semiconductor maker Linear Technology, which was part of the S&P 500′s information technology sector, is being shuffled off following its acquisition by S&P 500 constituent Analog Devices, in a cash-and-stock deal announced last year that values the group at $14.8bn.The S&P 500 comprises large-cap US equities and includes about 500 leading companies covering approximately 80 per cent of available market capitalisation, according to its website.
7;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2017-02-22T12:58:09Z;Dish unexpectedly adds pay-TV customers in fourth quarter;;Dish Network added new pay-TV customers in the fourth quarter, defying expectations for further corrosion in its subscribers as people increasingly watch shows on streaming services such as Netflix.The pay-TV group controlled by satellite billionaire Charlie Ergen said it added 28,000 customers in the three months to the end of December, beating consensus forecasts for a loss of 87,000. The company lost 116,000 customers in the previous quarter.Dish also surpassed forecasts for profits, earning net income of $343m, or 70 cents a share, compared to projections of 67 cents a share, and after posting a loss of 27 cents a share a year ago.Dish, which has nearly 14m pay-TV customers, has looked to diversify from its declining satellite business, launching a cheaper streaming service, Sling TV, to compete with the likes of Netflix.The group has also bought up a trove of wireless airwaves, used to connected mobile phones, as part of its diversification strategy, in anticipation of an explosion in mobile video watching. The company has been rumoured as candidate for dealmaking with US telecoms groups under a more lenient Trump regulatory regime.
8;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2016-06-10T01:57:23Z;Foreign buyers snap up lowly-rated US corporate debt;$1.5bn of inflows over the week for funds invested in high-yield bonds;The rally in lowly-rated US corporate debt has attracted investors to the asset class for the first time in seven weeks, with foreign buyers lining up for the bonds as yields in Europe and Japan slide deeper into negative territory.Funds invested in high-yield US corporate bonds counted $1.5bn of inflows in the week to June 8, the highest level since early March when a rebound from a deep and chilling sell-off at the start of the year took hold, according to data provider EPFR.Corporate bonds have advanced alongside the bounce in crude prices as investors search for yield. The rise of negative bond yields across much of continental Europe and Japan has prompted a migration of investors into the US market, where returns are more appealing.Yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen to 5.04 per cent for double B rated US companies — the highest rating within the so-called junk bond space. Those levels, below a 7.1 per cent high hit in February, are the lowest in a year, data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch show.“It all starts with the risk-free rate,” said Jack Flaherty, the investment director of asset manager GAM. “You have $10tn of bonds that have now gone to zero or less . . . It forces people into longer duration and down in credit quality to get the yield they want.”The drop in borrowing costs has enticed lower-rated groups back to market. High-yield US bond sales have eclipsed $12bn already this week — the highest weekly level in seven months, according S&P unit LCD, which tracks bond offerings. The deals have included multibillion-dollar sales from US computer maker Dell and satellite television provider Dish Network.Investors expect the European Central Bank’s corporate bond-buying programme, which launched this week, to lift US company bond prices further.US junk bonds have returned 9.4 per cent since the year began, outpacing the 6.5 per cent gain by higher-rated investment-grade company paper and the 3.5 per cent climb by the benchmark S&P 500 stock index.“There is a feeding frenzy in the primary market for high yield and investment grade [debt],” said Jim Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel. “The [ECB’s corporate bond buying] is exacerbating the feeding frenzy. You have a mega investor in the game now . . . It means more crowding out. Central banks are systematically crowding out investors.”Flows into high-grade US bond funds as well as global debt portfolios also accelerated in the past week, the EPFR data showed. Investors added nearly $8bn overall to global bond funds. That included $2.3bn of inflows to US investment-grade corporate bond funds, their 11th consecutive week of fresh capital.Equity funds once again faced redemptions this year, suffering outflows of $2.6bn. UK stock funds, which have been pressured by the looming vote on the country’s membership within the EU, counted their seventh consecutive week of outflows. EPFR noted that the daily rate of redemptions from the UK funds slowed as the week progressed.
9;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Paramount revenues were down 1 per cent at $655m.Viacom is exploring a sale of a stake in Paramount following increasing pressure from investors to turn around its lagging performance.The company swung to a net profit of $303m, or 76 cents a share, from a loss of $53m, or 13 cents a share, a year ago, beating Wall Street forecasts of 74 cents a share.Adjusted to exclude the impact of a $784m restructuring charge in 2015, earnings dropped 35 per cent from $467m, or $1.16 a share, last year.Viacom has been rocked by evaporating audiences for its young-oriented channels, hitting ad sales and raising concerns among investors. Shares have fallen nearly 40 per cent in the last year.The company has come under activist pressure from SpringOwl Asset Management, which has called for the removal of its chief executive, Philippe Dauman, the senior management team, and the appointment of an independent chairman.Mr Dauman succeeded the ailing Sumner Redstone, 92, as chairman recently, over the objections of Shari Redstone, Mr Redstone’s daughter.Some pressure on the company was relieved last week when Viacom headed off a potential blackout of its channels on the Dish Network.Viacom said its multi-year contract renewal with the satellite TV provider, along with other distribution deals it has signed in the last year, would boost growth of the affiliate revenue it receives from the companies that carry its channels by “solid mid-single-digit” rates.But drama continues to swirl. The health and mental competency of Mr Redstone, who holds controlling stakes in Viacom as well as broadcaster CBS, is at the crux of a lawsuit filed by Manuela Herzer, his former girlfriend, challenging her removal as his primary caretaker.A trial is scheduled to begin next week.
11;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2016-04-22T11:27:36Z;Viacom/Dish Network: Sign o’ the times;The 80s were a long time ago;"To honour Prince upon his untimely death on Thursday, MTV cut its regular programming in favour of a marathon of the artist’s music videos. Fortunately for the 13m subscribers of satellite television provider Dish Network, a threatened termination of 18 Viacom channels — including MTV — had been averted just hours before as its existing contract was set to expire.Dish boss Charlie Ergen is a well-known critic of the escalating cost of content and has played hardball with networks several times before. Viacom, whose other stations include Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and BET, had been dropped by two small distributors in recent years. Its shares have fallen 60 per cent since 2014 as its ratings have plummeted. Mr Ergen also chided Viacom for selling content to Netflix, pointing out that consumers will not pay for the same shows in two places.The last minute deal that kept Viacom on Dish sent the network group’s shares up 13 per cent, or more than $2bn in aggregate. Without Dish, Viacom’s operating profit could have fallen by more than a tenth, according to analysts’ estimates. This would have threatened its dividend. Worse, had Dish deemed Viacom dispensable, Dish peers such as Comcast and AT&T might have been tempted to dump MTV et al as well.Whatever posture it takes toward content providers, Dish must worry about its own subscribers leaving if its content offering becomes too thin; nevertheless, Wells Fargo note that, even if 5 per cent of Dish subscribers jumped ship, savings in programming costs would still let it break even.Mr Ergen knows that pay-TV generally is a decaying business and has smartly rolled out a digital TV bundle called Sling. Viacom’s response to a digital world has been tardy. Its heyday coincided with the rise of Prince. That peerless artist managed to reinvent himself several times and stay relevant. Viacom has struggled to learn from his example.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
12;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2015-09-22T20:58:00Z;Intelsat looks to sell assets to cut debt;Satellite operator has approached potential buyers as it seeks to reduce $14bn debt load;Intelsat, the world’s largest commercial satellite operator in revenue terms, is exploring a sale of some strategic assets, as it seeks to pay off a portion of its $14bn debt pile, according to people familiar with the matter.The US-based company, which transmits television signals for broadcasters and images from US military drones, has hired Goldman Sachs to seek potential buyers, said people close to the company.Eutelsat, a rival French satellite operator, and John Malone’s Liberty Media have been approached by Intelsat’s bankers to gauge their interest in taking over some of the company’s assets, these people said. It is unclear whether either is keen to engage with the Luxembourg-domiciled group. Liberty tried to acquire the group in 2007 in a joint bid with Charlie Ergen’s EchoStar Communications.Other plausible buyers include rival operator SES of Luxembourg and Canada’s Telesat, as well as other private equity firms, said another person familiar with the sector.Talks with potential suitors are preliminary and Intelsat, which has revenues of about $2.4bn, could ultimately decide not to sell any of its assets.“We routinely evaluate strategic options to generate value for shareholders, employees and customers. As a matter of company policy, we do not comment on market rumours or speculation,” Intelsat said in an email seeking comment about the potential sale of assets.BC Partners and Silver Lake, the private equity firms which acquired the group in 2007 for $16.5bn, including $11bn in debt, are keen to sell some assets as part of a broader effort to reduce the company’s debt, said those close to the situation.Intelsat, which has an enterprise value of $15bn, is concerned about its debt as its bonds have been trading at high yields. A $2bn Intelsat senior unsecured bond maturing in 2021 has a 16 per cent yield and trades at 70 cents to the dollar, which indicates a high default risk.Famed for having broadcast Neil Armstrong’s walk on the moon in 1969, Intelsat has struggled in recent months to boost revenue growth as it faces increasing competition as well as pressure from declining US military spending.Fears of oversupply of so-called high-throughput satellites, which have a much larger transfer capacity than older satellites, have led many large investors to sell shares in the operator.Intelsat shares are down more than 54 per cent since the start of the year, a trend that reflects the broader challenge facing the company in generating new growth.The 51-year-old company, which operates a fleet of 50 satellites, carries one out of every four television channels in the world via its platforms, making it a key gateway connecting content providers to cable operators.Among its most valuable assets are its US and Latin American media unit, which distributes programming such as HBO series for broadcasters and cable companies such as Comcast across the globe.Intelsat also has a more sensitive US government and military related unit, which could be of interest to other buyout firms with a focus in the area, said a person familiar with the matter.Liberty Media and Eutelsat could not immediately be reached for comment.Goldman Sachs declined to comment.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi and Matthew Garrahan
13;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2015-08-27T17:27:46Z;Dish Networks/Sinclair: think local;Local broadcasters’ gravy train may be about to slow down;For the beleaguered US television industry, now does not seem to be a good time to risk slaughtering one of the few golden geese. Sinclair Broadcast Group, which runs local stations in the US, on Wednesday resolved a financial dispute with satellite TV distributor Dish Network. Dish will resume distributing 129 Sinclair stations across the country. There had been a blackout of one day as the two tangled over the terms of renewing their distribution agreement.Fighting with content providers is nothing new for Dish. Nearly half of recent content distribution disputes have involved the satellite company. Chief executive Charlie Ergen has been outspoken about restraining the rising cost of acquiring programming. But the disputes have usually centred on cable networks such as MTV. The fight with Sinclair is about free over-the-air television from the likes of ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC that local networks broadcast. A 1992 law governs retransmission consent, the fees local networks can charge cable and satellite providers.Only in recent years, have the local networks begun to exploit the “retrans” revenue opportunity. Research firm SNL Kagan estimates that in total, $6.3bn of retrans revenue is to be paid in 2015, growing from just $3.6bn two years ago. Sinclair itself had said that its retrans revenue will grow at an annual rate in the teens. Three-quarters of its agreements with pay-TV providers are up for renewal (and increase) in the next two years.But the retrans bonanza has attracted the attention the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecoms regulator. Its chairman Tom Wheeler, who has become more pro-consumer, has called for the FCC to review the system in September. The risk is that the escalating cost of pay-TV packages could lead to stricter regulation of retrans agreements.The dispute between Dish and Sinclair was not just about retrans revenue. Other issues include the distribution of a new Sinclair network on Dish. But the broader theme is about the power local TV stations have demonstrated by growing retrans revenue so quickly perhaps to the detriment of distributors, who then pass the cost on to consumers. Sinclair, by entering into a high-profile dispute just as regulators are increasing scrutiny, could be tempting fate. And somehow the much scorned distributors begin to look like victims.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
14;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2015-06-17T14:59:49Z;Deutsche Telekom scouts for alternative T-Mobile US bidder;Approach to Comcast yields nothing concrete but shows desire for rival to Ergen’s Dish;Deutsche Telekom has approached Comcast to gauge the US cable group’s interest in T-Mobile US, people familiar with the matter said, as it scrambles to find an alternative buyer to Dish Network or force Charlie Ergen’s satellite company to pay up.Nothing concrete has emerged out of Deutsche Telekom’s efforts to inject competitive tension into the auction of its $31.5bn US mobile business, one person said, adding that Comcast was still weighing its options following its failed attempt to acquire Time Warner Cable.Deutsche Telekom and Comcast declined to comment but a person close to Comcast said no conversations were taking place and described the idea of Comcast buying T-Mobile US as “ridiculous”.The German group has sounded out several other possible buyers in an effort to explore their interest in hammering out an alternative to the potential deal it is discussing with Dish, according to two people.One person said that this was part of Deutsche Telekom’s strategy to put pressure on Mr Ergen to come up with more attractive terms than those he has offered so far. News of Deutsche Telekom’s talks with Comcast came out in a German publication, Manager Magazin.Talks between Dish and T-Mobile are at an advanced stage, according to another person, who said a deal could be reached within a few weeks if the two parties managed to come to an agreement on valuation.Deutsche Telekom is concerned about a deal that includes a high portion of Dish shares, one person said. The German group would be more open to a deal with a higher cash component.Mr Ergen, who has amassed billions of dollars worth of wireless spectrum, is a former professional poker player who is known as a hard negotiator.Shares in T-Mobile US were up 2.4 per cent to $39.79 in mid-morning trading in New York.
15;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2015-06-04T22:50:12Z;Dish in talks to acquire T-Mobile US;New group would be able to use billions of dollars of ‘spectrum’;"Dish, the pay-TV group controlled by satellite billionaire Charlie Ergen, is in talks to acquire T-Mobile US, according to people briefed on the discussions, in what would be the latest in a string of deals in the media and telecoms sectors.The talks, first reported in the Wall Street Journal, are at a preliminary stage, the people said, although the companies are discussing an executive structure in which John Legere, chief executive of T-Mobile, would take the same job at the combined group, while Mr Ergen would become chairman.A merger of T-Mobile and Dish would come amid a wave of industry consolidation: Charter Communications is attempting a three-way deal with Time Warner Cable and Bright House to create a company worth roughly $90bn; AT&T is buying DirecTV for $49.5bn; and Verizon recently said it would acquire AOL.Shares in T-Mobile were up 4.05 per cent in New York trading, giving the company a market capitalisation of $31bn. Shares in Dish added 5 per cent, taking its market capitalisation to roughly $33bn.T-Mobile and Dish have openly discussed a partnership of some sort in recent months.In March, Braxton Carter, T-Mobile’s chief financial officer, said of Mr Ergen: “You look at what he is doing with some of his technologies, and that type of marriage could be very, very, very interesting, or partnership.”On a conference call with investors in May, Mr Ergen said: “We’re keeping all our options open. But obviously we admire what John [Legere] and his team have done at T-Mobile, and certainly we follow what they do.”A combined company would be able to sell bundled content and wireless telecoms services to T-Mobile’s 44.7m retail customers and Dish’s 13.8m satellite TV subscribers.It would also be able to deploy the billions of dollars of wireless airwaves or “ spectrum” that Mr Ergen has acquired in recent years as a hedge against the future of the US pay-TV industry, which is suffering from decline.Valuations, and a desire to control rather than share, makes this a trickier deal than it should beContinue readingAfter emerging as the second-largest bidder in a record-breaking $44.9bn auction of government airwaves this year, Dish now controls about 15 per cent of industry spectrum capacity, but has no obvious use for it.T-Mobile, the fourth-largest US wireless group, has been growing quickly in the past two years, adding 14m new customers as it waged a price war on its larger competitors. But it controls just 12 per cent of industry spectrum capacity, which can lead to inferior network coverage.Analysts were divided on the chances of a T-Mobile and Dish combination.David Phipps, an analyst at Citi, said he had “set a 25 per cent probability” on the deal and argued Dish was more likely to sell itself to Verizon, the largest US telecoms group.Verizon accounts for roughly 40 per cent of industry revenues but controls just 20 per cent of spectrum, leading some analysts to suggest it will need to acquire more airwaves to cope with an explosion in people watching videos on their smartphones.We now think the most likely option for Dish is a sale to Verizon. Verizon has a spectrum shortage vis-à-vis rivals and Dish’s spectrum could narrow its spectrum deficit“We now think the most likely option for Dish is a sale to Verizon. Verizon has a spectrum shortage vis-à-vis rivals and Dish’s spectrum could narrow its spectrum deficit,” said Mr Phipps.However, John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS, said he did not expect the talks to flush out a bid for Dish, noting that such a deal would dilute Verizon’s earnings.It is not clear that Verizon, which is already heavily indebted, could afford such a large purchase. In 2013 it took on $49bn of debt, the largest corporate bond sale in history, to help buy UK telecoms group Vodafone out of their US joint venture.14mNew customers gained by T-Mobile over past two yearsEarlier on Thursday, Mr Legere deleted a tweet that appeared to cast doubt on reports his company was in merger talks with Dish.Mr Legere, a prolific user of Twitter with 1.4m followers, linked to a piece of analysis discussing a merger of the two companies on the Re/Code website, describing the article as a “snarky sensational and shallow look at a rumour that deserves no comment”.“Sad to watch the level of writing @recode especially Ina,” Mr Legere added, in an apparent reference to the article’s author, Ina Fried, a senior editor at Re/Code. He later deleted both tweets."
16;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2015-03-17T18:18:56Z;Apple: unbundle of joy;Distributing TV is poor business but that won’t stop the group;Dealing with the Hollywood jet set seems glamorous at first. But once the stardust settles, their demands become exhausting. Pay TV distributors — Dish Network, Time Warner Cable — have repeatedly been locked in nasty disputes with content companies such as CBS and Viacom over so-called carriage agreements in recent years. Those deals dictate how much the distributors pay for programming. The leverage of top talent means content costs have risen faster than distributors can pass them on to consumers.And yet, there is a rush for internet-based television distribution. Late on Monday it was reported that Apple would join Dish Network and Sony as purveyors of a “skinny” TV bundle. Rather than paying $100 a month for hundreds of channels from traditional cable or satellite services, consumers would pay Apple perhaps $35 a month for a few, important channels. It is not clear that skinny bundles paired with fast internet service and say, Netflix, is great value. But the à la carte approach, and similar bundles, is gaining traction.If Apple wants to get into the business of bare-knuckle negotiations with TV studios, cable companies may wish them good luck. One small cable company, Suddenlink, recently dropped Viacom for six months because its demands were so onerous.The more prosperous destiny of cable companies is selling broadband internet. Already half of internet traffic is dedicated to video and, according to Macquarie, broadband usage will double between 2012 and 2017. The bank estimates broadband revenue for big cable companies will grow a healthy 11 per cent annually between 2014 and 2016. Two of those, Cablevision and Charter Communications, have now subtly shifted their personas to “connectivity” companies (Cablevision has even unveiled a mobile WiFi phone service called Freewheel). One sticking point in an already concentrated US broadband market, however: regulators imposing “net neutrality” could be even tougher adversaries than Hollywood moguls.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
17;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2015-01-30T21:57:29Z;Dish spends $13.3bn in spectrum auction;Charlie Ergen takes central role in the future shape of the US mobile phone industry;"Charlie Ergen, the satellite TV billionaire, has bought $13.3bn of airwaves in a record-breaking auction of government-owned wireless spectrum, giving him a central role in the future shape of the US mobile phone industry.The aggressive push by Dish, Mr Ergen’s satellite TV company, means the group ended up spending more than Verizon, the largest US telecoms group, which spent $10.4bn. The largest bidder was AT&T, the number two operator, which spent $18.2bn.Dish already controls about 12 per cent of industry spectrum capacity but does not operate a mobile phone network, meaning it has little use for all of its airwaves. However Mr Ergen has spoken openly about his desire to diversify beyond the company’s core satellite TV business.Analysts say Mr Ergen, a former professional poker player, now has three choices: buy one of the smaller mobile phone networks, Sprint or T-Mobile US; sell his company to Verizon; or split Dish into two — a legacy satellite TV business and a new infrastructure group that leases wireless spectrum to others.Dish described the auction, which raised $44.9bn, as a “win for the American taxpayer” but said it could not discuss its plans for the spectrum due to “anti-collusion rules”.Shares in Dish, which have risen 14 per cent in the last three months, lost 4 per cent on Friday in reaction to the outlay. Analysts had expected it to spend between $2bn and $6bn.Dish participated in the auction through two smaller companies that are able to claim a 25 per cent rebate, meaning its total cost will eventually be closer to $10bn.Verizon ended up with much less spectrum than predicted and Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said its share of spectrum compared to its share of industry revenue “was even more mismatched than we expected”.Analysts say Verizon will have to find a way of accessing Dish’s unused spectrum, either by buying the company or by coming to an arrangement with Mr Ergen.AT&T also bought less than expected, with some analysts predicting it would spend up to $22bn.John Stankey, chief strategy officer at AT&T, said: “Growth in our customers’ mobile data usage continues to explode, driven by mobile video traffic. This spectrum investment will be critical to AT&T staying ahead of customer demand and facilitate the next generation of mobile video entertainment.”The sale of mid-band spectrum is the highest revenue generating auction in the 20 years since the Federal Communications Commission started selling off the government’s airwaves. Some analysts predicted the auction would raise as little as $15bn, and the fierce competition took many by surprise.The total haul is more than double the amount the government raised last time it auctioned airwaves in 2008, when the smartphone revolution was still in its early stages.However it comes at a time of considerable capital expenditure in the industry. Last year, Verizon completed its $130bn purchase of Vodafone’s stake in its wireless division, while AT&T is buying DirectTV, the satellite broadcaster, for $48.5bn and two Mexican telecoms networks for around $4bn.It also comes amid a bruising industry price war, in which Sprint and T-Mobile have tried to steal market share from their larger competitors by offering eye-catching deals. AT&T and Verizon have responded by sacrificing profitability to try to stop customers defecting.T-Mobile spent $1.8bn while Sprint, the cash-strapped number three network, decided to sit the auction out and save its financial firepower for another auction due in 2016 or 2017, which is expected to raise even more cash.Shares in AT&T fell 0.1 per cent on Friday, while Verizon slipped 0.9 per cent and T-Mobile US added 2.1 per cent."
18;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2015-01-29T23:51:59Z;US spectrum auction raises record $44.9bn;Wireless groups snap up airwaves amid explosive demand for mobile video and data;US wireless groups have snapped up $44.9bn of airwaves following a record-breaking auction of government-owned spectrum that underlines the explosion in demand for mobile video and data.The sale of the mid-band spectrum is the highest revenue generating auction in the 20 years since the Federal Communications Commission started selling off the government’s airwaves, and the fierce competition took many observers by surprise. Some analysts predicted the auction would raise as little as $15bn.The total haul is more than double the amount the government raised last time it auctioned airwaves in 2008, when the smartphone revolution was still in its early stages.It is not yet clear which of the large telecoms groups have been the biggest bidders, although AT&T and Verizon are thought to have been very active participants. T-Mobile US and Dish are also expected to have taken part.Sprint, the cash-strapped number three US mobile group, decided to sit the auction out and keep its firepower for the next spectrum auction in 2016 or 2017, which is expected to raise an even greater sum.Share prices in telecoms groups have suffered in recent months as the FCC published updates on the auction proceeds, and analysts say those companies which have spent the most will suffer more stock pressure in the near term. This also comes amid a bitter industry price war, with T-Mobile and Sprint offering eye-catching deals in an attempt to steal market share from larger rivals.The so-called AWS-3 spectrum that was on sale this time is especially suited to carrying large amounts of data and will help telecoms groups keep pace with the surge in consumers using mobile phones to download photos, music and apps.Tom Wheeler, FCC chairman, described the sale as “by far the highest-earning spectrum auction the US has ever seen” and said it “marked a new era in spectrum policy, where a collaborative and unprecedented effort resulted in new commercial access”.Around $20bn of the proceeds will be used to reduce the US deficit, which was $483bn last year, with the remainder going towards various government broadband initiatives, the FCC said.$20bnProceeds that will be used to help cut the US deficitAnalysts at New Street Research last week said they thought AT&T had spent up to $22bn in the auction, more than Verizon, the largest US wireless group.The auction comes at a time of considerable capital expenditure for AT&T, which is also buying DirectTV, the satellite broadcaster, for $48.5bn and two Mexican telecoms networks for around $4bn. Last week, the company said it had secured two credit agreements worth $11.2bn and in October it sold $1.295bn of bonds in Taiwan.On Thursday evening AT&T said it would raise a further $2.6bn in unsecured notes.The auction results could lead to a reassessment of Dish, the satellite TV group run by Charlie Ergen, which controls about 12 per cent of the industry’s spectrum capacity. Shares in the group, which have added about 18 per cent in the last three months, rose 2.73 per cent by the close in New York.Mr Ergen has sought to diversify beyond the company’s core television business and many telecoms executives think he will emerge from the auction as a big player in the wireless industry.Analysts have suggested that Dish could buy one of the smaller carriers — Sprint or T-Mobile — or sell itself to Verizon, while others think Mr Ergen’s best option is to split Dish in two: a legacy satellite TV business and a wholesale wireless infrastructure company that leases spectrum to others.
19;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2015-01-09T17:20:28Z;Pay TV: bundle of joy;Internet TV is for ‘cord nevers’ not ‘cord-cutters’;Opening the monthly US cable TV bill is a punch to the gut. Add $19.99 for this fee to $7.99 for that service and the total bill comes in well more than $100. This week, however, came something much cheaper. Satellite TV provider Dish Network unveiled its highly anticipated “over the top” package that will give subscribers access to a select group of networks, including the sine qua non ESPN, via the internet for $20 a month. That seems far better than $100, until you discover what is and is not in the $20 package.The traditional cable or satellite TV bundle is not limited to just a couple of hundred channels. It also extends to broadband internet, a digital recorder and the ability to watch programmes on TV, phone, PC or tablet. The Dish service, called Sling TV, is simply the ability to watch ESPN and 11 other networks of varying popularity, live on one device at a time. Notably the broadcast networks, ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, are not included. Adding in other ad hoc streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, or HBO, as well as the fast internet connection needed to consume this content, will total about $100. Not so cheap after all.So Dish is not for “cord-cutters” — those abandoning traditional pay TV. Sling TV is targeting an untapped segment called “cord-nevers” — the 10m US households who became adults eschewing pay TV entirely. These hipsters would never do anything so old fashioned as to buy a cable TV package, but may be cajoled into buying piecemeal services. A la carte is rarely cheap, but it suits those who want to pick and choose.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
20;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Dish Networks: shuffling the deck;Charlie Ergen may have a hot hand, but how he plays his cards is the question;Joker, wild card or king? Charlie Ergen, founder of US pay-TV provider Dish Network represents every card in the deck. The core Dish business remains dull and stagnant. Dish still boasts 14m subscribers to its satellite service but that number does not move much any more (and when it does it shrinks as it did in the third quarter by 22,000). The intrigue at Dish is about everything else it is – a mobile phone network, satellite broadband provider, internet TV service, or industry consolidator. Which of those cards get played, and when, is not obvious but many believe he has a hot hand.With Mr Ergen’s control of Dish (he owns more than half of the company) comes the freedom to experiment. Most recently, he has been willing to drop Time Warner networks including CNN because he is willing to wager that the benefit to cash flow will make up for subscriber defections. Dish is set to launch its internet-based TV offering later this year. He says it will cost a slim $30 per month for a handful of channels, including ESPN, targeted at millennial men. Dish is also touting the broadband service it delivers via its satellite. It only has 550,000 customers now but Mr Ergen thinks the potential customer base is in the millions.But while internet TV and satellite broadband have potential, the core driver of Dish shares is the spectrum holdings that Mr Ergen has carefully collected. He could merge Dish with Sprint or T-Mobile but it is not obvious that the band of spectrum Dish has is really what either of those second-tier players wants.The Dish spectrum may be worth between $20bn and $25bn. At its current share price of $64, that implies a modest valuation of 5 times cash flow for the traditional pay TV business (broadband and internet TV are not meaningful yet). Analysts have noticed the discount and have price targets on average of about $70 with a high of $100. That is a lot of chips to be won. If only Mr Ergen wasn’t holding his cards close to his chest.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
21;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2014-10-10T17:04:51Z;TV sports fees: regional differences;Customers shoud be allowed to choose the channels they want and how they view them;Now that the Los Angeles Dodgers have been eliminated from the Major League Baseball playoffs, their fans won’t see the team on television for months. That’s a familiar void. A nasty local pay-TV dispute prevented most LA baseball enthusiasts from watching games this past season. Recent national sports rights deals suggest that there is no ceiling on what networks will pay for live programming. The LA imbroglio cautions against that view.The record $2bn price paid for the Dodgers in 2012 stemmed from the its local TV contract, then up for renewal. Time Warner Cable, usually a distributor of existing networks, set up the SportsNet LA network and paid $8bn to the Dodgers for the right to broadcast games locally for 25 years. Sports Net LA was then distributed to TWC customers. But 70 per cent of pay-TV subscribers in LA rely on other distributors, such as AT&T, DirecTV, and Dish Network, which balked at paying the $4/month per subscriber SportsNet LA demanded (most channels cost less than $1). The limited SportsNet distribution forced TWC to slightly lower its growth outlook.Regional sports TV is a perennial flash point. A Houston network went bankrupt when it failed to find enough distribution. The distributors are in a tricky spot, too. Fans treasure sports but hate soaring bills. Yet their ire is directed not towards teams who sell pricey rights but at the middlemen who pass on the costs.The National Basketball Association deal with two networks raised the annual fees the two pay to the league from about $1bn to $2.6bn. The recent NFL deal with DirecTV was a jump of 50 per cent. The cable bundle, once a great deal, is now hard to justify. The path to stopping bill creep (bad for consumers) or further cord cutting (bad for distributors) is emerging. Allow customers to choose the channels they want and how they view them – on TV, online, or on mobile. Otherwise the gatekeepers still decide who watches what, when, and at which price.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
22;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2014-08-21T21:10:44Z;Gore sues Al Jazeera America;;Al Gore, the former US vice-president and co-founder of Current TV, has alleged Al Jazeera America “manufacture[d]” claims on $65m related to its purchase of Current TV so that the television network could curry favour with US distributors.In a lawsuit unsealed on Thursday, Mr Gore and Joel Hyatt, another Current founder, accused the US arm of the Qatar-based news network of attempting to misuse the funds to resolve issues with Time Warner Cable, Dish Network, DirecTV, CBS and AT&T.The suit accused Al Jazeera of employing an “underhanded tactic of using the escrow balance . . . as a reservoir from which to pull money to buy favour with its distributors”.Al Jazeera bought Current in 2013 for a reported $500m. The sale agreement called for $85m of the purchase price to be put in escrow until July 2 2014, at which time the remaining funds would be paid out to Mr Gore and the other former Current TV owners.Such escrow accounts are typically used to cover potential costs for claims related to the business being bought.“The complaint is about Al Jazeera making excuses for avoiding its financial obligations,” said David Boies, Mr Gore’s attorney, who also represented the former vice-president in his lawsuit against George W Bush following the contentious 2000 presidential election.Al Jazeera America declined to comment on the allegations. The television network said in a statement on Tuesday the suit was “an ordinary commercial dispute, of the type that courts decide all the time”. It called Mr Boies a “celebrity trial lawyer” and said the lawsuit was “designed to grab headlines with misleading accusations”.The crux of the complaint centres around what Mr Gore and Mr Hyatt depicted as Al Jazeera’s attempts to use $65m of the funds in escrow to cover costs associated with a terminated contract with Time Warner Cable as well as disputes with the other providers.The lawsuit said the claims were “baseless and fraudulent” and not permitted under the terms of the sale.In a sharply worded account, the suit characterised Al Jazeera’s actions as an attempt to get Current’s former owners “to foot the bill for the financially disastrous post-acquisition business decisions . . . made by [Al Jazeera’s] executives.”The suit alleged Al Jazeera wanted to use the funds to “make payments to its distributors to keep them happy without spending a dime of its own money”.Al Jazeera “hoped that currying favour with the distributors in this way would encourage them to renew or extend the distribution agreements [Al Jazeera America] inherited from Current TV notwithstanding [Al Jazeera America]’s dismal ratings,” the suit said.At the time of its 2013 purchase of Current, Al Jazeera had struggled to gain traction with cable and satellite operators which were wary of carrying its Al Jazeera English channel, first launched in 2006.Current TV reached about 60m of the US’s 100m homes, compared with 4.7m for Al Jazeera English. The deal was seen as a way for Al Jazeera to extend its reach – even though Time Warner Cable, the second-largest US cable provider, immediately dropped Current, cutting its reach to 41m homes.According to the lawsuit, Mr Gore and his co-owners “initially harboured serious reservations about selling Current Media to [Al Jazeera]” but eventually agreed on the grounds that boosting Al Jazeera’s presence in the US “would likely result in a significant improvement of its journalism not just in the United States, but across its global properties in the Middle East and elsewhere”.The court filings released on Thursday included a number of redactions requested by both sides in the case, some of which Mr Gore and Mr Hyatt are challenging.“When our remaining allegations are unsealed, as we are requesting, the extent of Al Jazeera’s commercial misconduct will become clearer,” Mr Boies said.Dawn Bridges, Al Jazeera America spokeswoman, said: “The plaintiffs and we have asked for certain portions of the complaint that deal with confidential business practices to be maintained under seal.”shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
23;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2014-05-29T17:58:43Z;Dish Network signs up to accepting Bitcoin;;Dish Network, the US satellite broadcaster, will become the largest company to accept payment in Bitcoin, underscoring how a tumbling exchange rate and security problems have failed to halt the march of the fledgling digital currency.Beneath the headlines about collapsed Bitcoin exchanges and bitter lawsuits, merchants are continuing to sign up to accept the currency using intermediaries that convert Bitcoin payments immediately into legal tender.Dish said on Thursday that it is to sign up with Coinbase, a San Francisco company backed by Netscape founder Marc Andreessen, which boasts 31,000 merchant customers.Coinbase will accept Bitcoin from Dish customers and pay the company in dollars, so Dish is not exposed to the wild price swings that have bedevilled Bitcoin.“This is a large step forward in the growing momentum of customers paying companies in Bitcoin for things we do every day, like watching premium TV,” said Fred Ehrsam, the former Goldman Sachs trader who is co-founder of Coinbase.Dish beams pay-TV to more than 14m homes and boasts annual revenues of almost $14bn.“We always want to deliver choice and convenience for our customers and that includes the method they use to pay their bills,” said Bernie Han, the company’s chief operating officer.“Bitcoin is becoming a preferred way for some people to transact and we want to accommodate those individuals.”As interest in Bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currencyThe number of Bitcoin transactions has stabilised this year at between 50,000 and 80,000 per day, after peaking above 100,000 at the height of the hype around the digital currency late last year, according to the research website Blockchain.info.Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous computer scientist to be an alternative to government currencies and to create a way for moving money outside of the expensive and highly regulated banking system. Transactions are processed across a network of volunteer computers and recorded in an online ledger.Coinbase is one of a growing army of companies building tools to make the use of Bitcoin easier for merchants and customers, despite concern about the robustness of the open source technology underlying the currency.Dish joins a roster of merchant users that has swelled from 17,000 at the start of this year. Coinbase’s other users include the retailer Overstock.com, the dating website Okcupid and the online learning business Khan Academy.BitPay, another service that instantly swaps payments for legal tender, has also been claiming strong growth in merchant numbers. It said this month that it processes more than $1m in transactions a day for 30,000 merchants, 50 per cent of which are in the US and 30 per cent in Europe.It recently signed a deal to integrate its technology with Toshiba cash registers in the hope of encouraging more small businesses to accept Bitcoin.
24;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2014-05-22T03:21:55Z;Dish Network ponders options after AT&T deal for DirecTV;;When AT&T announced its $49bn agreed bid for DirecTV this week, the deal appeared to leave Dish Network and the company’s one time poker-playing chairman, Charlie Ergen, out in the cold.In the wake of the deal, shares in Dish have fallen almost 6 per cent reflecting a belief among investors that the DirecTV bid, like Sprint’s potential offer to purchase T-Mobile US, in effect removes another potential strategic partner.But is Mr Ergen, who co-founded Dish, holding a busted hand, or could he still come out ahead in the restructuring of the US video, broadband and mobile communications markets?Dish, now the second-largest satellite TV operator in the US, has built a sizeable spectrum portfolio by buying satellite spectrum from bankrupt companies and persuading US regulators to reclassify it for use as a fixed wireless broadband network.Under the agreement, Dish has two years to begin building the network, find a partner to help fund the considerable capital expenditure required, or cash out and sell the spectrum.Before the AT&T deal was announced, most analysts had thought Mr Ergen would either sell the spectrum or the whole company to an established mobile network operator, or challenge regulators by once again proposing a merger with DirecTV. Now they say his options look more limited.“Dish Network has just been left standing,” says Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson, who also casts doubt on suggestions that Verizon Communications, which operates the FiOS fibre-optic broadband, telecoms and TV service, could bid for Dish. “That Verizon might be a buyer is more wishful thinking than it is analysis,” he says.Moody’s analysts agree a bid from Verizon is “highly unlikely”, adding: “Verizon would be more likely to expand its FiOS build out and invest more in content aggregation and distribution (video on demand and OTT) such as it has begun doing via its joint venture with Redbox.”Convergence often turns out to be siren song for dealmaking in communications world, writes Richard Waters.Continue readingAnother option mooted by some analysts would be for Dish to counterbid for DirecTV. But Mr Ergen appeared to rule that out during a call with analysts to discuss the company’s first-quarter results 10 days ago, when he acknowledged that Dish was not in a financial position to outbid AT&T for DirecTV, or Sprint and its Japanese parent, SoftBank, for T-Mobile USNevertheless, Moody’s analysts argue that if Dish is to pursue its plan for a fixed wireless broadband network, its only option may be through a deal with T-Mobile US.“The company has enough capital and financial flexibility to buy control of T-Mobile, but not enough to fund the capital that T-Mobile will need to compete with the capital spending of AT&T and Verizon Wireless, and not enough capital to build out its fixed wireless network,” they said in a note this week.Mr Ergen also appears to see this as a possibility. Asked whether Dish would be interested in bidding for T-Mobile US if regulators blocked a Sprint bid, he said: “If Sprint didn’t proceed or was denied, then T-Mobile would have strategic interest to us.”US telecoms company now has all TV possibilities coveredContinue readingMr Ergen may be hoping that Sprint does indeed bid for T-Mobile US and that regulators reject the combination, providing Dish with the opportunity to buy control at a discounted price.Dish would still need another deep-pocketed partner that might have been DirecTV if not for the acquisition agreement, say Moody’s analysts. “The question is: who is willing to be a partner to Dish’s controlling shareholder, Charlie Ergen, who has been known to end other partnerships in court and likes to maintain control?”Mr Ergen is holding his cards close to his chest. Explaining his strategy to journalists last week. he said: “When I used to play poker and everybody was throwing chips and betting crazy on the table and I had really good cards, I always felt it was better just to sit back and watch them go at it . . . every time they went at it, I’d learned something. And . . . as I sat back, they didn’t learn anything about what I had. I learnt to trust my cards.”He added: “I wasn’t a very good poker player, but when a bunch of drunken fools were throwing money around, occasionally I was able to pick up a pot at the end of the day.”
25;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2014-03-26T22:24:43Z;Deal talk boosts Dish and DirecTV shares;;Shares in Dish Network and DirecTV, the US satellite TV operators, rose sharply on Wednesday after reports that Charlie Ergen, Dish’s chairman, had approached Mike White, DirecTV chief executive, last month suggesting a merger.The initial report by Bloomberg, which cited people with knowledge of the matter, was not confirmed by either company. Dish’s shares closed more than 6 per cent higher at $62.09, while DirecTV gained 5.7 per cent to $77.34.Analysts noted that Mr Ergen might be hoping that in the wake of the proposed $42bn Comcast acquisition of Time Warner Cable, US regulators might be more inclined to accept a merger between satellite TV operators than they were 12 years ago when a similar proposal was blocked.A combined Dish-DirecTV would have about 40m subscribers, about 30 per cent more than Comcast-Time Warner Cable after expected divestitures.While acknowledging that a deal between Dish and DirecTV could yield “staggeringly large” synergies, Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson warned in a note to investors late on Wednesday that “the odds of successfully completing a merger must be deemed relatively low”.Mr Moffett and other analysts argue that while Comcast’s acquisition of Time Warner Cable could still face regulatory hurdles, “it doesn’t raise any of the same horizontal concentration issues as DirecTV/Dish Network”.The US justice department and the Federal Communications Commission are expected to focus on whether Comcast’s scale in broadband and/or video creates undue market power in negotiations with programmers and content creators. However, the number of competitors would not be reduced because geographically there is limited overlap.In contrast, Mr Moffett argues, “a DirecTV/Dish Network merger would reduce the number of pay TV competitors in every market in the US”.“From where we stand, the odds of a successful (satellite TV) merger, look very, very low,” he said.
26;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2014-03-05T19:42:13Z;Dish / Disney: stream of consciousness;The field of internet-based TV distributors is getting crowded;Internet television is here to stay. The question is where consumers choose to buy it. Netflix’s fantastic growth has stemmed from the complacency of big cable and satellite TV providers, who have remained focused on protecting $100 bundles of dozens of channels, most of which customers never watch.But Dish Network and Disney struck a landmark deal this week, demonstrating that legacy TV distributors can embrace creative ways of delivering content. Their inherent advantages (deep pockets, relationships with networks, and their broadband service) make them obvious innovators in content delivery – if they overcome inertia.This week’s deal sets out broadly how Dish will stream Disney programming, such as ABC and ESPN, over its planned internet TV service. Importantly, Disney insisted that Dish’s commercial-skipping “AutoHop” service be disabled for three days after the original broadcast, to protect advertisers. The details of how the service will be priced and distributed are still unknown. But a $20-$30 monthly service, including a package of Disney stations, could be one vision. Dish’s subscriber base is vast (14m) but eroding. An internet TV service would offset that erosion.Another question is how other distributors, whose TV businesses it will threaten, will react. As usual the content producer, in this case Disney, has the advantage over the content distributor. Its shares rallied 3 per cent on the announcement of the deal. The field of internet-based TV distributors is getting crowded, with Dish and impending offerings from Verizon, Sony and perhaps Apple and Google.The flaw in cable bundles for consumers was all the unwanted content. Ironically, the rush of a la carte offerings may make buying cumbersome and pricey for buyers to get exactly what they want.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
27;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2014-02-23T16:46:21Z;Dish Network: a platter of choices;Satellite TV operator is facing challenges on several fronts;Charlie Ergen, chairman of satellite television provider Dish Network, was facing a tough time to start with. Pay TV already has high levels of penetration in the US and Dish has to compete with cable offerings that can bundle in the internet at faster speeds than satellite broadband can offer. Competition from the likes of Netflix and Hulu is also growing. Dish, the number three in the pay TV market, ended 2013 with 14.1m subscribers which is more or less where it has been since 2009. But as if this mature background was not enough, Dish now has to deal with the proposed union of Comcast and Time Warner Cable (numbers one and four in the market, respectively).To stay young and fresh, Dish has been buying wireless spectrum . And in share price terms at least, the move has paid off. In spite of the lack of growth prospects in the core satellite TV business, its shares have risen 65 per cent over the past year. But Dish’s strategy is not yet clear.One option would be to sell the spectrum to a big telecoms company, such as AT&T. Alternatively, it could use the spectrum to create its own wireless broadband services, although that would mean a longer route to realising value.But it could be part of a bigger plan to either sell the company entirely or else pursue a merger with fellow satellite TV provider DirecTV (the number two in the pay TV market). Such a deal has been talked about for some time and would make sense for the cost savings and the potential to create a stronger competitor to cable. There is debate over how the Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up would affect this prospect. It could herald more consolidation or, perhaps, throw a spanner in the works. If the Comcast/TWC deal secures approval, regulators may be less inclined to agree to further consolidation.At current levels, Dish’s stock is an option on a sale of the spectrum or the company, or a DirecTV merger. Anything else and investors are probably paying too much.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
28;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Pirates a moving target for pay-TV providers;Fluid nature of pirated decryption hampers legal clampdown;"Hacking into pay-television channels is a growing business and a potentially serious crime. Last July, South Korean satellite receiver manufacturer Vicxon was ordered to pay just under $28m damages to US satellite service provider Dish Network for importing devices that enabled users to avoid paying TV subscriptions.Meanwhile, this January, a man was sentenced in Germany to 18 months in prison for illegally selling on access to Sky Deutschland, the pay-TV operator, the length of sentence suggesting the big sums of money involved.But while the legal penalties for pay-TV hacking – more properly known as pirate decryption – can be severe, public attitudes towards the crime are often ambivalent.A study published in November by the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights found that despite high reported levels of belief in intellectual property rights, EU citizens often possess a contradictory tolerance of the practice.Some 42 per cent of respondents said they found accessing copyright-protected material acceptable it if was for personal use, with illegal downloaders and decrypters (taken as a single group) more highly represented among the young (especially among those under 24), among men, and people educated beyond the age of 20. The greater level of tolerance among the young and educated does not bode well for providers in the future.The concepts, if not the practices, behind pirate decryption of pay TV are fairly simple. Pay-TV channels protect their content by scrambling sound and images; to unscramble broadcasts, viewers need to buy a smart card reader that exchanges a signal with the television provider and authorises access.Pirate decrypters can use various means to bypass this process. They can hack into the card itself, by using special equipment to change the its internal information so that the user appears to have paid for services, or by cloning the card.Far more common is card sharing. Also known as internet key sharing, this involves the owner of a single satellite receiver leaving their card intact but sharing content with a potentially large pool of other users via broadband, thus slashing subscription costs.While there are some small, informal card-sharing groups, this method of decryption is typically a commercial operation in which content access is sold on to a large number of people at a substantial discount to the market price.Piracy moves as rapidly as the television industry itself. In 2014, predicts anti-piracy service Irdeto, piracy of internet protocol TV – television streamed live via private IP networks – will overtake card sharing, driven mainly by international demand for live sports coverage.There are no clear figures on the global extent of pirate decryption, and not solely because pay-TV hackers keep as low a profile as possible.Sheila Cassells, executive director of the Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance says: “It can be difficult for the public to get a clear picture, because the cases that come to light of criminals being caught are just the tip of the iceberg. [TV companies] are secretive at times, because they don’t necessarily want to draw attention to criminal methods.”She adds: “As for the people who are committing these offences, we believe there is an organised crime element behind it. This type of crime is quite fluid and dynamic, and criminals change their locations quite quickly. China, Russia and Turkey are key areas, but we also see issues in places such as the Netherlands, Germany and the UK.”One problem is that the sale of pirated decryption services operates in a market that comes in shades from black to grey. At one end are consumers who simply do not want to pay; at the other are viewers accessing content they might be prepared to pay for but which is not available in their region.The latter camp consists of spontaneous groups, such as fans of a particular show that is not legally available in their country, and more fixed groups, such as ethnic minorities who find the provision of programmes in their mother language is limited in their country of residence. This grey market is widespread in Europe, for example, where satellite signals span national borders.Fighting off such attacks requires broadcasters to be nimble, as hackers in the past have found ways around well established security systems. Protection from pirate decrypters is feasible, nonetheless, through such measures as firewalls created by anti-piracy specialists.These measures need regular monitoring, and it is essential for companies not to be complacent about their level of protection, Ms Cassells warns. “Protecting yourself from this type of crime isn’t just about protection technology – you need to update it and refresh it regularly.”"

The Blockbuster stores cover 108 cities in Mexico, and are mainly located in the B and C demographic areas, which will expand the customer base of Grupo Elektra.The company already considers its mission to be contributing to build the middle class in the countries where it operates (Mexico, the US, Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, Panama and El Salvador). It says it will add Banco Azteca financial services and boost the range of electronics available at the stores, and that the purchase will boost Elektra’s sales area by 7 per cent.Luis Niño de Rivera, CEO of Banco Azteca, said:The purchase of Blockbuster México is a step towards the creation of high-quality, accesible services for increasingly demanding Mexican consumers. This transaction will provide a new range of vanguard products and entertainment systems.Elektra is buying Blockbuster México from Blockbuster LLC, a unit of satellite pay TV provider DISH Network. The Mexican operations were one of Blockbuster’s most profitable. To maintain that trend, Elektra is keeping Blockbuster México CEO Edward Argüelles in his job.As Niño de Rivera says: “This transaction will provide a new range of vanguard products and entertainment systems.”An upwardly mobile move then.
30;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-12-17T18:00:42Z;Sprint teams up with Dish for wireless service;;Sprint Nextel and Dish Network, the US satellite TV operator, plan to build an experimental fixed wireless broadband network in Texas that will launch by the middle of next year and will then be expanded to other markets.The partnership between Sprint, the third-largest US mobile operator, and Dish could signal a warming of relations between the two rivals following Dish’s failed attempts this year to acquire both Clearwire and Sprint. Sprint eventually acquired Clearwire and Japan’s SoftBank then bought a large majority stake in Sprint.The move could also indicate that Dish, which has acquired a sizeable wireless spectrum portfolio, intends to push ahead with its plans to build a nationwide wireless broadband network using LTE technology.However, the trial network, which will be based on the TDD version of LTE favoured by Sprint and will be built in Corpus Christi, Texas, will use Sprint’s 2.5GHz spectrum.Sprint, which is in the middle of a massive infrastructure upgrade project that will also enable it to host other network operators on its cell sites, has long been viewed as a logical partner for Dish whose outspoken chairman, Charlie Ergen, has made no secret of his wireless telephony ambitions.Under the terms of the agreement, Dish engineers will deploy roof-top antennas in some locations, and use in-home antennas in other places.“With millions underserved by inadequate broadband, the potential to bring a high-speed fixed wireless solution is very compelling to both Dish and Sprint,” said Tom Cullen, who is in charge of corporate development at Dish. Michael Schwartz, his counterpart at Sprint, added: “This trial with Dish has great potential as it combines the key capabilities and assets of both companies to provide another option to customers with limited broadband access.”Sprint will be Dish’s second partner for a fixed wireless broadband offering. This year the satellite TV provider, which has 14m satellite TV customers, announced a partnership with Ntelos, a smaller regional mobile operator, to provide a similar service in Virginia.
31;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-12-12T16:46:26Z;Curtains for Blockbuster’s remaining UK stores;;The final curtain has descended on the UK arm of Blockbuster, the struggling video rental business that entered administration in October.The administrator Moorfields said on Thursday that the last 91 stores are closing and over 800 jobs will be lost.Blockbuster initially went into administration in January as its business model struggled to compete against rivals including Netflix and Lovefilm that allow customers to stream films directly to devices such as televisions and tablets.In March the company was given a second chance after its purchase by Gordon Brothers Group, a US private equity firm. But the failure to secure licensing rights from Dish Network, Blockbuster US’s parent company, for an online service led to the company falling into administration again.A joint statement issued by administrators Simon Thomas and Nick O’Reilly said: “We were unable to secure a buyer for the group as a going concern and as a result had to take the regrettable action to close the remaining stores.”The news comes at the end of a year in which the British high street suffered a series of failures. In January camera retailer Jessops and entertainment products chain HMV collapsed within days of Blockbuster as they also struggled to adapt to online competition. Fashion retailers Republic and Nicole Farhi, as well as shoe retailer Barratts followed later in the year.The last Blockbuster stores will cease trading on December 16 with all remaining stock sold off at up to 90 per cent discount.
32;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-12-12T00:30:30Z;Centerbridge in $3.3bn LightSquared bid;;Private equity firm Centerbridge Partners has bid $3.3bn for LightSquared, the wireless telecoms group which was backed by Philip Falcone’s Harbinger Capital, beating a rival offer from Dish Network, the US satellite-television provider controlled by Charlie Ergen.The Centerbridge offer, made just before a bankruptcy court-imposed deadline for bids, tops the Dish offer worth about $2.2bn earlier this year.However, the deal has not been agreed and, according to people familiar with the matter, Dish could return with a higher price.LightSquared filed for bankruptcy protection 18 months ago after the US Federal Communications Commission blocked the company’s plans to build a nationwide 4G wireless data network based on LTE technology. The FCC cited concerns that LightSquared’s network could interfere with GPS navigation systems including those used on aircraft.Under the terms of the proposed bankruptcy reorganisation plan filed by Centerbridge, holders of $1.7bn of LightSquared debt – who have supported the Dish proposal until now – would be repaid in full with interest.Mr Falcone and his associates have been battling to maintain control of LightSquared, while the company’s debt holders have been pushing for an early sale of assets.LightSquared has lobbied the FCC to reconsider its decision to block the use of its spectrum. Last week Reed Hundt, a former FCC chairman representing LightSquared, and John Nakahata, a lawyer representing Centerbridge, met FCC officials. Mr Hundt asked if the FCC would set a date for deciding pending spectrum issues.Tim Farrar, a mobile satellite spectrum industry expert, said he was surprised that Centerbridge wanted to take a risk on the FCC ruling in LightSquared’s favour. However, he noted that “if the $3.3bn Centerbridge bid becomes firm, I wouldn’t expect Dish to bid even more”.He added that a deal with Centerbridge would be good news for Inmarsat, the global satellite operator, because it would be much more likely that LightSquared would continue a co-operation agreement in its current form.All parties involved declined to comment.
33;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-10-07T22:04:14Z;Pay TV: the future is not written;Dish Network’s consolidation is inevitable but its route is not;The bull case for cable is simple: it may look like the business model is falling apart, but the problem is really just pricing. Take Time Warner Cable. Half of its revenue comes from pay TV– even as the US becomes a nation of internet video watching cord-cutters.But all Time Warner needs to do is make its customers understand that it is just a broadband data utility, despite the fact that their bills are segmented into video and data. Customers are welcome to buy their content from distributors like Netflix, Google, Amazon or Intel. They just have to accept that their bill, which is roughly $75 a month for video and $45 for internet, is not going to drop by $75. It’s going to drop by the amount that Time Warner now pays for the video content it passes on: something closer to $35. The transition will be difficult. But the cable companies have great big pipes for getting data into homes. So they should be able to protect the return on their investment on them (Time Warner’s return on assets is a solid but not spectacular 9 per cent).What would happen, though, if Time Warner Cable did not have the option of becoming a pure internet provider? It would be a lot like Dish Network, a satellite TV provider. Satellites can be used to provide broadband access – Dish has 310,000 internet subscribers, to Time Warner’s 11m – but the speed is inferior. So satellite companies must depend on global expansion or entering new businesses. Dish has looked to acquire its way into the wireless business, by purchasing spectrum and bidding for Sprint and now for LightSquared’s assets.Interestingly, neither Dish’s recent share performance or its valuation reflect its strategic disadvantage relative to the cable companies. Investors clearly believe its deal making will pay off or Dish will itself become a target. Dish may well end up partnered with a wireless company or, even better, with DirecTV. But while consolidation may be inevitable, its path is not. Dish’s share price should reflect that.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

The rising market helped push the value of Berkshire’s stock portfolio to $97bn on Thursday, accounting for more than a third of the conglomerate’s $287bn market capitalisation.Mr Buffett has built the company over five decades, amassing a confectionery-to-rail collection of businesses, attached to the core insurance business.He prides himself on investing the insurance premiums collected over time, known as the “float”, and aims to grow the underlying book value of his business empire faster than the S&P 500. However, in his widely read letter to shareholders this year he chastised himself for subpar performance, and if Berkshire expands slowly this year he risks being beaten by the US market over a five-year period for the first time.Mr Buffett now controls 40m GM shares worth $1.4bn, up from 25m at the end of the first quarter. Berkshire also disclosed that at the end of June it owned more than 17.8m Suncor shares worth more than $500m.The new stake in Dish adds to Berkshire’s media holdings, as it already owns 6.8 per cent of DirecTV, worth $2.3bn, in addition to holdings in the Washington Post Company, and Liberty Media. However, the small size of the Dish investment, at $23m, suggests it is the responsibility of one of Mr Buffett’s two investment deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Mr Buffett also added slightly to his largest holding, in Wells Fargo, taking Berkshire’s stake to 8.7 per cent of the consumer bank, worth $20bn.Berkshire reduced some holdings, exiting a stake in newspaper publisher Gannett, while reducing investments in Kraft and Mondelez, the snack group it spun out last year.Berkshire’s biggest holdings are mostly consumer-facing groups with strong brands, including Coca-Cola, American Express and Procter & Gamble. The exception is Berkshire’s one technology holding, a $13bn stake in IBM.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
36;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-08-06T18:14:52Z;Pay-television market likely to face further consolidation;;Investors in cable and satellite companies on both sides of the Atlantic are betting on another round of consolidation in the pay-television market led by John Malone, the “cable cowboy” of the industry’s pioneering era.Earnings announcements from most of the large US cable companies and the country’s two satellite television operators showed the continuing pressure they face on traditional video subscription revenues and on the cost of programming. Time Warner Cable, for instance, is in a prolonged and public battle with CBS, the broadcaster, over the costs to carry CBS programming.Industry executives and analysts point to consolidation as an inevitable solution. Scale would allow US cable operators, a fragmented industry, to invest in new infrastructure and deploy innovative technologies. It also would give the cable operators and other pay-television operators more sway in negotiations with television programmers.“We believe in the benefits of consolidation, including significant opportunities for cost and tax synergies, and more importantly, the ability to grow assets organically at a faster pace,” Tom Rutledge, chief executive of Charter Communications, the fourth-largest US cable operator, said during a conference call on Tuesday. “Beyond that, if you get to a certain scale, you have the different form of leverage in programming negotiations.”Charter, which reported a $96m net loss in the second quarter of 2013 compared to a $83m loss a year earlier, has been at the centre of speculation since Mr Malone’s Liberty Media spent $2.6bn acquiring a 27 per cent of the company in March. Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’ chief executive, is said to have discussed a deal with Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable.Mr Maffei echoed the benefits of industry consolidation during a separate conference call on Tuesday but said it was unlikely that Liberty Media would buy stakes in cable companies other than in “helping Charter execute” its business plans.Pay-television operators need to consolidate in order to counter the “monopolistic” power of television programmers, which are raising rates by three to five times inflation, Charlie Ergen, chairman of Dish Network, said during a conference call on Tuesday.Dish Network, the US satellite TV operator run by Mr Ergen, made a net loss of $11m, or 2 cents a share, in the second quarter after writing down the value of two of the three satellites it acquired by $438m. In the same period last year, Dish reported a net profit of $226m, or 50 cents a share.“You have a general movement driving towards consolidation because programmers have become so powerful,” he said, noting that while deals are likely to happen first among cable operators he is open to a merger with DirecTV. “Consolidation would help level the playing field.”Speculation about a possible merger between Dish and DirecTV, the two US satellite operators, has revived since Mr Ergen was frustrated in his bid for Sprint.“Frankly, the balance between content providers and distributors is out of whack. And therefore, further industry consolidation does make sense to help address what I think are unsustainable cost increases for the average customer,” Michael White, DirecTV’s CEO, told analysts last week.He cautioned, however, that Mr Ergen may not be ready to talk about a merger: “it always takes two to dance and frankly,the kind of options that you would normally think about are committed on other ideas and strategies,at least at the moment as best as I can tell.”In Europe, Mr Malone’s Liberty Global group has also fuelled expectations of further consolidation, having bought Virgin Media in the UK and raised its stake in Ziggo of the Netherlands.Mike Fries, Liberty Global’s chief executive, last week ducked questions about acquisition targets in southern Europe but said: “There’s huge benefit to consolidation in all of our markets, Holland included. We compete with national telcos. The bigger scale we have in any market, the better we are able to compete.”Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson.
37;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Dish raises offer for LightSquared assets;;Dish Network, the US satellite TV operator which has been seeking to enter the country’s mobile broadband data market, has increased its $2bn cash offer to acquire most of the assets of LightSquared to $2.2bn.The revised bid, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by L-Band Acquisition, a Dish subsidiary, is the latest move in a battle by Charlie Ergen, Dish chairman, to reposition his company as a mobile data and telecoms group and offset sluggish growth in the satellite TV business.This year Dish bid for both Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator, and Clearwire, the 4G mobile data company, but ultimately lost a battle for both companies to Japan’s SoftBank.The offer for LightSquared’s assets comes as its lenders and the bankruptcy court consider reorganisation plans for the company. LightSquared had planned to build a nationwide 4G network but filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the Federal Communications Commission refused to approve its licence because of concerns about possible interference with safety and other GPS equipment.LightSquared, once controlled by Philip Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners, sought protection in May last year with assets of $4.48bn and debt of $2.29bn.L-Band Acquisition was formed to make a bid for LightSquared’s assets, and said it had entered into an agreement “with certain senior secured lenders to LightSquared to support and pursue confirmation of a reorganisation plan for LightSquared”. Any acquisition would be subject to approval by the bankruptcy court, the FCC and the Canadian Federal Department of Industry.Competing proposals could also be filed, and a court hearing in December would decide on their merits.
38;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-07-16T12:27:17Z;AT&T woos last ‘single lady’ in US wireless with Leap bid;;With AT&T’s proposed $1.2bn cash bid for Leap Wireless, the last remaining major independent wireless operator in the US is set to be subsumed into a larger group.“AT&T [is grabbing] one of the ‘single ladies’ left in US wireless,” says Kevin Smithen, of Macquarie Equities Research.The proposed bid came a week after Japan’s SoftBank completed its acquisition of a 78 per cent stake in Sprint Nextel. Earlier, T-Mobile USA completed its reverse acquisition of MetroPCS and Sprint Nextel beat out Charlie Ergen’s Dish Network to buy Clearwire, the wholesale 4G network operator.This scramble to acquire valuable wireless spectrum reflects the expectation that, as more people switch to using faster fourth-generation mobile networks, there will be exceptional growth in smartphone and tablet-based data traffic. It also represents rapid consolidation in the US mobile market.Some analysts believe that besides acquiring the wireless spectrum owned by Leap, AT&T could also benefit from the small operators’ focus on prepaid mobile services, especially at a time when operators are experimenting with new pricing models as smartphones sales slow.AT&T became the second major US mobile operator to change its upgrade policy making it easier for subscribers to trade in their handsets or connected tablets and shortening the time between penalty-free upgrades from two years to one year.The launch of AT&T’s ‘Next” upgrade programe comes less than a week after T-Mobile US unveiled its ‘Jump’ upgrade programme which allows its subscribers to trade in their devices twice a year after the first six months for an additional $10 monthly fee.“While media and investor attention has focused on Leap’s spectrum, we believe that AT&T is also looking to jump-start its prepaid business during a time of increasing competition and promotional activity in postpaid from T-Mobile US and Sprint Nextel,” said Mr Smithen. “This deal gives AT&T an opportunity to fight back at the challengers.”This positive spin was reflected in Leap’s share price, which traded around $17.10 on Monday, up more than $9 over the Friday close ahead of the AT&T offer. The difference between the $15-a-share AT&T offer price and the trading price on Monday reflects the fact that under AT&T’s proposal, Leap shareholders would also receive the net proceeds from the sale of a Chicago spectrum licence, worth about $2.58 a share. AT&T will also assume Leap’s $2.8bn in net debt.But some analysts believe the premium could also reflect expectations that AT&T’s offer could flush out rival bids. “Leap is one of the largest remaining operators, with spectrum covering two-thirds of the Top 100 markets,” says Mike McCormac of Nomura, “we would not be surprised if other parties come in with competing offers.”Amir Rozwadowski, of Barclays Capital, agrees. “The strategic rationale for AT&T – a mix of spectrum, moving deeper into the prepaid market and keeping the asset out of the hands of others – seems sound,” he says. “Given the deal’s potential competitive implications, we wouldn’t be surprised to see other carriers now express a desire to own Leap.”However, while both T-Mobile and Sprint would “benefit from the increased scale and spectrum depth that Leap would provide . . . neither is in a good position to do a deal today”, says Michael Hodel at Morningstar.Consumer groups have already signalled their opposition to the deal. “AT&T already has more wireless capacity than it needs to serve its customers and it should focus on using what it has rather than continuing to try to buy out competitors,” says Harold Feld, of Public Knowledge, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group.But despite such opposition, most industry analysts believe the deal will be approved. “Our sense is the deal will ultimately be cleared by the government, possibly with some conditions,” says Christopher King, of Stifel, Nicolaus.“We suspect the justice department’s antitrust division, which generally makes the basic antitrust call, would not find combining AT&T with Leap, which has less than 2 per cent of the overall market, would present a significant threat to wireless competition in general.”
39;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-07-05T19:59:00Z;SoftBank gets final approval for $22bn Sprint deal;;The Federal Communications Commission has approved SoftBank’s $21.6bn purchase of Sprint Nextel, clearing the final hurdle in the company’s protracted battle for the US wireless carrier.The FCC said on Friday the deal did not violate foreign ownership regulations and that it would not harm competitors in the mobile sector.“We find that approval of the transactions will serve the public interest,” it said.“We note at the outset that the investment by SoftBank in the US market differs from wireless transactions in which two domestic competitors with overlapping service areas or spectrum holdings are seeking approval to merge, thereby eliminating an existing competitor.”SoftBank was forced to raise its offer for Sprint after Dish Network made a rival bid for the company, valued at $25.5bn.The Japanese telecoms group will pay roughly $16.64bn to Sprint shareholders, while injecting $5bn into the company.The FCC also approved Sprint’s buyout of US broadband internet provider Clearwire.Sprint faced a bidding war for the shares it did not already own in Clearwire, after Dish forced it to nearly double its offer for the company to $5 a share.Sprint must still win approval at a minority shareholder vote set for July 8. Clearwire’s board of directors has endorsed Sprint’s offer.
40;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-07-03T15:55:59Z;Crest Financial backs Sprint’s Clearwire bid;;Crest Financial, one of the largest and most vocal independent shareholders in Clearwire, said on Wednesday that it would drop its campaign and support Sprint Nextel’s bid for the wireless internet operator, clearing another obstacle from the path of the much-contested deal.The news comes after Dish Network, the US Satellite TV operator, last week abandoned its bid for Clearwire. Crest Financial had thrown its support behind Dish and waged a campaign against the Sprint bid, arguing that it undervalued Clearwire’s extensive spectrum holdings.Crest Financial, which holds 8 per cent of Clearwire, said it would stop its fight and support the bid following Sprint’s recent offer to increase its offer for Clearwire to $5 per share, a 68 per cent increase from the initial price of $2.97.“We are proud of our campaign and stand by our analysis,” David Schumacher, general counsel of Crest Financial, said in a letter to Clearwire stockholders. “At the same time, with this favourable resolution, we withdraw any statements made in the heat of battle that may be construed as disparaging to Clearwire, Sprint, their directors and officers, or any other participants in this hard-fought contest.”The battle for Clearwire has dragged on for more than half a year after Sprint in December attempted to buy the 50 per cent of Clearwire that it does not already own for $2.97 per share. Dish stepped in less than a month later with an unsolicited offer for Clearwire at $3.30 per share.Clearwire shareholders are due to vote on the Sprint offer on July 8. The deal is subject to approval from the Federal Communications Commission.Shares in Clearwire were flat at $5 in mid-morning trading.
41;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-30T15:53:54Z;Dish ends battle for Sprint and Clearwire with win-win scenario;;"Charlie Ergen, Dish Network’s chairman, may have lost the bid battle for Sprint Nextel and Clearwire, but shareholders in the US satellite TV operator still have reasons to smile, not least because the value of the stakes Dish built up in both target companies has increased.Just last month Dish disclosed that it owned $592m in derivative financial instruments tied to Sprint Nextel’s stock, and Sprint shares worth $75m. In addition, Dish owned $950m in Clearwire debt at the end of the first quarter. The numbers have yet to be crunched, but as one person close to the bid battle with Japan’s SoftBank noted, “Dish shareholders will be just fine”.But in the wake of the collapse of Dish’s bids for Sprint Nextel and Clearwire last week, many analysts remain confused by Mr Ergen’s tactics. Some even suggest the bids might have been part of a “Machiavellian design” to raise the perceived value of Dish’s own wireless spectrum holdings.“Someday, we may discover the truth about Charlie Ergen’s quixotic quest for Sprint and Clearwire,” Craig Moffett of Moffett Research said in a note to investors. “Was it a genuine expression of strategic interest or was it simply a ruse that was designed to fail? We wouldn’t pretend to know.”But as analysts at Barclays Capital note, “the question telecom investors now are asking is what is Dish’s next move?” Most believe Mr Ergen still has several options to capitalise on its wireless holdings, which include a large tranche of low-cost satellite spectrum acquired in a bankruptcy bid from TerreStar.Dish subsequently persuaded regulators to re-licence that spectrum for mobile broadband usage, increasing its value at least threefold to perhaps $10bn.Neil Begley of Moody’s argues Dish has three options: “First, to abandon its broadband plan, sell its spectrum and repay a significant amount of debt with the cash on hand; second, a build from scratch strategy which management has previously suggested is an unattractive option and would be risky from a credit perspective; third, to pursue a controlling interest in T-Mobile US.”Mr Begley believes the third scenario is the most likely. Some analysts agree, while others suggest that Mr Ergen may now seek to sell Dish’s spectrum – or the whole company – to AT&T, or pursue a new merger agreement with satellite TV rival, DirectTV.A proposed merger between the two satellite TV companies in 2002 was blocked because of competition concerns, but analysts say market conditions are now different.Nevertheless Mr Moffett argues that “in the Alice in Wonderland world that is Dish, a complete failure of all its wireless ambitions would be the best-case scenario. The company will still walk away with substantial gains on Sprint derivatives it started purchasing in the first quarter.”"
42;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-26T23:19:24Z;Dish bows out of Clearwire fight;;Dish Network, the US satellite TV operator, conceded defeat on Wednesday and abandoned its bid for Clearwire paving the way for Sprint Nextel to acquire the minority equity stake in the spectrum-rich wireless broadband operator that it does not already own.The decision marks a rare setback for Charlie Ergen, Dish’s founder and chairman, and a further victory for Japan’s SoftBank which on Tuesday won the overwhelming support of Sprint Nextel shareholders for its $21.6bn bid for a 78 per cent stake in Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator.Dish said it was withdrawing its $4.40 tender offer for “among other reasons, as a result of the recent change in recommendation by Clearwire”. Clearwire’s board switched to recommending Sprint Nextel’s rival bid after the mobile operator sweetened its original offer by 47 per cent to $5.00 a share, valuing Clearwire at about $14bn.Sprint Nextel’s raised offer was widely seen as an attempt to knock Dish out of the bidding battle and secure the approval of dissident shareholders and the leading proxy advisory firms. Clearwire’s shareholders are due to vote on the Sprint Nextel offer on July 8. Both the Clearwire and SoftBank transactions are subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission.Dish launched its unsolicited bids for Sprint Nextel and Clearwire earlier this year in an effort to leverage its spectrum holdings and enter the US mobile market that has been reshaped by smartphones and tablets and the new 4G mobile broadband services based on LTE technology.The battle between Dish, Sprint Nextel and SoftBank was marked by claims and counterclaims and allegations by Dish that SoftBank’s acquisition of Sprint Nextel and the Clearwire spectrum could pose a risk to national security. Those claims were rejected by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States which approved SoftBank’s acquisition of Sprint Nextel last month, albeit subject to certain conditions.Analysts expect Dish to explore other possible partnerships including a deal with T-Mobile US, the fourth-largest US mobile operator, which could use Dish’s repurposed satellite spectrum to broaden the coverage and depth of its own LTE network. Alternatively, Dish could seek to sell its spectrum, which Mr Ergen says is worth roughly $10bn.Both T-Mobile US and Sprint Nextel are seeking to bolster their networks in an effort to compete more effectively with their larger rivals, Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility, which together control about 70 per cent of the US mobile market.Last week, Sprint Nextel, which already owns a 51 per cent stake in Clearwire and also has irrevocable commitments from a group of Clearwire’s strategic investors, filed a lawsuit against Dish claiming that Dish’s bid for Clearwire violated Delaware law and Sprint’s rights as a majority shareholder in Clearwire.
43;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-21T15:33:39Z;Dish pulls out of bidding war for Sprint Nextel;;Dish Network has formally conceded defeat in its bid battle with Japan’s SoftBank over Sprint Nextel, the US’s third-biggest wireless operator by subscribers, ending one of the most intriguing takeover battles in years.In an SEC filing yesterday morning, Dish said that it had decided to “abandon its efforts to acquire Sprint Nextel Corporation”.Dish had already said on Tuesday that it would not submit a revised offer for Sprint Nextel, after SoftBank raised the total value of its offer, for 78 per cent of Sprint’s shares, by $1.5bn to $21.6bn last week.The statement from Dish clears the way for Sprint shareholders to vote on the offer from SoftBank next week, when they are likely to approve the deal. However, the Japanese company must still gain final clearance from US regulators.Masayoshi Son, chief executive of SoftBank, and Charlie Ergen, chairman of Dish, are, however, still tussling over Clearwire, a wireless internet provider already half-owned by Sprint, and which Sprint is trying to acquire in full.That battle may also be drawing to a close. On Thursday Sprint raised its offer for Clearwire to $5 a share, trumping the agreed $4.40-a-share bid from Dish.Should Mr Ergen emerge without control of Sprint or Clearwire after months of bidding, his next moves will be closely scrutinised. Dish operates a mature satellite television business that is likely to decline. As a hedge, Mr Ergen has accumulated billions of dollars worth of spectrum. But he does not yet have a means to deploy it.How Mr Son proceeds will also be important to the future of the US wireless industry. Though he is on the verge of taking control of Sprint and Clearwire, both companies have work to do in repairing their balance sheets while embarking on significant capital expenditure programmes.At SoftBank’s annual general meeting in Tokyo yesterday, Mr Son sought to convince investors that his audacious bid for Sprint would pay off.“We want to be the world’s number-one company in various terms including profit, cash flow and market value,” Mr Son said, without setting a timetable.He also said that SoftBank had “seriously considered’’ the possibility of acquiring T-Mobile USA, the fourth-biggest US carrier, as an alternative if its deal with Sprint fell apart. People familiar with the situation believe that Mr Son may soon renew that effort, betting that US regulators would allow Sprint and T-Mobile to merge and create a stronger rival to market leaders Verizon Wireless and AT&T.SoftBank’s shares have gained 77 per cent this year, compared with a 28 per cent increase in Tokyo’s Topix index.
44;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-20T22:11:02Z;Sprint raises Clearwire bid;;The Clearwire bidding war intensified on Thursday as Sprint Nextel raised its offer for the wireless internet provider to $5 per share, trumping the agreed $4.40 per share bid from Dish Network.The Clearwire board endorsed the new offer, which values the company at $14bn including debt, and postponed a shareholder meeting to vote on the deal from June 24 to July 8.Sprint said it had secured commitments from four Clearwire shareholders who collectively own 9 per cent of the stock to vote in favour of the new deal. Those four, Mount Kellett Capital Management, Glenview Capital Management, Chesapeake Partners Management and Highside Capital Management, have also agreed to sell their shares to Sprint if the deal does not close.Sprint and Clearwire also modified the merger agreement to include a higher break fee of $115m, which Clearwire will have to pay Sprint if the deal does not close.The fight for Clearwire has stretched for more than half a year, since Sprint in December attempted to buy the 50 per cent of Clearwire it does not already own for $2.97 per share.Dish showed up less than a month later, making an unsolicited offer for Clearwire at $3.30 per share and touching off a complicated battle for control of several companies that will be influential in determining the fate of the US wireless industry.SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications group, last year agreed to take control of Sprint and has already provided the company with the cash it is using to fund its Clearwire purchase.Dish worked hard to scuttle that deal too, making offers to acquire Sprint that forced SoftBank to raise its bid last week. However, Dish this week said it would not submit a revised offer for Sprint, ensuring that Sprint shareholders will vote on the SoftBank deal soon.Both Dish chairman Charlie Ergen and SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son are seeking to acquire Clearwire for its valuable spectrum. Though Clearwire is heavily indebted, it controls airwaves that either suitor could use to expand coverage as mobile data usage spikes around the country.Its strategic presence has led to the aggressive bidding, with Sprint now increasing its price per share offer by 68 per cent since December.Mr Ergen is looking to diversify away from Dish’s core satellite television business, which has matured.John Malone, the cable industry pioneer whose Liberty Media group spun off DirecTV, the rival satellite operator to Dish, told Liberty’s annual meeting this month that satellite services would struggle as rising demand for high-speed connectivity changes the balance of power in the pay-TV business.“I’ll swear on a Bible that they would not have been able to pry DirecTV out of my hands if I had a solution for terrestrial broadband that I could marry to DirecTV,” Mr Malone told investors. “Charlie right now is out in the wilderness trying to find the pieces to put together a terrestrial-like solution, and it’s tough.”Satellite technology was hard to beat for “a one-way video machine”, he said, but as more video content is delivered over broadband connections, “the bandwidth demands are going to force market share cable’s way,” he argued.
45;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-19T18:07:35Z;Sprint: tough terms;A higher bid and first-mover advantage have sealed deal for SoftBank;SoftBank, it appears, will capture Sprint. Sprint’s board had endorsed the Japanese company’s sweetened bid and rival suitor Dish Network has declined to counteroffer (for now). Unfortunately, SoftBank’s victory does not derive from superior economics alone. SoftBank negotiated aggressive deal protection terms that built a wall around its bid – and paid Sprint shareholders only 7 per cent more for the privilege.SoftBank raised the portion of its offer that goes to Sprint shareholders to $16.6bn – $7.65 per Sprint share vs $7.30 in the original offer. In exchange, SoftBank got a higher break-up fee and a “poison pill” preventing anyone else from buying a big Sprint stake.Deal protections are not inherently malicious. They can help get deals done by protecting the efforts of the first bidder. SoftBank did the hard work of figuring out what that market-clearing price for Sprint was. Mechanisms such as termination fees and matching rights keep the likes of Dish from freeriding on SoftBank’s efforts by bidding, say, a nickel more than SoftBank to win Sprint. But there must be a balance between protecting the first bidder and allowing shareholders to get maximum value by encouraging a competitive process.The latest protections given to SoftBank skew this balance too far away from shareholders. Courts have affirmed the legality of poison pills in general but in merger agreements they are rare. The termination fee was increased by a third to $800m, even though SoftBank’s overall cash outlay was upped by only 7 per cent (SoftBank is funding the higher payment to shareholders mostly by investing less in Sprint’s business). This is all academic now. An incrementally superior bid, first-mover advantage and some tough deal protections have sealed the deal for SoftBank. Investors are left to wonder what might have been.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
46;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-19T01:17:46Z;Dish decides against raising Sprint offer;;Dish Network said it would not submit a revised offer for Sprint Nextel – a move that clears the way for SoftBank to proceed with its $21.6bn offer for 78 per cent of the third-largest US wireless provider.Dish had a Tuesday deadline to submit a fully financed offer for Sprint. Since Dish did not submit a revised proposal, Sprint could no longer terminate the merger agreement with SoftBank, ensuring shareholders would vote on the deal on June 25.The deadline was set last week, after SoftBank raised its offer for Sprint by $1.5bn, and Dish was asked to stop conducting due diligence. SoftBank’s revised offer won the support of leading Sprint shareholders, including hedge fund Paulson & Co.The move is a signal that Charlie Ergen, Dish’s chairman, may have given up on his efforts to outmanoeuvre SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son for Sprint.“While Dish continues to see strategic value in a merger with Sprint, the decisions made by Sprint to prematurely terminate our due diligence process and accept extreme deal protections in its revised agreement with SoftBank, among other things, have made it impracticable for Dish to submit a revised offer by the June 18 deadline imposed by Sprint,” the company said.Though Mr Ergen may have lost the battle for Sprint, he remains embroiled in a related takeover battle with Mr Son.Dish has offered $4.40 per share for Clearwire, the wireless internet provider that SoftBank is also trying to buy. That offer won the support of Clearwire’s board and many investors.But on Monday Sprint sued to stop the deal, saying the Dish offer violated terms in Clearwire’s charter. Dish said that “Sprint’s lawsuit is a transparent attempt to divert attention from its failure to deal fairly with Clearwire’s shareholders, as well as to exploit its majority position to block Clearwire’s shareholders from receiving a fair price for their shares”.On Tuesday Dish said: “We will consider our options with respect to Sprint, and focus our efforts and resources on completing the Clearwire tender offer.”
47;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-13T20:16:18Z;Clearwire board backs Dish Network’s offer;;Clearwire’s board postponed a shareholder vote set for Thursday until June 24, and recommended that its independent shareholders accept Dish Network’s $4.40-a-share offer rather than a rival bid by Sprint Nextel.The latest move puts further pressure on Sprint, itself the subject of a takeover bid by Japan’s SoftBank, to either sweeten its $3.40-a-share Clearwire offer for a second time, try to block the Dish bid by exercising its governance rights or reach an accommodation with the US satellite TV operator, which is seeking to use its own spectrum holdings to roll out a new wireless broadband service.The Clearwire board recommendation is the latest twist in a battle between Charlie Ergen, chairman of Dish, and Masayoshi Son, chairman of SoftBank, over who will play the largest role in restructuring the US mobile market and challenge the dominance of Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility, the two largest US mobile operators with over 70 per cent of the mobile subscriber market.Dish’s bid also received the backing of ISS, the proxy advisory firm used by many institutional shareholders. ISS said that, in the wake of the Clearwire board decision, it was reversing its position and now recommending that shareholders vote against the lower Sprint Nextel offer.Earlier this week Sprint’s board voted to accept SoftBank’s improved offer while giving Dish, which made a tentative $25.5bn offer for Sprint in April, a final chance to come back with a formal bid by pushing back the shareholder vote to June 25.Sprint, the third-largest US mobile operator, already owns a 51 per cent stake in Clearwire and has irrevocable commitments from a group of strategic investors in Clearwire, which means it controls more than 68 per cent of Clearwire shares.Dish is seeking at least 25 per cent of Clearwire and has the support of Crest Financial, Clearwire’s largest independent shareholder, which has mounted a campaign against the Sprint bid, arguing that it undervalued Clearwire’s extensive spectrum holdings.People close to the negotiations say SoftBank, which earlier this week raised its bid for Sprint to $21.6bn for a 78 per cent stake, might be willing to accept Dish as a minority shareholder, rather than raise its Clearwire bid.Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research said he believed Dish wanted to be more than a minority shareholder in Clearwire. “We believe they want 40MHz of Clearwire spectrum and bidding for the equity gives them leverage to extract this spectrum from an unwilling Sprint/SoftBank,” he said.Similarly, Dave Novosel, an analyst for Gimme Credit, said: “Realistically, we do not think Dish can afford to acquire both Sprint and Clearwire. The company just needs enough of the valuable Clearwire spectrum to support its aspirations to be a major wireless player.”
48;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-11T18:24:37Z;Dish’s spectrum hoard keeps it in the game;;Dish chairman Charlie Ergen may be on the verge of losing the bidding war for Sprint Nextel, the third largest wireless provider in the US. But he is still in a powerful position as he seeks to disrupt the US wireless market.Mr Ergen has amassed a large trove of unused spectrum and is still on the hunt for more.He has spent billions of dollars buying the airwaves that carry wireless data, and estimates the value of his spectrum assets at more than $8bn.Spectrum is a finite resource that is growing more valuable as businesses and consumers use more mobile internet services.Yet for all the airwaves that Mr Ergen has accumulated, he is short on ways to deploy it. Building out his own mobile phone and internet brand would be a long and costly endeavour, which is why he was trying to buy Sprint.If he is outmanoeuvred by SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son and loses a chance to buy Sprint, he might try to buy other US wireless providers, such as T-Mobile USA.In the meantime, Mr Ergen is pursuing Clearwire – a wireless internet provider that is highly indebted but owns a lot of spectrum. He lifted his bid for Clearwire to $4.40 per share last month, topping Sprint’s offer for $3.40 per share.Sprint holds slightly more than a 50 per cent stake in Clearwire and has irrevocable commitments by strategic investors in Clearwire to sell its shares to Sprint, lifting Sprint’s stake to 68.8 per cent.Crest Financial, the largest independent minority shareholder in Clearwire, remains firmly opposed to the Sprint bid.Clearwire shareholders are therefore set to reject the Sprint deal on Thursday, when they are due to vote on it.That is likely to lead to a new round of manoeuvring over the fate of Clearwire between SoftBank – which seems likely to gain control of Sprint – and Dish.But with the US telecoms industry being reshaped by large mergers and acquisitions, even fierce rivals may be willing to strike deals with each other.Kevin Smithen of Macquarie Securities said: “We believe that Son-san and Mr Ergen will work out a compromise on Clearwire whereby Sprint sells 40+ MHz of spectrum to Dish and that Sprint will sweeten its offer on Clearwire.”
49;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-11T18:00:05Z;Dish’s spoiling tactics in Sprint bid left in tatters;;When Dish chairman Charlie Ergen made his surprise $25bn bid for Sprint Nextel in April, advisers, analysts and industry insiders were taken aback.The somewhat cantankerous satellite television pioneer was known for making audacious moves within his own industry – going head to head with moguls including Rupert Murdoch – but few expected him to reach so far, making a bid for the third-largest wireless operator in the US.Mr Ergen’s reputation preceded him. With a reputation for being litigious, his entry into a bidding war with SoftBank, the Japanese telecommunications company run by billionaire Masayoshi Son, was met with some surprise. In the past, some of Mr Ergen’s deals have floundered.Yet the size of his bid – and his vision of bundling satellite TV with cellular phone and internet service – inclined participants in the deal to take him seriously. “When Charlie showed up, people were willing to give him a seat at the table,” said one person close to the deal.Two months later, however, Mr Ergen has confounded competitors, acquisition targets, and even his own advisers with a series of moves that appear to have eroded goodwill.Among the most perplexing tactics were launching an advertising campaign questioning whether SoftBank was unfit to own Sprint on national security grounds, and trying to outbid Sprint for another company, Clearwire, just days after Sprint agreed to let Dish conduct due diligence on Sprint as part of its bid.On Tuesday morning in Tokyo, SoftBank’s Mr Son sought to put an end to Mr Ergen’s tactics, announcing an improved bid for Sprint. By offering $7.65 per share for Sprint, up from $7.30, Sprint shareholders will receive more cash upfront, and SoftBank will own 78 per cent of the company, up from 70 per cent.The special committee of Sprint’s board evaluating the proposals agreed to the new offer, and also claimed Dish “has not put forward an actionable offer”.Analysts believe the improved SoftBank offer is enough to get the deal done. “We view the higher cash component as enough to gain favour with [Sprint] shareholders and expect the deal to close by the end of June,” said S&P Capital IQ analyst James Moorman.A welcome bit of added momentum came in the form of support from Paulson & Co, the hedge fund that owns 7.7 per cent of Sprint shares and said it would vote in favour of the new deal.Dish’s chances of acquiring Sprint were further compromised as Sprint increased the break fee of its agreed deal with SoftBank by $200m, giving Dish one week to present a “best and final” offer.But by giving shareholders more money up front, SoftBank is diverting money that was intended to strengthen Sprint as it looks to compete with Verizon and AT&T, the market leaders in US wireless service. “They’re robbing the Sprint balance sheet,” said a person close to Dish.Dish chairman Charlie Ergen may be on the verge of losing the bidding war for Sprint Nextel, the third largest wireless provider in the US. But he is still in a powerful position as he seeks to disrupt the US wireless market.People close to Dish also believe that when a complex web of other arrangements is considered, SoftBank’s offer is worth less than the headline price of $7.65 per share. SoftBank says “the reallocation is justified as the company has discovered more synergy expectations coupled with Sprint’s improving profitability,” said analysts from Cowen and company.According to people familiar with the negotiations, SoftBank presented its sweetened offer at the end of last week. Sprint’s special committee, which has been discussing a rival bid from Dish for the past eight weeks, had also expected Dish to formalise its offer during a meeting held last Friday but instead, Dish asked for more time.Given the lack of a formal offer from Dish, the committee decided to move ahead with the new SoftBank bid and pushed the shareholder vote back to June 25, giving Dish a final chance to come back with a formal bid.People close to the process aren’t yet counting out Mr Ergen. He could come forward with a new partner on the deal, or raise his offer once more on his own.“The process with Dish, may have more room to run than we initially expected,” said Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research in a note to investors.“It seems that Sprint management believes that Dish was sincerely interested in Sprint, so there is a prospect Dish comes back with a more formal offer.”Nevertheless, Mr Chaplin, like most analysts, believes it is likely now that SoftBank’s sweetened offer will be approved.Larry Glasscock, chairman of Sprint’s special committee, could not hide the board’s frustration with Dish in a statement announcing the new SoftBank offer.“We have expended substantial time and energy engaging with Dish over the past nine weeks, including an extensive due diligence process,” he said. “But these efforts did not lead, in the Special Committee’s view, to a proposal that was reasonably likely to lead to a proposal superior to SoftBank’s.”Additional reporting by Paul Taylor
50;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-11T04:31:11Z;SoftBank raises offer for Sprint Nextel to $21.6bn;;Sprint Nextel has all but closed the door on a takeover bid from US rival Dish Network after SoftBank of Japan boosted both the value and cash portion of its offer, winning the support of a key Sprint shareholder.SoftBank lifted the total value of its offer for the US’s third-biggest wireless operator by $1.5bn to $21.6bn. Crucially, it increased the cash part of its bid by $4.5bn, which will hand investors an extra $1.48 per share for a total cash payout of $5.50 each.Sprint’s board gave the revised offer its unanimous backing while Paulson & Co, the hedge fund that is Sprint’s second-largest shareholder, said it would vote in favour of the deal because of the “improved financial terms”.The news appears to hand victory to Masayoshi Son’s Japanese telecoms group. SoftBank made an agreed bid for 70 per cent of Sprint in October, but found itself facing a rival bid at the 11th hour from Charlie Ergen’s satellite group, Dish.The bid battle turned into a public war of words. SoftBank tried to intimidate banks into not funding Dish’s bid, while Dish attempted to whip up security fears over SoftBank’s ownership among politicians.Sprint’s special committee and board of directors said there had been a lack of progress with Dish after a long due diligence process, leading them to conclude that the rival $25.5bn cash-and-stock proposal from Dish was “not reasonably likely to lead to a superior offer”.Sprint has ended discussions with Dish and will ask the company to destroy all confidential information it obtained during due diligence. However, it left Dish with one week to make its “best and final” offer, which would have to be fully financed. It also bumped up the break fee payable to SoftBank by $200m to $800m.Mr Son, chief executive and chairman of SoftBank, said the revised offer “delivers more upfront cash to Sprint stockholders, while still achieving our goal of creating a well-capitalised Sprint that is better positioned to bring meaningful competition to the US market”.Larry Glasscock, chairman of the special committee of Sprint directors, also emphasised the higher cash portion of the offer and the certainty of SoftBank’s bid.“We have expended substantial time and energy engaging with Dish over the past nine weeks, including an extensive due diligence process, but these efforts did not lead . . . to a proposal that was reasonably likely to lead to a proposal superior to SoftBank’s,” Mr Glasscock said.SoftBank’s offer is now worth a total of $7.65 per share, up from $7.30, according to Sprint. The Japanese group will acquire 78 per cent of the US carrier, up from 70 per cent in its original proposal.The company is funding the increase in the cash portion partly by reducing the amount of investment it is promising to make in upgrades to Sprint’s network by $3bn. It will also inject a further $1.5bn of cash.The two companies said they had refined their original estimates of the value of operating and capital cost benefits that would come from the deal after nine months of due diligence, which is what allowed SoftBank to reallocate money from investment to a higher cash payout to shareholders.To give investors more time to assess the new offer, Sprint adjourned its planned special meeting of shareholders from June 12 to June 25.
51;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-07T22:58:55Z;SoftBank looks beyond Sprint to T-Mobile USA;;Japan’s SoftBank is considering making a bid for T-Mobile USA if its agreed deal for Sprint Nextel falls apart, according to people familiar with the matter.Talks are preliminary, these people said, but signal SoftBank’s strong interest in entering the US market no matter the fate of its $20.1bn deal for control of Sprint.Dish Network, the satellite television company, has mounted a rival offer for Sprint, and is conducting due diligence. The special committee of Sprint’s board is still recommending SoftBank’s offer to shareholders, who are set to vote on the deal next week.People close to the process said news of SoftBank’s interest in T-Mobile, first reported by Reuters, could scare Sprint shareholders into voting for the deal.SoftBank has considered buying T-Mobile before, but moved on Sprint last year after T-Mobile’s owner, Deutsche Telekom, opted for a reverse merger of the unit with MetroPCS. That deal is now complete, with Deutsche Telekom owning 74 per cent of the new publicly traded T-Mobile USA.The consolidated ownership of T-Mobile would make it easy for SoftBank to strike a deal, avoiding the complications it has faced in its pursuit of Sprint.SoftBank will reap nearly $5bn if its bid for Sprint falls apart, benefiting from a convertible bond, currency hedges related to the deal, and a substantial break fee. It could use these gains as acquisition currency for T-Mobile, people familiar with the deal said.Retired Admiral Mike Mullen will join Sprint Nextel’s board as the company’s security director when SoftBank’s deal to acquire a 70 per cent stake in the US mobile network operator is completed.In that role, Mr Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would also be responsible for overseeing Sprint’s compliance with the company’s recently announced National Security Agreement with the US government, and serve as the US government’s contact for all security-related matters.Sprint and SoftBank agreed to appoint a special security director as part of an agreement with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which approved the transaction late last month. The Federal Communications Commission has yet to approve the deal.Sprint’s shareholders are due to vote on the proposed $20.1bn deal on Wednesday, although the vote could be delayed if Dish, the US satellite TV operator decides to make a formal offer. Charlie Ergen, Dish’s chief executive, has proposed a rival cash-and-stock offer for Sprint valued at $25.5bn.SoftBank, which launched its bid for Sprint in October, expects to close the deal next month, provided it is approved by the FCC and shareholders.Earlier this week, Institutional Shareholder Services, adviser to mutual funds and other big investors, recommended the SoftBank offer.ISS did not address the potential share and cash offer from Dish Network, because it has not yet been formally tendered to Sprint Nextel’s shareholders.In a related but separate transaction, Clearwire shareholders are due to vote on competing offers from Sprint Nextel and Dish on Thursday.Dish launched a $4.40-a-share all cash tender offer for Clearwire at the end of May, topping a rival $3.40-a-share offer from Sprint for the shares in the wireless broadband operator that it does not already own. Sprint holds just over a 50 per cent stake in Clearwire and has irrevocable commitments from a group of strategic investors in Clearwire to sell their shares to Sprint. lifting Sprint’s stake to 68.8 per cent.
52;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-06-02T16:39:03Z;Sprint investors urged to back $20.1bn SoftBank bid;Deal could bring in capital to compete with larger US rivals;Sprint shareholders have been steered towards voting in favour of a $20.1bn takeover bid for the US mobile operator from Japan’s SoftBank by a proxy advisory service.The move came as Dish Network considered starting a bidding war by making a formal $25.5bn offer of its own for Sprint.Institutional Shareholder Services, adviser to mutual funds and other big investors, has reportedly said SoftBank’s offer will infuse Sprint with enough capital to upgrade its network and compete better with its larger US rivals Verizon and AT&T.ISS did not address the potential share and cash offer from Dish Network, as it has not yet been formally tendered to shareholders in Sprint.“ISS has not developed a view, from a valuation perspective, on whether the Dish offer is superior to the SoftBank transaction for Sprint shareholders.”Sprint shareholders are set to vote on SoftBank’s bid for a 70 per cent stake, which would result in $5bn cash infusion from the Asian telecoms company, on June 12. The acquisition has been recommended by Sprint’s board. Last week, Sprint and SoftBank said they anticipated the merger would be completed in July.Last week, SoftBank won US national security clearance for the deal from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, despite lobbying by Dish Network.Shares in Sprint closed at $7.30 on Friday, up 28.75 per cent since the start of the year. Its largest shareholders are led by Dodge & Cox, the mutual find company, with an 11.61 per cent stake, and Paulson & Co, the hedge fund run by John Paulson with a 7.66 per cent holding. Capital Group, Vanguard and BlackRock each hold more than 5 per cent of the company.
53;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Dish/Clearwire: wake up call;It is hard to create wealth by being a nuisance. Charlie Ergen is trying;It is possible to scrape out a living being a nuisance. Journalists do it. But it is harder to create real wealth this way. Charlie Ergen, founder and boss of Dish Network, is trying.His latest irritant is a $4.40 per share offer for the US wireless broadband company Clearwire, or rather, the half of it that is not owned by wireless operator Sprint. Dish is a satellite television company. What does it want with a minority stake in what amounts to a big lump of spectrum in dire need of capital? One answer is hectoring Masa Son, boss of Japanese wireless operator SoftBank, which has bid for control of Sprint. The first thumb that Mr Ergen stuck in Mr Son’s eye was a counterbid for Sprint. The Dish offer featured a higher headline price than Softbank’s, and Mr Ergen touted synergies that Softbank’s transcontinental deal could not match. Mr Son was quick to point out, rightly, that Dish/Sprint would carry a huge debt burden, in an industry where investment is crucial. But Mr Ergen’s offer is too compelling to dismiss out of hand.Mr Son has said that Clearwire is important to his plans for Sprint. If he matches Dish’s offer, his effective price for Sprint/Clearwire goes up by at least $700m (it now stands at $20bn). If he does not, it is hard to imagine that most minority Clearwire shareholders will not sell to Dish – its cash offer is 29 per cent higher than SoftBank/Sprint’s. In that case, even if SoftBank wins Sprint, the obstreperous Mr Ergen remains as a minority shareholder in a key subsidiary.All this sand-throwing puts Dish in a position to negotiate for the right to buy a big chunk of Clearwire’s spectrum, or for a spectrum-sharing agreement. Either would add value to the wireless spectrum Dish has already amassed. So whether Dish wins Sprint or not, it has inserted itself into the middle of any attempt to create a viable third competitor to Verizon and AT&T in the US, the most profitable wireless market in the world – a position from which it can make ever more annoying and lucrative demands.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
54;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-05-30T01:27:48Z;Dish launches rival cash offer for Clearwire;;Dish Network has launched a $4.40-a-share all cash tender offer for Clearwire ahead of a Clearwire shareholder meeting on Friday, topping a rival $3.40-a-share offer from Sprint Nextel.The Dish bid, detailed in a letter sent late on Wednesday to Clearwire’s board, appeared designed to further delay Sprint’s proposed acquisition of Clearwire and SoftBank’s plans to acquire a 70 per cent stake in Sprint for $20.1bn, the third-largest US mobile operator.“The special committee of Clearwire’s board of directors has received Dish Network’s offer and will review it to determine the best course of action for the company and its stockholders,” Clearwire said in a statement. “The special committee has not made any determination to change its recommendation of the current Sprint transaction.”Dish said it was making the offer public in light of the limited time remaining before the Clearwire stockholders’ meeting to consider the Sprint offer, and said it intends to initiate a tender offer for the outstanding Clearwire shares before that meeting.“The Clearwire spectrum portfolio has always been a key component to implementing our wireless plans of delivering a superior product and service offering to customers,” said Charlie Ergen, chairman and co-founder of Dish.Speculation about the higher offer sent Clearwire shares up 1.5 per cent on Wednesday to close at $3.48. At that price Clearwire shareholders would be more likely to turn down the Sprint offer when it goes to a vote.The tender offer would be the latest gambit by Mr Ergen to derail the acquisition of Sprint by Japanese telecom company SoftBank. Dish is also trying to buy Sprint, and sees blocking the closure of the Clearwire sale as tactic to buy itself time.Dish, which had earlier proposed acquiring spectrum from Clearwire, noted that its tender offer represents a 29 per cent premium over the nominal purchase price of $3.40 per share in the Sprint proposal and said it remains committed to a commercialisation of Clearwire’s significant portfolio of wireless spectrum assets.Dish added that it would also ensure Clearwire has access to appropriate capital during the necessary transition period until the company can effectively fund itself. It said it was prepared to provide Clearwire with a financing package allowing it to draw up to $80m per month until the aggregate amount of funding provided equals $800m.SoftBank agreed to buy nearly three quarters of Sprint for $20.1bn, but Dish has offered $25bn for the whole company. Dish is conducting due diligence, but Sprint’s board is still recommending the SoftBank offer.The takeover battle comes as the US telecommunications sector is being reshaped by a wave of deals including the recent merger of T-Mobile and MetroPCS.SoftBank on Wednesday cleared a big hurdle in its attempt to acquire a controlling interest in Sprint when it won US national security clearance for its proposed deal.The go-ahead from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States came despite strong lobbying by Dish.Dish had portrayed the SoftBank bid as a potential threat to national security because of the Japanese company’s use of network equipment manufactured by Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker.As expected, SoftBank and Sprint made several concessions to Cfius to assuage concerns. Such agreements are common where a foreign entity plans to take control of strategically important US infrastructure.Under the terms of the agreement, SoftBank and Sprint will give the US veto power over a security director on the new board of Sprint. The director will be responsible for overseeing compliance on all security-related matters.SoftBank and Sprint also agreed to remove “certain equipment deployed in the Clearwire network” by the end of 2016, if Sprint’s proposed acquisition of Clearwire goes ahead.

Clearwire shareholders are due to vote on a sweetened offer from Sprint this week.This provision, coupled with an agreement that the US government should have the right to approve network equipment suppliers to Sprint and Clearwire, is believed to relate to equipment supplied by Huawei, which a US congressional panel labelled a national security risk late last year.The agreement with Cfius means the Federal Communications Commission will be able to resume its review of the Sprint deal, a process that is expected to finish in a week or so, according to people close to the discussions. The FCC, which is considering the public interest aspects of the proposed deal, suspended deliberations pending the Cfius review.Sprint shareholders must also approve the SoftBank bid, which has been recommended by Sprint’s board. The shareholder vote is scheduled for June 12. Sprint and SoftBank said on Wednesday they anticipated the merger would be completed in July.However, the vote could be delayed if Dish makes a formal bid for Sprint after completing due diligence.Dish said on Wednesday: “While we have not seen the terms of the announced agreement, we believe the US government should continue to proceed with deliberation and caution in turning over assets of national strategic importance – such as the Sprint fibre backbone and wireless networks – to a foreign-controlled entity with significant ties to China.”
56;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-05-24T23:48:28Z;Dish / Sprint: a most anticipated blockbuster;US satellite company should simply drop its (red) scare campaign;"This summer’s most anticipated blockbuster involves an eccentric Japanese tycoon buying an American mobile phone network on behalf of a Chinese company planning to infiltrate the US national security infrastructure. A Michael Bay production? No; this release is too inane even for the director of Armageddon and Transformers.The script comes from Charlie Ergen, boss of US satellite company Dish Network. Dish is locked in battle with the Japanese mobile company SoftBank over Sprint, the number three US mobile network, and has initiated a campaign to detonate a SoftBank/Sprint tie-up. The argument is that a Japanese company that uses equipment made in China threatens the very existence of America and everything it holds dear. (More about this mortal threat can be found at nationalsecuritymatters.com; the page notes that Dish is its sponsor, but says nothing about Dish’s own interest in owning Sprint.)In noisy summer films, details like acting, script and plot often get lost among special-effects pyrotechnics. So here is a handy guide what the plot should be, and the proper role for each actor: Dish should be focused on putting its best bid forward, and explaining why it offers more value to Sprint shareholders. Its headline valuation for Sprint appears higher, after all. Dish should simply drop its (red) scare campaign, which makes it appear xenophobic, jingoistic and, worst of all, desperate – as if its bid is inadequate on merit. US politicians, meanwhile, should let the regulatory process run its course. So far, thankfully, politicians have stayed away from the heated rhetoric heard years ago when Chinese and Middle Eastern companies pursued US assets. The regulatory process allows for remedial actions, and SoftBank has reportedly agreed to have a Sprint board member dedicated to national security issues. Finally, shareholders should focus on which deal gives them the most benefit.Investors do have a tough choice. Since both bidders for Sprint are offering a partial consideration in stock, shareholders must weigh which of the two business plans creates the most long-term value. That is less a thriller than a mystery.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
57;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-05-22T12:07:20Z;Dish steps up campaign to derail SoftBank’s bid for Sprint Nextel;;In 2006 a bid by Dubai Ports World to buy several US port terminals fell apart at the last minute after opponents of the proposed deal launched a fierce lobbying effort in Washington, stoking fears that Middle Eastern owners might jeopardise national security.Now Dish is hoping it can steal a page from that playbook. The Colorado-based satellite television provider has launched a brash campaign in Washington aimed at derailing Japan-based SoftBank’s bid for Sprint Nextel, the US wireless provider that Dish is also trying to buy.Dish has filed letters to the Federal Communications Commission disparaging SoftBank, created a website dedicated to scuttling the deal, and on Tuesday it launched an advertising campaign with a message for policy makers: “Don’t outsource our national security.”It has even gone so far as to compare the SoftBank deal for Sprint to the Dubai Ports controversy. On the website it created and with ads in the Washington Post and Politico, it contrasts images of Dubai Ports equipment with a photograph of an internet router. The copy reads: “In an ever changing world, ‘ports’ may change, but keeping them in American hands never should.”The overt lobbying follows comments by Dish chairman Charlie Ergen that suggested Japanese control of Sprint would lead to a flood of ineffectual foreign workers. “We are an American company, and the modernisation of Sprint’s network will have to be done from the US,” he told USA Today. “You have to climb the towers here, and you’ll have to have US employees who speak English.”Mr Ergen’s father was an Austrian immigrant who came to the US before the second world war and worked on the Manhattan Project.SoftBank called the Dish campaign “undignified xenophobic rhetoric lacking appreciation for the critical strategic and trade relationship between the US and Japan”. SoftBank also pointed out that the company’s $20.1bn deal for Sprint would be the largest foreign investment in the US since 2008.James Thurber, a professor at American university in Washington who studies lobbying, said the Dish effort was “a stretch”.“In an effective lobbying campaign you can’t just run a few ads,” he said. “These things are rarely effective unless it’s China, and I don’t think they can make a national security case.”Dish is pursuing the China angle. It says the company’s commercial ties with Chinese electronics manufacturer Huawei could prove a risk, given Sprint’s customers include several US military agencies. It also points to SoftBank’s stake in Alibaba, the Chinese internet group, as cause for concern.“Cyber security is a focus of congress today, and China has been one of the leading sources of recent attacks,” said Jeff Blum, deputy general counsel of Dish. “If you had a choice, would you prefer all of these sensitive government contracts to be in the hands of a company here in the US, or one with connections to China?”However, Sprint and SoftBank have both agreed not to use equipment made by Huawei. They had also agreed to replace products made by the Chinese company in the network of Clearwire, a data network operator that Sprint is acquiring.Dish is working with Goodfriend Government Affairs, run by former Clinton administration official turned lobbyist David Goodfriend, and the law firms Steptoe & Johnson and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.Opponents of the Dubai Ports deal were able to enlist high profile politicians including Senator Charles Schumer in their fight. But so far, the lobbying campaign has not yet caught on in a Washington mired in partisan bickering.The most vocal critics of SoftBank’s deal so far have been former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, Republican senator Orrin Hatch, and former Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell.During a House hearing on cybersecurity on Tuesday, Mr McConnell said he opposed foreign ownership of Sprint. “If you are in the intelligence business …the one thing you would love to do is run the telecommunications infrastructure in another country,” he said.
58;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-05-21T16:05:42Z;Sprint boosts Clearwire offer in last-minute effort to save bid;;Sprint made a last-minute effort to save its bid for wireless internet provider Clearwire, boosting its offer by 14 per cent ahead of a Tuesday shareholder vote that was likely to block the deal.Sprint, the third largest mobile phone operator in the US, now plans to offer $3.40 per share for the 50 per cent of Clearwire it does not already own, a big increase from its previous offer of $2.97 per share. Clearwire shares had been trading above Sprint’s original offer price thanks in part to a conditional offer from Dish Network valued at $3.30 per share.The vote has been rescheduled for next Thursday. Clearwire shares were trading at $3.40 after the announcement, signalling the new offer would be cleared by shareholders.The manoeuvring is part of a complex web of deals that is reshaping the US wireless industry. Sprint is seeking to take full control of Clearwire so it can use its troves of wireless spectrum to bolster its wireless offerings around the country, allowing it to compete more effectively against a newly combined T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS, and industry leaders Verizon Wireless and AT&T.At the same time Sprint itself is a target of rival offers. It has agreed to sell 70 per cent of itself to Japan’s SoftBank for $20.1bn, a deal that could close in the coming months if it goes ahead.However, Dish, the satellite television provider, has made a $25.5bn offer for full control of Sprint. On Monday SoftBank granted Sprint permission to open up its books for Dish, which can now conduct due diligence.People close to the situation said taking full control of Clearwire was unlikely to sway the special committee of Sprint’s board evaluating the rival offers one way or the other.Sprint has sought full control of Clearwire for years, and clearing next week’s vote would resolve years of governance headaches for the companies, which have fought over the strategic direction of the heavily indebted but spectrum-rich wireless internet provider.For Sprint’s suitors, the implications are less clear. Masayoshi Son, the billionaire chief executive of SoftBank, last week told the Financial Times that having control of Clearwire was “essential”, but that he need not have full control.“At worst case, 68 per cent ownership through Sprint and majority board control is sufficient to do arm’s lengths transactions,” he said.For Dish, which is already sitting on lots of unused spectrum, the need to own all of Clearwire is less pressing. However, Dish had signalled it was willing to buy Clearwire as well, while Dish chairman Charlie Ergen has demonstrated an insatiable appetite for spectrum, buying up whatever he can.Mr Ergen this week also made a a $2bn ‘stalking horse’ bid on Monday for spectrum owned by LightSquared, the US broadband operator that is in the midst of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganisation.Additional reporting by Paul Taylor in New York
59;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-05-15T14:31:27Z;Dish Network gains edge in battle for Sprint with $9bn financing;;Dish Network has lined up financing on its $25.5bn bid for Sprint Nextel, overcoming attempts by its rival suitor SoftBank of Japan to persuade banks to boycott the US group, according to people familiar with the process.Dish has said it needs $9bn of financing to back its bid for Sprint. This was flagged up as a big weakness in the US group’s proposal by SoftBank’s chief executive Masayoshi Son during the public war of words between the rivals.SoftBank’s $20.1bn bid for the US’s third-biggest mobile network was launched last October and had already been agreed by the board when Dish tried to break into the process with its offer a month ago. A special committee of Sprint’s board has been formed to rule on whether Dish should be invited to bid formally.The US satellite broadcaster, run by billionaire entrepreneur Charlie Ergen, has now lined up a consortium of four banks – Barclays, Jefferies, Macquarie and Royal Bank of Canada – to fund its bid.They have agreed to arrange a $2.5bn bond deal for Dish and to provide at least $6.5bn in syndicated loans, which would later be refinanced with bonds.SoftBank tried to thwart Dish’s financing talks by telling banks that it could threaten their chances of being involved in the $60bn-plus share listing of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce group in which SoftBank holds a one-third stake, according to two people familiar with the situation.However, it is widely expected within the financial industry that the nine banks which recently agreed to lend Alibaba $8bn to refinance older debt will be in pole position to secure the prime roles on the initial public offering.Those banks were ANZ, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, DBS of Singapore, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JPMorgan, Mizuho of Japan and Morgan Stanley.With its efforts, Dish has hoped Sprint directors will focus on the headline offer of each bid as they conduct their analysis. But SoftBank has argued that factors such as financing dilution, future capital expenditure and the time value of any delay be considered.Dish has pushed back on SoftBank’s assertion that a Dish deal for Sprint could take up to a year to close, saying it could close its deal within the calendar year since it did not face review from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.Shares in Sprint have gained more than 44 per cent since mid-October when reports of SoftBank’s potential offer first arrived.Additional reporting by David Gelles and Arash Massoudi
60;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
61;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-05-13T19:39:13Z;SoftBank leans on banks in effort to disrupt Dish’s Sprint bid;;SoftBank is trying to thwart its rival’s bid for Sprint Nextel by leaning on investment banks and asking them not to finance the offer from Dish Network.The Japanese telecoms group, which owns one third of Alibaba, is telling banks that their chances of being involved in the Chinese e-commerce group’s mammoth share listing could be under threat if they help Dish raise the $9bn it needs to fund its competing bid, according to two people familiar with the situation.The battle between US-based Dish and SoftBank for the US’s third-biggest mobile telecoms group has seen the rival chief executives blast each other’s offers in public as they try to convince shareholders that their own is the best deal.SoftBank’s $20.1bn bid was launched first and has been agreed by the Sprint board, but Dish has tried to break in at the 11th hour with a $25.5bn bid a month ago. A special committee of Sprint’s board has been formed to decide whether Dish should be invited to bid formally.Charlie Ergen of Dish and Masayoshi Son of SoftBank have each talked down the financial value of the other’s offer and the industrial logic of a deal with their rival. Mr Son has criticised Dish for not having the funding in place to back up its offer.Alibaba is expected to launch the most highly anticipated initial public offering since Facebook’s last year either in the final quarter of this year or early in 2014. Investment banks are desperate to be involved in the deal at a time when many are still struggling to make decent profits in Asia and where the IPO market remains weak, particularly in Hong Kong where the e-commerce group is expected to list.Alibaba this month agreed an $8bn loan deal with nine banks to refinance other more costly debt, and those banks expect to be given lead roles in the roughly $60bn-$80bn listing, say people familiar with the process.Alibaba has not yet asked any banks for their pitches to be part of the IPO.The banks involved in the loan are Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, DBS, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JPMorgan, Mizuho Corporate Bank and Morgan Stanley, according to the people close to the situation.While SoftBank is a major shareholder in Alibaba, it is unlikely to be able to dictate to the Chinese group’s management. However, it could make life very difficult for an individual bank to be involved if it set itself against one.Alibaba and SoftBank both declined to comment. Dish could not immediately be reached for comment.
62;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-05-09T19:26:09Z;Dish and SoftBank trade blows over Sprint;;The billionaire telecoms moguls fighting for control of Sprint Nextel continued their public spat on Thursday, with Charlie Ergen of Dish and Masayoshi Son of SoftBank pleading their case to shareholders.Both men are jostling to control Sprint, the third-largest US wireless carrier, as the US mobile phone industry undergoes a massive round of upheaval, with old rivals partnering up and new entrants looking for seats at the table.Mr Ergen, whose Dish Network has made a rival $25.5bn bid for Sprint to top the agreed $20.1bn SoftBank offer, spoke as his company reported first-quarter results, and said he was confident he could win Sprint.“From a regulatory point of view, I don’t have any doubt that Dish-Sprint can get done,” Mr Ergen said. “And I have no doubt that we have a higher offer on the table.”Mr Ergen made his offer nearly a month ago. But a special committee of Sprint’s board is still deciding whether to invite a formal bid from Dish.Dish reported a 40 per cent decline in net profits. Its core satellite television business is mature, and faces bleak growth prospects as US consumers turn to online video.As a hedge, Dish has amassed billions of dollars worth of wireless spectrum that it wants to use to bolster Sprint. This would allow Mr Ergen to offer consumers bundled offerings of wireless video, phone and internet.Meanwhile, Mr Son, in New York to court Sprint shareholders, said in an interview that investors were “starting to digest what we’ve been telling [them], and the response has been pretty good”.Mr Son said if Sprint were acquired by Dish it would be sidelined for about three years, as the deal closed and then as Dish incorporated its spectrum into the new company.“They’ll kill the company,” added Ron Fisher, president of SoftBank.SoftBank said it expects to close its deal in the coming months, and would then invest billions into Sprint.Dish and SoftBank are also jockeying for control of Clearwire, a wireless internet provider that would bolster Sprint’s spectrum holdings.Mr Ergen on Thursday disclosed that he had made new debt and equity investments in both Sprint and Clearwire. Dish said it had acquired Clearwire debt valued at $950m at the end of March, in addition to a small $75m equity stake in Sprint as well as $592m in derivatives linked to Sprint’s equity trading price.Yet even as Mr Ergen manoeuvred for a blocking stake in Clearwire, Mr Son said he believed Sprint’s current ownership stake was enough to achieve his objectives. “At at worst case, 68 per cent ownership through Sprint and majority board control is sufficient to do arm’s length transactions,” Mr Son said.Mr Son also said the spectrum Dish would contribute to Sprint might be valuable, but would cost at least $6bn to deploy. “It’s like getting the gift of a cow in a Manhattan apartment,” Mr Son said. “It costs more to keep the cow alive.”Mr Ergen acknowledged that if SoftBank raised its bid, Dish might be forced to bring in a strategic partner rather than add to the merged company’s projected debt levels, an issue that already concerns some analysts and Sprint shareholders.Some analysts have speculated that Japan’s NTT DoCoMo, with deep knowledge of the mobile telecoms sector, might help Dish persuade Sprint shareholders to back its bid.But Mr Son dismissed the threat of such a partnership. “At least we have had experience with DoCoMo, and we have already won,” he said, referring to SoftBank’s dominant market share in Japan.If Dish’s offer for Sprint is rebuffed, Mr Ergen said that going direct to shareholders with a hostile bid was one option that could be considered. Other options might include the sale of Dish’s extensive spectrum holdings which it values at “$10bn or more”, a partnership with another company, or the sale of Dish as a whole.Firing back, Mr Son said there were no good precedents for bundling mobile phone and satellite service, a linchpin of Mr Ergen’s proposal. “I’ve never seen even one successful case in the world for bundling satellite and mobile and being able to get a meaningful number of customer acquisition,” he said.
63;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-05-05T18:13:08Z;Dish rebuts SoftBank’s claims over Sprint bid;;"Dish Network has fired back at SoftBank after the Japanese telecommunications group last week disparaged its US rival’s bid for Sprint Nextel, the wireless carrier.In comments to the Financial Times, Dish rebutted what it said were inaccurate and misleading claims made by SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son about the value, timing and potential synergies of the duelling bids.By going on the offensive, Dish hopes to persuade Sprint’s board that it should be allowed to conduct due diligence on the third-largest US wireless carrier by subscribers.The US satellite television provider has made a $7-a-share cash and stock proposal to buy Sprint valued at $25.5bn, topping the agreed deal for SoftBank to buy 70 per cent of Sprint for $12.1bn with a promise to invest a further $8bn in the company. A special committee of Sprint’s board is deciding whether to invite a formal bid from Dish.But Mr Son last week said that the SoftBank offer was worth $7.65 a share. He described the Japanese group’s bid as a 21 per cent premium to Dish’s offer, which he said was actually worth only $6.31 a share, after synergies.Dish said this was an “apples to oranges” comparison. To reach that value for the Dish bid, SoftBank subtracted the cost of capital expenditure that Dish would have to make. In calculating the value of its own bid, SoftBank included optimistic new projections about the value of its own synergies with Sprint.“The math is simple; our offer is higher,” said a Dish spokesman. “At Dish’s current share price, our offer is $7.10 a share while SoftBank’s offer is $6.38 a share.”Dish is hoping Sprint directors will focus on the headline offer price of each bid as they conduct their analysis. But SoftBank is arguing that factors such as financing dilution, future capital expenditures, and the time value of any delay be considered.Dish also says SoftBank’s assertion that a Dish deal for Sprint would take at least a year to close is misinformed. Dish said its deal would be expected to close this calendar year since it did not face review from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US.However, as part of any review, the Federal Communications Commission will have to conduct a spectrum screen process to look for concentrations in individual markets. Most complex telecom deals have taken a year or more to approve. SoftBank expects to receive final CFIUS clearance soon.Dish said it would also be able to pay down its debt faster than SoftBank, thanks to the revenues from its satellite television operations.Under Dish ownership, Sprint shareholders would receive stock in a new company in which all shareholders had the same incentives. But under SoftBank ownership, Dish said, Sprint minority shareholders would be invested in a company controlled by a foreign company with potential conflicts of interest.On the point of synergies, Dish said it had identified $11bn in cost savings by combining back offices, call centres and real estate, while SoftBank would not enjoy such benefits. It also said it was unreasonable to characterise its existing spectrum holdings as a liability, saying they were an asset that could be used or sold to strengthen a combined Dish-Sprint.“Sprint shareholders are going to accept the offer from the company that brings the most to the table, including the best price and strategic plan going forward,” Dish said. “Dish is offering more money, greater synergies, and we’re bringing over $10bn of spectrum.”"
64;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-30T12:20:05Z;SoftBank: Sprint finish;Japanese telco’s energetic dealmaker determined to close deal;"Energy counts for much in getting big deals done. Masayoshi Son has delivered a punchy defence of the value in his bid for Sprint compared with that of Charlie Ergen’s Dish Network. But his performance was not aimed at his home base so much as Sprint’s shareholders, who must choose. Thus SoftBank investors are no clearer about their future.SoftBank’s share price suggests they are either relaxed about that, or too confused to move. Initial horror at a releveraged SoftBank after the deal went public in October wiped one-fifth off its shares. That had been recovered by the time Shinzo Abe’s likely election sent the Tokyo market on a tear, after which SoftBank has gained nearly four-fifths compared with three-fifths for the broader Topix. Since Dish hove into view, SoftBank has matched the Topix. Relief that Mr Son does not plan to increase his bid has a lot to do with that, although SoftBank is likely to be downgraded to junk if the Sprint deal proceeds as it is. On Tuesday Mr Son deployed various arguments, including Mr Ergen’s lack of expertise in telecoms. This is an interesting tactic from a man who has variously owned stakes in businesses ranging from chipmakers to magazines and TV broadcasters. Mr Son’s valuation sums were as assumption-filled as Mr Ergen’s two weeks ago. But such is dealmaking. The most arresting were around the cost to Sprint of the delay in much-needed investment should it choose to wait for the Dish offer, and the hefty $1bn charge if the SoftBank deal is broken.If Mr Son loses Sprint, SoftBank will get more than $4bn in currency hedge profits, compensation and its Sprint stake. But that will leave
Mr Son doubtless seeking another deal, and the same process starts all over again. Thus will it always be with such an energetic dealmaker. SoftBank’s muted market moves suggests its investors accept that.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
65;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-23T23:21:08Z;Online video: Web of creativity means greater opportunities to boost sales;Growth of platforms and content changes the nature of the game, writes Matthew Garrahan;"There is a new kid on the block in the advertising world, with online video evolving rapidly and audiences on the rise. Forget about skateboarding cats and the amateur, user-generated videos that used to dominate YouTube: these days the internet is full of slick, professionally produced programming that would not look out of place on prime time television.Whether it’s Vuguru’s comedy Little Women, Big Cars, which attracted big audiences on AOL, Burning Love, from Ben Stiller’s Red Hour Films, airing exclusively on Yahoo, or any of the new YouTube channels packed with professionally made content, the quality of original online video is beginning to compare favourably with TV.The question for producers of this content and the platforms that distribute it is whether advertising dollars will follow viewers moving from TV to online. Analysts say it will, eventually. Total advertising on digital video is forecast to almost double from about $4bn in 2013 to $8bn by 2016, according to eMarketer, the research company.TV will continue to be the primary home of video advertising, with revenues projected to rise from $66bn in 2013 to $73bn. Despite the fragmentation of audiences and time-shifting viewers who use DVRs to watch programmes when they choose – and skip the ads – TV will “continue to dominate spending”, says the eMarketer report.“These two worlds – online video advertising and television advertising – are going to collide,” says Tracey Scheppach, executive vice-president of innovation at VivaKi, a division of Publicis specialising in digital advertising. “What will emerge is the idea of addressable advertising.” In other words, advertising that is targeted specifically to the particular viewer based on available data. DirecTV and Dish Network, two satellite operators, are already experimenting with targeted TV ads.Online video can personalise ads – some sites, such as Hulu, allow viewers to choose ads which are more relevant to them before viewing. But, until they perfect the art of online ad targeting, the digital video sector has a potential problem to grapple with. The sheer number of platforms, producers, publishers and programmes out there mean an abundance of advertising inventory is available for brands looking to reach particular audiences.YouTube has bankrolled more than 100 channels from companies, including Vice Media and Machinima, to create original content; other operators, such as Maker Studios, which is backed by, among others, the actor Robert Downey Jr and media executive Elisabeth Murdoch, have created a network of online video stars.These companies have built vast online audiences but, with all the programming available, advertisers are struggling to catch up. CPMs – the cost per thousand impressions, a key advertising metric for the sector – are under pressure. BrightRoll, a digital video advertising company, says online video CPMs in 2012 were down by as much as 15 per cent on 2011. CPMs, says eMarketer, will fall from $45 in 2010 to $31.20 by 2014, where they are projected to stay flat until 2017.Is this decline bad news for the producers and distributors of online video? “The people making the shows are seeing more users and [the number of users] is growing exponentially,” says Dan Mosher, general manager of BrightRoll Exchange, the video advertising exchange.This, he says, will offset the decline in CPMs because the number of people watching online video is growing faster than those rates are falling. “This is about the overall industry growing. Advertisers aren’t hitting the kind of scale in digital video that they are used to in TV.” Advertising spending will continue to move from TV to online platforms, he adds. “We’re already seeing that and it will continue to happen.”His confidence is echoed by Larry Tanz, chief executive of Vuguru, one of the most prolific producers of programming for the web. The company makes shows for distribution on a range of platforms, including Hulu, AOL and Yahoo, which is airing Vuguru’s puppet comedy, The Fuzz,“There’s been a big increase in volume [of viewers] and there are also more advertisers,” he says.The bigger issue for the sector is that it is so young, Mr Tanz adds: brands are not used to buying advertising time in the way they buy airtime on TV.That will change. “This is a great time to be a content owner and creator because now you have distribution platforms that are trying to increase their inventory by increasing their audiences,” he says. “They need premium and original content to do that.”"
66;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-21T20:30:37Z;US telcos pave way for more mergers;;Blame the iPhone. Since the debut of Apple’s smartphone in 2007, wireless data consumption in the US has mushroomed. Consumers now expect rapid access to email and the internet and video streamed to their handset cheaply and swiftly.For a few years the five big US wireless carriers were able to maintain the status quo. But as increasing demand for spectrum shows no sign of letting up, the industry has entered into a tumultuous round of consolidation.The latest big deal came last week, as Dish Network offered $25.5bn forSprint Nextel. The deal would give Dish chairman Charlie Ergen a unified offering of wireless voice and data services. It would also scuttle the agreed $20.1bn move by SoftBank to take control of Sprint.Whether it is Mr Ergen or Masayoshi Son, the SoftBank chief, who ultimately wins the battle for Sprint, their deal is unlikely to be the last in a wholesale reshaping of the $178bn-a-year US mobile phone market.There are more than 320m mobile subscribers in the US and four major US mobile network operators, Verizon Wireless, AT&T Mobility, Sprint and Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit. Smaller providers like MetroPCS, and wireless internet operator Clearwire, are also in the mix.Each is now pursuing deals that would strengthen it at home, and in some cases, abroad. Although Verizon and AT&T, the two largest US carriers, are constrained by regulators in their ability to expand through acquisitions, each is looking at other options. Verizon is seeking to take full control of Verizon Wireless by buying the minority stake owned by Vodafone. AT&T is seeking European deals to balance its dependence on US revenues.Sprint is in the midst of a tug-of-war between Dish and SoftBank, and at the same time is buying Clearwire, a spectrum-rich asset that is haemorrhaging cash.Complicating matters further is that T-Mobile USA is in the process of reverse-merging with MetroPCS. This deal paves the way for T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom to exit the asset.All these deals may just be precursors to a merger of the third and fourth largest players. Many in the industry believe that neither Sprint nor T-Mobile will be able to independently compete with Verizon and AT&T, and will be pressured to merge in the coming years.“You have a three-way dance,” says a person involved in the deals. “There’s Charlie [Ergen], there’s Sprint, and there’s T-Mobile. You have lots of permutations.”How open regulators are to further consolidation remains to be seen. The origins of the current tumult go back to 2011, when AT&T Mobility made an agreed offer of $39bn for T-Mobile, the smallest of the four major US mobile network operators, which has struggled in recent years.The bid was driven by AT&T’s then-urgent need for wireless spectrum to accommodate the growing data demands of its smartphone and tablet user subscribers. But it was ultimately withdrawn at the end of 2011 after opposition from the US Justice Department and Federal Communications CommissionAT&T initially had exclusive rights to the iPhone, making it the first to feel the full effects of the new generation of data-hungry consumers. Mobile data volumes for the company surged by a staggering 8,000 per cent from 2007 to 2010.Yet at the time, the DoJ and FCC opposed a so-called “four to three” merger that would have strengthened AT&T further while reducing competition. Since then Julius Genachowski, FCC chairman, has repeatedly defended the move.“Three years ago, the US mobile market was on the doorstep of duopoly,” he said when he announced that he was stepping down as FCC chairman last month.But with Mr Genachowski’s departure, along with the exit of other FCC commissioners, many in the industry wonder if a refreshed slate of commissioners might approve more aggressive consolidation. “You’ve got two behemoths,” said another person close to the deals. “Intuitively, anything that creates a truly third competitor has to be on the table.”The breakneck speed of consolidation has been driven by three main factors: First, in a capital-intensive industry, scale typically translates into savings, better margins and higher profits.Second, while the availability of wireless spectrum underpins all mobile communications, the launch of Apple’s iPhone in 2007 and other advanced smartphones heralded an explosion in mobile data usage. To accommodate these new demands, mobile operators had to seek out new spectrum by bidding at auction, through spectrum swaps and by acquiring rivals.“Spectrum is at least as valuable right now as subscribers or cash flow,” said one adviser working on deals in the sector.Third, the shift in the US mobile industry from incompatible 3G technologies to 4G based on a common technology called LTE, has required significant new capital expenditure to roll out the new networks – but eased persistent concerns about the problem of post-merger network integration.Whether or not US telecoms regulators would accept a reduction in the number of major US network operators from four to three, remains a moot point. Many US industry analysts believe that ultimately some form of combination of Sprint, Clearwire and T-Mobile USA will take place.Two years ago, Timothy Horan of Oppenheimer predicted that a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile was “inevitable” to allow them to compete effectively with AT&T and Verizon. Now he adds, “Dish is complicating matters and it is probably going to take a bit longer than I realised at the time.”
67;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-21T13:27:11Z;Dish stresses ad benefits of Sprint deal;;Charlie Ergen, chairman of Dish Network, said his $25.5bn pursuit of Sprint Nextel would allow him to revolutionise the way mobile advertisements are delivered to consumers.By uniting Dish and Sprint Mr Ergen would create the first US company to offer nationwide mobile phone, data and video services. Dish could then use location and content consumption data, among other factors, to deliver targeted adverts, he said.“We think we can target commercials even better on a mobile basis,” Mr Ergen told the Financial Times. “We’ll know where you are with GPS. We’ll know who you call. We’ll know how you spend your money with the phone being a wallet in the future. All that goes together.”Other media companies are working on similar efforts, but despite rising mobile usage, ad dollars for mobile dramatically lag.Mr Ergen’s comments add new clarity to the rationale for his surprise move for Sprint, which would trump the agreed $20.1bn deal for the third-largest US wireless provider by SoftBank of Japan. Sprint’s special committee is evaluating the Dish offer.Mr Ergen said Dish would be a better long-term corporate parent for Sprint than SoftBank. Although SoftBank would bring $5bn in immediate cash to Sprint, Mr Ergen said Dish would generate more cash during the next five years, and could delever its balance sheet quickly.“SoftBank is coming in and solving a balance sheet problem, but at the end of the day it’s still Sprint,” he said.Mr Ergen is pursuing Sprint as Dish’s satellite television business has “matured”. He has accumulated broad swaths of spectrum in recent years, seeking entrance into the mobile phone and data business, but not knowing exactly how.The path forward came in December 2011 when cable television companies including Comcast and Time Warner Cable sold their wireless spectrum to Verizon.“That was an indication that the cable industry was going to stay inside the home, and Verizon was going to stay outside the home,” Mr Ergen said. “Absent that, the cable industry could have gone outside the home. But when they sold their spectrum we realised we had a chance to be a truly unique company.”Mr Ergen also defended Dish’s Hopper ad-skipping technology, which News Corp, CBS and Comcast have sued to block.“There’s no criticism coming from consumers on the Hopper,” he said. “There is criticism from the networks, who rely on a dual revenue stream” of ads and fees from cable operators.“We’re not against a dual revenue stream,” Mr Ergen said, adding that he wanted networks to make ads more targeted.Aereo, the disruptive Barry Diller-backed start-up that delivers broadcast television over the internet, is a threat to satellite television, Mr Ergen said, providing further impetus for a Sprint bid. “If they’re successful they’ll change the dynamics. It would pose a risk to our business model.”
68;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-19T18:21:20Z;Charlie Ergen: Media mogul at a Sprint;The poker-playing chairman of Dish Network is placing his biggest bet yet;"Last weekend Charlie Ergen was holed up in the Times Square offices of Barclays, preparing an offer to buy Sprint Nextel for $25.5bn. When food was delivered for the sleep-deprived deal team, the chairman of Dish Network declined. He requested a hot dog from a street vendor; it was cheaper, he reasoned.His pedestrian culinary preferences reflect the frugality, independence and common-man touch that have made Mr Ergen, 60, the most unlikely media mogul of his generation. Behind this façade, however, is a cut-throat operator. A former professional poker player who strikes fear into employees and baffles rivals, he has made a career of counterintuitive business decisions and fierce competition on price.With his bid for US telecoms group Sprint, Mr Ergen is placing his biggest bet to date. By marrying the satellite television service of the company he cofounded with Sprint’s mobile phone business, he would recast the way Americans consume media. In doing so he would save Dish, with its $17bn market capitalisation, from atrophy. At the same time he would scuttle a deal by fellow billionaire Masayoshi Son of Japan, whose SoftBank has already agreed to buy Sprint for $20.1bn.Mr Ergen says he wants to improve service and cut costs. “We’re going to get really bloody fighting for consumers,” he says. History suggests this is just the sort of battle he delights in. “He’s a street fighter,” says Maggie Wilderotter, the chief executive of Frontier Communications with whom he has worked on deals. “And he’s fearless.”Born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the self-described “country boy” still speaks with a Southern drawl. His father, a physicist, emigrated from Austria before the second world war and worked on the Manhattan Project, coining the term “China Syndrome” to describe a nuclear meltdown. Mr Ergen studied finance at the University of Tennessee, then earned a business degree from Wake Forest University in North Carolina.He joined snack-maker Frito-Lay as an accountant, but soon quit, bored. When he tried his hand at poker – he still peppers earnings calls with gambling references – he was kicked out of a casino for counting cards.In 1980 he and poker buddy Jim DeFranco founded EchoStar, a satellite television company. At the time, a minority of Americans had cable television. “We didn’t know how to spell ‘satellite’,” he once said. They were based in Colorado, where the Rocky Mountains deprived rural customers of terrestrial TV signals. Driving to the company’s first installation, Mr Ergen went too fast and the outsize dish flew off the trailer, destroying half his inventory.EchoStar took off, and in 1996 launched Dish, which beamed cable TV to smaller, pizza-sized dishes. EchoStar and Dish eventually split, although Mr Ergen still controls both. Dish is now the third-largest US pay-TV company, with 14m customers. He is worth $11bn, the 100th richest person on Earth.Building Dish left Mr Ergen with a list of media moguls as enemies. In 2001, News Corp had agreed to buy Dish competitor DirecTV, which would have given Rupert Murdoch a US complement to his British-based BSkyB, creating a global satellite TV network. Mr Ergen killed the deal at the last minute, offering $28bn in a move that foreshadowed this week’s bid for Sprint. Dish won the auction for DirecTV – although regulators blocked it, it was enough to keep the prize out of his rival’s hands.More recently, Mr Ergen has rankled the broadcast networks by introducing the Hopper, which allows Dish subscribers to skip advertisements. He repeats he is just giving viewers what they want: “Why is Dish the only one fighting for consumers?” But the Hopper has earned him the title of “most hated man in Hollywood”, and drew public ire from Les Moonves, CBS chief executive. It also drew a lawsuit. ABC, CBS, NBC and have sued the company to outlaw the Hopper.Mr Ergen is used to it. Battles with competitors have dragged on for decades. Besides fights with the networks, those currently in progress include two with the government over Dish’s telemarketing tactics.The website 24/7 Wall St recently named Dish the “meanest company in America”. If staff tip more than 17 per cent on meals when traveling for business they are not reimbursed. Some report being berated by Mr Ergen, who wields ultimate authority even after stepping down as chief executive two years ago. “I don’t hold myself up as a great manager,” he says. He controls 90 per cent of voting rights, and the board comprises close allies and his wife of more than 30 years, Candy.Ever frugal, they have lived in the same house in Denver for 20 years, raising five children. At home, he packs a lunch of a sandwich and Gatorade. Until recently he followed company policy and shared hotel rooms with colleagues. For a time, he signed all cheques over $10,000. “My mom grew up in the Depression,” he says. “I don’t have a mahogany desk.”He does, however, enjoy adventure. Mr Ergen ventured to Kazakhstan, China and French Guiana to watch EchoStar’s satellite launches. He has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and the highest peak in the Andes, and visited Everest base camp. When at home, he hikes in the Rocky Mountains and has scaled all 54 peaks in Colorado of at least 14,000ft. Each summer he leads Dish interns up a “fourteener”.With more than half his fortune in Dish stock, his fate rides on the Sprint bid. “We’re taking chances and taking risk,” he says. “And you’re talking to a chairman who’s willing to risk his net worth on the company.”Mr Ergen claims no mentors; he learnt business skills from gambling. Blackjack taught him there was always a right move and a wrong move. Backgammon taught him to see a few moves ahead. Poker taught him to bluff, using other people’s emotions to his advantage. “That was my second MBA,” he says.He is still a card shark. On hiring managers, he hosts a poker game. Usually, says a friend, “he takes them for every dollar they have”.The writer is the FT’s US mergers and acquisitions correspondent"
69;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-17T18:02:40Z;Rival offers weighed up in race for Sprint;;Sprint Nextel, the third-largest wireless carrier in the US, is about to become a very different company. But no one, not even Sprint’s directors and executives, knows what it will look like.If it proceeds with an agreed deal to become majority owned by SoftBank of Japan, Sprint will receive a $5bn cash infusion from the Asian telecoms company.With that, it could begin to expand its US network, positioning it to compete with market leaders Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Consummating the deal will make Sprint somewhat levered, but not so much that capital expenditure would be hindered.But Sprint may instead be bought by Dish Network, the satellite television provider based in Colorado that on Monday trumped SoftBank’s bid. Under Dish ownership, Sprint would gain an infusion of valuable wireless spectrum it could use to expand its service offerings, but join a company with a precarious debt load.“We believe Dish+Sprint could have a better chance at being a formidable wireless competitor,” wrote Christopher Larsen, analyst at PiperJaffray. “On the flip side, the Dish deal would bring a more highly levered company with less cash available for network builds.”Dish unveiled an unsolicited $25.5bn offer for Sprint last week, trumping a $20.1bn move made last October by SoftBank.A special committee of Sprint’s board is evaluating the Dish proposal, determining if it is likely to lead to a superior offer, which would set the stage for a formal counterbid. But because Dish is offering cash and stock, the special committee must consider not only the headline price of each offer, but the financial health of the combined company.On the face of it the Dish bid looks dangerously levered. Dish-Sprint would have more than $40bn in net debt, nearly five times expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Additionally, Dish would have to spend billions building out a network to make use of the spectrum it has, to support a unified offering of mobile phone, internet and video services.Finally, whichever company wins will be responsible for continuing losses at Clearwire, a wireless internet provider that Sprint is buying . Clearwire burnt through $500m last year, an improvement over 2011. People close to the company said the losses would continue for years.Dish has received a letter from its financial adviser, Barclays, saying the bank is highly confident it can finance the deal. People familiar with Dish’s plans argued that because debt was cheap now, such a highly levered deal was feasible.The $9.3bn that Dish will have to borrow up-front should add only several hundred million dollars per year in interest expenses.One person familiar with Dish’s offer believes the cost of servicing that debt would be less than $1bn for the first three years, leaving plenty of cash for infrastructure investments.“Through a combination of [free cash flow] from [Dish] and potential divestitures of spectrum (a possible requirement to close the deal) or non-core assets the new Dish could support the required capex,” wrote Credit Suisse analysts. While Dish, Sprint and Clearwire have billions of dollars of loans maturing in the coming years, the low interest rate environment means refinancing should be easy, they said.But other analysts believe that a deal with SoftBank makes more sense in the longer term, for several reasons. In a note to investors, New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin argued that the Dish offer failed to bring the capital or management needed to build and operate a next-generation mobile network.He pointd out that Sprint needed to invest about $8bn in 2013 and for the next few years to update and expand its network. “The Dish offer …leaves limited capacity to make the required investment and seriously limits future strategic flexibility,” Mr Chaplin said.Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley expressed concern that Sprint needed more investment than Dish could provide. “Dish is aiming to acquire an asset with significant capital needs, that has been struggling to maintain its customer base, and is in the midst of a major network expansion project,” he said.Some investors, however, are already favouring the Dish offer. “Dish is offering more value to Sprint shareholders and also is contributing valuable spectrum, 14m subscribers, cost synergies and revenue synergies,” said John Paulson of Paulson & Co, owner of 4 per cent of Sprint shares. “Dish needs to firm up the financing but it’s a compelling offer.”
70;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-16T10:25:29Z;Dish turns Sprint race into long haul test;;"Charlie Ergen’s move to snatch Sprint Nextel from the grasp of Japan’s Masayoshi Son has set the stage for a potential bidding war between strong-willed billionaires who have disrupted telecoms industries on two continents.Investors in Mr Son’s SoftBank, however, are not keen to see the drama play out.Shares in SoftBank fell as much as 10 per cent on Tuesday after Dish Network, Mr Ergen’s satellite TV operator, unveiled an unsolicited $25.5bn offer for Sprint, the third-largest US mobile phone provider with 46m subscribers. His bid trumped a $20.1bn offer for Sprint made by Mr Son last October.Industry experts suggested that investors sold SoftBank stock, which closed down 6.8 per cent, not because they were worried the company would miss out on a lucrative acquisition opportunity. Rather, it was more likely that they feared Mr Son would come back with a more generous offer – one that could stretch SoftBank’s finances and possibly lead to a dilutive issue of new shares.“The issue for Son is that he wants to build a global company; he promised to do that. This is probably the one shot he has of doing that and I don’t think he’s going to walk away,” Neil Juggins, Hong Kong-based telecoms analyst at JI Asia, an affiliate of Société Générale, told Reuters.Mr Son is known as a savvy and opportunistic investor with a history of spotting underpriced assets – from Yahoo in the mid-1990s to Japan’s Aozora Bank and the Japanese operations of Vodafone, which it bought in 2006 and turned into what is now the core of SoftBank’s portfolio of businesses.A bloodless calculation of the risks and rewards of pursuing Sprint might well convince Mr Son to let Dish scoop up his prize. SoftBank would receive a $600m break-up fee if Sprint were to abrogate their tentative deal, along with an even larger financing-related windfall.To protect itself from currency swings, SoftBank locked in a forward exchange rate of Y82 to the US dollar when it agreed the deal six months ago. Since then, the yen’s value has plunged to nearly Y100 to the dollar, leaving SoftBank with a potential gain of $2bn should it decide simply to cash in the contracts and pocket the difference.SoftBank is also sitting on a paper profit of $1bn from a $3.1bn convertible bond it purchased from Sprint last year. Sprint’s shares jumped to a four-and-a-half-year high after Dish disclosed its interest on Monday, and are trading almost $2 above the purchase price of $5.25 a share.Mr Son’s desire to expand his empire could be stronger than the lure of one-time profits, however. When he entered the mobile business in 2006 he said he would make SoftBank, Japan’s third-biggest mobile provider, bigger than the domestic leader NTT DoCoMo within a decade, a goal he could fulfil by buying Sprint.“Everybody laughed at me at the time,” he recalled when he announced the Sprint deal last year.In a written response to Mr Ergen’s bid, SoftBank on Tuesday said its existing agreement offered “superior short- and long-term benefits to Dish’s highly conditional preliminary proposal”.It did not elaborate, but a person close to the situation said its appeal to Sprint management and shareholders would focus on the vulnerability of Mr Ergen’s cash-and-share offer to swings in Dish’s share price, as well as what SoftBank argues is a lack of certainty about whether Dish can raise enough money to fund a deal.Even so, Christopher Larsen, an analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co, said SoftBank would need to sweeten its bid by $2bn to match Dish’s offer.Mr Son is drawing down most of SoftBank’s nearly Y800bn ($8.2bn) of cash reserves to fund what would be the biggest foreign acquisition by a Japanese company. Analysts said he would have little difficulty expanding the remaining portion of loans he has secured from Japanese banks if he decided to sweeten his offer, though some said a share issue – a particularly commonplace financing move for Japanese groups – might also be considered.In the past, Mr Son has shown he is not afraid to borrow to make big bets. The Vodafone acquisition cost SoftBank $15bn, making it Japan’s largest leveraged buyout at the time. The debts that he took on to fund it have only recently been paid off."
71;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-15T22:44:34Z;Ergen trumps SoftBank with $25bn Sprint bid;;Charlie Ergen, chairman of Dish Network, launched his boldest bid to date on Monday with a $25.5bn offer for Sprint Nextel that trumped an agreed deal for the US wireless carrier by Japan’s SoftBank.The enigmatic billionaire is jockeying for position as the US wireless industry undergoes a tumultuous round of consolidation that will position a new batch of winners and losers in the world’s most valuable telecoms market.The unsolicited cash and stock bid, which would marry the second-ranked US satellite television operator with the third-largest US mobile phone provider, both by subscribers, is the latest sign of a budding revival of high stakes mergers and acquisitions.Colorado-based Dish caught Sprint and SoftBank by surprise. Sprint said it would evaluate the proposal. SoftBank said it remained committed to its deal for Sprint, which it said offered more certainty than Mr Ergen’s offer.SoftBank has so-called matching rights that could set off a bidding war for Sprint. It is entitled to a $600m break fee if its deal falls through. The Japanese group’s current offer, which is being reviewed on national security concerns, is expected to close by July 1.Buying Sprint would allow Mr Ergen to use the valuable cache of wireless spectrum he has amassed and make him a well-positioned but highly-levered rival to Verizon Wireless and AT&T, the US’s two largest mobile phone operators. A combined Dish and Sprint could also offer a “triple play” of integrated phone, internet and video services, allowing it to compete with cable operators.“Dish Sprint is the only company that could do that,” Mr Ergen said in an interview. “That is the vision. We’re going to give consumers what they want.”He has considered making offers for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit and MetroPCS in recent months. He has also launched a counter-offer for Clearwire, a spectrum-rich company that Sprint is trying to buy. “We talked to everybody in the industry,” Mr Ergen said. “That’s no secret.”But he only targeted Sprint after securing regulatory approval to use a key portion of his spectrum for wireless services. “It is a Rubik’s Cube in terms of how you solve problems,” said a person who is working on the deals. “You have to test the waters and see what works.”Dish said its bid was superior to SoftBank's $20.1bn deal for 70 per cent of Sprint. Joining Dish with Sprint would offer $37bn in synergies and growth opportunities, including an estimated $11bn in cost savings, Dish said, whereas there were minimal synergies from Japanese and US wireless providers joining forces.Mr Ergen’s bid faces hurdles. SoftBank has already provided $3.1bn in financing to Sprint, which is convertible to 16 per cent of Sprint stock. It will also have to clear the Federal Communications Commission, which wants to see more competition, but may be wary of allowing Mr Ergen to consolidate too much spectrum.Dish is offering $7 per share in cash and stock for Sprint, a 13 per cent premium over the SoftBank offer. Sprint shareholders would own 32 per cent of the combined company, compared to 30 per cent in the SoftBank deal.Sprint shares rose 13.5 per cent on Monday, while Dish shares fell 2 per cent. Barclays is advising Dish.
72;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-15T18:49:59Z;Dish / Sprint: a case of second helpings?;US wireless carrier’s shareholders are happily situated between eager bidders;Is that all you got, Masa? Sprint shareholders are happily situated between two eager bidders. Satellite TV provider Dish Network has made them a cash-and-stock offer of $7 per share. This is about 13 per cent higher than the offer from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, made back in October. Mr Son is committed to the US market and has already sunk capital in Sprint in the form of a $3.1bn convertible bond. He is likely to make another offer.It will have to be meaty. Dish operates in a business with many structural similarities to Sprint, and, unlike SoftBank, does so in the US. It can cut costs by consolidating sales and back-office operations. Dish aims for $1.8bn a year in cuts. This is not unrealistic: the two companies have $29bn in sales and overhead costs between them. Sprint shareholders will own a third of the new company and therefore, in theory, a third of the savings’ $11bn present value. All they would get from SoftBank is the thin gruel of increased purchasing power and “expertise”. Yes, Dish will have to pay a $600m break-up fee to SoftBank and the deal will leave it leveraged to at least four times its operating cash flow. But its offer remains superior.Dish also promised $24bn in future revenue growth opportunities, based on an integrated offering of wireless data and satellite television. Sprint holders should ignore these giddy figures. Bundling services does improve customer retention. But it is not possible to predict what the mobile video market will look like in a few years’ time (other than to say it will be hideously competitive).To win, Mr Son will have to make an offer that compensates Sprint shareholders for the loss of the synergies they would have harvested as owners of the new Dish. It would be rational for him to walk away instead. Sprint shareholders will hope his ego prevails.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
73;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-15T18:49:59Z;Sprint offers Dish chance for revival;;"Charlie Ergen is the wild card in the US mobile industry. As the sector has been shaken by a series of megadeals in recent months, executives, advisers and analysts knew the Colorado billionaire would be itching to play a role.On Monday his intentions became clearer. The chairman of satellite TV operator Dish Network launched an unsolicited $25.5bn bid for Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator with 46m subscribers.Taking over Sprint would allow Mr Ergen to use a large cache of spectrum he has accumulated, including satellite spectrum which regulators have agreed Dish can repurpose for terrestrial mobile communications.It would also scuttle the $20.1bn deal agreed in October in which SoftBank, Masayoshi Son’s Japanese wireless operator, would take control of Sprint. Success for that deal would leave Dish dependent on satellite video and running out of options to use the spectrum it has amassed.SoftBank’s deal is moving towards approval from US regulators keen to foster competition to Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility, which together control more than 70 per cent of the US smartphone market.“We believe that Dish is more strategically desperate for Sprint than is SoftBank; however, SoftBank certainly has deeper pockets,” analysts at Stifel wrote on Monday. Concern at the creation of a duopoly was central to why US regulators opposed AT&T’s $39bn bid for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA in 2011. That deal’s failure added impetus to the reshaping of the US mobile landscape driven by change in technology, shortage of spectrum and need for scale. This gave Mr Ergen his opportunity.When the AT&T deal collapsed, a revitalised T-Mobile USA – flush with funds and spectrum that AT&T handed over in a break clause – agreed to acquire rival MetroPCS. A shareholder vote on that deal is due later this month.As part of its agreement to acquire a 70 per cent stake in Sprint, SoftBank has bolstered Sprint’s balance sheet through a convertible bond issue. This gave Sprint the flexibility it needed to bid for the 49 per cent stake it did not already own in Clearwire, the wireless broadband provider.Dish’s satellite video business is in decline and lacks the growing broadband revenue its cable rivals enjoy. Buying Sprint would let it match their offerings. “Satellite’s position in the pay TV industry is challenged,” noted Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Mr Ergen believes a combination of Sprint and Dish – which offers TV to handheld devices by its Slingbox technology – would have a vital advantage.“Everybody I know in the US wants to have in the house a voice product, a broadband product and a video product,” Mr Ergen told the Financial Times, “and they want the exact same product outside the house . . . in an integrated manner and they want that in one bill they understand and they want to tie all their devices together.”Mr Ergen admitted he talked “with everybody” in the industry before settling on a bid for Sprint. Those talks picked up momentum in January after the FCC approved Dish repurposing its spectrum.Dish’s options included selling its spectrum – valued by Mr Ergen at $8bn to $10bn, but much lower by analysts; building its own LTE network – a hugely costly proposition; or finding a partner to help build the network.Dish talked to Sprint and T-Mobile about partnerships or spectrum sharing and bid for spectrum owned by Clearwire – an offer that the target’s board rejected.Mr Ergen argues his bid for Sprint is not only financially superior to SoftBank’s terms, but has other advantages as well. Asked about his estimate of $37bn synergies and growth opportunities from the deal, he said short-term growth would come from a triple-play bundle “with a price incentive” but long term it would be positioned for growth as video, broadband and mobile converge.Some analysts agreed: “The benefits SoftBank would bring to Sprint are scale in the wireless industry,” said Charles Golvin of Forrester Research: “On the other hand, Dish would make Sprint a much more firm competitor to Verizon and AT&T not just in wireless, but in broadband and TV as well. They would be a true national competitor.”Shareholders may favour Dish, Mr Golvin added.The prospect of stronger competition could be important for regulators. “We believe this is not going to raise any regulatory hurdles,” Mr Ergen said. “For the justice department, I don’t think anybody would say this is concentration. And it’s very clear the FCC is going to great lengths to strengthen competition to Verizon and AT&T to help Sprint and T-Mobile.”"
74;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-04-15T18:42:18Z;Blackjack player makes big telecoms bet;;Charlie Ergen made waves from Wall Street to Tokyo on Monday when the reclusive billionaire from Colorado injected himself into the dealmaking that is reshaping the US telecoms industry.Offering $25.5bn for Sprint Nextel in a bid that trumps an agreed deal by SoftBank is classic Mr Ergen – brash, unpredictable and ambitious. A former professional blackjack player, he made his name and his fortune by making big bets.In the early 1980s, before most US consumers had cable television, Mr Ergen and a friend founded EchoStar Communications, a satellite services provider. He used EchoStar to launch Dish Network, a satellite television service, in 1996.Dish has grown into one of the largest pay-TV providers in the US, alongside Comcast and DirecTV. Mr Ergen spun off EchoStar’s set-top box unit in 2008. He is now the 37th richest man in the US, according to Forbes, worth an estimated $10.6bn.But with demand for satellite television services looking set to decline, Mr Ergen is attempting to reinvent his business once more. In recent years he amassed wireless spectrum, and is now seeking to put it to use by creating a company that would rival wireless providers such as Verizon and AT&T, and cable operators such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable.“Ergen has always seen around corners,” said one adviser who knows him well.The 60-year-old calls himself a “country boy from Tennessee”, and is known for being austere, travelling cheaply and eschewing the luxurious trappings most billionaires enjoy. His father was a nuclear physicist from Austria who came to the US before the second world war, worked on the Manhattan project, and coined the term “China Syndrome” to describe a nuclear meltdown.
75;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-02-20T17:34:02Z;New screens require new TV strategy;There is encouraging news for content owners in data on internet video use;When the season finale of Downton Abbey aired on PBS last Sunday, some of the 8.2m US viewers could be forgiven for feeling let down. Not only because a favourite character was killed off, but because many of them knew that fact on Christmas day, when British viewers saw the episode and tweeted their reaction or shared it on peer-to-peer torrent sites.Julian Fellowes, Downton’s creator, expressed his frustration in a New York Times interview.“The thinking behind different screenings belongs to a different era,” he said. Fellowes knows a thing or two about different eras. Content “windowing” strategies may not make great costume drama any time soon, but such venerable media customs are looking as threatened by change as his characters.American fans are relatively lucky. “Australia gets everything last,” notes Sean Knapp, chief technology officer of Ooyala, the online video platform, so the temptation to seek out shows on peer-to-peer torrent sites is higher. As Charlie Ergen, chairman of Dish Network, said last week: “People will steal it if you don’t make it easy.”Indeed Game of Thrones, last year’s most pirated programme, was downloaded particularly often in Australia, according to TorrentFreak, which tracks filesharing sites. Telstra, the Australian broadband provider, is now testing “throttling” of peer-to-peer traffic on its network.Traditional media companies, once again, have reason to feel nervous but in truth there is encouraging news for content owners in the latest data on rapidly growing internet video consumption.For a start, a market once defined by YouTube’s user-generated clips is starting to look more like TV. Ooyala sees long-form programming – TV shows and films – growing much faster than short videos.Hardware has played a role: it is easier to watch a half-hour show on a tablet, connected TV or games console plugged into the living room screen. Debates about whether Sony is right to bring out a fourth-generation PlayStation as gaming moves online often ignore such devices’ importance for accessing video content.Investments in original programming from digital distributors such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have also helped, and the Olympics proved there is an appetite for watching lengthy live events online.There is even a migration back to a form of linear viewing, in which you finish watching one video and a recommendation engine serves up the next, tempting you to stay glued to your screen, whatever size it may be.Russian meteor sightings are a reminder of the huge and growing audience for short clips, but the shift is clear. “We’re seeing the form of content change back towards TV, but with a very different engagement model,” Mr Knapp says.Content owners increasingly see a revenue model too. Informa predicts that the global online video market will be worth $37bn by 2017, and Morgan Stanley estimates Time Warner, News Corp, CBS and Viacom will each earn $200m-$350m from online video this year.YouTube is exploring cable-style subscriptions for some of its channels, which feature increasingly professional content from production companies such as Fullscreen, Machinima and Maker Studios. Its ad revenues are also becoming substantial, rising two-thirds to $1.3bn last year, according to Pivotal Research.“Bringing TV dollars to digital”, as ComScore put it last week, sounds threatening to people who depend on TV dollars, pounds or euros. But as online video ad rates improve, they can still collect that money if they make their content available at the right price online.The most sensible way to do so while protecting traditional revenues still looks like the “TV Everywhere” model of providing content to pay-TV subscribers on any device. Also making it available to non-subscribers willing to pay for it would be more sensible still.TV has immense staying power and will coexist with digital video for years, but if fans are going to illegal sites for episodes they cannot find legally, content owners are needlessly missing out on potential download, subscription and ad revenue.They are also annoying their customers. As James McQuivey of Forrester Research puts it in his book, Digital Disruption, “what has changed is consumers’ ability to get what they want. This has led them to expect that their needs and wants can and should be met”.When consumer expectations change, companies had better change with them. Downton’s inhabitants learnt to live with the telephone. Media’s aristocrats can do the same with the disruptive technology of their era.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times’ media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
76;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-01-30T19:12:26Z;Shelves need not be stacked against media;Technology offers the ability to understand consumers;"In 1949, the publisher of Life wrote that the 21 newsstands in Grand Central station each sold a large enough pile of his magazines every week to reach the stars on its 125-foot high ceiling. “Newsdealers get quite a workout keeping the fast-melting stacks refilled,” he bragged. Today, Grand Central’s few news outlets are among its quieter corners, selling as many snacks as magazines to commuters absorbed in their iPods, Kindles and Android smartphones.You cannot find a boastful publisher of Life any more. It ended its run as a weekly title in 1972, as a monthly in 2000, as a newspaper supplement in 2007 and as a branded online venture with Getty Images in 2012. Its owner, Time Inc, is planning about 500 lay-offs at the magazines that outlived Life.All magazine, newspaper and book publishers, music companies, movie studios and video games developers now face similarly jarring changes to the retail channels they once counted on.In stations, shopping malls and high streets in developed markets, media and entertainment retailers are disappearing. Barnes & Noble, the US book chain, this week said it could close 30 per cent of its stores in the next decade; HMV, the UK music retailer, fell into administration this month and will emerge with fewer outlets even if it is rescued; Dish Network is closing 300 US Blockbuster video rental stores and the brand’s UK arm is in administration.Cuts by these retailers will hit the media companies that supply them, who seem caught in a vicious circle where falling sales of their physical products contribute to store closures, making those products ever harder to find. It should hardly come as a shock to any media owner that more pain now looks inevitable in traditional retail channels, even if the pace of decline may be faster than many hoped. Retail upheaval has been common since vinyl stores and independent booksellers gave way to Tower Records and Borders, which gave way to a few shelves at Walmart or Tesco. It is 17 years since Jeff Bezos sold the first book on Amazon.com.Physical media has been looking for years like a legacy business to be managed as its producers turn to digital outlets for growth. Even Amazon, a prime disrupter, is experiencing the transition, Mr Bezos said on Tuesday. After five years, Kindle ebooks have become “a multibillion-dollar category” that grew about 70 per cent last year; in contrast, print book sales grew just 5 per cent, the lowest rate in 17 years.Mr Bezos can now boast that his digital media store features 23m movies, TV shows, songs, magazines and books. Grand Central could not stock them all, and commuters would not buy them if it did. It is pointless to pretend otherwise.Online stores do not yet help customers to browse freely as they did in stores. But they pose bigger risks to media owners. Control of distribution was central to their power and profits. Now, power is shifting to digital outlets with the scale to squeeze margins.These outlets increasingly do not mind whether customers buy media, rent it or subscribe to it at lower returns than the download model that has defined digital stores since iTunes launched in 2003.Newsstands will be with us for years to come, and some high street entrepreneur will work out how to make entertainment retail more entertaining. Some content companies with strong brands are finding direct digital routes to consumers with no need for a retail middleman. But with consumers’ attention and spending moving to tablets, smartphones and connected TVs, media owners need to move on and devote more thought to the retailers – and consumers – of the digital era.Until now, media companies have built large infrastructures to serve the “newsdealers” refilling magazine stacks or the Barnes & Noble staff refilling bookshelves. Few have dedicated as much effort to working out how best to serve the iTunes, Kindle or Android stores’ customers. If they hope to improve the discovery of digital content, and their profits from it, they will need deeper partnerships with the new distributors.Grand Central, Barnes & Noble and HMV are also reminders that consumers’ media habits change fast. Media companies have rarely been as fast in predicting such changes.Publishers and record labels knew little about the person casually picking up a magazine at a newsstand or even the most ardent music fan leafing through racks of vinyl. Digital retailers do not share all their data but they offer one powerful advantage over what went before – the ability to understand consumers in far more detail. Media owners need to seize it.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness"

The gains, which put the benchmark at its highest level since December 2007, came as the fourth-quarter earnings season moved into full force.Google, the online search and advertising company, was set to open higher today after it reported earnings of $10.65 per share, 13 cents better than analysts’ forecast following the market’s close.Shares climbed 3.9 per cent to $730.24 in after-market trade. Google had lost 0.2 per cent to $702.87.IBM, also reporting results after the close, gained 2.5 per cent to $201 after finishing the day’s session 0.8 per cent higher at $196.08.DuPont shares rose 1.8 per cent to $47.82 even as the US’s largest chemical group reported that its earnings per share dipped 58 per cent in the fourth quarter.Johnson & Johnson fell 0.7 per cent to $72.69 as the US healthcare company said demand for its drugs and medical devices helped net profits rise. The gains came as the company faced mounting legal costs related to faulty products in the quarter.Verizon Communications, the US telecoms group, said profit margins shrunk in the fourth quarter due to costs associated with its sale of smartphones.However, Verizon shares climbed 0.9 per cent to $42.94 as it targeted cost savings of $2bn at its wireless unit for 2013, and said it might offer share buybacks “if the opportunity presented itself”.Elsewhere, TD Ameritrade Holding gained 3.1 per cent to $19.03 as the brokerage and financial services company said fourth-quarter sales beat analysts’ expectations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 0.5 per cent higher to 13,712.13.Shares in Caterpillar ended 0.1 per cent higher at $97.72 after the earthmoving equipment maker said late last week it would take a $580m charge for accounting misconduct at a Chinese company it acquired last year.Boeing lost 1.2 per cent to $74.16 as the aircraft manufacturer continued to face the fallout from a series of incidents with its Dreamliner 787 aircraft.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.3 per cent to 3,143.18 as shares in the tech benchmark’s largest constituent, Apple, rose. The iPhone maker, which is due to report its quarterly results today, gained 1 per cent to $504.77. Its shares are 28.1 per cent below their September peak and its market valuation has fallen to $474bn.“The smartphone market is showing initial signs of maturation in developed countries, and Apple’s position as a high-end product and margin leader is going to limit volumes as the market shifts to emerging countries,” said Colin Gillis, analyst at BGC Partners.“We do not see Apple getting to a trillion-dollar valuation with its current product line-up or with the addition of a product such as a television,” he added.Dish Network fell 1.1 per cent to $37.50 as the satellite television provider said it would close 300 Blockbuster movie rental stores in the coming weeks.Delta Air Lines rose 2.9 per cent to $14.01 even as the world’s biggest airline by revenues said fourth-quarter net income fell to $7m from $25m.Analysts at S&P Capital IQ said the S&P 500 rose a cumulative 57.9 per cent in price during President Barack Obama’s first term, placing him fifth among US presidents since 1900.
78;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-01-16T23:19:48Z;Dish Network handed opportunity on a plate;Enough spectrum to make noise in wireless, with the right partner;It is axiomatic that strong businesses can increase revenues faster than costs. Satellite TV provider Dish Network can’t. Yet its shares are up a third over the past year, and it trades at a premium to its larger, more profitable peer, DirectTV. What gives? Well, it has achieved what many structurally-challenged businesses aim for: a move into another industry. Or, more accurately, Dish has – with a little foresight and luck – created the impression that it is about to be in another industry.Pay TV in the US is growing its subscriber base very slowly, if at all. Dish’s subscriber count has been stuck at 14m for several years. The company has also struggled to increase prices. So revenues have been flat while the costs of programming have increased steadily. The resulting margin degradation has become acute in the last year. Dish has tried to combat this with well-designed set-top boxes that store big chunks of programming for replay without commercials (the television studios are not fans).The foresight came when the company bought, first, some traditional wireless spectrum in 2008 for $700m and then two chunks of satellite spectrum from bankrupted networks in 2011, for $2.9bn.The good fortune came last month when US regulators ruled that the satellite spectrum could be used for terrestrial broadband services. Suddenly, Dish has enough spectrum to make some noise in wireless, with the right partner.JPMorgan has estimated that, given the authorities’ blessings, the spectrum holdings could be worth $5bn (Dish’s total enterprise value is about $20bn). But the hyper-competitive US wireless industry, while it contains pockets of high profitability, will crush a half-baked new entrant. Investors paying up for Dish should keep another axiom in mind: business transitions never go quite as planned.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
79;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2013-01-14T17:24:04Z;Dish spoils Sprint’s Clearwire plans;;When SoftBank made its bold $20bn bid for 70 per cent of Sprint Nextel in October, all eyes were on Masayoshi Son, the Japanese entrepreneur who was poised to shake up the US mobile phone market.Mr Son, a brash executive who built SoftBank into a massive commercial empire, making himself a billionaire in the process, was audaciously challenging AT&T and Verizon Wireless, market leaders widely seen as holding a near-duopolistic grip on the US market.But with last week’s news that Dish Network had jumped Sprint’s $2.2bn deal to buy the 50 per cent of wireless provider Clearwire it does not own, Mr Son now finds himself squaring off with an equally brazen billionaire, whose motives are not entirely clear.Charlie Ergen, chairman of Dish, made himself a fortune by building a satellite television business. In recent years, however, he has been accumulating spectrum in anticipation of a boom in wireless data volumes. In Clearwire, he sees at the very least the opportunity to acquire valuable spectrum on the cheap, and perhaps also an opportunity to enter entirely new lines of business.Sprint, and by proxy SoftBank, also wants Clearwire, but for more transparent reasons. Taking full control of the spectrum-rich wireless operator would give Sprint added muscle it needs to roll out the robust network it needs to better compete with Verizon and AT&T, and also T-Mobile, which is planning to merge with MetroPCS.Dish’s offer involves two steps. In the first, it has proposed to buy a swath of Clearwire spectrum for $2.2bn. In the second, it is offering to buy Clearwire shares for $3.30 a share, an 11 per cent premium over Sprint’s offer. That sounds good to Clearwire shareholders, many of whom think the Sprint offer is far too low and could still try and block the deal. Mr Ergen has also offered to finance upcoming debt payments that Clearwire needs to make in an effort to sweeten his bid and sideline Sprint.“Sprint already faced an uncertain outcome on obtaining shareholder approval for the Clearwire transaction but the latest move by Charlie Ergen has created yet another obstacle,” said Walter Piecyk, analyst at BTIG, in a note late last week.But people close to the situation say Mr Ergen has over-reached, proposing a series of governance changes and commercial agreements that Clearwire cannot currently accept. Sprint, which already owns 51 per cent of Clearwire, called the Dish bid “illusory” and said it would oppose any deal. Nonetheless, Clearwire said it had a fiduciary responsibility to consider the Dish bid.Any number of outcomes could still result. Sprint could still acquire all of Clearwire, while begrudgingly allowing a sale of spectrum to Dish. Sprint could block Dish by raising its offer price or by suing to block the deal.Or Dish could even wind up striking commercial partnerships with Sprint. Though the two companies have had a contentious relationship in the past, Sprint’s new majority owner might play a role here. “SoftBank might be better served by having [Mr] Son reach out to Ergen directly to forge a broader relationship,” said Mr Piecyk.Dan Hesse, Sprint’s chief executive, has said he always envisaged reintegrating Clearwire’s spectrum into the Sprint portfolio and that he is confident the deal will win regulatory approval and close in the first half of this year. The Dish bid has not changed this expectation.Rather, analysts and industry insiders view the Dish offer as either a “spoiler” that could delay the Sprint-Clearwire deal, or as a negotiating tactic that could give Dish more leverage going forward. Either way, SoftBank’s Mr Son now has an unpredictable new personality to contend with in his bid to cement a place in the US.The big unanswered question, however, is what Mr Ergen plans to do with his growing trove of spectrum. Here too, there are myriad possibilities. Mr Ergen is reclusive and rarely telegraphs his true intentions.Yet he knows that satellite television subscriptions are no longer growing, and is likely working to build a more holistic offering that includes wireless internet and possibly phone service. It is entirely plausible that Mr Ergen is vying to build his own LTE network to rival those of Verizon, AT&T and Sprint.However as one telecoms executive attending last week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas noted, “it’s a strange way to go about it”.
80;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Dish outbids Sprint in Clearwire race;;Dish Network has topped Sprint’s bid to take full control of wireless provider Clearwire, intensifying the fight for position in the US telecoms sector.Dish, the satellite television provider, on Tuesday made an unsolicited offer to acquire spectrum assets and all of the company’s common stock.Dish is offering $2.2bn for a large amount of spectrum, and $3.30 a share for Clearwire stock, an 11 per cent premium to Sprint’s offer.But the Dish bid faces hurdles, as Sprint, the fourth-largest US mobile phone operator, has gradually moved to take control of Clearwire in recent months.Sprint immediately fought back against Dish’s bid, saying it had “no intention” of waiving any of its rights as Clearwire’s largest shareholder and biggest customer.Gaining full control of Clearwire is part of a move by Sprint to become a more formidable rival to Verizon Wireless and AT&T. In October SoftBank, the Japanese telecoms company, agreed to buy 70 per cent of Sprint for about $20bn.In December, Sprint agreed to acquire the 50 per cent of Clearwire it does not already own for $2.97 per share. As part of that deal and other agreements between the two companies, Sprint in many ways controls the fate of Clearwire.In a statement announcing the Dish bid, Clearwire said the new offer was “subject to numerous material uncertainties and conditions, including the negotiation of multiple contractual arrangements being requested by Dish”.Given the premium that Dish is offering, Clearwire said its special committee had determined it had a fiduciary duty to engage in discussions.However, Clearwire said Dish had previously approached the company about a similar deal, and that its special committee had worked with it to improve those terms before signing the existing Sprint deal.Clearwire said it had received a letter from Sprint saying the Dish offer was “illusory” and “inferior” and could not be executed because of contractual and legal obligations.Nonetheless, Dish’s bid will be welcomed by some Clearwire shareholders, who felt that the company was being sold to Sprint for too little.“We look forward to working with Clearwire’s special committee as it evaluates our proposal,” said Tom Cullen, Dish executive vice-president of corporate development.Sprint said it believed its agreement to acquire Clearwire “offers Clearwire shareholders certain and attractive value” and was “superior to the highly conditional Dish proposal”.“Sprint does not intend to waive any of its rights and looks forward to closing the transaction with Clearwire,” it said.Clearwire is being advised by Evercore Partners. Its special committee is being advised by Centerview Partners.
81;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-12-30T17:10:05Z;US telecoms – softly ticking;Competitive pressure has not really hit the big boys yet – but it will;AT&T and Verizon investors are a calm bunch. The two companies’ shares have underperformed the market by 9 per cent and 5 per cent respectively since October but have performed in line with the market for 2012 and have outperformed over two years. The shares trade at a slight premium to the market. Yet these pseudo-duopolists, which sit atop the US wireless telecoms market, are facing a radically different competitive environment than they did a year ago. SoftBank’s purchase of Sprint and the latter’s subsequent acquisition of Clearwire create a better-funded number three with the spectrum to launch low-priced wireless data products.Nor is Sprint the only problem: the T-Mobile/MetroPCS merger (if it is not interrupted by a counterbid) creates a fourth player just strong enough to grasp for market share, adding to the price pressure Sprint is all but certain to create. Meanwhile, Dish Network has a nice chunk of wireless spectrum it could add to one of the smaller competitors’ war chests. The next few years are going to be fun to watch – from a distance.Owners of AT&T and Verizon shares may be complacent because of high dividend yields (both about 5 per cent) and because operating performance at both companies has held up. A couple of percentage points of subscriber growth and a couple more of revenue per subscriber growth (thanks to data sales), helped by a little operating leverage, keep wireless operating earnings ticking up slowly – sometimes even enough to offset declining landline profits.Mergers and network upgrades take a while. So the big boys have months or even years before the pressure really hits. But hit it will. AT&T’s announcement in November that it would ramp up its capital spending can only be interpreted as an acknowledgment of this. The time to worry is now.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
82;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-12-13T00:00:48Z;Dish Network wins approval on spectrum;;US regulators approved Dish Network’s plans to use repurposed satellite spectrum to roll out a new terrestrial mobile broadband service while taking steps to protect the value of an adjacent band of spectrum known as the H Block, which is expected to be auctioned next year.Both actions are expected to facilitate the further rollout of next generation mobile data networks based on LTE technology at a time when mobile data use in the US is soaring.The Federal Communications Commission approved Dish’s plan for the AWS-4 spectrum unanimously, but will require Dish to take extra precautions to ensure that its services do not interfere with transmissions in the H block, thereby protecting the potential value of that spectrum.“We accomplished this by removing regulatory barriers that limited this spectrum to satellite use,” the FCC said in a statement. “Carefully balanced technical requirements will unlock tremendous value in both the AWS-4 band and the 10MHz H Block, which Congress directed us to auction.”Dish, which first applied for the change of spectrum use a year ago, has plans to build an LTE Advanced network by 2016 using the 40MHz spectrum. The company purchased the satellite spectrum from DBSD North America and Terrestar Networks earlier this year.Dish welcomed the FCC’s decision which it said “removed outdated regulations and granted terrestrial flexibility for most of the AWS-4 band”.“The Commission has taken an important step toward facilitating wireless competition and innovation, and fulfilling the goals of the National Broadband Plan,” said Jeff Blum, Dish’s senior vice-president and deputy general counsel.Among its options, some analysts have suggested Dish could now seek a partner to help fund the LTE network deployment, or perhaps sell or lease the spectrum to an existing telecommunications operator.While the FCC’s decision to approve the changed use of the AWS-4 spectrum is an important win for Dish, the decision to impose restrictions on the use of the spectrum closest to the H Block in order to avoid potential interference issues also represents a victory for Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator.Sprint Nextel is expected to be one of the bidders in the H Block spectrum auction and has also been mentioned as a potential partner for Dish. While indicating that it supported Dish’s plans, Sprint Nextel had said repeatedly that the value of the H block spectrum would be significantly reduced if it were subject to interference.Congress mandated that the FCC auction the adjacent H Block of spectrum by February 2015 as part of its plan to release more spectrum for mobile data use and raise additional funds for the Treasury. However, the FCC has indicated that it hopes to complete the auction in 2013.
83;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-11-21T22:52:26Z;Dish wins spectrum approval;;Dish Network, the US satellite TV operator, has moved an important step closer to winning regulatory approval for its plan to use spare wireless spectrum to launch mobile broadband services.However, the plan is only likely to be approved with restrictions that Dish claims could hinder its plans to spend billions of dollars building a new nationwide telecoms network based on LTE technology.Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has circulated proposals to his fellow commissioners that would allow Dish to use its “AWS-4” satellite spectrum for broad terrestrial purposes, but with certain power emission limits to protect the adjacent “H” block of spectrum that the FCC plans to auction next year.“Chairman Genachowski shared proposals with his colleagues that will unleash up to 50MHz of spectrum for mobile broadband, including LTE,” said an FCC spokesman.The proposal is likely to be voted on by the commissioners before the end of the year, clearing the way for Dish to launch LTE services in direct competition with rivals including the four largest US mobile operators: Verizon Wireless, AT&T Mobility, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA.“If approved, these actions will promote competition, investment and innovation, and advance commission efforts to unleash spectrum for mobile broadband to help meet skyrocketing consumer demand, while unlocking billions of dollars of value to the public,” the FCC said.“We believe the (FCC chairman’s) proposal is in line with our expectations, and we continue to believe it would give Dish a strategic victory – opening the door to entering mobile broadband or at least monetising increased spectrum value – but a tactical defeat versus Sprint, which wants to win the H block at auction and use it for high-power wireless service,” said Christopher King of Stifel Nicolaus Telecom Equity Research.Dish has lobbied hard for its proposals, but in response to the FCC chairman’s move cautioned that the restrictions over the transmission power could jeopardise its plans. “While the FCC would grant full terrestrial rights, its proposal to lower our power and emissions levels could cripple our ability to enter the business,” the company said.In proposing the power restrictions, the FCC chairman is clearly eager to avoid a rerun of the controversy over similar proposals tabled by LightSquared, the wireless broadband start-up backed by Philip Falcone. LightSquared was forced to abandon its plans to launch a nationwide LTE network because of concerns over possible interference with navigation and other equipmentDish has made little secret of its ambitions to enter the US mobile telecommunications market, despite fierce competition. Last week, MetroPCS, the pre-paid mobile market leader, which is being acquired by Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit, revealed in a regulatory filing that it had earlier held talks with a number of potential bidders including Dish.Separately, the FCC announced on Wednesday that it would hold hearings over the next few months to consider measures that could help avoid the loss of telecommunications services during and after disasters such as the recent superstorm Sandy.In the immediate wake of Sandy, mobile network operators reported that up to 25 per cent of the cell towers in the hardest hit part of America’s East coast were knocked out of service, mostly when they lost power.
84;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-10-30T05:46:42Z;Slingbox 500′s HD step-up, easier setup;;When Dish Network bought Sling Media five years ago, I feared the worst for Slingbox, a remote TV viewing device on which I had come to depend.I saw the technology being incorporated into the satellite TV service’s DVRs, which has happened to some extent, while the standalone boxes would slowly be allowed to fade away.The signs have not been good in recent years, with no new consumer hardware since the Pro HD in 2008 and I’ve found little improvement in the video streaming software, with services such as HBOGo, WatchESPN and the BBC iPlayer offering me better quality video of late than my Slingbox’s relaying of my TV source at home.But finally, we have two new Slingboxes and updated software that have significantly improved the viewing experience for me.I have been testing the top-end Slingbox 500 (available now in the US for $300, launching in Canada in November, no UK dates as yet), which improves in several respects on previous models.First, a refresher on what the Slingbox does. This distinctive-looking set-top box – the 500 rethinks the unique design in curvy black plastic – connects via HDMI, component or composite cables to a video source like a satellite receiver or cable box. It also connects to your home network through your router and makes itself available over the internet for remote access.So I use the Slingbox to watch my living-room satellite box in the bedroom on my laptop and can even put it on my bedroom TV using another set-top box device called a Slingcatcher. I also access my satellite box remotely in the US and abroad, using Slingplayer software that works in a web browser, on Facebook and with apps, including for the iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Android and Windows Phone.The apps allow you to control the video source, changing channels, operating a DVR etc, with on-screen approximations of my real-world remote.Setting up a Slingbox properly is usually straightforward, but there can be problems – lately I have been unable to get my Solo model to connect to the internet through a new router.The 500 has a much easier setup process. Instead of connecting the device and then going to a computer on the same network to set it up. There is now an on-screen setup on the TV to which the box is linked, as there are now pass-through connections – HDMI and Component in and out ports that put the 500 between the satellite box and the TV.A remote is also included to aid the setup process.Another aid is built-in Wi-Fi. Until now, you had to use a wired ethernet connection to connect to your router and I used powerline networking devices to bridge the gap, with the TV some way from my router.There is still an ethernet port on the 500, but I found the Wi-Fi more than adequate for a good picture. The set-up process also configured my router for internet access beyond the home in the background. There was a separate manual process for this previously, which involved reconfiguring the router and did not always work.Finally, I found no need to position a cable with infra-red transmitters in front of the satellite box in order to be able to change channels remotely through the 500 – it has built-in transmitters that bounced the commands around the room well enough to control the box.Updating my Slingbox apps and connecting to the box with them for the first time, I was impressed with the picture improvement – there was no buffering, stuttering or dropped frames and the picture was HD sharp compared to the fuzziness I often experienced in the past.On the downside, I did notice it could be something of an all or nothing experience – if the broadband speeds slowed significantly, I would get a blank screen rather than a dramatic degradation of the picture I experienced before. Controlling my satellite box could also be subject to longer pauses than before.I found my PC client software no longer works with the 500 – I have to access it through a web browser on a PC or Mac, although this seemed to have nearly all of the PC software’s features, particularly the Windows version.My Slingcatcher will not work with the 500 either, but it should still be possible to project the feed onto another TV using Apple’s Airplay linking an Apple TV with my iPad or iPhone app or through my MacBook. The Slingbox’s stream can also be viewed on TV via a Boxee box, Western Digital’s media players and over a Google TV system like the Logitech Revue.Something beyond Sling Media’s control is the HDCP content protection system, which means the HDMI connection will not show all the channels on my satellite box – ones such as HBO are blocked and required me to attach the component cables as well, in order to get round this.I have not tried the second model released – the $180 Slingbox 350. This has no Wi-Fi, no HDMI connections, no remote – so no on-screen TV setup, and it lacks a feature – Slingprojector – that allows you to show photos from your mobile phone on your TV.In summary, the 500 and the 350 are very welcome updates to Slingbox hardware, with the 500 simplifying the set-up process dramatically. Software improvements have given me HD quality streams at high frame rates without stuttering within a home network, but a steady and speedy broadband connection was needed to achieve this over the internet.
85;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
86;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-09-24T22:22:14Z;Verizon in $510m video settlements;;Verizon Communications, the US telecommunications group, has agreed to pay TiVo and ActiveVideo Networks at least $510.4m to settle all patent infrigment litigation between the companies.TiVo had filed suit against Verizon in 2009, alleging the infringement of three of its patents related to digital recording and replay of television programmes while ActiveVideo sued Verizon in 2010 alleging the infringement of four of its patents related to video-on-demand, interactive TV and other services offered by Verizon.Tivo’s case was due to come to court in Texas next week while ActiveVideo won a jury verdict in August 2011 which was later upheld on appeal on three of the four patents and was awarded $260m.Under the terms of the two agreements Tivo will receive at least $250.4m from Verizon while ActiveVideo will receive the $260m it had previously been awarded plus, “an additional unspecified amount of money.”Jeff Miller, ActiveVideo’s chief executive said: “While the terms of the agreement are confidential, we can confirm that the parties agreed to cross-license their patents, agreed not to sue each other for a period of years, and Verizon agreed to pay the $260m previously ordered by the district court and an additional unspecified amount of money. In the end our technology and its value have been recognised.”As part of the settlements, Verizon has also signed a licensing deal with Tivo. News of the settlement sent shares in TiVo up 38 cents, or almost 4 per cent, to close at $9.94 in trading in New York. ActiveVideo, known for its CloudTV technology which is used by Cablevision and other cable TV network operators, is not listed.TiVo’s agreement with Verizon is the latest in a series of patent settlements for a company which has struggled to make a profit despite pioneering the “time-shifting” technology used in most digital video recorders.TiVo has posted an annual loss in eight of the past 10 years but has begun to refocus its business on technology licensing deals and is exploring ways to generate revenue from the data its set-top boxes collect on TV viewing habits and the impact of advertising.Under the terms of the TiVo deal, disclosed in a regulatory filing, Verizon has agreed to pay TiVo an initial cash payment of $100m later this month, followed by 25 recurring quarterly payments totalling $150.4m.The agreement also includes a cross-licence provision for each company’s “advanced television patents”, under which Verizon will pay higher monthly licence fees if the growth of the company’s fibre optic digital video (FiOS DVR) subscriber base tops certain predetermined levels.TiVo reached a similar deal in January with AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, under which AT&T agreed to pay TiVo at least $215m. Last year it settled a three-year lawsuit with Dish Network, the US satellite TV company, and EchoStar, for $500m. Lawsuits are still pending against Motorola, Time Warner Cable and Cisco.
87;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-03-07T21:02:50Z;Media delivery: stream becomes torrent;The leviathans in streaming media face a challenge from a shoal of minnows;Three’s a crowd. And there are lots more than three. Apple was first to the idea that delivering media over the internet might be good way to sell something else – in its case, gadgets. Years after the iTunes store made the iPod indispensable, other companies are still intent on turning a similar trick. Google thinks buying or streaming media will sell ads. This week it rebranded the Android store, to be known as Google Play, with greater emphasis on music, movies and books. Meanwhile, Amazon thinks that doing this will help it dominate all internet retail.But these leviathans will not be able to split the business between them. In music, there is Pandora Media and Spotify to contend with, among others. Video is tougher still. Netflix has 24m US subscribers, Hulu is popular, and Walmart is taking a stab with Vudu. Nor are the pay TV players standing idly by: Comcast, Verizon and Dish are all offering new streaming services. Results from the publicly traded streaming companies do not make the business look terribly appealing in its own right. Netflix boosted its revenues by close to 50 per cent last quarter, but its content costs are growing faster still and its expansion plans are expected to produce a bottom line loss in 2012. Pandora announced on Tuesday that, surprisingly, it will also make no profits in the upcoming year, despite doubling listener hours in 2011, and the stock then lost nearly a quarter of its value.The big internet companies must, in this crowded field, use their media services to distinguish and support their core businesses. It will not be easy. Superior selection makes a difference, as do lower prices. But both of these can be matched by a competitor willing to spend money.

88;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-03-06T19:59:02Z;Verizon under pressure to reveal deal details;;Opponents are ratcheting up pressure on Verizon Wireless and a group of large US cable TV companies to disclose details of their agreement to sell spectrum worth $4bn to the telecoms operator and cross-market each others’ services.The opponents, which include Sprint Nextel, Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit and DirectTV and the Rural Telecommunications Group on Tuesday asked the Federal Communications Commission to “stop the clock” on the informal 180-day review process until Verizon and its cable TV partners provide access to full details of their cross-marketing arrangements, claiming them to be anticompetitive.Verizon and the cable companies deny this. At the FCC’s request last week, they made public some documentation about their commercial arrangements, but redacted information that they described as commercially sensitive.“Those redactions, which the applicants describe as ‘related to pricing, compensation and marketing strategies’, make it impossible to understand the full ramifications of the documents or to evaluate their relationship to and effect upon the proposed transactions,” the opponents said in their letter to the FCC.Opposition to the proposed deals between Verizon and Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks and Cox Cable has grown since they were first announced in December.Like AT&T’s now abandoned $39bn bid for T-Mobile USA, the proposed Verizon transaction highlights the pressure US mobile operators are under to acquire new spectrum in order to accommodate the surge in mobile data usage triggered by smartphones like Apple’s iPhone and Android-based handsets. Verizon is seeking spectrum to roll out its 4G mobile broadband network based on LTE technology,The spectrum crunch has also driven other moves, including the acquisition of spectrum by Dish, the US satellite TV operator. Last week, it won FCC approval for its recent spectrum purchases, but was denied immediate approval of a waiver that it would have needed to use its purchase to build a terrestrial wireless broadband network and substantially increased the value of the airwaves.
89;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-02-06T18:04:06Z;Verizon and Coinstar to challenge Netflix;;Verizon and Coinstar, owner of the Redbox DVD rental service, are teaming up to take on Netflix.The companies announced a joint venture on Monday that was thin on details but telegraphed the companies’ ambition to compete in the booming market for subscription video services.Verizon is already a player in the video market with its growing FiOS pay television service. That gives the company, best known as the largest wireless provider in the US, critical relationships with the networks and studios it will need to secure content.Redbox operates a network of 35,000 DVD rental kiosks that offer new releases for $1 a night. Yet it has clashed with some film studios including Warner Brothers, which worry that the service undermines their home entertainment sales, which are declining rapidly.“Today’s announcement emphasises the development of digital ecosystems, integrating the consumer experience across all devices, as a key theme for 2012,” said Macquarie Capital analyst Kevin Smithen.Mr Smithen said the joint venture would help Verizon attract new subscribers and add scope to its business. It also helped put to rest speculation that Verizon might attempt to acquire Netflix.It will also give media companies yet another buyer for the digital rights to their content. In addition to Netflix, buyers now include Blockbuster, Amazon and Hulu.“Netflix, once seen as the bogeyman of traditional media owners, actually turned into everyone’s friend due to a steady stream of cashable cheques,” said Nomura analyst Michael Nathanson.The new company will see Verizon hold a 65 per cent stake, with Redbox holding 35 per cent worth $14m.“It’s about bringing two great brands together and being able to address what our consumers are looking for,” said Scott Di Valerio, chief financial officer of Coinstar.Though specifics were lacking, the outlines of the new service might include features such as unlimited streaming video and a set number of Redbox DVD rentals. Such an offering would mimic Netflix’s streaming and DVD delivery bundle, which starts at $16 a month.Blockbuster, now owed by Dish, also offers a similar service that includes streaming, delivery and in store rentals for $10 a month. Mr Smithen said the joint venture announcement helped to reaffirm the logic behind Dish’s acquisition of Blockbuster.Mr Di Valerio acknowledged that there were “a lot of different offerings in the marketplace” but said Verizon and Redbox would distinguish their service, which will be launched in the second half of the year.Explaining the lack of details, he said: “For competitive reasons you don’t want to be coming and providing the road map.”Netflix has been seen as more vulnerable since last year, in which a series of marketing gaffes caused the company to lose subscribers, and sent its share price plummeting. However, Netflix recovered some ground last week as it reported it was adding subscribers again.
90;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-01-31T01:54:47Z;AT&T names Stankey as chief strategy officer;;AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, has named senior executive John Stankey to the newly created position of group president and chief strategy officer. The move comes a month after the company abandoned a $39bn bid for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit and could signal possible asset sales.During the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call with investors last week, Randall Stephenson, chief executive, hinted that AT&T might sell off its directories business noting “that’s one area that we’re going to obviously take a very hard look at, and while I don’t want to give any indication on M&A activity, it’s one of these areas that we’re going to have to decide, do we keep it, do we restructure it, as we move forward.”In his new role, Mr Stankey, a 27-year industry veteran who was previously the president and chief executive of AT&T Business Solutions, will be responsible for “developing the road map to maximise future growth opportunities, including corporate development, addressing long-term wireless-capacity needs, capital allocation strategies and identifying the best strategic paths for low-growth and non-strategic assets”.His appointment is a further indication that AT&T is considering the sale of some of its older, slow growing assets including perhaps some of its fixed-line telephone operations or its directories business.Ray Wilkins, chief executive of AT&T Diversified Businesses, which includes the directories business, and Forrest Miller, group president for corporate strategy and development and one of the architects of the failed T-Mobile USA bid, recently announced plans to retire.AT&T also announced new roles for two other senior executives. Andy Geisse, a 32-year company veteran, was named senior executive vice-president in charge of AT&T Business and Home Solutions. He will be responsible for serving the business segment from global enterprise customers to small businesses and will oversee the company’s residential broadband and voice services.John Donovan will become senior executive vice-president in charge of AT&T Technology and Network Operations while Ralph de la Vega, will remain chief executive of AT&T Mobility.Separately, AT&T filed a request with the Federal Communications Commission that the agency should not include any restrictions on the transfer or leasing of spectrum that Dish Networkacquired through the bankruptcies of DBSD North America and TerreStar Networks.AT&T also requested the FCC to impose a strict timetable on Dish for using spectrum. The company said Dish should not be allowed to wait for new LTE technology specifications before it starts building its wireless broadband network. Some analysts suggest that AT&T may be seeking to improve its negotiating position with Dish should it seek a deal with the satellite TV group.
91;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-01-18T23:28:59Z;Cuban retunes his TV channel to music;;Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, has struck a deal with Anschutz Entertainment Group to rebrand his HDNet television channel as a live music and entertainment network.The deal will see Mr Cuban form a joint venture with AEG, Ryan Seacrest Media and Creative Artists Agency, relaunching HDNet as AXS TV. Mr Cuban told the Financial Times that the channel would do for live music and entertainment programming “what ESPN SportsCenter did for sports”.AEG is one of the biggest venue owners in the world, operating facilities such as the Staples Center in Los Angeles, as well as the 02 arena in London. Mr Cuban, who made his fortune when he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7bn in 1999, said the channel would broadcast live music coverage from venues across the US.AXS would “go beyond the concerts” with other live entertainment programming, such as behind-the-scenes interviews with top performers, he said.The channel will be available in 35m US homes, after Dish Network, the satellite provider, struck a deal to carry AXS, alongside other distributors, such as DirecTV, Comcast and Verizon.The deal gives AEG a stake in a new TV brand and a platform to boost its ticketing operation, which it recently launched in competition with Live Nation Entertainment. AEG opposed the 2010 merger of Live Nation and TicketMaster, which created the industry leader in concert ticket sales, and recently launched AXS.com, its own ticketing service, which has so far been limited to a couple of its US venues.The participation of Mr Seacrest and CAA should boost AXS’s celebrity credentials. CAA represents some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, while Mr Seacrest, the host of American Idol, has become a significant figure behind the camera as well as in front of it. His company produces reality shows such as Keeping up with the Kardashians. “Nobody has his paws on pop culture like Ryan,” said Mr Cuban.CAA said AXS would become a “new distribution opportunity for artists and content creators”.Mr Cuban will run the relaunched channel, which will retain a weekly show presented by Dan Rather, the former CBS news anchor. HDNet was aimed at young males but the rebranded channel will be targeted at a broader audience, Mr Cuban said. “We see this as an opportunity for anybody interested in pop culture.”AXS is one of Mr Cuban’s portfolio of business interests: since selling Broadcast.com he has acquired the Dallas Mavericks, which last year won the NBA Championship, bought the Landmark cinema chain, and launched a film production company.
92;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-01-10T17:00:04Z;Dish bids to stem subscriber decline;;Dish Networks has unveiled a suite of new products and refreshed branding as it attempts to stem a sharp decline in subscribers who have abandoned the satellite television provider due to superior offerings from competitor DirecTV and cable operators such as Comcast.Joe Clayton, chief executive of Dish, the US’s third-largest satellite provider with 14m subscribers, said he aimed to transform the company’s “cheap” image to that of a premium products provider.“We’re trying to change the image of the company,” said Mr Clayton ahead of the company’s presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show. “The weakness that our company has had over the last couple of years is in our communication to the public. In the past our image has been one about cheap, cheap, cheap. We’re more than that.”As part of these efforts, Dish has unveiled a high-definition digital video recording system that it says is among the most advanced in the industry. The Hopper system will be accompanied by smaller Joey boxes, using the Australian term for kangaroo, which will deliver Dish services to multiple televisions in a single home.Yet it will take more than savvy marketing and products to lure back customers, and analysts remain unconvinced. Dish lost 111,000 customers in the third quarter, and 134,000 in the quarter before that. But the company has managed to increase revenue per user, boosting third-quarter revenues to $3.6bn and net income to $319m, both up from the same time a year earlier.Benjamin Swinburne, analyst for Morgan Stanley, remains sceptical about Dish’s ability to win back customers as it faces stiff competition in the “increasingly difficult” US pay-television sector where “over time, we expect slow but steady [subscriber] declines”.Other Dish offerings designed to entice consumers include free SiriusXM radio stations through Dish devices, and expanded access to HBO content. But these features will be costly for Dish, and Mr Clayton warned they may be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher rates.“Like every other pay-TV provider, we’re concerned about the programming costs,” he said, pointing to NBC’s $4.83bn bid for the Olympics. “Who knows how much of that will be passed on. It will get to a point of diminishing returns.”Mr Swinburne pointed to Dish’s unused wireless spectrum as a valuable asset whose worth increased sharply after Verizon’s $3.6bn acquisition of the SpectrumCo assets last month. Mr Swinburne said Dish’s spectrum could be worth as much as $8.5bn, compared with the $2.8bn Dish paid for it last year.Dish is also looking to leverage its $320m acquisition of the failed Blockbuster video rental chain last year by offering it as a streaming video service for $10 per month, to compete with Netflix’s $8 a month service. “Blockbuster is somewhat tainted, according to Wall Street,” Mr Clayton said. “But consumers still use it.”Mr Clayton’s hope is that Dish’s technology platform, along with some services, will stop customer losses. “We have a long history of being first in technical innovation,” he said. “The problem is that we never told anybody.”
93;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-01-08T19:52:44Z;D Telekom seeks to boost T-Mobile USA;;Deutsche Telekom could raise billions of dollars for the T-Mobile USA business by issuing bonds and selling broadcast towers to bolster the independence of the US unit after failing to sell it to AT&T last month.The proposed $39bn sale of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile arm in the US to AT&T ended before Christmas after the companies admitted defeat in the face of regulatory opposition.The company has held preliminary talks with bankers about options to keep the US’s fourth-largest mobile operator competitive in the US market, where it is trailing behind far larger groups such as Verizon and AT&T, as well as Sprint Nextel, which sells the latest Apple smartphones.Deutsche Telekom has admitted that its US arm risks being left stranded with outdated technology as its rivals move to the next generation of mobile services able to carry the increased data that is being demanded by US consumers. René Obermann, Deutsche Telekom’s chief executive, said in the wake of the deal’s collapse that the company had not come up with a plan to launch a competitive level of services using the emerging 4G technology that is set to lead the US telecoms market.Deutsche Telekom faces the prospect of being marginalised since it does not have the bandwidth necessary to carry next-generation, or LTE, services such as high-speed mobile TV and gaming. Deutsche Telekom is expected to announce a strategic update after its results in February. Sources familiar with the company said that one option discussed has been to raise funds for the US business by means of bond issuance, with additional cash having been emphasised as necessary by some analysts.Deutsche Telekom, which declined to comment, has been promised by AT&T a fee of $3bn in addition to wireless spectrum and roaming rights with a book value of $1bn – but that may not be enough.Some analysts estimate that it could require more cash to keep the company competitive in the short term, in particular to buy any spectrum that could be sold or freed by regulators from other companies, unless other options were to emerge quickly. These could include a deal with another US business to solve the longer term shortage of spectrum able to carry next-generation services.Deutsche Telekom has also considered plans to sell its US towers business – the masts that broadcast its network – which could raise between $1bn-$2bn.A person with knowledge of the company’s plans said there was unlikely to be any rush to find a more long-term solution for US unit, however, which analysts still expect to be eventually sold or merged with another US group.Companies such as Sprint and Dish have already been linked with a deal. The regional or prepaid companies could also be an option, such as Leap Wireless or MetroPCS.One source said that a fundraising would also show Deutsche Telekom shareholders – who have become accustomed to high dividend payments but who will now have to forgo a windfall from the US – that T-Mobile USA would operate independently of its parent. He said shareholders could otherwise worry that further cash would need to be injected into the business just when Deutsche Telekom needed the funds in Germany to support initiatives such as the rollout of fibre infrastructure for superfast broadband.Analysts at Espirito Santo have warned there may need to be a substantial allocation of funds to the USA next year, which will come at a cost to domestic investment in LTE and fibre and potentially the dividend. “If you can raise debt against T-Mobile US, which can be kept in place if it is sold or floated, and pay a dividend to the parent, then that is like raising third-party funding,” said one financier.Analysts have also said that the company could face pressure by shareholders to consider raising money by sale of assets outside the US, with talk intensifying among industry bankers that it could sell its half-stake in Everything Everywhere, its British joint venture with France Telecom.Deutsche Telekom is seen by bankers as a willing seller, having given indications that the UK is no longer an important market, although those who have looked at the business said it might be difficult to find a buyer at the price.
94;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2012-01-03T17:17:16Z;Intense scramble for US mobile telecoms spectrum;Attention focuses on one of the most fiercely competitive industries in the world;AT&T’s failed $39bn bid for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit, coupled with a string of successful deals in recent months, has refocused attention on one of the most pressing issues facing the US mobile telecoms industry – the scramble for spectrum.When Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, announced the abandonment of the T-Mobile USA bid last month, he said: “The actions by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block this transaction do not change the realities of the US wireless industry.“It is one of the most fiercely competitive industries in the world, with a mounting need for more spectrum that has not diminished and must be addressed immediately. The AT&T and T-Mobile USA combination would have offered an interim solution to this spectrum shortage. In the absence of such steps, customers will be harmed and needed investment will be stifled.”Since then, AT&T has completed a separate deal to buy spectrum from Qualcomm for $1.93bn, increasing its total spectrum holdings to around 81.1 Megahertz, according to calculations by Bernstein Research. That transaction should help ease immediate concerns about spectrum shortages as AT&T rolls out its new LTE broadband wireless network. But industry insiders say the US mobile industry needs access to much more spectrum if it is to continue to innovate.“Spectrum is the backbone of the wireless industry – without it, the applications, speed, devices and other innovations of the wireless ecosystem could be in jeopardy,” says the CTIA, the US mobile industry trade group.As evidence, it points to reports from the wireless carriers themselves. For example, data usage on AT&T’s network – the first to host Apple’s popular iPhone handset – grew by more than 8,000 per cent from 2007 to 2010.Industry executives say this data growth will continue, fuelled by the increasing use of smartphones which consume on average 26 times the amount of bandwidth as an ordinary mobile phone, and other wireless data devices including PC tablets which are even more data hungry.“We estimate that in the first five to seven weeks of 2015, we will carry the same amount of mobile data traffic on our network that we carried in all of 2010, as customers continue to ‘mobilise’ everything,” AT&T says.While some argue that dire warnings about a looming spectrum crisis are overblown, the Federal Communications Commission, the main industry regulator, strongly disagrees. “The spectrum crunch is very real,” says an FCC official.Julius Genachoski, FCC chairman, has made the need to free up an additional 500 Megahertz of spectrum one of the policy centerpieces of his ambitious National Broadband Plan. As part of the plan, the FCC is seeking Congressional approval for one of its most hotly debated initiatives – the use of so-called “incentive auctions,” sharing the proceeds of the sale of up to 120 Megahertz of unused TV spectrum with the current owners.Mobile operators themselves are taking steps to secure additional spectrum. While AT&T was mulling over the future of its T-Mobile USA bid earlier this autumn, rival Verizon Wireless announced a $3.6bn deal to acquire unused airwaves from SpectrumCo, a coalition of US TV cable companies that includes Comcast and TimeWarnerCable. Then a few weeks later it unveiled a deal to buy additional spectrum from Cox Communications for $315m after Cox decided to abandon its own wireless phone initiative.As part of these deals, which Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research has described as, “in some ways the most important telecom transactions I have seen in 20 years,” the cable companies will also resell Verizon Wireless services.Mr Moffett describes Verizon’s cable spectrum purchases, which must still be approved by the FCC, as “a strategic masterstroke for Verizon in that it takes an enormous step towards a wireless duopoly, but does it with far less regulatory friction than AT&T’s [failed] transaction to buy T-Mobile USA.”If approved, Verizon will emerge with the best spectrum position in the industry and a very deep position in the 700 Megahertz band, considered “beachfront” property in the mobile industry because it is the most suitable spectrum for mobile broadband in dense urban areas.Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator by subscribers which recently renewed its wholesale agreement with Clearwire, has acknowledged that it will also need more spectrum as it pushes ahead with its 4G network rollout and its partnership with LightSquared looks increasingly uncertain.However, T-Mobile USA is in perhaps the most difficult position. Although the fourth-largest US mobile operator will receive some new spectrum as part of the break fee agreed between AT&T and Deutsche Telekom, the company has said it will need to acquire more spectrum before it can build the LTE network that it needs to compete with its three larger rivals. LTE is the next generation wireless broadband data standard which is supported by most leading telecoms operators in the world.Now that Verizon has tied up the cable companies’ spectrum, it is unclear where that spectrum might come from, and whether as a result, T-Mobile USA will be forced into another, perhaps less contentious merger or partnership.LightSquared, funded mainly by Philip Falcone’s Harbinger Capital, is struggling to overcome GPS interference issues before it can launch its planned nationwide wholesale LTE network. That leaves Dish Network, the US satellite TV operator which is awaiting regulatory approval for its purchase of 40 Megahertz of spectrum, as perhaps the most likely partner for one or other of the US mobile industry leaders – or perhaps a “tier two” regional operator – in their scramble for spectrum.
95;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-12-20T18:48:44Z;Fallout expected after failed AT&T bid;;The collapse of AT&T’s $39bn bid for Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit will have important repercussions for all three companies as mobile data use continues to grow, say analysts and industry insiders.AT&T, the second-largest US mobile operator by subscribers, will be forced to re-examine its options for obtaining new wireless spectrum, they said on Tuesday. T-Mobile USA and its German parent meanwhile will need to develop a new strategy for competing in the US market which is in the middle of an expensive technology transformation to a 4G technology known as LTE.While AT&T did not elaborate on its statement announcing the end of a deal that would have changed the US mobile landscape, analysts suggested the company is now likely to focus on winning approval from US regulators for its separate $1.93bn bid for spectrum owned by Qualcomm, while building its own LTE network.In addition, they said AT&T might examine alternative purchases or partnerships with companies that hold unused spectrum including Dish Networks, the leading US satellite operator which is in the process of acquiring a 40 MHz tranche of spectrum. “Dish could very well be the next target for AT&T,” said analysts at Stifel Nicolaus.Others, including antitrust lawyers, noted that the failure of the bid represents an unusual setback for AT&T in Washington where it is estimated to have spent $40m on lobbying efforts since the deal was announced in March. At the very least, they said it suggests that the company’s senior management and advisers seriously misread the Washington political and regulatory landscape.The challenges facing T-Mobile USA and its German parent are perhaps more stark, though DT will receive $3bn in cash and spectrum with a book value of $1bn as part of the break fee.DT had admitted its US business risks being left stranded with outdated technology as its three larger rivals move to the next generation of high-speed mobile data services based on LTE technology.Ultimately, as DT officials have privately acknowledged, the spectrum could prove more valuable to T-Mobile USA than the cash because without it T-Mobile USA faces the prospect of being marginalised in the market without the bandwidth necessary to support next-generation mobile services such as mobile video conferencing, mobile HDTV and gaming.For the moment, T-Mobile USA says it will continue to rely on an alternative high-speed wireless data technology called HSPA+ and relatively low-cost voice and data plans in order to compete. But T-Mobile USA is the only major US network operator that does not offer Apple’s iPhone.But unless it is able to forge a new partnership that would bring spectrum and new investment capital to the business, some analysts believe T-Mobile USA could become a niche player focused on the less lucrative but equally competitive pre-paid market.DT accused the US authorities of failing to give the deal a proper hearing. “We never really got to a thorough inspection [of the merger],” René Obermann, Deutsche Telekom chief executive, said on Tuesday, adding that authorities never appeared interested in details of the initial deal and later concessions.As a result of the deal collapse, he admitted that T-Mobile USA has “no clear path to LTE on current spectrum” and pointed out the “disadvantages in spectrum in economies of scale”. He said that the company would work on solutions to improve its spectrum position, although he refused to comment on any other merger, sale or acquisition to bolster its business.“The full solution [offered by the AT&T deal] would have been much better and easier but we will use the proceeds to improve our position,” he said. “We will work very hard on a solution for LTE.” Mr Obermann said the break-up provisions would give T-Mobile USA vital extra spectrum and roaming capabilities, which would help it along for a while. “But this isn’t the whole solution for the long term,” he conceded.He refused to be drawn on what Deutsche Telekom was now planning to do with T-Mobile USA and how quickly. But he did say Deutsche Telekom would continue to invest in its US business, which was profitable.
96;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-12-20T00:23:15Z;AT&T and D Telekom hit by deal failure;;The collapse of AT&T’s planned purchase of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit is a severe blow to both the US telecommunications group and Deutsche Telekom, which in the spring had touted the deal as the best way of jettisoning its US mobile unit before it needed to make big new investments.In an effort to soften the blow for investors, Rene Obermann, Deutsche Telekom’s chief executive, is expected to emphasise that the $4bn in cash and spectrum that the group will get from the break-up, coupled with a new roaming agreement with AT&T, will provide it with the means to invest in the infrastructure needed to build a new 4G network using a technology called LTE.T-Mobile USA will need to build this network if it is to remain competitive with its bigger rivals, including Verizon Wireless, AT&T and Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile operator once talked of as a potential partner.Yesterday, in the wake of the announcement that the deal had been abandoned, Philipp Humm, T-Mobile USA’s chief executive, urged staff to remain positive and noted: “We have an opportunity to write our own future.” He said the company’s leadership team will meet in the next few weeks to consider its strategic options.Nevertheless, such optimism that T-Mobile USA can “go it alone” will be tempered by the knowledge that top Deutsche Telekom executives were a year ago privately admitting T-Mobile USA had until late 2012 at most before big new investments would be needed and indicated that Deutsche Telekom, now focused increasingly on its domestic market, was in no position to shoulder such costs.In the meantime, T-Mobile USA – now the only main US network operator without the iPhone – has continued to lose valuable monthly contract customers in the nine months that AT&T and the German company have been fighting to get their deal approved, further narrowing the options for Deutsche Telekom.Having gone for the risky but high-paying deal, Deutsche Telekom could now be forced to accept a considerably lower valuation for its US unit.While Deutsche steadfastly stood by the AT&T deal, even the German government, which owns more than 30 per cent of the company, was growing uneasy. A top official in past weeks told the Financial Times that Berlin was increasingly pessimistic.Among the possible options for Deutsche, spinning T-Mobile USA off through an initial public offering is seen by analysts as highly unlikely. Similarly a combination with Sprint, with which the company had on-off deal discussions before signing the AT&T deal, looks challenging, argue industry experts, given the Department of Justice’s opposition to two national carriers teaming up.Analysts at Bernstein argued earlier this month that one remaining option would be for DT to partner with Dish Network, the pay TV company, whose 40MHz of spectrum looks increasingly valuable.Ultimately, say analysts, the US wireless market will be shaped by the need for wireless spectrum – the raw material on which they all rely. It was the looming shortage of spectrum that drove AT&T to offer a premium price for T-Mobile USA and announce a separate deal to acquire spectrum from Qualcomm, which is still pending regulatory approval.The same forces shaped Verizon’s deal earlier this month to buy $3.6bn of spectrum from a group of cable companies.Indeed, if that deal is approved in Washington, it will remove one of the strongest back-up plans available to Deutsche. AT&T’s biggest competitor continued to mop up spectrum last week, striking another deal to buy 20MHz from Cox Communications.The deal-making and communicative failures are likely to weigh on Deutsche Telekom’s Mr Obermann, even if government officials last month told the FT that his role was not in doubt. But both he and AT&T’s Randall Stephenson will be under pressure from investors to set this misstep right.
97;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-12-14T18:44:38Z;ViaSat launch targets rural US web demand;;A newly launched $250m satellite will soon start transmitting broadband internet to rural US consumers the latest effort by telecommunications groups to satisfy skyrocketing demand for high speed residential data services.The new satellite from ViaSat will give the Nasdaq-listed company, based in California, the ability to effectively compete with other non-premium internet providers, which still are the only options for millions of US consumers.Its bandwidth will also be used to power the in-flight wireless internet service for JetBlue, the US carrier.The ViaSat launch is likely to be welcomed by the Federal Communications Commission, which is pushing for solutions to the digital divide, especially in rural areas. “If we have a really good service at a reasonable price, we can keep expanding the market,” said Mark Dankberg, ViaSat’s chief executive. “Satellite will be better for a lot of people than DSL, 3G or 4G.”While most satellites are primarily used for one-way broadcasting, ViaSat-1 will be able to handle the two-way transmission of data at 140 gigabytes per second. That is more bandwidth than the combined capacity of Intelsat and SES, ViaSat’s two largest peers, Mr Dankberg said.Intelsat, the world’s largest provider of fixed satellite services, recently outlined plans to invest $1.3bn in four new satellite launches by the end of 2012.ViaSat, in October successfully launched its new ViaSat-1, one of the highest capacity data satellites in the world. Launched with a Proton rocket in Kazakhstan, the satellite is now in geosynchronous orbit 22,500 miles above the earth. It is powered by 100 meter wide solar panels. Including launch costs and insurance, the satellite cost ViaSat $400m.Mr Dankberg conceded that his industry faces an uphill battle. “Satellite doesn’t have a good reputation for broadband service,” he said.Moreover, WildBlue, the consumer facing service ViaSat acquired in 2009, has not upgraded its service, even as the use of data intensive services such as Netflix and Hulu has increased. “Wild Blue hasn’t changed its service for six years,” he said. “That isn’t considered a good value anymore.”ViaSat had revenues of $223m in the most recent quarter with net income of just $8m. Shares in the company are up 16 per cent over the past month to about $47, giving it a market capitalisation of $2bn.Its Wild Blue service has about 400,000 customers in the US paying about $50 per month for satellite internet services. Mr Dankberg hopes to treble the number of subscribers in the coming year with capacity from the new satellite. The company also makes money by supplying components to other satellite makers, and selling services to companies and the US government.One of ViaSat’s customers is Dish Networks, the satellite TV provider, which resells its service to US consumers. Earlier this year Dish’s parent company, EchoStar, acquired Hughes Communications, a ViaSat rival, a move that could see Dish drop ViaSat as a supplier.
98;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-12-05T20:04:06Z;Verizon carves new landscape with spectrum deal;;"Until last Friday, US telecoms operator Verizon Communications appeared to be the sworn enemy of cable companies such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable.Verizon, already the largest US mobile operator by subscribers through its Verizon Wireless joint venture with Britain’s Vodafone, had been pushing into the cable operators’ territory, offering high-speed internet services, and even its own television service.But last week sworn enemies suddenly became friends, as Verizon Wireless agreed to buy $3.6bn of spectrum owned by a joint venture of Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks known as SpectrumCo. The deal will allow Verizon to bolster its wireless services with new spectrum, which is used to transmit voice and most importantly, data.That alone would have been a significant coup for Verizon. While rival AT&T’s quest to add spectrum through the $39bn proposed acquisition of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit has become bogged down in a legal battle with the government, Verizon’s deal achieves a similar objective for a fraction of the cost.The spectrum Verizon is acquiring will enable it to rapidly expand the rollout of its fourth generation network and provide it with the headroom to accommodate the next generation of data-hungry smartphones.But Verizon and the cable companies didn’t stop with a mere transfer of spectrum licenses. Instead they announced extensive reselling arrangements that will allow Comcast and Time Warner Cable to offer their customers Verizon Wireless service. And in markets where Verizon does not yet have its own television product, it can resell cable services from Comcast and Time Warner Cable.The result is a reshaped competitive landscape where cable and telecoms companies will be competing in some markets, but co-operating just miles away. Commenting on the announcement, Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett titled his note: “The End of the World as We Know It”.Ever since AT&T announced its planned acquisition of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile unit nine months ago, Verizon Communications has remained carefully aloof from the debate over the merits of the proposed $39bn deal.Now as AT&T struggles to keep its deal afloat in the face of regulatory opposition, Verizon has produced an acquisition of its own.The driving force behind both deals the growing appetite for wireless spectrum. While wireless communications was mostly about voice calls and text messages, there was generally enough spectrum to go around.But the advent of data hungry smartphones and tablet computers has sent a shockwave through the industry. AT&T saw data usage surge after the iPhone was launched in 2007.While the company has tried to accommodate this surge in demand by upgrading its network technology, it admits that it has struggled to keep pace.The acquisition of T-Mobile USA would provide it with the spectrum it says it needs to improve its services.However, the US justice department believes the deal would reduce competition and stifle innovation, while the Federal Communications Commission believes that the benefits of the deal are outweighed by the negatives.While AT&T has temporarily withdrawn its application to acquire T-Mobile USA’s spectrum licences, the DoJ’s case will be heard in court in February.Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest US cable companies, now have the nation’s leading wireless provider as a partner; one of the main benefits of the deal for them is that it puts to rest speculation that they were poised to build or acquire their own wireless networks.“We’re not going to go out and acquire a wireless player, so it gives us access to the wireless player we feel is the best out there for a long time,” Neil Smit, president of Comcast Cable, said at the UBS Media Conference on Monday.The deal also highlights the different strategies that the US wireless telecoms groups are adopting to deal with what they perceive to be a looming spectrum crunch driven in part by the success of smartphones.US regulators are seeking to free up additional spectrum for wireless communications, but it could be several years before that is available for auction. Verizon Wireless clearly believed it could not afford to wait.As several analysts noted, the spectrum purchase should ensure that Verizon can continue to deliver what it has positioned as a premium network experience to smartphone and tablet PC users.The deal also has knock-on effects for other cable and telecoms companies. Dish Networks, the satellite TV provider, is sitting on a large swath of valuable spectrum. With SpectrumCo’s licenses now accounted for, that makes the Dish assets more valuable. “It makes Dish’s spectrum all the more scarce,” said Stefan Anninger, a Credit Suisse analyst who put a value of about $8.6bn on the Dish spectrum.For Clearwire, another spectrum holder, the deal is a mixed bag. Comcast, which had provided Clearwire’s wireless data service to 35,000 of its customers, will phase it out in favour of Verizon. But just as Dish’s spectrum is now more valuable, so too is Clearwire’s.While no one is disputing Verizon’s savvy in buying the SpectrumCo assets, some analysts wonder if Comcast and Time Warner Cable might have given away too much to a company that remains a competitor.“If cable’s future becomes increasingly entangled with the wireless space, we wonder if an agreement with a company such as Verizon, who’s long term interests may not be aligned with cable’s, makes the most sense,” said Mr Anninger.“It’s too early to tell, but with so many deals and technologies unfolding in the wireless space, we wonder if it might have made more sense for SpectrumCo to keep its wireless space bargaining chip for a bit longer.”"
99;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-12-02T22:43:59Z;Verizon Wireless: bands of gold;A valuable commodity is sometimes invisible and intangible;Who said a valuable commodity had to be something you can see or feel? The sale of a large band of US wireless spectrum by a consortium of cable companies to top US mobile operator Verizon Wireless for $3.6bn – about 50 per cent more than they paid the government for it five years ago – suggests otherwise.Like traditional “hard commodities” – those that are neither renewable nor perishable such as oil or tin – businesses whose lifeblood is spectrum will pay through the nose to secure it. Likewise, when demand surges they manage to do more with less. Both in terms of squeezing more bytes out of each bit of frequency and the rate at which demand grows though, mobile telephony operates at a different order of magnitude. Globally, wireless capacity must double about every 30 months and adding towers or improving technology can go only so far.Verizon’s deal is a further slap to number two and four players AT&T and T-Mobile USA. While the Federal Communications Commission objected last week to their $39bn marriage – a deal motivated in large part by the latter’s spectrum – it is less likely to protest spectrum resales. With their deal in limbo, an option mentioned by some, including analysts at Sanford Bernstein, had been for Deutsche Telekom to fold T-Mobile into the spectrum consortium to form a more viable entity.The deal boosts the prospective price of other bundles of underused spectrum such as those owned by DISH and Clearwire. And inasmuch as spectrum is becoming dearer, remaining independent is harder for smaller operators, encouraging more concentration, which is exactly what the FCC objected in the AT&T/T-Mobile deal.To modernise John Paul Getty’s quip about mineral rights, the meek may inherit the earth but not its radio frequency.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
100;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-11-20T18:13:12Z;Prospects darken for AT&T’s merger hopes;;When Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, triumphantly announced a definitive agreement to buy Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA business for $39bn in cash and stock eight months ago, most industry analysts thought it was all over bar the shouting.AT&T, the largest US telecoms group by revenue, was so confident of winning regulatory approval for the deal when it was negotiated that it agreed to pay a break up fee of $3bn in cash together with another $3bn-$4bn in other assets including spectrum.But all that changed on August 31 when the US justice department filed an antitrust suit to block a deal that would have created a new mobile industry market leader in the US with more than 130m subscribers, just ahead of Verizon Wireless, the joint venture between Verizon Communications and Britain’s Vodafone group.Today most analysts think there is a less than 50:50 chance that the deal will be completed, unless significant concessions are made ahead of a court hearing in February. Some only give the deal a 20 per cent chance of completion. Bankers suggest that in order to be sufficient, such concessions would have to be significant and include perhaps the sale of spectrum to Metro PCS or another second tier mobile operator.Robin Bienenstock, an analyst at Bernstein Research, says that if the suit goes to court the deal is almost certain to be stopped given a relatively straightforward legal case based on national competition grounds.AT&T and T-Mobile USA, the fourth-largest US mobile network operator, say despite the challenges they remain committed to the deal and plan to fight the DoJ suit which is due to be heard in Federal court in February. Both AT&T and Deutsche Telekom also insist, at least in public, that there is no “Plan B” contingency plan should the deal not be completed.Glenn Lurie, president of emerging devices and resale at AT&T, said during a Morgan Stanley conference in Barcelona this week that he was still confident the deal would succeed. “I fully expect the deal to be done,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “We are confident that we are going to get that done. It is very important to us from a network and spectrum perspective.”But since the antitrust suit was announced, AT&T has increasingly positioned the purchase of T-Mobile USA and its 33m-strong customer base as the “rescue” of an ailing company orphaned by its German parent.“Over the past two years, T-Mobile USA has been losing customers despite explosive demand for mobile broadband,” AT&T said in a statement this week. “T-Mobile USA has no clear path to 4G LTE, the industry’s next generation network, and its German parent, Deutsche Telekom, has said it would not continue to make significant investments in the United States.”For the moment, all Deutsche Telekom will say is, “we still expect the transaction to be approved because we think our reasons for it are good. This deal is good for customers and the market in the US.”But as analysts point out, as long as Deutsche Telekom and AT&T are locked in a legal battle with the US government, Deutsche Telekom is bound by the “best efforts” terms of the deal to neither discuss the possibility of a “Plan B” nor pursue alternative negotiations with any third party.“This enforced silence and legal limbo is a very long way from a comfortable position for Deutsche Telekom, as it remains the reluctant owner of an asset that is deteriorating rapidly in an increasingly difficult US,” said Ms Bienenstock and Craig Moffett of Bernstein in a recent research note.But some analysts believe recent actions by T-Mobile USA have been driven in part by a tacit recognition that the deal is in trouble. In particular they note that T-Mobile USA has stepped up its advertising and introduced a potentially disruptive $30-a-month pre-paid pricing plan.In addition, they suggest that once Deutsche Telekom is free of legal constraints, an alternative deal might emerge. Some believe T-Mobile USA could merge its spectrum with Dish Network, the leading US satellite TV operator, to form a new 4G mobile operator. Another option might be to buy spectrum from a group of leading US cable TV operators, or consider some form of combination with them, ahead of an initial public offering of a combined entity.Fuelling such speculation, analysts note that Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest US cable TV operators, together hold a 20MHz block of spectrum covering about 80 per cent of the US in exactly the same band that is already held by T-Mobile USA.“A deal would give the cable industry a neat answer for 4G,” say Berstein’s Bienenstock and Moffett, “and would provide a clear exit from their spectrum holdings in a way that would satisfy the Federal Communication Commission’s desire to crack down on spectrum “warehousing”.For the moment, there is no evidence that either side of the AT&T-Deutsche Telekom deal are considering such a “Plan B”. But the longer the deal remains in limbo, the more likely that is to change.
101;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-11-18T19:00:50Z;Indian TV mogul hopes to channel US viewers;;Subhash Chandra, the Indian media pioneer behind the Zee TV channel, is making a $250m bet that he can get American viewers and advertisers interested in Indian-style alternative therapies and “wellness” programming.The investment will go towards original and acquired programmes for Veria Living, a US cable and satellite channel and website focused on yoga, holistic treatments and healthy eating, and represents the largest such investment by an Indian media group in content for the US market, he said.Mr Chandra, the Essel Group chairman who began his entertainment career more than 20 years ago with one Mumbai amusement park, is using his family’s money, rather than the budget of Zee TV, which is 51 per cent family-controlled. He launched the Veria channel in 2010 with a $100m investment.Part of the new funds will be used to rebrand the channel from Veria to Veria Living to help explain its positioning more clearly to US viewers.“This is the only health and wellness channel in the US,” said Mr Chandra, who practices Vipassana meditation. “This country [the US] produces about 25,000 masters degree holders every year in Ayurvedha [traditional Indian medicine]. They will get a voice, as will the tens of thousands of practitioners in the US.”Veria has had trouble persuading the largest US cable operators, including Comcast and Time Warner Cable, to carry the channel, however, which is now available through Dish, Verizon FiOS and Frontier Communications in just 10m of the 80m US TV homes. Mr Chandra said he hoped to be in 35m-40m US homes by the end of 2012.“Big cable companies were not as receptive as we would have expected,” Mr Chandra said, but Veria was now talking to “all the big cable operators” and to newer digital distributors. Online channels, from YouTube to Hulu, have begun to provide a more viable home for specialist programming, from cricket games for Americans of Indian extraction to documentary films that struggle to get cable distribution.Extra distribution will be critical for Veria to get the Nielsen ratings advertisers demand and to reach Mr Chandra’s goal of the channel breaking even within 24 months.Mr Chandra’s bet on the US market comes at a time when growth in Indian cable TV has slowed. Although no longer growing at 30-35 per cent per year, at 14-15 per cent it still exceeds the growth in US pay-TV and continues to attract investment from large US media groups. India has the world’s third-largest number of homes with pay television, at about 100m, serviced by more than 450 channels.Groups including Disney, NBC, Time Warner, and Viacom have committed several billion dollars to India’s entertainment industry over the past two years.Mr Chandra said the multitude of competitors in India’s television market were losing a combined $3bn a year, making Zee TV “one of a handful” of profitable operators.Margins across the Indian pay-TV market are among the lowest of any emerging market because of rising costs, competition and reliance on legacy analogue networks.These losses would force the industry to consolidate, Mr Chandra predicted, saying that this “cleaning up” would bring annual growth back to the 30-35 per cent rate within three to five years.KPMG India expects the number of TV households in Asia’s third-largest economy to exceed 156m by 2015. India is also expected to overtake China as the largest pay-TV advertising market in Asia by 2017 with $5.6bn in net revenues, according to Media Partners Asia.
102;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-11-08T11:43:31Z;US pay-TV: don’t touch that dial;Will the internet do to pay TV what wireless phones did to landlines?;"Americans average five hours of TV viewing per day. If time is to be left for work and sleep, old ways of watching must decline as new ones arise. Heavy investment in internet video by Amazon, Google and Netflix surely spooks executives at pay TV companies. Their nightmare scenario: the internet does to pay TV what wireless phones did to landlines.Third-quarter results from the largest TV distributors should ease fears about mass cable-cutting. The big cable companies – Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, Comcast, and Charter – all lost video subscribers, but the declines were lower than in the year-ago period. Telecoms companies AT&T and Verizon added TV customers, and the satellite company DirectTV had a bumper quarter for subs, driven by American football, more than offsetting nasty losses at rival Dish. Nor does competition from the internet seem to be causing price pressure: revenue per user was up across the industry.Still, total 2011 sub growth for cable companies is likely to be less than 1 per cent. Perhaps the internet is stealing marginal subscribers. In any case, the game has hardly begun. There are still fewer viewing options on the internet – pay TV has a virtual lock on sport, for example. And content producers will work to ensure that cable and satellite distributors keep getting the best stuff first, because that is where the money is, for now. They see the internet primarily as a new way to earn revenue from back catalogues.What will happen if, as the options available on the internet increase, viewers leave pay TV in greater numbers? One likely outcome is that broadband access (also sold by the cable and telecoms companies) will get pricier. Video already consumes more than half of internet bandwidth; as that grows, someone will have to pay for it.

103;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-10-26T21:04:36Z;Warner stops giving Blockbuster latest films;;Warner Brothers has stopped supplying discs of its latest releases to Blockbuster after the DVD rental chain refused to agree to a 28-day delay between the films going on sale and their availability to rent.The move is the first step taken by Warner Bros to stimulate retail sales and make owning film content more appealing to consumers. It will be followed by efforts to expand similar release “windows” already in place with other movie rental services, such as Netflix and Redbox.Blockbuster has rejected the Hollywood studio’s request for a 28-day window and has instead bought discs of Horrible Bosses and The Green Lantern on the open market in order to rent them to its customers.“They felt it was important to continue to offer day and date rental so rather than work with us they went around us,” said Kevin Tsujihara, president of Warner Bros Home Entertainment. Blockbuster declined to comment.“The question is: how do we make ownership more valuable and attractive?” said Mr Tsujihara. “We have started the process of creating a window in bricks-and-mortar DVD and Blu-ray rental.”Horrible Bosses and The Green Lantern are the first two titles to be released by Warner Bros through the Ultra Violet service, which allows consumers to store the movies in a cloud-based locker and watch them on a device of their choosing.Hollywood has pinned its hopes on Ultra Violet to arrest the slump in DVD sales. But with an increasing number of consumers choosing subscription rental services – such as Netflix – over ownership, the industry has to convince consumers that buying movies represents good value for money.Blockbuster was recently bought out of bankruptcy by Dish Network, the pay-TV operator, which has increased footfall in the chain’s retail outlets and recently created a $10-a-month subscription service to rival that of Netflix.Netflix, which operates the largest streaming and DVD subscription service by users, has been battered in recent months by a tumbling share price. Shares in Netflix touched $300 in July but have since fallen to below $80.Netflix currently has to wait 28 days to make Warner Bros titles available to its subscribers. Mr Tsujihara indicated that the studio wanted to increase that window. “The Netflix and Redbox deals are going to be expiring at the end of the year and beginning of next year and it’s likely we will try to extend those windows,” he said.
104;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-10-14T00:36:17Z;Sale of Hulu video site scrapped;;Walt Disney, News Corp and Providence Equity Partners have scrapped their planned sale of Hulu after failing to attract a compelling bid for the online video site.The companies said in a joint statement that because Hulu held “a unique and compelling strategic value to each of its owners, we have terminated the sale process”. The companies added that they “look forward to working together to continue mapping out its path to even greater success”.Hulu had attracted several interested parties, with Amazon, Dish Network, Google and Yahoo among those expressing interest.However, Yahoo withdrew from the sales process three weeks ago after the ousting of Carol Bartz, its chief executive, and a subsequent strategic review which has led to the internet group becoming the focus of takeover talk.The other interested buyers failed to win over the Hulu shareholders with their bids for the site. The auction has not been a smooth one, with bidders at times expressing their frustration with the exclusivity of programming offered by the media companies that provide content to the site.The bidders had pushed for long contracts to broadcast hit shows, such as ABC’s Modern Family and NBCUniversal’s 30 Rock, but Hulu’s owners could not guarantee that the site would have exclusive content that was not available on other platforms or sites.The scrapping of the auction leaves unclear the fate of Hulu’s management team, which had pushed for a sale after failing to generate sufficient investor interest in an initial public offering of the company.Jason Kilar, the former Amazon executive who has run Hulu since its creation in 2008, has clashed with the company’s shareholders after criticising the business model of network TV.“He and his team are getting restless,” said one person close to the bidding. “They want the media company [owners] off their backs and they wanted some liquidity. Now they don’t have them off their backs and they still don’t have any liquidity.”Hulu has been aggressively signing content deals to broaden the appeal of the service. It recently struck a deal with Univision, the most-watched Spanish-language station, to make much of its content available online to US viewers.The site has also struck deals with the Miramax film studio to supplement the hours of programming it has from the ABC, Fox and NBC networks.
105;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-10-10T16:49:42Z;Netflix drops plans to split DVD and online;;Netflix has buckled under pressure from investors and customers to make one of the most high profile US corporate strategic u-turns in recent years, backing off from a controversial plan to split its mail-order DVD and its online streaming media businesses.The move is the latest twist in four months of dramatic announcements and corporate restructuring from the company, during which customers and commentators have pilloried Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings over the changes.Richard Greenfield, analyst at BTIG, called the move a “necessary reversal of a bad decision”.Shares in Netflix had fallen 60 per cent since July, as investors and analysts reassessed the company’s long-term prospects. Netflix traded up modestly in midday trading, but the finished the day down 4.8 per cent to $111.62.“They’ve completely alienated their customers at a time when there are strong new threats,” said Shahid Khan, a consultant with MediaMorph. “I don’t think their stock is ever going to recover.”Mr Hastings last month said he would separate the mail-order business, which is declining, into a new company, called Qwikster, and keep the growing online streaming business as Netflix.com. But on Monday Mr Hastings completed an about-face.“There is a difference between moving quickly – which Netflix has done very well for years – and moving too fast, which is what we did in this case,” he said.The plan to split the company followed a price increase in July that caused Netflix to lose at least 1m subscribers. Mr Hastings on Monday said there would be no more price increases.Analysts said the introduction of Qwikster and its quick demise ranks among the more spectacular debacles in recent business history.“This doesn’t quite rise to the same level of self-destruction as New Coke [when Coca-Cola briefly tried a new formula in 1985],” said Adam Hanft, a brand strategist who works with media and technology companies. “But it’s pretty close.”Mr Hanft drew a comparison between former Apple chief executive Steve Jobs, who died last week, and Mr Hastings: “It points to how sure-footed Apple is in understanding consumer behaviour, and how Netflix has lost its way.”As Netflix works to attract new customers and retain existing ones, it is having to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new content deals with television and film studios such as Fox, AMC and DreamWorks. Those costs continue to rise, and negotiations between Netflix and Starz, the premium cable network that owns rights to films by Walt Disney and Sony Pictures, recently broke down.Netflix is also facing fresh competition from the likes of Amazon, which will include a free trial of its Amazon Prime streaming media service with each new Kindle Fire tablet it sells, starting next month. Hulu, the streaming service, is up for sale and has attracted bids from Google and Dish Network.The turmoil has prompted a fresh analysis of the company’s value. “In the long run if they go all digital, the economics may not work,” Mr Khan said. “The whole love affair with Netflix is, if not over, at least tainted.”
106;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-09-24T00:04:32Z;Dish launches streaming and DVD service;;Dish Network has announced a new film streaming and DVD rental service under the satellite television provider’s recently acquired Blockbuster brand, mounting a fresh challenge to the troubled Netflix service.Dish also revealed that Blockbuster had signed up nearly 500,000 customers to new film subscription services over the past 30 days “given recent events”, referring to subscriber desertions from Netflix after it announced a dramatic rise in rates and the splitting of its streaming and DVD rental services.Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, said in an email on Monday apologising to subscribers about the handling of the split that film streaming and DVD by mail had become two different businesses that needed to be marketed differently.But Joe Clayton, Dish chief executive, argued at a news conference in San Francisco on Friday that consumers wanted the opposite.“It’s one company, one bill, one connection for everything you need in video entertainment,” he said of Dish’s offering.The new Blockbuster Movie Pass launches on October 1 for Dish subscribers only. Existing subscribers can choose from more than 100,000 DVD-by-mail titles, including 3,000 games, for an extra $10 a month on their bill. The ability to stream thousands of films on a PC or to their TV through their set-top box is also included.New Dish subscribers can have the service free for a year and the company said it would be offered to non-Dish subscribers in the future.Michael Pachter, media analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the new offering lacked the depth of catalogue of other streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon and it would have only a limited impact through being confined to Dish customers.“To the extent that if you’re a Dish customer and a Netflix customer and you’re pissed at Netflix, maybe they’ll pick up one or two million subscribers,” he said.Mr Pachter said he was now convinced that Netflix had divided its business with a sale to Amazon in mind for the streaming portion. He raised the stock on Thursday from “underperform” to “outperform”.Blockbuster was the arch rival of Netflix until it filed for bankruptcy a year ago. It had been closing stores to try to cut losses incurred as services such as Netflix and RedBox – a low-cost DVD rental kiosk business – gained ground.Dish acquired Blockbuster in April and has been rebuilding and integrating its business. While the number of stores in the US has been halved to about 1,500, they have been redesigned and DVD rentals priced more competitively, at as low as 99 cents.

According to UBS Investment Research, the nearest rival hardware manufacturer is HTC, which earned a 39% retention rate, while the biggest loser was Research in Motion, whose retention rate dropped from 62% to 33% in the last 18 months.Blockbuster, the video and DVD rental group acquired out of bankruptcy in April by Dish Network, is holding a press event on Friday titled ‘A Stream Come True’, CNN Money says.

108;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-09-19T23:06:55Z;Netflix to split DVD and web services;;Netflix will separate its online video streaming and DVD-by-mail services into two businesses, its chief executive said.The announcement came in a corporate blog post on Sunday night after Netflix said it would begin charging separately for the two services and raised prices as much as 60 per cent, a move that was poorly received among subscribers.The company’s shares dropped nearly 15 per cent last week after Netflix said it expected 1m people to cancel their subscriptions.“I messed up. I owe everyone an explanation,” wrote Reed Hastings, chief executive. “We realised that streaming and DVD-by-mail are really becoming two different businesses, with very different cost structures, that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently.”The streaming service will retain the Netflix name, while the DVD service will be renamed Qwikster, Mr Hastings said.Andrew Rendich, who has led the DVD business for the past four years, will become chief executive of the new company, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Netflix.There will be no further pricing changes but customers will be billed separately for the two services and they will use a different, non-integrated website for each, Mr Hastings said.Mr Hastings took an apologetic tone in his post, saying that “in hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success. We have done very well for a long time by steadily improving our service, without doing much CEO communication.”He said he should have more fully explained the decision to split the services to subscribers. “It wouldn’t have changed the price increase, but it would have been the right thing to do.”Rich Greenfield, research analyst at BTIG, wrote in a note last week: “While Netflix thought they had weathered the worst of the storm when they reported earnings [in July], they clearly underestimated the number of people that would call back in late August/early September to cancel/alter their subscription plan as the price increase was going into effect.”He added that the shrinking subscription base in the US may open the door for competition from other video streaming services, such as Amazon, Google and Dish Network.Netflix shares dropped 7.4 per cent to $143.75 on Monday in New York.
109;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-09-15T17:36:14Z;Subscriber cancellations strike Netflix;;Netflix shares tumbled close to 15 per cent on Thursday after the fast-growing DVD and online video streaming service said it expected 1m people to cancel their subscriptions in the US because of a recent price hike.The company, which downgraded its subscriber estimates in a letter to shareholders, expects to have 24m subscribers in the US in the third quarter, rather than 25m which was its guidance a few months ago.The downgrade comes after the company angered many of its subscribers by splitting its DVD subscription and online streaming packages into two distinct services, charging separately for each one.The change represented a 60 per cent price hike for people subscribing to both services. “Despite the guidance revision, we remain convinced that the splitting of our services was the right long-term strategic choice,” the company said in the shareholder letter.The company added that its financial guidance remained unchanged.Netflix is trying to shift its DVD subscribers to online streaming because this service costs less to provide and savings can be spent on bolstering Netflix’s library of content. The price hike cost the company 800,000 subscribers, according to the letter.“Management have clearly underestimated the impact of the price hike for the combined service,” said James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities. But he added the stock price fall may be an overreaction.“The vast majority of Netflix growth comes from its streaming only package, and that price hasn’t changed. Once the dust settles from the impact of the pricing structure changes, we shouldn’t see a material change in the growth trajectory.”Netflix has grown rapidly, announcing plans to launch in several countries across Latin America and the Caribbean. But as the company has expanded, content providers have begun to demand more money for their film and TV programming.Negotiations between Netflix and Starz, the premium cable network controlled by Liberty Media, were terminated recently, which means that Netflix will lose Starz’ films and TV shows when their contract expires next February. Starz has the streaming rights to movies from Walt Disney and Sony Pictures Entertainment, and losing that content will be a blow to Netflix.“We suspect the combination of a large effective price increase and then news that they would be losing some of their highest profile movie content related to Starz has impacted their momentum,” wrote Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, in a note.The online video marketplace is becoming increasingly competitive, with Amazon increasing the programming available on its own subscription service. Hulu, the online video site owned by Walt Disney, News Corp and NBC Universal, is up for sale and has attracted bids from Dish Network, Amazon and Yahoo, with Google also interested in acquiring the company.“We believe Starz’s digital rights are increasingly valuable as they could help an Amazon, Google, Dish, or whoever wins Hulu compete aggressively with Netflix,” added Mr Greenfield.
110;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-09-07T20:11:23Z;Hulu owners should take the money and run;Online content is still a rocky road to profitability;While advisers in other sectors anxiously watch the latest twitches in global financial markets, technology bankers still look confident about the depth of potential bidders’ pockets. Speculation that Yahoo could again become a target after Carol Bartz’s unceremonious exit is a reminder that cash is not an issue for most would-be buyers.In this context, the auction for Hulu, the US online video site founded just four and a half years ago, has attracted offers of $1.5bn-$2bn from Amazon, Dish Network and Yahoo itself. Apple, DirecTV and Microsoft looked at an earlier stage, and according to an AllThingsD report corroborated by one person familiar with the auction this week, Google is still hovering, indicating albeit vaguely that it could offer substantially more in exchange for sweeter content agreements.Yet not everyone is convinced that Hulu’s owners should sell. Hulu was founded by NBC and News Corp’s Fox network in 2007 as an advertising-supported online outlet for their television programming. Providence Equity Partners invested $100m months later, valuing the fledgling service at $1bn, before Walt Disney, the owner of ABC, took a stake in 2009.Its revenues have grown fast, helped by last year’s launch of Hulu Plus, an $8-a-month subscription tier with a wider array of content. Jason Kilar, chief executive, has said that revenues could hit $500m this year, nearly double last year’s $263m.It has been helped by bigger trends. Analysts at eMarketer expect US online video advertising revenues to grow by 52 per cent to $2.16bn this year.But that growth has presented Hulu’s media owners with a dilemma. Its success depends on the quality of the content it offers, but the more shows ABC, Fox or NBC make available online, the more they alienate the cable and satellite companies that pay most of their bills and the retailers still selling their DVD box sets.NBC’s takeover by Comcast, which agreed to take a back seat at Hulu to satisfy regulators anxious about a cable company dictating the future of online video, has only highlighted that tension. Comcast, Providence and Disney are now seen as sellers, but News Corp is said to be on the fence.Hulu is a rare digital success for content owners. For years, critics mocked music companies for not setting up their own download site, letting Steve Jobs’ 99-cent tracks dominate the market at iTunes.Quite apart from the financial returns, which have exceeded expectations, Hulu has given the networks more of a say in how their content is consumed online. Rich Greenfield, media analyst at BTIG, calls the idea of selling now “a mistake of epic proportions”. A mishandled sale certainly risks further empowering a technology giant such as Google, Amazon or Apple just when content companies are fretting that they are already too influential.In the same breath, however, Mr Greenfield notes that media companies have “utterly failed at building their own digital assets”. There are broader questions about media groups’ ability to invent the digital future in-house, and about the sustainability of Hulu’s success under its current ownership.Now, no one is pressing record labels to set up their own digital music store. Instead, the music industry is finally seeing glimmers of growth as competition to iTunes flourishes from alternatives such as Spotify and Google Music. Vevo, the labels’ music video venture with Google, has given them an income stream and a measure of control over online content.The lesson of the past decade has been that content owners’ attempts to keep everything in-house, or to favour one digital distributor, rarely work and rarely last. Hulu has many challenges to crack. It is only at the start of its international expansion plans, and advertising is still an unsatisfactory revenue stream for professional online video.It would undoubtedly benefit from the online advertising clout, mobile device savviness and international brand strength of an Amazon, Google or even Yahoo. The ideal outcome for media companies would be to have three or more strong competitors bidding against each other for their content. Selling to Google, for example, would create a strong counterweight to Netflix and Amazon.Hulu always looked like a temporary solution, a stepping stone to the TV Everywhere promise of making a full programming array available to subscribers on any device, any time.That people are talking about a valuation in the billions of dollars is a remarkable achievement, but joint ventures rarely last. Already, the conflicts of interest are showing. Hulu’s owners should take the money and run, reinvesting it in content that will cut through the digital clutter.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s Media Editor
111;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
112;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-09-02T22:08:24Z;DirecTV knocked out of battle for Hulu;;The race to buy Hulu, the online video site, became a three-way fight between Amazon, Yahoo and Dish Network, after DirecTV, the satellite TV operator, was ruled out of the auction for submitting too low a bid, said people familiar with the situation.The three leading bids for Hulu are in the $1.5bn-$2bn range, said a person close to Hulu.With three of its shareholders direct competitors with each other, a sale is not necessarily certain. However, one person close to the situation expressed confidence in the completion of a sale, describing the auction as “robust and competitive”.The US-based site, which in the past three years has become one of the biggest online video services, is being sold by its owners: News Corporation, Walt Disney, NBC Universal and Providence Equity Partners.Hulu, which has thousands of hours of hit TV shows on its site, including Modern Family, The Office and Saturday Night Live, recently unveiled plans to launch its service in Japan. The sale of the company initially attracted a broad field of interested bidders, with Google, Apple and Microsoft among the companies to explore a potential acquisition.But, after first round bids were submitted, the field narrowed significantly. Amazon has an established connection with the group: Jason Kilar, a former Amazon executive, is the chief executive of Hulu and remains close to Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who is his former boss.“Buying Hulu would propel Amazon’s video strategy forward with exclusive content versus Netflix and others,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, in a recent note. “It could also create a unique marketing advantage for the coming Amazon tablet.”Yahoo is keen to bolster its network of advertising-supported sites with the professionally made content provided by Hulu. The deal is also attractive to Yahoo because Hulu is a dual revenue stream business, generating income from 1m paying subscribers as well as advertisers.Dish Network is also keen to buy Hulu. The satellite TV provider recently acquired Blockbuster, the DVD rental chain, out of bankruptcy and wants to build a viable digital alternative to Netflix, the DVD and online streaming group that has upended TV viewing trends and the broader home entertainment market.Hulu was created by its media company owners in response to YouTube, to provide them with a digital platform that could retain TV viewers who were migrating online.The site’s growth has surpassed expectations, although the journey has not always been smooth. Mr Kilar recently angered his media company shareholders when he wrote a blog post that lambasted the traditional TV business model. He also tried to lead an initial public offering of Hulu but failed to generate sufficient investor interest.However, an outright sale of the company quickly became the most favoured option, with several companies coveting the site and its growing subscriber base.But not everyone is convinced a sale of the company would be best for its media company shareholders. Mr Greenfield has described the auction as “a mistake of epic proportions”.“While Hulu can generate meaningful value for media companies owned by a third party … maintaining ownership in Hulu would allow [its shareholders] to build significant long-term equity value, have direct control of their digital future and propel Hulu’s growth in unique, proprietary ways,” he wrote in his recent note.Hulu’s biggest competitor is Netflix, which suffered a setback this week when Starz Entertainment, the premium cable network that owns rights to films by Walt Disney and Sony Pictures, ended discussions on a contract renewal.The termination of talks, which means Walt Disney, Sony and Pixar films will not be available on Netflix after February 28 next year, sent Netflix shares down more than 8 per cent in after-market trading on Thursday.The shares failed to rally on Friday, although some analysts expressed confidence that Netflix had time to replace Starz’ content with programming and films from other suppliers.“We believe TV studios are more willing than ever to license content to Netflix and there is a lot of content still available,” said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Barclays Capital.
113;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-08-02T22:23:45Z;CBS benefits from digital distribution;;New deals with digital distributors helped CBS increase its second quarter revenues and profits.The US TV group’s revenues from content licensing and distribution were $889m for the three months ended June 30, a 21 per cent rise from the same time a year earlier.CBS is receiving about $200m from Netflix over two years, and last week it also struck a deal with Amazon that will allow the online retailer to stream the network’s content online. Analysts at Barclays Capital estimate Amazon will pay CBS $100m over less than two years.“We are capitalising on the value of our content by selling it to new distributors without taking away from established revenue streams,” said Les Moonves, CBS chief executive. “New entrants are coming into the marketplace all the time and we will look to negotiate additional prudent, online distribution deals going forward.”Dish Network, the US satellite TV provider, said this week it would spend aggressively to acquire more content, and BarCap analysts believe CBS is in talks for similar deals with companies such as Microsoft and Facebook.Last week, CBS struck a new deal that will allow Netflix to stream some of its shows in Canada and Latin America. “International expansion is a key strategic growth area for our company, and this deal represents a significant step in that process,” said Mr Moonves.None of the shows CBS is offering to Netflix and Amazon are currently on the air, leading Mr Moonves to suggest that the deals are unlikely to cannibalise TV viewers and advertisers.“At the heart of all the success is great content,” said Mr Moonves. “Our content is performing extremely well and we are increasingly distributing it in the most profitable ways with new possibilities opening up all the time.”Overall advertising revenues, which include CBS’s broadcast network, local TV stations and billboard business, were up 3 per cent.CBS’s publishing house, Simon & Schuster, was the one weak spot for the quarter, with revenues falling 3 per cent to $183m. Though digital content revenues more than doubled, they could not offset falling print sales. Publishing profitability improved, however, thanks in part to the better margins from e-books.Overall, revenues were $3.59bn for the quarter, up 8 per cent year on year. Net earnings were $395m, up more than 150 per cent.
114;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-05-04T00:58:37Z;CBS in no hurry to sell billboard business;;CBS would listen to an offer for its billboard business from JCDecaux, but is in no hurry to sell to its French outdoor advertising competitor, executives said on Tuesday.Announcing surging first-quarter profits across the company’s divisions, Les Moonves, chief executive, confirmed that CBS saw itself primarily as a content company, “but outdoor is a wonderful business”.Jean-Francois Decaux, co-chief executive of the family-led street furniture company, sparked a war of words in March when he said that he expected to have the opportunity to buy the UK operations of either CBS Outdoor or Clear Channel Outdoor this year.“We are here. He has our phone number. If he wants to make an offer, we will always listen to it,” Mr Moonves said, but he added: “We have no great intent to sell it.”CBS Outdoor revenues increased 5 per cent to $413m in the quarter, despite a 6 per cent decline in Europe. Operating income before depreciation and amortisation jumped 53 per cent to $49m.“When [Mr Decaux] does call, I will remind him that the earnings are up 53 per cent. So whatever the offer is, multiply it by plus 53,” said Joe Ianniello, chief financial officer, adding that he expected “real upside” from the company’s London Underground contract during the 2012 Olympic Games.Mr Decaux had no comment.Sumner Redstone, chairman of CBS, said the group’s first-quarter performance showed “extraordinary momentum”. Hailing Mr Moonves as “a genius”, he said he was very confident that the group would reach “even greater heights throughout the rest of the year and beyond”.Strong advertising growth and increases in non-advertising revenues offset the loss of this year’s Super Bowl broadcast rights to Fox, the company said.Mr Moonves announced that a 29 per cent increase in free cash flow would permit it to double its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share. CBS spent $251m buying back its shares in the first quarter.Mr Moonves again said that broadcast television was “still the best game in town,” singling out the core CBS channel as ”by far the most stable network in the business”. Advertising on the network was up 12 per cent excluding the effect of the Super Bowl.The advertising market looked “highly favourable” as the “upfront” season approaches, when broadcasters set out their schedule plans for advertisers, he said, with “scatter” pricing for advertising time bought in the open market “extremely hot”, up 40 per cent from last year’s upfront period.The group’s figures were also skewed by a new deal with Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting in which the two companies share revenues from NCAA basketball tournament broadcasts. Total revenues were flat at $3.51bn and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortisation rose from $294m to $576m.Mr Moonves had warm words for Netflix, the DVD rental and online video streaming service with which CBS announced a US deal in February for programming that had already aired elsewhere. That deal would generate “hundreds of millions of new dollars,” he said, with “meaningful revenue” starting in the second quarter.CBS was in serious discussions with Netflix about further deals in Latin America and Canada, he added, while competitors such as Amazon.com and Dish Network, the satellite broadcaster that bid $320m last month for Blockbuster, were also eager for its content.
115;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-05-02T22:04:22Z;Pharmaceuticals boost US sentiment;;"Deal activity lifted the healthcare sector to a multiyear high, but the wider markets closed slightly lower as the market euphoria following the news of Osama bin Laden’s death fizzled out and investors turned their attention back to more humdrum
economic matters.Teva Pharmaceuticals, a generic drugmaker with its headquarters in Israel, announced a $6.8bn deal on Monday to purchase Cephalon, the US pharmaceutical company, helping to lift the wider healthcare sector.The news sent shares in Cephalon up 4 per cent to $80.11, near its all-time high, while Teva’s American shares added 3.4 per cent to $47.27.The deal will see Teva pay $81.50 a share, outgunning a $73 a share hostile approach for Cephalon made in March by Valeant. Shares in Valeant fell 5.8 per cent to $49.58 on the news.Elsewhere in the sector, Forest Laboratories added 4.8 per cent to $34.74 and Watson Pharmaceutical rose 2.2 per cent to $63.36. The S&P healthcare index put on 1 per cent. That performance made it the best performing sector on Wall Street and took the index to a three-year high.In the wider market, the S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,361.21, weighed on primarily by energy stocks as oil prices softened. Halliburton was down 3.1 per cent to $48.92 while Schlumberger lost 2.2 per cent to $87.79. The S&P energy sector lost 1.3 per cent.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average flat at 12,806.83, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,864.08.Healthy ISM manufacturing data helped to limit losses on Wall Street. The data showed a slightly less robust manufacturing expansion in April than the previous month, but the 60.4 reading still indicated a healthy rate of growth in the sector.News on Sunday night that Osama bin Laden had been killed prompted a “risk on” trade across the world and left Wall Street higher in early trading. But the markets fell flat shortly after lunch and then began to tick lower as investors took a more even-handed look at the real market implications of the news.“Obviously there has been a little bit of euphoria and a sense of relief following bin Laden’s death, but fundamentally this news has little relevance for the equity markets,” said Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management.“The markets are more interested in fundamental factors like the success of the current earnings season,” he said.The earnings season so far has been solid. Of the 302 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings, 76 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations, compared with 73 per cent last quarter.The materials, consumer discretionary and financial sectors have been the best performing, on average beating analysts’ earnings expectations by about 13 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.The best performing stocks in the material sector have been Freeport-McMoRan and Nucor, which reported earnings 24 per cent and 41 per cent higher than expected, respectively.In the consumer discretionary area, Whirlpool and Ford Motor have reported some of the biggest “beats”, with their earnings coming in 32 per cent and 25 per cent higher than estimates. Among financials, SunTrust beat estimates by 103 per cent and Goldman Sachs by 92 per cent.Since the start of the earnings season on April 11 when Alcoa reported, the S&P materials index has risen 2.1 per cent. In the same period, the financial index has dipped 0.9 per cent and the consumer discretionary index has gained 4.2 per cent.Looking back to Monday’s session, deal activity in the materials sector also helped lift sentiment in the wider market. International Coal Group jumped 30.8 per cent to $14.43 after Arch Coal said it had agreed a $3.4bn deal with the coal producer.Arch said it would pay $14.60 per share for its smaller rival, a 32 per cent premium to the closing stock price on Friday. Shares in Arch were down 2.2 per cent to $33.53.Alcoa was up 1.3 per cent to $17.22 after the aluminium producer was raised to “buy” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs.In earnings news, Dish Network, the satellite television provider, was up
19 per cent to $29.79 as the company reported that its first-quarter profit had more than doubled, helped by a patent settlement with TiVo."
116;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-05-02T21:39:14Z;TiVo takes $500m to end patent suit;;TiVo settled a contentious patent dispute with Dish Network and EchoStar Corporation over digital recording technology on Monday, ending one of the longest-running legal battles in the media sector.TiVo, which makes digital television recorders, will receive $500m, including an initial payment of $300m. Dish, the second-largest satellite television provider in the US, will pay $290m upfront, with the remaining $10m coming from Echo­Star. Dish and EchoStar will split payment of the remaining $200m in six instalments to 2017.In return, TiVo agreed to dismiss all pending litigation between the companies and dissolve all injunctions against Dish and EchoStar.The row stems from a 2004 lawsuit in which TiVo accused Dish and EchoStar, which were then part of the same company, of illegally using its patented video recording technology for its digital video recorder.The settlement was for substantially less than had been expected. Many analysts expected Dish to settle for about $3 per DVR subscriber a month. But this settlement was worth closer to $1 per subscriber per month.Stefan Anninger, Credit Suisse analyst, said the settlement was “very attractive [for Dish], and removes an overhang that has hobbled shares for years”.The groups will exchange some patent licences as part of the settlement, and have agreed to collaborate in future.“The results of TiVo’s formidable intellectual property enforcement programme speak for themselves and, consequently, we are pleased to put this litigation behind us and move forward,” said Charles Ergen, chief executive of Dish and chairman of EchoStar.“We are extremely pleased to reach an agreement with Dish Network and EchoStar, which recognises the value of our intellectual property,” said Tom Rogers, TiVo chief executive. “The compensation from this settlement, including the resulting reduction in legal expenditures, puts TiVo in an enviable financial and strategic position.”Because the dispute with Dish Network and EchoStar has been unresolved for so long, TiVo has struggled to capitalise on its patent portfolio.Monday’s settlement follows a complicated ruling two weeks ago in which an appeals court ruled that Dish and EchoStar had infringed on TiVo’s patents, but left the door open for further appeals that would have taken at least another year to settle.Because the settlement came on the heels of that complex ruling, the resolution of the case was not necessarily a good thing for patent law, said Richard Epstein, professor at the University of Chicago Law School.“The slow and dilatory nature of the patent protection is yet another gratuitous weakening of the patent system,” he said. “Not a good show in my view.”
117;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Plunge in DVD sales poses challenge for Hollywood;;Sales of new DVDs have collapsed, falling 20 per cent in a year and presenting a significant challenge for Hollywood film studios, according to figures released on Monday.Worryingly for Hollywood, which has been grappling with many of the same issues that decimated the music industry, the decline of DVD sales, once the film industry’s biggest revenue generator, has not been offset by other areas.Total sales from film-related “packaged goods”, which include DVD and Blu-ray discs, fell from about $2.6bn to $2.1bn in the US, according to the Digital Entertainment Group, which represents film studios and consumer electronics companies. The DEG said the decline was related to the success of films released in the period, with the first quarter of 2010 having a stronger selection of films than the start of 2011.However, the scale of the decline will cause anxiety in Hollywood, where technology continues to wreak havoc on established business models and revenue streams.The DEG figures suggest consumers are shifting their spending away from buying films in favour of streaming them online or watching them via film subscription services such as, Netflix.Spending on renting DVDs in physical stores, such as Blockbuster, also collapsed, falling 36 per cent in the first quarter to $440m, according to the DEG.Blockbuster was recently taken out of bankruptcy protection when its assets were acquired by Dish Network, the satellite TV group.Spending on streaming and subscription services had risen 33 per cent to $523m in the period, the DEG said. “The industry has proved resilient, with modest gains posted in a number of key areas,” the organisation said.“The home entertainment business is morphing, as increased enhancements to technologies like Blu-ray Disc, Blu-ray 3D and new digital service offerings are made available.”Total spending on home entertainment, which includes DVD and Blu-ray rentals and sales, together with electronic downloading, fell 10 per cent to $4.7bn.Several studios are signing up to release their films on an on-demand basis in the home just two months after they have been screened in cinemas.The scheme, which is being promoted by DirecTV, the pay-TV group, has caused consternation among cinema chains and some film directors.
118;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-04-06T21:10:35Z;Tech stocks lift Wall Street higher;;Cisco Systems led the gains in the technology sector after a candid admission of management failures led to hopes of a turnround. But losses in the materials and energy sectors weighed on Wall Street, leaving the wider indices only slightly higher in the session.Shares in the internet equipment company were up 4.9 per cent to $18.07 after John Chambers, chief executive, made a rare admission of failure and signalled a shake-up to refocus Cisco on its most important markets.He said that the company’s strategy was “sound”, but added that they had been slow to make decisions and had “lost the accountability that has been a hallmark of our ability to execute consistently for our customers”.Cisco’s stock has fallen 27 per cent since the start of 2010 at a time when the Nasdaq Composite has risen by 23.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the technology sector, semiconductor stocks saw gains. These were led by Broadcom, the chipmaker, which added 3.9 per cent to $39.95 after Oppenheimer upgraded its rating on the stock from “perform” to “outperform”, citing the growth in wireless markets and networking.This helped related semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices was up 4 per cent to $8.43, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose 1.5 per cent, adding to the 2.3 per cent gain in the previous session. Sentiment in the sector continued to be high following Texas Instruments’ agreed $6.5bn deal to acquire National Semiconductor.Overall, the S&P technology sector was up 0.7 per cent, the best performing S&P sub-index. The benchmark S&P 500 was only up 0.2 per cent at 1,335.54.In the energy sector, oilfield service stocks were the worst performing. Cameron International lost 2.5 per cent to $55.30 while Halliburton fell 2.6 per cent to $48.41. The S&P energy sector was 0.9 per cent softer.In the materials sector, it was coal miners that suffered the most as investor confidence in global demand took a turn. Massey Energy fell 3.5 per cent to $67.59 while Peabody Energy declined 3.7 per cent to $69.56.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite were up 0.3 per cent to 12,427.13 and 2,799.82 respectively.The S&P 500 index has now added 6.2 per cent this year boosted by a sense that the fundamentals of the US economy are improving. “Macro outlook in the US is slightly more positive compared to the past few quarters. Economic sentiment in Europe remains choppy, but trends appear to be stabilising,” said analysts at Citi Investment Research.Technical analysts at JPMorgan Securities argued that in the short term the S&P was likely to see highs of 1,344, while in the second quarter the index was likely to trade between 1,353 and 1,367.Over the year the S&P 500 would face a ceiling of between 1,420 and 1,440, they argued, suggesting the S&P could still rise a further 7.8 per cent this year at its peak, on top of the 6.2 per cent added already.In corporate news, shares in Monsanto lost ground after the world’s largest seed company by revenues reported disappointing revenues, sending the shares down 5.7 per cent to $69.16. But the company also beat estimates for its earnings per share and confirmed guidance for the year.American Superconductor tumbled 41.6 per cent to $14.47 after the maker of wind turbine components and transmission lines said it expected to report a loss for the fiscal fourth quarter after Sinovel Wind Group refused to accept shipments.Cephalon was down 0.5 per cent to $77.02 after the drugmaker rejected the $5.7bn bid offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, saying that the offer undervalued the company.Dish Network, the satellite television provider, was fractionally higher at $24.32 after it won an auction to buy the bankrupt Blockbuster film rental chain for $320m. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy protection in September with debt of more than $1.4bn and assets of $1bn.Transatlantic Holdings added 2.8 per cent to $50.60 after the reinsurer formerly owned by American International Group said that its first-quarter catastrophes cost was $355m, including about $240m from last month’s Japanese earthquake and tsunami.Optical networking stocks saw gains. JDS Uniphase added 2.3 per cent to $19.58 while Oclaro rose 7.6 per cent to $11.72.
119;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-04-06T12:25:54Z;Dish Network to buy Blockbuster for $320m;;Dish Network, the satellite television provider, will acquire bankrupt video rental chain Blockbuster in a $320m deal that marks the end of an era for home entertainment.Blockbuster once dominated the home video and DVD rental market in the US but has lost ground to mail-order DVD services such as Netflix, online offerings from Apple and others, and on-demand options from cable and satellite providers, including Dish Network.In September it filed for bankruptcy protection with debt of more than $1.4bn and assets of $1bn. Despite a last-ditch marketing effort that emphasised its own mail-order and streaming options, which have failed to catch on, the company continued to close stores.Dish won the bankruptcy auction with a bid valued at $320m. After closing costs and adjustments for cash and inventory, Dish Network expects to pay about $228m, and said the deal would close in the second quarter.In the bankruptcy auction, which took place on Tuesday in New York, Dish faced competition from activist investor Carl Icahn, who already owns a large block of Blockbuster senior notes. Also bidding was a group of creditors known as Cobalt Video, which included Monarch Alternative Capital, according to the New York Times.In announcing the deal, Dish Network made it sound as if it might seek to preserve the Blockbuster brand.“With its more than 1,700 store locations, a highly recognisable brand and multiple methods of delivery, Blockbuster will complement our existing video offerings while presenting cross-marketing and service extension opportunities for Dish Network,” said Tom Cullen, executive vice president of sales, marketing and programming for Dish Network.“While Blockbuster’s business faces significant challenges, we look forward to working with its employees to re-establish Blockbuster’s brand as a leader in video entertainment.”But given the troubles Blockbuster has faced in recent years, analysts were not certain what Dish Network, led by billionaire founder Charles Ergen, would do with the struggling brand.“It is not yet clear what Ergen might do with Blockbuster,” Credit Suisse analysts Stefan Anninger and Ashton Ngwena wrote in a note last week after Dish’s interest was made public.“But the company does have a well-recognised brand and Ergen could attempt to reorganise the company into a Netflix-like entity which would stream video content while continuing with DVD rentals, [or] offer Blockbuster services for a fee to current and future Dish [subscribers] in his efforts to fight churn and improve his current offering.”
120;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-04-01T19:26:00Z;Icahn makes bid for Blockbuster;;Carl Icahn, the activist investor, has submitted a $300m bid to take Blockbuster out of bankruptcy, according to a person familiar with the situation.The chain used to dominate the video and DVD rental market but has struggled to adjust to the advent of subscription DVD services, such as Netflix, kiosk operators such as Redbox and digital downloads.It sought bankruptcy protection last September when it said that it had gross debt of $1.46bn and assets of $1bn. Since then, more of Blockbuster’s 5,000 stores have closed while its rivals, namely Netflix, have continued to expand.Mr Icahn is likely to face competition for Blockbuster: the Wall Street Journal reported on its website on Friday that Charlie Ergen, the billionaire behind Dish Network, the satellite television company, had submitted a bid of about $290m.It also emerged this week that SK Telecom, South Korea’s largest wireless carrier, is considering bidding for the video rental chain, in an effort to strengthen its content development, according to a person close to the company.Mr Icahn amassed a large position in Blockbuster debt during 2010 and owns about a third of the company’s senior notes. The company is one of several film industry investments by Mr Icahn, who also owns large stakes in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lions Gate Entertainment, the company behind the Mad Men seriesHe recently warned that another market downturn could be in the offing, telling the Financial Times that “you’ve got to be myopic if you’re not at least concerned that there might be a major correction”.The warning came as Mr Icahn told outside investors in his Icahn Partners hedge fund that their money was no longer required.However, his bearish views of the market have not deterred him from pursuing Blockbuster.A US federal bankruptcy court judge recently approved the sale of the company so that it could avoid liquidation. The company agreed to sell itself to a group of creditors for about $290m in a so-called “stalking horse” bid as a way of drawing more offers.The stalking horse bid was submitted by a group of hedge funds: Monarch Alternative Capital, Owl Creek Asset Management, Stonehill Capital Management and Värde Partners.The film industry will be watching the progress of the Blockbuster auction with great interest. The chain was formerly one of its biggest customers and still owes money to Summit Entertainment, the company behind the Twilight series of movies.Summit recently filed a legal action against Blockbuster, alleging that it is owned about $10m for Blu-ray and traditional DVDs of its movies including Eclipse and Red.
121;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2011-02-14T21:08:35Z;EchoStar agrees $1.3bn merger;;EchoStar, which makes tele­vision set-top boxes and provides satellite services, has agreed to acquire Hughes Communications, a provider of broadband satellite services for businesses, for $1.33bn.The deal brings fulfilment to a merger that was first proposed nearly a decade ago. In 2002, EchoStar and Hughes proposed to merge at a much higher valuation but were blocked by the Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice over antitrust concerns.Hughes’ shareholders will receive $60.70 per share without interest, a 31 per cent premium over Hughes’ share price on January 19, the day before news of a possible takeover surfaced. Including debt, the deal is valued at about $2bn.Barclays Capital advised Hughes on the deal, and several other suitors looked at the company in recent weeks.Apollo Management, the majority shareholder of Hughes’ outstanding stock, approved the transaction. Analysts said there was little risk that regulators would block the deal today.EchoStar works closely with Dish Network, the US satellite television provider, which it spun off in 2008. Hughes has satellite properties, but is better known for providing broadband capacity to businesses.Bernstein Research senior analyst Craig Moffett said the acquisition was partly a hedge against any potential weakening in the market for satellite services for TV.“It is an acknowledgement that [EchoStar’s] core satellite business is in jeopardy without a broadband component,” said Mr Moffett.Charles Ergen, founder and chairman of EchoStar and chief executive of Dish, has been acquisitive lately. Earlier this month, Dish agreed to purchase DBSD North America, another satellite company, for $1bn.“He seems to be diversifying his business and broadening it,” said Tom Champion, a Credit Suisse analyst. “His eggs are very much in one basket right now and it’s a vulnerable one.”In a research note, Mr Champion said the deal made sense for several reasons. “It gives [Mr] Ergen a consumer broadband solution that can be bundled with Dish’s video product,” he said, adding that Hughes will bring enterprise and international market share to EchoStar. “And [Hughes’] hardware networking product fits well with [EchoStar’s] set-top box business.”EchoStar shares were up 1 per cent at $30.14, while Hughes shares slipped nearly 4 per cent to $59.46.
122;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2010-10-07T06:00:24Z;Logitech launches Google TV at $300;;Logitech has set a benchmark price of $300 for the new Google TV service, with the official launch of its Revue set-top box and controller.That’s three times the price of Apple TV, but the two services are very different in features and approach, with Google TV offering much tighter integration with existing TV channels.The Logitech launch in San Francisco came ahead of Sony’s unveiling of its version of Google TV in New York next week, where it is expected to be shown integrated into a TV set and Blu-ray player. There was no news of when Google TV would be available overseas from Logitech or Google executives.Logitech is offering a set-top box that sits between a cable or satellite receiver and the TV. An HDMI cable is connected from the receiver to the Revue and then another HDMI cable links the Revue to the TV.This allows Logitech to overlay Google’s service and provide picture-in-picture options for viewing TV programming and web content.The Revue comes with a wireless keyboard with a trackpad that act as a remote. The controller incorporates Logitech’s Harmony technology, enabling it as a universal remote.Accessories include a $150 Logitech TV cam, offering video conferencing from within Google TV, and a $130 mini-controller.Dish Network subscribers will be able to buy the Revue and controller for a discounted $179 and enjoy tighter integration, with Google TV’s universal search function also able to find content stored on their DVRs.Features that everyone can enjoy include a search and browser interface that allows content to be found on local devices, TV channel listings and across the web. Music, photos and videos from PCs on a home network can be streamed on the TV and anything being watched on a smartphone can be switched over to the TV screen. Google TV will feature apps from the Android Market from early 2011 and Google on Monday announced a number of content partners providing services optimised for Google TV at launch.Logitech said its system was compatible with 60m HDTVs in the US and any set-top box with an HDMI connection. The Revue should be available by the end of October and we plan a full review before then.
123;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2010-10-04T23:04:40Z;Google TV claims key allies;;Google has announced that top media companies will back its assault on the living room with this month’s US launch of Google TV.NBC Universal, Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting are among television industry players bringing enhanced versions of channels to the TV-meets-the-web product. PC peripherals maker Logitech launches its version of Google TV – a special set-top box and remote – in San Francisco on Wednesday. Sony next week shows Google TV integrated in a TV and Blu-ray player at a New York launch.Google has made huge efforts to get retailers, tech companies, network operators and media partners to support its new platform, which could open up TV to other forms of advertising.Its unveiling in May saw an unprecedented gathering of chief executives, with those of Google, Adobe, Best Buy, Dish Network, Intel, Logitech and Sony on stage voicing support.Google said on Monday Turner Broadcasting had optimised its TBS, TNT, CNN, Cartoon Network and Adult Swim channels for Google TV. NBC Universal would introduce CNBC Real-Time, an application combining news feeds and share prices with the regular financial TV channel.Time Warner’s HBO will enable access to hundreds of programming hours through an enhanced HBO GO website. The National Basketball Association has built NBA Game Time offering real-time game scores and latest highlights.Google launched a website to promote Google TV and announced online services including Twitter, Pandora internet radio and Napster music streaming would optimise content for the big screen.Google TV attempts to integrate the web with TV programming for sets with access to an internet connection and will feature a remote with a keyboard and touchpad. An app downloaded on to an Android phone can also control it.A Google search onscreen for a show such as HBO’s Boardwalk Empire can bring up results including a link to the show itself on the TV programme guide, a web page or a link to the location where it was recorded on a DVR.Google’s approach is more ambitious than that of Apple, which relaunched its Apple TV product this month as a $100 palm-sized set-top box. Apple TV offers movies and TV shows from its iTunes store, web services such as Netflix and YouTube and streaming content from computers on a home network such as photos and iTunes music. It does not mix this content with live television. Google TV’s direct rivals will be cable and telecom operators able to mix web content with programming.
124;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2010-07-26T07:50:30Z;Pace gets US triple-play with $475m 2Wire buy;;Pace has announced a proposed $475m acquisition of Silicon Valley’s 2Wire, in a move that will add telecom companies to the number-one set-top box maker’s existing cable and satellite customers in the US.Pace going for a triple-play of industries to serve is another sign of the major strategic shifts taking place as different sectors converge on delivering content and services to consumers over the internet.Earlier indications of this included Walmart buying Vudu‘s “over-the-top” internet video service, Sonic Solutions buying DivX , Sigma Designs acquiring CopperGate and Google TV bringing together Google, Intel, Sony, Logitech, Dish Network and Best Buy with a new vision of “smart TV”.Pace’s move to acquire 2Wire will mean it has all bases covered in terms of serving the traditional industries as they compete against new internet rivals.Pace said the addition of 2Wire would make it the number one provider of telco residential gateway devices in the US and the number three globally.You won’t have seen 2Wire’s products in any stores. While the likes of Netgear and Cisco’s Linksys have sold consumers routers to set-up Wi-Fi networks in their homes, 2Wire has focused on providing its routers directly to telcos. They issue them to customers as they sign up for internet services.2Wire’s “residential gateway” routers are becoming ever more sophisticated, with add-ons that can provide network storage, internet telephony and content services.Cisco is understood to have considered an offer for the company in the past and China’s Huawei more recently, but the Pace deal makes more strategic sense.AT&T is 2Wire’s biggest customer – its broadband gateways help to deliver AT&T’s U-verse services such as multiroom HD TV, high-speed broadband and telephony. AT&T also has a stake in the company, as part of a consortium of investors including Alcatel-Lucent, Telmex, Oak Investment Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, and Technology Crossover Ventures.“This acquisition will strengthen our Americas business, extending Pace’s US market coverage with entry into the tier one telco market,” said Neil Gaydon, Pace chief executive, in a statement.“2Wire’s software and gateway expertise will further drive development of our home entertainment convergence strategy.”The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory consents and Pace and 2Wire shareholder approval. 2Wire reported sales worth $667m last year and profits before tax of $29m. Pace expects the acquisition “to be earnings and cashflow enhancing …in the first full financial year of ownership”.Pace also unveiled first-half earnings figures on Monday. The world’s biggest supplier of digital set top boxes said sales grew 21 per cent on a year ago to £635m and profits before tax were up 46 per cent at £45m.
125;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2010-07-05T22:24:38Z;Apple likely to spoil Sun Valley’s summer;;Deal talk used to dominate the unofficial agenda of Sun Valley, the annual summer gathering of media, tech and finance moguls.Capital Cities/ABC’s merger with Disney in 1996 and the imminent takeover of NBC Universal by Comcast were both ideas seeded at the exclusive conference sponsored by Allen & Co, the boutique media investment bank.But this week, the chatter will centre on the one invited guest not yet expected to attend – Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple.As late as last week, Mr Jobs had told some associates he planned to skip the event, while relaying to others that he was “leaning against” attending, but was undecided.He has only attended twice in the last 27 years.Ketchum, Idaho, is once a year transformed from being a sleepy ski resort town into a billionaires’ summer camp.But the mood this year will also be decidedly less relaxed than at some previous gatherings. The meeting is sure to witness skirmishes in a crucial battle to shape the media world for the next decade.Mr Jobs is in an arms race with Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, for the future of mobile media and television.Apple’s iPhones and iPad digital tablet devices compete for market share with dozens of devices that run Google’s Android software platform.The fate of a constellation of media executives, whose companies have recovered somewhat from a severe advertising drought last year, rests on the outcome of the war.“The Apple versus Google fight is now a media fight,” said one senior media executive expected to attend the conference. “It’s a big deal and it’s on everybody’s mind.”Chief executives attending the meeting include Rupert Murdoch of News Corp, Barry Diller of IAC, Robert Iger of Disney, and Brian Roberts of Comcast.The pivotal role content plays in the success of both Apple and Google has given the media industry leverage in the platform war. But the economics of digital media in an Apple or Google-dominated future remain under pressure.“The Apple store has been about 99 cents music and they’re trying to drive the price [of films and TV programmes] down,” the senior executive said. “Google starts at zero.”Media companies have favoured Apple’s closed system, which recalls the “walled garden” business model of AOL, when access to entertainment and news required signing up for the service – and revenues to content companies were guaranteed.The lustre of the iPad has also captured the attention of media executives, who have tended to have held off adopting new technology in their personal lives.“A lot of media guys who never got it are using the iPad,” one media executive said.“It’s a different kind of interest than I have ever seen before.”Google, whose mission is to organise the world’s information and to generate income from advertising against content, prefers an open system.Although Mr Murdoch spent last year waging a public relations offensive against Google for acting like a “content kleptomaniac,” his attitude against the group has softened, said one executive close to the company.News Corp has been in talks with Mr Schmidt about forming pay models for news, he added.Google has also stepped up its war with Apple with the debut of Google TV, software which connects television to the vast libraries of the internet.Google TV – which has attracted the backing of Sony, Adobe, Intel and Dish Network – has pushed Apple to rethink its lacklustre television technology, according to executives in contact with Apple.Both companies have failed to rally any substantial support for TV initiatives from content companies.But Sun Valley would not maintain its mystique without at least one tidbit of deal speculation.Disney denied in late May that it was actively seeking a buyer for its ABC television network and stations – but the talk has not died down, said one media executive.Additional reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco
126;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2010-05-20T23:08:40Z;Google plans to hit small screens;;Google has unveiled Google TV and announced a powerful array of allies in consumer electronics, retail and broadcast for its assault on the living room.The Silicon Valley company said on Thursday it would launch a service in the autumn that includes Google Search and merges applications and a web browser with television programming through a set-top box or integrated TV.Following a demonstration at Google’s developer conference in San Francisco, Eric Schmidt, chief executive, received strong industry backing for the service as he was joined on stage by the heads of Adobe, BestBuy, Dish Network, Intel, Logitech and Sony.Mr Schmidt said it had taken many years and the advent of software and services such as cloud computing to make internet TV possible.“There was one other thing we needed and that turned out to be fundamental. We needed a whole ecosystem of partners,” he said.Sony is to launch a line-up of televisions and Blu-ray players in the autumn that include Google’s Android operating system and Chrome browser, powered by Intel’s Atom chip.Logitech plans to introduce a set-top box with a remote control and integrated keyboard at the same time.Charlie Ergen, Dish Network chief executive, said the software would allow its satellite subscribers to search across TV programming, their digital video recorder and the web to find related content.Shares in Tivo, which sells DVRs and licenses its programme guide software, fell 6 per cent on the news.The US launches – international ones are expected in 2011 – represent a concerted effort by the partners to grab market share in internet-connected TVs, which were introduced in large numbers at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January.“I think there is going to be an enormous consumer appetite . . . it opens up an entirely new category,” Brian Dunn, Best Buy chief executive, told a news conference.Intel said last week that it had seen explosive demand for its Atom microprocessors from set-top box and TV makers and Paul Otellini, chief executive, described the advent of “Smart TV” as the biggest broadcast revolution since the introduction of colour.“The Google, Sony and Logitech relationship is the earliest, deepest and best we’ve seen so far,” he told reporters.“What I see in the pipeline are other versions, but they don’t have the deep integration of the web and broadcast that this content has, so we’re super excited.”Google and its partners said the service would be free and prices for Sony’s TV and Logitech’s box would be announced at a later date.Sir Howard Stringer, president of Sony, said its Bravia internet video link for its TVs would be maintained, but Google TV was the future, even though Sony lacked exclusivity with the technology.“We have about a six-month lead [over our competitors], we are the first out of the box and it’s up to us to take advantage otherwise everyone else will have a chance to develop a system similarly,” he said.
127;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2010-05-18T15:39:50Z;Valley View: There’ll be no escaping the home entertainment revolution;;"You can seal up the letterbox and lock all the doors, but it won’t help you resist the next digital revolution invading your home.Technology companies, retailers, content makers and service providers are fighting over the digital keys to the house, but their mode of entry will be subtle and largely invisible to the consumer.Unlike burglars, they are not out to ransack the place. They aim to slide in unnoticed through vents and ducts or wirelessly. They might rearrange the furniture a little and the point of entry will be varied. Your best chance of a glimpse of them will be on a TV monitor or an iPad-like tablet device.A first encounter with the culprits may be at a Best Buy store. The world’s largest consumer electronics retailer said in March it was
re-engineering its stores to sell what it described as higher-value “invisible” digital products.The thinking is that TVs and computers are becoming commoditised items, while services can command a premium. Selling a portable media player with a music subscription service installed or a DVD player with movies can add value to the purchase.Sonic Solutions, which digitises content for Hollywood studios and other media companies, is working with Best Buy and other retailers and content owners to digitise media in every conceivable format so it can be streamed from the cloud to any device. Its CinemaNow movie service is also offered on network-enabled digital video recorders (DVRs) and Blu-ray players.Walmart bought the Vudu digital media service in February to create a digital storefront for content.As well as Blu-ray players, there are set-top boxes, storage devices and games consoles delivering content over the internet to the TV, from Flickr photos and Pandora radio to Netflix movie streaming.These are known as “over the top” (OTT) services, ones that leap over the established cable and satellite players with their content.All the big TV makers are also integrating such services directly into their sets to differentiate their products and adding features such as Skype videoconferencing. Sony is expected to announce an Android-based internet TV next week with Intel chips inside.The established market participants are fighting back with their own added-value services to retain customers. Comcast, a cable provider, launched TV Everywhere last year, allowing access to programming online through a PC, in addition to its set-top box.Dish Network, the satellite service, bought Sling Media and integrated its technology into digital video recorders to allow content to be viewed remotely on mobile devices and PCs anywhere.Last month, Broadcom gave me a demonstration of some tablet devices based on its chips. They can act as an enlarged touch-screen remote control, showing a TV guide grid and allowing programmes to be previewed and then selected for the main screen.The idea is that service providers could give them away to subscribers and later add services, such as home automation controls, which can earn extra revenues and increase their hold on their customers.Motorola and NDS, which make set-top boxes and provide services for cable and satellite, have shown me user interfaces that contain the best of OTT internet services, including social features, such as Facebook and Twitter. They can also offer greater personalisation because of the knowledge that service providers have of their customers’ behaviour.All this is part of a battle over the control centre for the digital home. Scott McGregor, Broadcom chief executive, told me he could make a case for every market participant – from makers of standard cable set-top boxes, TVs, and games consoles, to network storage suppliers, remote control makers and even cellphone vendors – to make theirs the main device in the home.A Silicon Valley company, 2Wire, showed me in a demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show in January how their modems for telecoms carriers had developed into home gateways offering a variety of bolt-on services.Modules can now be added to extend cellphone coverage in the home, add home automation and security systems or provide a server that aggregates all digital media content and also draws from the cloud. 2Wire sees its home gateways as obviating the need for set-top boxes in future.Finally, wireless and wired solutions are fighting it out for the best way to route all of this wonderful broadband content around the home. The idea is to establish carrier-grade service throughout the house, where consumers now rely on flaky Wi-Fi and limited cabling.The International Telecommunication Union ratified a new “G.hn standard” for wired home networking last October. Backed by the non-profit trade group, HomeGrid Forum, the technology can run seamlessly over phone lines, powerlines and co-axial cable. However, backers of HomePlug AV and MoCa (multimedia over cable) technologies have criticised the standard.In wireless, the Wi-Fi and WiGig Alliances announced a co-operation agreement this week to develop multi-gigabit technology for wireless high-definition video in the home, competing with existing WirelessHD and WHDI technologies.As new network technologies and wireless video remove the need for tangles of cables behind the TV, these invisible forces at work could gather and explode our existing concepts of how homes are designed and function for our entertainment.While the TV may hang on a wall in the future, the Blu-ray player could be wedged under the coffee table, the DVR could be in the closet and the tablet remote-control would at last be too big to lose down the back of the sofa."
128;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2010-03-10T02:19:59Z;TV groups urge action after Oscars fee drama;;A group of 14 US pay-TV service companies on Tuesday night asked US regulators to prevent a repeat of the breakdown in fee negotiations that led Walt Disney to block millions of viewers from watching the Oscars broadcast on television.Ahead of tense negotiations with Disney this summer, Time Warner Cable is leading a coalition of pay-TV providers to prevent programmers such as Disney, owner of the ESPN cable sports network and ABC television stations, or News Corp’s Fox from pulling their television signals during programme carriage negotiations.A Time Warner Cable spokeswoman said the group was “asking the [Federal Communications Commission] to address skyrocketing consumer costs by establishing a new framework for resolving retransmission consent disputes and ensuring that consumers are not caught in the middle”.Disney pulled its ABC TV station from 3m New York subscribers of Cablevision’s service last Sunday but restored the channel after reaching a tentative agreement under political pressure shortly after the broadcast of the 82nd Academy Awards.The group is expected to seek new arbitration rules if companies fail to reach commercial agreements on their own.The coalition cuts across systems and platforms, bringing together rivals that include DirecTV, Dish Network, Verizon, Cablevision and Charter, according to one person familiar with the matter.Public interest groups and industry organisations are also expected to jointly petition regulators.Comcast, the nation’s largest cable operator, is not expected to take part as its deal to take control of NBC Universal faces regulatory review.Disney’s distribution contract with Time Warner Cable expires on September 1 and is more expansive than its discussions with Cablevision.The Time Warner Cable negotiations will include renewals for its broad portfolio of ABC TV stations and cable networks including ESPN across the cable group’s 13m US customers.Tensions underscore the changing economics of the US television business. Station owners such as Disney have historically given away channels in exchange for launching cable networks such as ESPN.But TV station owners, eyeing the dual revenue streams of fees and advertising of pay-TV networks, have begun demanding fees for carriage of its free-to-air TV stations to offset declines in advertising revenue and viewership as consumers migrate to pay-TV channels and online video services such as Google’s YouTube.
129;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2010-03-04T07:08:24Z;Tivo premieres DVRs with added web content;;"My TiVo digital video recorder has been gathering dust for the past couple of years since I replaced it with free DVRs from Dish Network that did more or less the same thing and had bigger capacities.But TiVo is giving current and former users a reason to consider buying its boxes anew with the launch of its Premiere and Premiere XL units on Wednesday.They mark a major shift by TiVo to differentiate itself from growing competition – it is combining its service for traditional TV broadcasts with aggregation of internet video and audio content.This is a welcome blending of regular TV services with the so-called “over the top” online content currently aggregated by services such as Boxee.It could make TiVo seem relevant again to the extent of making it the centre of the TV viewer’s experience.“TiVo Premiere is your new cable box, it’s your movie box, it’s your web box, and music box; it’s the one box that can give you access to almost anything you want, whenever you want it,” said Tom Rogers, TiVo chief executive, in a statement.At $300 for the basic Premiere version, which includes a 320Gb hard drive and HD recording,Tivo seems to be pricing things right as well – previous HD TiVos have been beyond most people’s budgets.TiVo is leveraging its powerful search function with the Premiere to find not just relevant TV programmes but also internet content for viewers such as YouTube videos or movies from Netflix, Amazon Video On Demand, or Blockbuster On Demand.Music from Pandora Radio and internet channels from FrameChannel will also be available, in a similar offering to that of Roku’s sub-$100 streaming device and the Popbox.The Premiere and Premiere XL, which has a one-terabyte drive and costs $500, will be available in April. A $13 monthly fee for the TiVo listing service still applies."
130;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2009-11-09T22:14:00Z;US stocks rally on deals;;"Deal activity by companies from chocolate makers to a nuclear submarine manufacturer buoyed Wall Street confidence on Monday, lifting US stocks after last week’s strong gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2 per cent at 10,226.94, its highest level since October last year.The S&P 500 gained 2.2 per cent to 1,093.08 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 2 per cent at 2,154.06.In spite of volatile trading, Wall Street closed higher every day last week, shrugging off Friday’s data that showed a spike in unemployment.A rally in the technology sector after Cisco’s results gave the Nasdaq its biggest daily gain since July.“The market was probably too short going into those payroll numbers and the fact that there wasn’t a downside on Friday has injected some confidence,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.After an indicative offer two months ago, Kraft launched a formal hostile bid for Cadbury on Monday, valuing the UK company at £9.8bn ($16.4bn).The terms were the same as the original offer but, due to the fall in Kraft’s share price, the implied value of the latest bid was slightly lower. Cadbury rejected the offer as “derisory”.While the deal activity boosted market sentiment, Kraft was the only Dow company to end the day in negative territory, losing 0.9 per cent to $26.53. Cadbury shares edged up in London.In other deals, Northrop Grumman, one of the largest US defence contractors, agreed to sell TASC, its advisory services unit, for $1.65bn to private equity groups General Atlantic and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.The sale is the latest sign of a revival in leveraged buy-outs. Northrop rose 3 per cent to $53.93.Reports also revealed that Comcast was planning to finalise a deal to buy a controlling stake in NBC Universal from General Electric by next Monday. The acquisition would create one of the US’s largest media companies and values NBC Universal at about $30bn.Comcast rose 3.8 per cent to $15.15 and General Electricgained 3.4 per cent to $15.85.A pledge by the G20 over the weekend to keep stimulus programmes in place until the recovery was more certain added to the market’s optimism and boosted financial stocks. Bank of Americawas up 4.8 per cent to $15.77 and Citigroup gained 3.2 per cent to $4.19.Elsewhere in the banking sector, East West Bancorpsurged 55 per cent to $13.41 after the California-based bank purchased its main rival United Commercial Bank (UCB), which was seized by regulators last week.UCB, based in San Francisco, was the 120th bank to fail this year and was estimated to have assets worth $11.2bn. Morgan Stanley analysts welcomed the deal, upgrading East West from “equal-weight” to “overweight”.The G20 assurances pushed gold to fresh highs and boosted other metal prices. ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, was raised from “neutral” to “buy” by MF Global, pushing the shares 4.9 per cent higher to $36.82.United States Steel gained 3.6 per cent to $38.11 and the S&P Materials sector was up 3.2 per cent.Global sales figures from McDonald’s sent shares in the fast food chain up 1.5 per cent to $62.64.Total like-for-like sales rose 3.3 per cent in October, helped by strong demand from Europe. The gains help to offset a 0.1 per cent decline in US sales – the first monthly decline in the fast food retailer’s home market since March 2008.Shares in RadioShack, the electronics retailer, were set to hit their highest level for two years after jumping 14.3 per cent to $20.27. The chain announced plans to sell versions of Apple’s iPhone later this month.Dish Network rose 5.2 per cent to $20.14 after the company, America’s second-largest satellite TV provider, beat Wall Street forecasts.Trex, the deckings and railings maker, was one of the market’s few casualties.Its shares fell 2.5 per cent to $16.86 after the group posted a quarterly loss due to an impairment charge and continued weakness
in the home construction sector."
131;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2009-08-27T02:43:52Z;TiVo extends legal action to AT&T and Verizon;;TiVo stepped up its efforts to defend a core part of the technology behind its digital video recorder on Wednesday as it sued AT&T and Verizon over their own fledgling television services.The complaints, filed in federal court in the eastern district of Texas, echo similar cases TiVo brought previously against Dish Network and EchoStar, the two largest satellite television companies in the US. TiVo won those cases, though both are now under appeal. Also, the US Patent and Trademark Office has begun a re-examination of the key patent behind TiVo’s time-shifting service, which allows users to digitally record television programmes.AT&T and Verizon, the two largest telecoms companies in the US, have invested heavily to build their own multi-channel television services – Verizon through its FiOS service, which has nearly 2m customers, and AT&T with a service called U-verse.TiVo argued in its complaints that these services infringed on three of its patents, including ones for a “multimedia time-warping system” and a “system for time-shifting multimedia content streams.”The telecoms groups did not immediately respond to the complaints.
132;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2009-06-03T20:35:14Z;Wall Street dips on Bernanke warning;;Wall Street stocks declined on Wednesday as oil prices slid and investors reacted to mixed data on the economy and a warning from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.Testifying before the House Budget Committee, Mr Bernanke said the US budget deficit threatened US financial stability and said the government could not continue indefinitely to borrow at the current rate to finance the shortfall.“Unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term, we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth. Maintaining the confidence of the financial markets requires that we, as a nation, begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance,” he said.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 index was down 1.4 per cent at 931.79, above its lows for the day, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.6 per cent lower at 1,825.92.

133;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2009-02-17T13:31:19Z;Malone comes to aid of Sirius;;John Malone’s Liberty Media offered $250m in a senior secured loan on Tuesday as the first step in a “multi-stage” deal to rescue Sirius XM ahead of an imminent debt deadline, the companies said in a statement.The deal offered by Liberty involves a debt for equity swap and leaves Mr Malone’s group, which controls DirecTV, the US satellite television company, with a “meaningful” stake in Sirius, one person familiar with the satellite radio group’s discussions said ahead of the deal.The $530m transaction will occur in two phases beginning with Tuesday’s infusion which is part of a larger $280m senior secured loan. That will be used for Sirius XM to repay $171.6m of its debt that comes due on Tuesday, with the balance to cover working capital and transaction costs. The loan bears a 15 per cent interest rate that will mature in December 2012.In the second phase of the deal Liberty will provide a $150m loan to XM Satellite Radio and will offer to purchase up to $100m of its outstanding loans. At that point Sirius will issue Liberty 12.5m shares of preferred convertible stock and Liberty will take seats on the Sirius board of directors.”We are pleased to have come to this agreement with Liberty Media, particularly in light of today’s challenging credit markets,” Mel Karmazin, Sirius’s chief executive said in a statement.Liberty’s offer aims to thwart the advances of Charlie Ergen, chief executive of EchoStar and Dish Communications, the US satellite broadcasters, which offered to buy Sirius last year.Mr Ergen’s offer was rebuffed but since then he has accumulated Sirius’s debt and now owns a $175m tranche that comes due on Tuesday. Sirius told investors last week it would need to file for bankruptcy protection if it could not restructure its debt by Tuesday’s deadline. The group owes $3.25bn, with $1bn due this year.Creditors voiced concern over the weekend. Edward Weisfelner, a Brown Rudnick bankruptcy lawyer representing holders of about $173m of Sirius debt, warned that bondholders could seek to remove Sirius executives should it file for bankruptcy.Mr Weisfelner, who also represented disaffected XM bondholders seeking a change of control premium during the merger with Sirius, said on Monday that neither he nor his clients had been contacted by the company to clarify its plans.Liberty Media’s approach is seen as a more friendly option for Sirius than an offer by Mr Ergen, who has tussled before with Mel Karmazin, Sirius’s chief executive.The crisis at Sirius was triggered by the company’s inability to refinance debts taken on in the XM merger in frozen credit markets, a sickly climate for media valuations and a plunge in sales of new cars for its radios to be installed in.The group, which once lavished large fees on its broadcasters, including a $500m five-year deal with the “shockjock” Howard Stern, has seen its market capitalisation crash from $5.5bn at the time of the merger to less than $370m on Friday night.Evercore is advising Sirius. UBS is advising Liberty Media.
134;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2008-11-10T22:32:55Z;Financials lead Wall St declines;;Wall Street stocks failed to cling onto early gains on Monday as China’s near $600bn economic stimulus package did little to assuage fears for the growth prospects of some of the biggest names in corporate America.The bankruptcy of a well-known retailer, concerns over the fate of shareholders in the nation’s automakers and drastic losses at AIG and Freddie Mac sent many stocks to multi-year lows.Financials led the declines, down 4.4 per cent overall. Goldman Sachs hit a five-year low, down 8.5 per cent to $71.21, after analysts at Barclays became the latest to forecast a fourth-quarter loss, citing in part its exposure to private equity.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 1.3 per cent at 919.21 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent at 8,870.54 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.9 per cent at 1,616.74.The market had risen as much as 2.3 per cent on the hope that the Chinese plan could lessen an expected global slump. Hard-hit construction, material and energy stocks were given a particular boost. New projects such as railways and airports as well as rebuilding earthquake-hit areas seemed likely to form a key plank of the Chinese government’s plan and the move sparked hopes of a floor in commodity prices.Also helping the market earlier, the Federal Reserve unveiled a revised $150bn rescue plan for AIG.The shares jumped 8.1 per cent to $2.28 in spite of third quarter figures from the struggling insurer that showed a net loss of $24.5bn .Stocks retreated as familiar concerns returned to the fore. Among the biggest, General Motors shed 23 per cent to $3.36 after Deutsche Bank set a price target of zero for the shares and recommended clients sell them.The bank said that while necessary for its survival, a government bail-out would do little to help shareholders. “Even if GM succeeds in averting a bankruptcy, we believe that the company’s future path is likely to be bankruptcy-like,” Deutsche analysts wrote, adding that “equity shareholders are unlikely to get anything”.Barclays also downgraded its recommendation on the stock and cut its price target from $4 to $1.Ford lost 4.5 per cent to $1.93 in spite of further signs that the pair, along with privately-held Chrysler, would secure government assistance. Credit Suisse called Ford’s cash burn “eye-popping” and also lowered its price target from $4 to $1.Best Buy rallied as much as 7.3 per cent on hopes the bankruptcy of smaller rival Circuit City would provide an opportunity for the electronics retailer to expand.Best Buy had previously said it could take over stores that struggling rivals closed. Yet the shares closed down 1.5 per cent to $25.21.Other retailers came under pressure after Barclays Capital issued a bearish outlook on a series of department stores after last week’s October sales figures.“We remain especially concerned about declining access to consumer credit and higher finance charges for consumer credit card balances,” the bank said in a report.Macy’s tumbled 9.3 per cent to $9.94 after Barclays cut its price target on the stock from $18 to $15.Starbucks fell 3.3 per cent to $10.20 and a further 2.8 per cent in after-hours trade, when the coffee chain disclosed fourth quarter profit slumped 97 per cent, hurt by the cost of closing underperforming stores.Earlier, UBS trimmed its forecasts and said that “new smoothies did not seem to drive significant sales”.Defensive names were among the biggest winners. Among them, upbeat like-for-like sales figures from McDonald’s lifted the burger chain 1.8 per cent to $56.48, and gave the fast food sector a boost.Delivery stocks United Parcel Service and Fedex rose after rival Deutsche Post unveiled plans to scrap domestic express services in the US.UPS and Fedex climbed 3.2 per cent to $53.60 and 2.7 per cent to $66.29 respectively, as the move is expected to allow the dominant US duo to take yet more market share.Dish Network slid 14.7 per cent to $13.24 after the satellite television group said quarterly profits dropped more than half. DIRECTV Group, its larger rival with which communications group AT&T has struck a deal to replace Dish in providing bundled deals, gained 1.1 per cent to $22.17.
135;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2008-09-09T06:44:17Z;Google to broker TV ads for NBC Universal;;Google took a step forward in its long-running attempt to break into the television advertising business on Monday as NBC Universal said that it would sell advertising time on “several” of its cable networks through the internet company.The announcement followed a gap of nearly 18 months since Google reached its first deal to broker television ads on behalf of Dish Network, a US satellite company. Google refused to comment on the volume of advertising the two agreements cover.Television networks have been slow to turn to Google to help sell their advertising time, despite considerable investment by the internet company to build a system that integrates television inventory with its highly successful AdWords network. Critics have argued that pushing inventory through a “self-service” network like AdWords, where advertising time is bought through an impersonal marketplace, would risk weakening the networks’ relationship with advertisers and eating into pricing.NBCU and Google characterised their ad-selling move as part of a broader “strategic advertising partnership” under which Google will work to expand both the effectiveness and the reach of NBCU’s advertising base.The internet company’s base of existing customers would help it bring new advertisers who have not turned to television as a medium before, they claimed. They also said they would use Google’s analytical tools to develop a better understanding of how users respond to adverts, enabling them to improve the cost-effectiveness of television advertising.The agreement to sell some advertising through the Google network initially extends to the Sci Fi, Oxygen, MSNBC, CNBC, Sleuth, and Chiller cable networks, with the potential for others to follow.
136;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
137;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2008-03-23T20:28:33Z;Dish may serve up mobile television service;;Dish Network, the US direct broadcast satellite TV operator, could be considering launching a mobile television service to compete with the leading US mobile phone companies, according to industry analysts.The company, which has about 12.7m satellite TV customers, was a surprise bidder and big winner in the Federal Communications Commission’s auction of prime 700Mhz spectrum which ended last week with bids totalling $19.6bn.While Verizon Wireless, the joint venture between Verizon Communications and Vodafone Group of the UK, and AT&T, the largest US telecoms group, spent most in the auction, Dish, through a company called Frontier Wireless, won nearly enough licences to create a nationwide footprint.Dish spent $712m for licences in the so-called “E” block of spectrum which is ideal for video but does not allow for two-way services.“We suspect Dish bid on E block spectrum to build a wireless video network, rather than a data or voice network [which requires two-way communications],” noted Jason Bazinet of Citigroup Global markets in a note to investors. “We were surprised Dish entered the auction and more surprised it emerged as a big winner.”With the cable and satellite industry in the US maturing – roughly 80 per cent of US households have multi-channel TV services – analysts have suggested video customer adoption rates could slow, encouraging operators such as Dish to invest in wireless broadband services.However, Mr Bazinet estimates that it could cost $3bn-$5bn to establish a nationwide mobile video service.Dish’s auction success probably also reduces the chance that the company could be acquired by AT&T.“This level of investment seems to signal that Dish plans to compete with the cable and telecoms companies on a standalone basis rather than sell to a rival,” Citigroup said.Dish declined to comment on the auction results, or its plans.Meanwhile, other analysts warned that the decision by Verizon Wireless to spend $9.36bn in the auctions may prove to have been a risky investment.“Verizon spent $4.7bn on the national C block with open access restrictions, $2.6bn on A block that may have interference issues and $2.1bn on particularly expensive B block licences,” noted Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.Under the terms of the auction, Verizon must adopt “open access” provisions for the C block spectrum and allow any device, once tested, to run on the network.By contrast, Mr Armstrong said that the other big auction winner, AT&T, spent roughly $9.1bn in the auction for spectrum that has “fewer requirements and lower potential for interference”.AT&T’s mobile unit is expected to use the spectrum it acquired in the auction to roll out a next generation 4G network based on LTE (long- term evolution) technology beginning in 2010.
138;DISH;Dish Network Corp;2006-08-18T18:23:00Z;EchoStar told to withdraw recorders;;EchoStar Communications was ordered to halt the sale and use of several of its digital video recorders (DVRs) by a Federal court in Texas after a jury said in April that the US satellite TV operator infringed on a patent held by TiVo, the US DVR pioneer.Judge David Folsom also ordered EchoStar, which operates the Dish Network, the second largest US direct broadcasting satellite service with 12.5m subscribers, to pay $5.6m in interest and $10.3m in damages on top of $74m in damages awarded by the jury earlier.EchoStar’s stock fell 2.6 per cent to $31.90, in early trading on Nasdaq on Friday, while shares in TiVo jumped 17 per cent to $7.60.Analysts suggested the court ruling could lead to a licensing deal between the companies, and that it may encourage TiVo to challenge other DVR distributors.The judge’s ruling was the latest step in a lengthy dispute over the DVR technology typically built into TV set-top boxes. Like video tape recorders, hard drive-based DVRs enable viewers to record TV programming for viewing later as well as watch or pause live TV.TiVo sued EchoStar in the Texas courts in January 2004, alleging that EchoStar was violating a patent issued to TiVo in May 2001, known as the “Time Warp” patent.Last year, EchoStar countersued, saying TiVo had used technology patented by EchoStar between 1998 and 2003.If implemented, the injunction would require Dish Network to stop customers using any of eight DVR models supplied by EchoStar within 30 days, EchoStar, however, said it planned to ask the appeals court to block the permanent injunction pending an appeal.
