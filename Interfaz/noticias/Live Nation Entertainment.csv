The DoJ had been investigating Live Nation over concerns it had tried to pressure concert venues to use its Ticketmaster sites over other ticketing platforms. Live Nation bought Ticketmaster in 2010, a deal that combined the biggest concert promoter with the dominant ticketing site, raising concerns of a monopoly over live music. US regulators approved the deal under certain conditions — specifically, that Live Nation would not force concert venues to use Ticketmaster.But ticket prices continued to climb after the merger, and companies complained Live Nation was using its clout to make venues use Ticketmaster for their events. Live Nation manages tours for hundreds of artists, including Jay-Z and U2, and allegedly threatened to snatch shows from venues if they did not use Ticketmaster as a vendor. The DoJ said on Thursday that Live Nation had violated its agreement “repeatedly and over the course of several years”. As part of Thursday’s settlement, the DOJ modified the consent decree “to make it clear” that pressuring concert venues into using Ticketmaster is prohibited. Live Nation would be subject to a $1m penalty each time it violates these rules, as part of the new agreement. The DoJ called the deal “the most significant enforcement action of an existing antitrust decree by the department in 20 years”. The agreement, or consent decree, had been set to expire next year, but the two sides have agreed to extend it by five and a half years.Live Nation said on Thursday that the agreement is “the best outcome for our business, clients and shareholders as we turn our focus to 2020 initiatives.”Shares in Live Nation jumped more than 9 per cent to $69.91 on Thursday afternoon. 
1;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2018-10-12T11:35:06Z;Taylor Swift hits high note in battle against ticket touts;Dynamic pricing looks to have paid off but question remains whether other acts will follow;"Last month, Taylor Swift put on a show in Indianapolis featuring giant inflatable snakes, fireworks, flames and a glittered gold cage in which she flew across the football stadium. The next morning she thanked fans through Instagram for breaking the attendance record for the venue. More than 55,000 people paid to see what critics praised as a “perfect pop spectacle” with “the vibe of a mass communion”. It is an accomplishment that one might expect for a star of her stature. But the feat seemed in doubt several months before, when thousands of tickets remained up for grabs at each of the venues she booked across North America and the UK. The slower pace of sales was in part the result of an experiment that Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticketing site, is pitching as the entertainment industry’s model for the future, in a push to recapture the $8bn a year lost to ticket resellers — also known as touts or scalpers.After missing out on an estimated $150m in sales to touts on her 2015 tour, Ms Swift, equal parts musician and entrepreneur, hatched a plan with Ticketmaster to stamp out resales. For the tour supporting her latest album, Reputation, she initially only sold tickets to those who registered weeks ahead of time through Ticketmaster’s new technology, called Verified Fan. Ms Swift added an additional hurdle to potential touts, unveiling a points system that gives fans who watched her videos or bought merchandise a better chance at buying tickets. Later, tickets were released on general sale but at steeper prices, with the best seats running into the thousands of dollars, slicing the arbitrage opportunity for touts.“A certain amount of patience is required for an industry that for the past 40 years measured success by: ‘how fast can I sell out?’ The goal was to write ‘Sold Out’ on the marquee,” said David Marcus, head of music for Ticketmaster. Now, however, he said, sold-out tours are a sign of “underpricing” tickets below what people are willing to pay, drawing the eye of touts.Instant sell-outs have become a rite of passage for big stars, as scalpers use software to buy up tickets the moment they are available online. Louis Messina, Ms Swift’s tour promoter, boldly predicted that by mid-December he would be “celebrating Taylor’s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world”. Yet none of her shows had sold out. By January Gary Adler, director of the National Association of Ticket Brokers, dubbed the tour a “total disaster”. But as the tour draws to a close this month, the strategy appears to have paid off: Ms Swift has captured about $1.4m a show that had been lost to resellers on her previous tour, as measured by a Financial Times analysis — recouping more than $50m. By August, she had already broken her own record for the highest-grossing tour for a woman in North America.Thirty days before her shows in September and October, 3 per cent of her tickets were listed for sale on StubHub, the dominant resale site, the FT found by tracking ticket volumes. By comparison, 12 per cent of Bruno Mars’ and 6 per cent of Ed Sheeran’s tickets were listed on StubHub over the same time.While touting is not new, the entertainment industry has been rattled by the use of software “bots” buying tickets, leaving fans frustrated as popular events are sold out within minutes. Some governments have fought back. Ireland has banned secondary ticketing while Italy has fined companies millions of euros for misleading customers on price. Under pressure in the UK and Europe, Ticketmaster last month shut  its own resale sites. But in the US, the largest market, the practice is alive and well.Critics say the fury that touts have fuelled in recent years raises fundamental questions about how to distribute tickets to fans. Fans in Toronto were left outraged in February when tickets to Sir Elton John’s farewell tour were sold out within one minute; the star has slammed secondary ticketing as “disgraceful”. In April 2017, a year before she would hit the road, Ms Swift met Ticketmaster to devise a new sales strategy. After reviewing a host of prototypes, she took a chance on Ticketmaster’s Verified Fan platform, a technology the company said would identify real fans and weed out scalpers. Fans register online to express their interest in a show; Ticketmaster uses artificial intelligence to trawl their information and determine which are genuine fans, and gives them a code to buy tickets. Ticketmaster does not say how exactly its technology decides what a true fan is. Reg Walker, director of security company Iridium Consultancy, who examines ticket sales data, is sceptical. “There’s not an algorithm in the world that would determine whether a person is a genuine fan or not,” he said. “It’s smoke and mirrors.”Yet Ticketmaster says it is effective. Between 30 and 50 per cent of tickets for popular concerts typically make their way to secondary websites. Ticketmaster says that 30 per cent of the tickets for Taylor Swift’s 2015 tour ended up on the secondary market, but this rate shrunk to 5 per cent of Verified Fan tickets for her 2018 tour. After selling about half of her 2.5m tickets to fans through a Verified Fan presale last November, Ms Swift raised prices for a wider general sale in December to match their “market value”. The cheapest seats were $50, while a front-row seat without VIP perks cost $899. Three years ago Ms Swift priced tickets for her 1989 tour at between $40 and $225, according to Pollstar data.The industry has taken steps to combat scalpers. Last year, the producers of Broadway hit musical Hamilton used a similar premium pricing strategy to Ms Swift, lifting the price for seats to a record $849 each. Adele in 2016 enlisted the help of Songkick to distinguish scalpers from fans, which successfully blocked more than 50,000 ticket sales through touts. However, this latest attempt, and its sheer scale, is “absolutely new”, according to Rafi Mohammed, a consultant and author of The Art of Pricing. “It was pretty gutsy of [Ms Swift] to come out and be the first big name artist to do this, and have it be known.”The question remains whether others will follow. In the past year music acts such as U2 and Harry Styles, and even speakers like Michelle Obama, have tried the Verified Fan programme. But Ms Swift’s unsold tickets unnerved other artists, making it an industry-wide talking point. Even though she ended up breaking attendance and gross sales records at several concerts, many of the stadiums did not sell out. The FT found that on average, 668 empty seats were available through Ticketmaster an hour before each of Ms Swift’s shows. In addition to sacrificing sold-out dates, artists risk being accused of greed. Technology has made it easier to pinpoint exactly how much people are willing to pay for certain seats, say for a Saturday rather than a Wednesday performance, but some acts have been hesitant to charge higher prices for fear of a backlash. Regardless, Ken Davenport, Tony-award-winning producer of Broadway hits including Kinky Boots, said dynamic pricing was “absolutely becoming the industry standard”. “The airlines have mastered this, so why not do the same thing? Give us a couple years,” he added.Dean Budnick, author of Ticket Masters: The Rise of the Concert Industry and How the Public Got Scalped, says the latest assault on touts is a throwback to tactics used by rock bands in the 1970s and 80s. Grateful Dead, for example, required fans to express their interest in a ticket via a postcard, which the band then selected in a lottery. “They weren’t socialist hippies, they were just confident they could sell a lot anyway, and they didn’t care when,” he said. “To some extent, that’s also true for Taylor Swift. It doesn’t necessarily matter if she ever sells out her shows.”Scalping has become a bigger concern for musicians who, after decades of shrinking album sales, now rely on concerts for the bulk of their income. The FT analysed this year’s major tours by tracking the number of tickets listed on StubHub, providing a snapshot of how much each artist’s seats were being resold 30 days before a given show. Ticketmaster offers a dizzying array of sales options for artists, such as “VIP experiences”, presale offers with credit cards and bundling with album sales. The major tours each used their own mix of strategies that resulted in different levels of scalping, the FT found. Price appeared to be the biggest factor. Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s stadium tour did not use the Verified Fan programme, but did price tickets “dynamically”, resulting in hefty prices for the best seats. A front row ticket for their October 4 show in Seattle cost $695, which Ticketmaster’s website openly stated was “dynamically priced up and down based on demand”. Only 2.3 per cent of tickets were available to buy on StubHub as of 30 days before the show.By comparison, Ed Sheeran has made a point of keeping his prices low. He told Australian media in 2014 that he was “really trying not to have elitist tickets”, charging a maximum $99 per ticket at the time. His tickets cost between $36 and $119 each for his current tour, much lower than peers. Mr Sheeran also used the Verified Fan programme to sell tickets, but the FT found that a much larger number of his tickets were resold on StubHub than Ms Swift. Both stars played stadium shows on September 22. Ten days before the show, Mr Sheeran’s New Jersey venue had “sold out” on Ticketmaster, but more than 3,000 tickets were for sale on StubHub. For Taylor Swift’s show, more than 1,000 tickets were still available on Ticketmaster for her show in New Orleans, but less than 1,000 were listed on StubHub. "
2;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2018-09-11T10:13:22Z;Credit-card skimming group suspected of BA hack - RiskIQ;;A tech security company has claimed the credit-card skimming group behind the attack on Ticketmaster was also responsible for the British Airways hack announced last week.Threat detection firm RiskIQ said that the BA hack, in which 380,000 customers’ data — including sensitive financial details — were stolen, was probably carried out by criminal group Magecart.It said the BA attack was “similar to the one leveled against Ticketmaster with one key difference: instead of compromising commonly used third-party functionality…Magecart operatives compromised the British Airways site directly”.According to RiskIQ, Magecart rewrote the BA’s sites code “to steal sensitive data that consumers enter into online payment forms”, rather than scooping up information directly from BA’s system. The attack was “a simple but highly targeted approach compared to what we’ve seen in the past with the Magecart skimmer which grabbed forms indiscriminately”.RiskIQ’s research determined that Magecart had broken into BA’s site “several days before the skimming began” on August 21. The attack lasted for 15 days until September 5.The attack was one of the worst since the introduction of new data protection rules in May because card verification value (CVV) codes were taken. CVV codes make it much easier for cards to be used.BA said: “As this is a criminal investigation, we are unable to comment on speculation.”
3;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2018-08-17T15:40:06Z;Ticketmaster’s resale site closures hailed as ‘turning point’;Demise of GetMeIn and Seatwave follows pressure from fans, musicians and politicians;"Iron Maiden fans searching on Viagogo’s web site last month would have found exorbitantly priced tickets to a gala show at the Estadio Nacional de Chile in Santiago in October next year. The problem, for anybody who tempted to buy them, was that the gig does not exist.The risk of buying tickets for a phantom show is one of the worst symptoms of the secondary-ticketing market that has been blamed for a rise in “industrial scale” touting that has emerged during the past decade. The resale market can also allow tickets to be sold at a huge premium to their original price, freezing out ordinary fans from concerts, sporting events and theatre shows.However, a move this week by Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticketing site, to close its Seatwave and GetMeIn resale platforms in the UK and Europe has been hailed as the beginning of the end of the UK secondary market.Andrew Parsons, managing director of Ticketmaster UK, said the decision reflected fan frustration. “We know that fans are tired of seeing tickets being snapped up just to find them being resold for a profit on secondary websites, so we have taken action,” he said.But with fans, musicians, regulators and politicians all putting pressure on the UK secondary market, by introducing regulations or calling for boycotts, some within the industry argue that Ticketmaster’s motives might not only have been to satisfy the ethical concerns of fans and musicians; the sites had also become less profitable.In addition, Ticketmaster itself confirms that it will continue to offer reselling with no caps on price in the US.A number of countries have moved against the secondary ticketing market: the Irish government has outlawed it; Italian regulators have fined companies millions of euros for misleading consumers; and Australia has given bands and venues the right to void tickets that have been resold. The situation is different in the US, the largest secondary ticketing market, where there is greater public acceptance of the increased ticket prices that tend to be offered on such sites.The closure of GetMeIn and Seatwave was hailed as a victory by UK campaigners even though Viagogo and StubHub, the largest resale platforms available to UK buyers, are still active.This whole industry is built around ripping off fansMike Weatherley, the Conservative party politician who co-chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group On Ticket Abuse alongside the Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, until his retirement in 2015, said Ticketmaster’s move was a significant moment in tackling the problem.“The tide has turned,” he said of the ticketing company’s change of heart.Rod Smallwood, one of Iron Maiden’s managers who has led the fight against secondary ticket platforms, compared the resale market to online gaming and payday loans. “This whole industry is built around ripping off fans. The profit made on these sites isn’t going to pay for a tour or a new album and if you’re paying £300 for a £60 ticket you are probably not going to to many more shows,” he said.Iron Maiden, one of the biggest touring acts in the world, moved to tackle rip-off reselling by working with Ticketmaster to introduce a paperless ticketing system in 2010 that required proof of identity to get into the show. It also forced the company to remove all Iron Maiden tickets from the resale sites it owned and installed one of its own employees in the box office at every show to deal with fans with ticketing issues. The band sold 250,000 tickets at face value for its “Legacy of the Beast” tour this year and largely kept the digital touts at bay, although it is still forced to respond frequently to new problems caused by touts, as the fake Chile show.Paperless ticketing has since been used for the hit musical Hamilton, the band Radiohead and solo artist Robbie Williams to stem the impact of secondary ticketing by requiring the person who bought the tickets to be there. Other artists, including Iggy Pop and Ed Sheeran, as well as London football club Crystal Palace, have started working with Twickets, an independent face value exchange site.Richard Davies, founder of Twickets, said pressure from fans and bands has helped make life harder for the secondary ticketing platforms, but that the ticketing industry was likely to respond by increasing margins on the fees they charge for the best tickets. “Greed will take over,” he said.Reg Walker, director of Iridium, a security company that works with events organisers and bands to crack down on ticket touting, said online resale sites had given rise to an army of “armchair touts” that operated at an “industrial scale”.However, he argued that Ticketmaster’s move needed to be put into perspective as some of the resale sites were now struggling to make money due to artist opposition and a regulatory crackdown on the biggest touts. “Iron Maiden have proved that if you give a damn about the fans, then you can eliminate it,” he said.Why there is no case for outlawing ticket touts / From Andy Thompson, Worcester Park, Surrey, UK"
4;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2017-11-28T13:02:21Z;Ticket resellers may have broken consumer law – CMA;;Ticket resale websites may be breaking consumer law by failing to give customers enough information about what they are buying, according to the UK’s consumer protection watchdog, which said it would expand its investigation into the sector after finding “widespread concerns” about companies’ behaviour.The Competition and Markets Authority said it would raise concerns with “a number” of websites to ensure consumers are clearly told information such as where they will be seated in a venue, who they are buying from, and whether restrictions on resold tickets could mean they are denied access to events.The CMA said some sites have already made changes since it opened its investigation 12 months ago, but said it would take action against one unnamed website in particular which had failed to fully comply after previously committing to improve its practices.Andrea Coscelli, CMA chief executive, said “secondary ticketing websites can offer an important service”, but said “our investigation has identified concerns that the law protecting consumers is being broken”.Sites such as GetMeIn and ebay’s StubHub say they are designed to offer customers a chance to sell previously-purchased tickets for events they can no longer attend. However, the sites have come under attack for facilitating large-scale touts, who use automated systems to quickly buy tickets from primary sellers to sell on at a higher price.The sites have also been criticised for having “inappropriately close” relationship with primary sales platforms. GetMeIn and Seatwave, two of the largest secondary marketplaces, are both owned by Ticketmaster, the biggest primary ticketing site.The CMA was initially supposed to focus on the use of automated ticket-buying bots, but it expanded its investigation after lobbying by parts of the music industry. On Tuesday it said it would broaden its scope even further, after being concerned by new information on practices such as event organisers selling tickets directly through the secondary websites without making it clear to consumers.The authority was also worried about issues including pressure selling – where claims about the availability of tickets “create a misleading impression or rush customers into making a buying decision” – difficulties for customers in getting refunds, and speculative selling by businesses before they have actually acquired the tickets to sell.Mr Coscelli added:We are putting our concerns to these websites and will be requiring the changes necessary to tackle them. We will use the full range of our powers to get the right outcome for these sites’ customers – including taking action through the courts if needed.The CMA’s announcement was welcomed by the government as well as some of the major players in the industry.Margot James, the consumer minister, said “all too often people are left feeling ripped off when buying tickets from resale websites. It’s good to see the Competition and Markets Authority clamping down on businesses suspected of breaking the law, as we work to deliver greater transparency in this market to further protect consumers”.A spokesperson for Ticketmaster said “it is great to see that the CMA is taking this much-needed step to enforce the law in the UK resale market”, adding that “we have been working closely with the CMA to ensure that we are compliant with consumer law”.StubHub said:StubHub remains committed to working with UK regulators to ensure that consumers continue to have access to a safe, secure and transparent ticket resale service. As the CMA investigation is ongoing, we await the final outcome.(Image: Getty)
5;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2017-10-02T20:10:47Z;Las Vegas shootings: From a call for unity, to gunshots from above;A gunman massacres dozens of people during country music concert in Las Vegas;On Saturday night, singer Sam Hunt stood before a large crowd of country music fans in Las Vegas and delivered a heartfelt plea to unify a divided America and bring an end to violence.Within hours at least 58 of those fans were dead and more than 500 injured in the worst mass shooting in modern times.Sunday was the closing night of the Route 91 Harvest festival, an annual open-air country music event organised by Live Nation. Fans said the weekend crowd was peaceful and good natured.Headliner Jason Aldean was in the early stages of his set when people in the crowd heard what they described as a “pop pop pop” sound between songs. Some thought it was firecrackers or problems with the speakers. Mr Aldean continued playing then the lights went out and he dashed from the stage.Ginger Barth, who was visiting Las Vegas from Colorado, thought there had been another equipment malfunction, after issues with the mics on the first night of the festival. “Then people started screaming,” she said.Tony Johnson, who was visiting from Southern California, was close to the stage.“Everyone started laying down,” he said. “It was like dominoes. We all fell on top of each other . . . So much damage was done before the police could isolate it.”As he scrambled for cover, Mr Johnson could hear bullets ricocheting off metal fences and buildings all around him. “There were so many different sounds” of gunfire, he said, suggesting a range of weapons had been used.“It was definitely different artillery.”Later, police said they had found more than a dozen rifles in a room on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Hotel, where Stephen Paddock, the suspected shooter, was found dead by police.“I figured someone was in a building,” said Ms Barth. “You could hear [the shots] but you could tell it was far away.”In the chaos that followed the shooting, crowds gathered in nearby hotels such as Hooters and MGM Grand. Mr Johnson was concerned that the security guards in the lobbies lacked the guns they would have needed to protect them if another shooter emerged.“We were like sitting ducks,” he said. He booked a room upstairs and barricaded himself and his friends inside until morning.On the festival grounds, concertgoers pushed over fences and fled into a nearby car park, where some hid behind trucks for safety. “The police kept moving us further north but there was nowhere to go,” said Ms Barth. Eventually a local picked them up in his truck and drove them to a local motel, where they spent the night.“We were in shorts and tank tops and we were freezing,” said her friend Shawn Hendricks, until local people offered them jackets and water.At 9am on Monday, many hotel guests were returning to their rooms for the first time since the incident. Men in cowboy hats and women in boots and denim shorts, some with blankets over their shoulders, staggered through the unusually silent casino floor at the Mandalay Bay.As she spoke to the FT, Ms Barth was sitting smoking next to the Jackpot Streak slot machine alongside Barb Campbell and Ms Hendricks. All were still wearing the purple wristbands that had given them entry to the festival.“We had to come down here to smoke and calm down,” Ms Hendricks said.She had been in her room on the 20th floor of the hotel when the shooting started. “It was very loud — I was looking for fireworks. You could see a lot of movement down there” at the concert below, she said. When they left the room to go to the hotel lobby to find out what was going on, they were evacuated by bus to a nearby college.The country music stars who played at Route 91 reacted with shock to the events.“Tonight has been beyond horrific,” said Mr Aldean in a post to Instagram bearing the caption “Pray for Las Vegas”.“It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night. #heartbroken #stopthehate.”The Culinary Union in Las Vegas, which represents 4,000 Mandalay Bay staff, said its organisers were “conducting an outreach program in employee dining rooms” to help workers cope with “the pain that our community is feeling”.“This will not paralyse our city,” said Geoconda Argüello-Kline, the union’s secretary-general. “We will continue to work together with the resorts on ensuring workers are protected at work and safe.”On Monday morning, Las Vegas residents lined up in large numbers to donate blood at emergency centres around the city. “Let this town know they were awesome,” said Ms Campbell.

The stock, which had been trading at a record high of $42.20, reversed a 9.3 per cent gain to trade 3.7 per cent lower on the news before bouncing back to end the day up 5.6 per cent.According to Reuters, Amazon is seeking to partner with US venue owners to sell event tickets. The talks with US operators of major stadium, arenas and concert halls come after Amazon’s efforts to partner with Ticketmaster fizzled amid disagreement over who would control customer data, said Reuters, citing sources with knowledge of the conversations.The quick rebound in Live Nation’s share price suggests the market believe the talks could be revived.Ticketmaster is by far the biggest player in the US ticketing space, with exclusive rights to sell primary tickets for many top venues in the country.
7;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2017-06-15T12:10:46Z;Liberty Media shows how to win deals and influence companies;US media group’s investments from radio to Formula 1 reveal unconventional strategy;It was early 2009 and the depths of the financial crisis when Greg Maffei, chief executive of cable magnate John Malone’s Liberty Media, struck what would become one of the most eye-popping deals of recent times.SiriusXM, the satellite radio operator that is home to the original “shock jock” Howard Stern, was desperate for cash and close to filing for bankruptcy protection. With no lenders willing to help, Liberty stepped in. It offered to lend Sirius up to $400m, provided it sold preferred shares to Liberty that would convert into 40 per cent of the struggling company — for just $12,500.Sirius agreed, but with markets in meltdown, loaning it anything was a big risk. “My treasurer at the time said either the world’s going to end or we’re going to make a lot of money,” Mr Maffei recalls. But Sirius was good for its loan, borrowing $400m and paying it back with interest. Over the years, the 40 per cent stake that Liberty negotiated grew to about 67 per cent thanks to various Sirius stock buybacks. Fast forward to 2017 and a holding that cost Liberty the equivalent of a second-hand car is now worth more than $16bn.It is unlikely to strike as lucrative a deal any time soon, but the complexity of the Sirius trade is emblematic of Liberty’s approach under Mr Maffei, Mr Malone’s top US executive. He is the architect of a strategy that has seen Liberty assemble a broad portfolio of media, sports and cable assets — from baseball’s Atlanta Braves and Formula 1 motor racing to the QVC shopping channel — that rival those of players such as 21st Century Fox and Time Warner. The method has been control and influence by using leverage, board presence and complex, tax-driven dealmaking, rather than having outright ownership.Last week, he orchestrated Liberty’s latest deal when Sirius invested $480m in Pandora, the internet radio operator. Sirius is buying preferred stock in Pandora that will eventually convert into a 16 per cent stake. As part of the deal, Sirius will name three people to Pandora’s board of directors, with one of these appointees becoming chairman.The deal is classic Liberty in that it gets clout in a company that it will not control. “Control is a relative word,” says Mr Maffei. “We need to have influence. If you have influence, if you have board seats, you have a better chance to drive your exit in an attractive manner.”The combination of Sirius’s satellite radio business, which is mainly sold in cars, with Pandora’s internet radio operation comes as streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music are duking it out in paid-for subscription music. “We’ve always thought part of the [music] market will be free,” says Mr Maffei, adding that the combined company will target the US radio ad market, which is worth about $17bn.Analysts said the Pandora investment would help Sirius diversify away from its reliance on in-car systems and boost other music-related businesses in the Liberty portfolio — such as LiveNation Entertainment, the world’s largest concert booking and ticketing groupLiveNation owns Ticketmaster, the event ticketing operator. “Pandora can help Ticketmaster and LiveNation’s promotion arm sell more tickets,” Brandon Ross, analyst with BTIG Research, wrote in a recent note. Pandora user data will be key, he added. “Ticketmaster has a lot of customer purchase data, but it has no idea to what music its customers are listening.”Liberty Media is wholly separate from Liberty Global, Mr Malone’s European cable group, and has stakes in a range of media, internet and cable companies, including Charter Communications, which is the second largest cable operator in the US after buying Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks in tax-driven deals two years ago, which were worth close to $90bn including debt.It controls some of its businesses outright, such as home shopping network QVC and Formula 1, which it acquired this year in a typically complex deal that valued the sport at $8bn. But for most of its investments, the company holds smaller stakes. This week, it also invested in the Drone Racing League, joining Sky and World Wrestling Entertainment in backing the nascent sport.Liberty was formed from the remnants of TCI, the cable operator Mr Malone turned from an also-ran into the largest in America before selling it to AT&T in 1999 for $48bn. TCI regularly took stakes in cable networks in return for distributing those channels and at various times has owned stakes in Viacom, Turner networks and Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News Channel. “We were this collection of little minority investments,” says Mr Maffei. Unwinding those investments “in a tax efficient manner” has been critical “because the cost of not doing that would be so high. If you’re paying out a 40 per cent capital gains tax at the corporate level, and then paying it again at the shareholder level, you’re dissipating a lot of returns.”Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer with Gamco Investors, says Liberty Media invites comparisons with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and 3G, the private equity group, for the scale of its investments and the returns it has generated. Since 2003, Liberty has spun off eight companies and launched six tracker stocks, he says. “If you held on to all the pieces it will have returned 13 per cent compared with the market, which returned 8 per cent, and Berkshire Hathaway, which has returned about 8.5 per cent.”Much of its future growth will depend on the recent bet the company made on Formula 1. It has installed Chase Carey, formerly Rupert Murdoch’s top lieutenant, as the sport’s chief executive and is intent on pushing it into new markets — particularly the US. “What attracted us is that it is a global sports franchise,” says Mr Maffei. “There are only three or four of similar scale and you can’t buy the Olympics and you can’t buy Fifa. It was one we saw that had frankly been under-exploited.”He mentions commercial opportunities such as increasing broadcasting revenues and building ancillary events around each Grand Prix. Before Liberty bought Formula 1, the sport had one full-time person working on sponsorship and a couple working part time to service 17 sponsors. By contrast, Major League Baseball which, unlike Formula 1, is almost entirely US-focused, “has 80 people working on sponsorship and 75 sponsors”.There are other untapped opportunities: “We have teams spending several hundred million dollars a year trying to get five seconds faster than the other guy, 10 seconds faster. It’s all about technology, and we don’t have a technology sponsor.”He raises the prospect of staging Grand Prix in cities such as Miami, Las Vegas “down the Strip”, and New York, with the Manhattan skyline as a backdrop. “There are a lot of potential venues that are interesting.”Valuing Liberty is difficult, but Mr Marangi estimates its various holdings, stakes and owned companies are worth a combined $80bn. Liberty’s complex structure, array of tracking stocks and lack of a single, unifying brand distinguish it from rival media conglomerates such as Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox. Its focus on the long term — unlike private equity firms it has no fixed time horizon for its investments — also differentiates it, according to Mr Marangi.Mr Maffei says Liberty is not wedded to any of its assets. “We’re different from companies that don’t have the view that they are ever going to get rid of anything.” Instead, he says, the company intends to use its assets to keep growing as tax efficiently as possible. “That is where we are,” he says. “Where we have the most leverage.”

The profits from the premium seats can then be used partly to keep other tickets affordable.Hamilton’s move to premium pricing comes after a year of reckoning for the ticketing industry as online bots scooped up tickets for many of the most popular events, inflating the prices on secondary markets and leaving fans out in the cold. That has prompted Hamilton’s producers to use technology to weed out bot purchasers for tickets in London, where tickets went on general sale on Monday for the planned November opening.Now, as the first holders of $849 tickets head to the theatre, the price rise appears to have paid off. The resale of Hamilton tickets has dropped nearly 50 per cent after the price change, as measured by an Financial Times analysis of secondary ticket volumes on the resale site StubHub. Secondary ticket sellers posted an average of 53 listings for each Hamilton performance after the price rise, compared with 99 listings before.“They have been bold in claiming their true market value,” said Chris Carey, of Media Insight Consulting. “That certainly breaks the mould.”Scalping strips an estimated $8bn a year out of the hands of creators, a significant problem at a time when live events are one of the few creative revenue sources shielded from digital disruption. “Experiences cannot be replicated,” said Mark Mulligan, analyst at Midia Research.Raising prices to combat scalping is not new. Back in 2001, The Producers, the most popular Broadway show of its time, raised ticket prices after seeing that secondary “diggers” were reaping financial benefits of the nightly sell-outs, said Richard Frankel, a producer for the show. That strategy aimed to bring more of the profits back to the show’s stakeholders.But technology has made it easier for producers to pinpoint how much people are willing to pay. Mr Seller told the New York Times that Hamilton’s producers came up with the $849 price by “monitoring the secondary market and finding out what the average is”. In fact, the resale price of premium tickets has barely changed since the price increase, which means scalpers’ margins are shrinking.The transparency of online marketplaces also illuminates just how much money the creators are losing out on, said Joe Berchtold, chief operating officer of Live Nation, the world’s biggest concert promoter.Hamilton has grossed more than $155m since opening in 2014, and most recently broke box office records with a gross of more than $3.3m in a single week. Prices on StubHub have ranged from $195 to more than $10,000. Before the price increase, an FT analysis showed that the production was losing more than $2.6m a week to scalpers.In the past year, Hamilton has also taken several other steps to curb ticket scalping, such as limiting the number of tickets that can be bought on Ticketmaster and in person. The UK production will also use a ticketless system, where the buyer will need to swipe a credit card to enter the theatre.Other pockets of the entertainment industry have also taken on the ticket resellers. Musicians, after decades of shrinking album sales, now rely on concerts for the bulk of their income, prompting big stars to wage a war on the bots.In 2015, Coldplay, Elton John and other artists sent a letter to the UK government urging action against “industrial scale abuse” from ticket resellers. “Tens of thousands of fans have been ripped off by people who exploit fair ticket prices,” they wrote.After watching tickets to her stadium tour sell out and then appear on secondary sites within minutes — often marked up tenfold and sparking fury from fans — Adele last year enlisted the help of Songkick, a ticketing start-up, to weed out suspected scalpers from real fans. It blocked more than 50,000 sales.Live Nation-owned Ticketmaster, the largest ticketing company, has been ramping up efforts to differentiate humans from bots, building technology that can track a buyer’s social media profiles and other information to gauge whether a fan is making the purchase. However the company faces ever more sophisticated technology from the bots — it estimates it received 5bn attacks in 2016 — or 10,000 times a minute.Still, many musicians are wary of following Hamilton’s lead and raising ticket prices, for fear of alienating fans, said Mr Carey. “They could absolutely charge much more for their shows, the secondary market activity is evidence of this, but . . . risk a backlash if they were to price at the market rate for each show,” he said.—————Further reading● Life and Arts: Simon Schama on ‘Hamilton’

9;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2017-01-13T12:28:48Z;‘Hamilton’ fights off London ticket bots with new system;Success of musical’s card-swipe technology will be watched by entertainment industry;Trying to score tickets for hip hop musical Hamilton on Broadway has become a quixotic quest. At least, for anyone unwilling to spend hundreds of dollars to purchase them on secondary resale websites.But as tickets go on sale this month for its new run in the UK which kicks off in November, the show’s producers are preparing stiff challenges to ticket touts that have used new technology to profit from the show’s enormous popularity.Hamilton’s runaway success in New York caused problems as ticket websites snapped up thousands of seats as soon as they were put on sale. US tickets were initially priced at about $139 — and premium tickets from $549 — but were quickly being reported to be on offer on reseller sites as high as $2,000.In a bid to avoid profiteering by such ticket touts, Hamilton will open at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London in November using a “ticketless” system run by Ticketmaster, the online site owned by Live Nation.Delfont Mackintosh Theatres, the UK group co-producing the London transfer, will offer the majority of seats priced between £37.50 and £89.50, with those who have preregistered having the first option to purchase tickets from Monday next week. Tickets go on general sale on January 30.Theatregoers will be asked to swipe the credit card used to pay for each ticket to gain entry to a performance. All tickets found being offered on resale sites will be voided.The aim is to stymie the use of “bots” — automated software used to harvest tickets in bulk, so they can be resold online at vastly inflated prices on secondary reselling sites such as StubHub, Viagogo and the Ticketmaster-owned sites GetMeIn and Seatwave. The global secondary ticketing market is worth $8bn a year, according to Ticketmaster.Hamilton’s producers have said “any purchase that is detected to be an automated bot purchase” will be voided.The Hamilton sale will be closely watched by other groups in the music and theatre businesses, which have also complained about the voracious use of bots by determined touts.In December, the singer Adele implemented a variety of measures to battle touts for a series of gigs next summer, such as declaring that only buyers whose names are printed on their tickets are guaranteed entry to concerts. But her efforts did not stop the tickets appearing on resale sites for as much £9,000.Reg Walker, director of the Iridium Consultancy which advises on ticketing irregularities, welcomed Hamilton’s ticketless system but says he expects touts to find novel ways to target the sale. “The show will come under unprecedented attack because of the demand,” he says.The show has been an unlikely success, lauded by the likes of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, who described Hamilton as “the best art I have ever seen in my life”.Based on the life of Alexander Hamilton, the first US secretary of the Treasury, the show features rap battles between America’s founding fathers who debate each other on the establishment of the US national banking system and the country’s 1793 proclamation of neutrality in the war between France and Great Britain. Critics deemed it a triumph. The show has been sold out in New York for months.Its success has made it a high-profile target for touts. Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hamilton’s creator, campaigned for the US Congress to pass the Better Online Ticket Sales Act last year, which made it illegal to use bots to purchase tickets in bulk or resell those tickets bought using automated software. The UK government is also considering legislation to target bots.Mr Miranda lobbied US lawmakers after it emerged that about 20,000 Hamilton tickets had been acquired using bots during the time he starred in the show, with touts making more than $15.5m from the sale of bot-bought tickets to 100 shows.“I want you to be there when the curtain goes up,” he wrote in a op-ed piece in the New York Times declaring the need for new legislation. “You shouldn’t have to fight robots just to see something you love.”But the attempts to stamp out ticket touts in the US might come to hit the producers of Hamilton in the UK. Mr Walker says the same touts that profited from acquiring Hamilton tickets on Broadway are still likely to target the London sale.He says recent examinations of sales ledgers at British events suggest that US-based touts have begun to unleash their bots on UK ticket sales and other markets around the world.“Tightening legislation in the USA has certainly made the UK a more attractive market,” says Mr Walker. “Touts are using international borders to obfuscate their activities.”Campaigners argue that secondary resale sites have not done enough to tackle large-scale touts, even though all platforms have expressed disapproval of bots and have supported legislation aimed at curbing their use.

The sector has evolved more quickly there than in the US because most US cities tend to have an arena or amphitheatre, he added. “But now every big city wants to have a great festival and there are still a lot of markets, like Boston, Miami and Toronto, that don’t have one.”Secret Sounds owns the Splendour in the Grass festival in Byron Bay, which recently featured Kanye West and Coldplay. Paul Piticco, co-chief executive, said it had become more difficult for independent operators to compete for the best acts and talent on a more congested festival circuit.“There are so many festivals proliferating and a lot of global deals for bands, which means there really can be a shortage of headline acts,” he said.In Australia live music events generated A$1.4bn in ticket sales in 2015, more than combined attendances for rugby, cricket and Australian Rules Football, according to a report from Live Performance Australia.Around the world, live music has been a welcome fillip for the music industry, which continues to adjust to a digital distribution model and the shift to online streaming. “International demand for concerts is increasing, driven by social media and online video, rising incomes and improved infrastructure,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a recent research note.Live Nation, which acquired Ticketmaster in 2009 for $400m, owns 80 music festivals, including six of the world’s top 10 measured by attendance. They include Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo in Tennessee and Rock Werchter in Belgium.Mr Rapino said the festival circuit was becoming increasingly important but would not replace the traditional music touring business, which tends to be concentrated on arenas, sports stadiums and other venues. “We have about 150 clubs and theatres that we manage and lease but the artist is still the most important piece . . . whatever the venue we make it work.”
11;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2016-07-24T10:55:16Z;All eyes on the future for virtual reality start-ups;VR headsets are still rare but interest in the new medium among founders and backers is booming;"When Tony Bevilacqua came face to face with a dinosaur, he saw the future.As co-founder of Knetik, a digital services and analytics provider, Mr Bevilacqua regularly attended video games industry events such as the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. At last year’s GDC, after seeing the interest in virtual reality technology from “people I really respected”, he ordered a pair of headsets to test on his family.A VR spin-off of Jurassic World for the Gear VR made a particular impression. “It scared the hell out of several of my family members,” he says, as the feeling of being in a forest next to a giant dinosaur, while free to look in any direction just as they would in the real world, “amplified” their emotions. “That was kind of the beginning of the mission.”Mr Bevilacqua was so convinced of the technology’s potential that he quit Knetik to launch Cognitive VR, a data-analytics company focus­ed on virtual reality.“Looking at the types of experiences and the response that people had in VR, I felt that it was a fundamentally different medium that was going to take off.”Entrepreneurs from all kinds of backgrounds are taking the same leap of faith and betting everything on VR.Felix Lajeunesse and Paul Raphael, creators of the Jurassic World VR short that wowed Mr Bevilacqua, were making commercials and art installations in 2012 when they heard about Oculus VR, the virtual reality technology company. “We were convinced of the promise of the medium almost instantly,” says Mr Raphael. “Our very first tests felt like such fundamental shifts in what storytelling could become.”The Montreal pair founded Felix & Paul Studios in 2013 and this year raised $6.8m in venture funding led by Comcast Ventures, the investment arm of the US cable group.However, most consumers have never worn a headset. While low-cost, smartphone-based viewers such as Google Cardboard and Samsung’s Gear VR have sold millions of units, more expensive PC-based headsets, such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, are estimated to have sold about 200,000 devices since they went on sale this year. PlayStation VR, seen by many as an early frontrunner in high-end headsets because it works with 40m PS4 games consoles, will not go on sale until October.The uncertainty over if and when meaningful numbers of consumers start buying VR devices raises the stakes for start-ups and their investors. “The timing is a multibillion dollar question,” says Eugene Chung, founder and chief executive of Penrose Studios, a VR content producer in San Francisco.That is no rhetorical exaggeration, judging by the sums that Google, Facebook and other Silicon Valley leaders have so far spent on VR technology. Digi-Capital, a Silicon Valley-based tech adviser, calculates that more than $2bn has been in­vest­ed over the past 12 months in start-ups in VR and so-called “augmented reality”, a related technology that blends digital images with the real world, the latest example being
Pokémon Go. While some of that went into gaming, the most likely initial market for VR, start-ups working on video, marketing, distribution and peripherals have all raised millions of dollars.Mr Raphael, who recently returned from a 360-degree video shoot with US President Barack Obama in Yosemite National Park in California, says: “We knew the market wasn’t going to ramp up overnight. But the investors and the tech companies are confident.”Mr Chung, who formerly worked on production at Pixar, Walt Disney’s animation studio,and as a venture capitalist at New Enterprise Associates, says the VR market has developed far faster than he expected. In 2014, he was the first employee in Oculus’s “film and media” unit, now Story Studio. Then Facebook swooped with its $2bn acquisition of Oculus and suddenly the tech world was paying attention to VR.“What I thought would take 10 years got condensed into something like one or two,” Mr Chung says. He quit Oculus last year to start Penrose: “It seemedobvious that this was the time to do it, rather than two or three years later.”VR content studios such as Penrose and Felix & Paul have become a particular focus of investment, while Within, previously VRSE, raised $12.7m from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Live Nation, Elisabeth Murdoch’s Freelands Ventures and 21st Century Fox. Los Angeles-based The Virtual Reality Company, which released a VR spin-off of Matt Damon movie The Martian this year, received $23m from China’s Hengxin Mobile Business, alongside individuals such as Metallica lead singer James Hetfield and Hollywood director Steven Spielberg.All see a unique opportunity to help define the creative language and storytelling style of VR.Guy Primus co-founded VRC with film-maker Robert Stromberg. He has long been an admirer of cable TV pioneer Ted Turner, who founded CNN and Turner Network Television. “I’ve been waiting . . . for my Ted Turner moment when technology and content collided in a really organic and game-changing way,” he says.Chris Milk and Aaron Koblin founded Within, whose projects include the 360-degree video Clouds Over Sidra, after working on digital arts projects, inc­lud­ing 2014’s This Exquisite Forest in the Tate Modern, London. “The promise [of VR is] that we could have the quality of the immersion and the accessibility of doing digital projects on the internet,” says Mr Koblin. “We want to be ready for what’s coming.”While many VR entrepreneurs have come to the technology in the few years since Oculus rose to prominence, others have been waiting some time for it to reach maturity. Nonny de la Peña says that after reading Virtual Reality, the 1991 book by Howard Rheingold, “I knew that was what I wanted to do.”After years researching “immersive journalism” at MIT and University of Southern California, Ms de la Peña entered the 2012 Sundance Festival with Hunger in Los Angeles, which combined computer graph­ics and audio captured at a food bank. “People were crying. Once I saw those reactions it was clear that this was going to explode.”Ms de la Peña founded Emblematic Group in 2007. It creates immersive journalism and branded content, often using computer graphics to put viewers inside scenes, from a Formula One car to a Syrian refugee camp.Yet after years of persistence, Ms de la Peña is realistic that the intensity of the hype around VR may soon cause a backlash. “I know we are in a period where there is a lot of VR crap being made,” Ms de la Peña says, “but, whatever! The quality will rise to the top . . . Something is going to happen. Something is bound to solidify out of this.”Cognitive VRFounder: Tony BevilacquaHQ: Vancouver, CanadaKiller app: Tracking VR usage, from the PCs powering headsets to “gaze tracking”, where customers are looking inside virtual worldsWhy VR: “Looking at the types of experiences and the response that people had to VR, I felt it was a fundamentally different medium that was going to take off.”Felix & Paul StudiosFounders: Felix Lajeunesse and Paul RaphaelHQ: Montreal, CanadaKiller app: Nomads, a documentary series filmed in 360-degree “cinematic VR” following nomadic tribes in Mongolia, Kenya and BorneoWhy VR: “We have a new medium now that is unique.

12;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2016-07-10T11:34:07Z;Touts in focus as ticket prices skyrocket for Broadway hit show;Resellers scoop up more than $2.6m a week on ‘Hamilton’;On Saturday night Lin-Manuel Miranda, the brains behind Hamilton, took the stage for his final performance of the Broadway hit that Michelle Obama, the First Lady, has called “the best piece of art in any form that I have ever seen in my life”.The show was already the hottest ticket in town, but in the two months since Mr Miranda announced his departure, prices on secondary ticketing websites have soared. Listings on StubHub reached as high as $25,000 for Mr Miranda’s final curtain call, even though the tickets had a face value of $177.Mr Miranda says the resales are “killing Broadway”. Hamilton alone has been losing out on about $2.6m in revenue each week to third party resellers, more than the $2m it grosses at the box office, according to a Financial Times analysis.The ticket market is the latest example of a resale market estimated to be worth $8bn worldwide.While scalping of tickets is not new, the entertainment industry has been shaken by the growing use of “bots”: sophisticated software that automatically buys tickets the moment they go online.Critics say they raise fundamental questions about how to distribute art to fans. “You shouldn’t have to fight robots just to see something you love,” Mr Miranda said last month, calling for legislation to make use of ticket bots a felony.Secondary ticketing websites, dominated by StubHub and Live Nation, which owns Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticketing company, have been criticised for enabling scalping, and the UK government in May called for a crackdown on ticket sales platforms, although it has stopped short of recommending price caps on tickets. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority has also opened a compliance review on secondary ticketing websites.In the US laws on ticket scalping vary from state to state, with Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney-general last month calling for tougher punishments for ticket resale sites that fail to reject tickets purchased through bots.Research from his office found a single bot took one minute to buy more than 1,000 tickets to a U2 concert last year, and that third-party brokers inflated ticket prices by double on average. New York’s state assembly has since voted to criminalise the use of ticket bots as a misdemeanour.Ticket sellers have rejected accusations that they allow touts to profit at the expense of fans. Ticketmaster argues that anti-resale legislation would simply redirect sales into unregulated websites, “providing an opening to unscrupulous sites and fraudsters”.Live Nation argues that the creative industry should work to combat ticket scalping through better pricing strategies.Broadway’s other big commercial success, Disney’s The Lion King, grossed $103m in 2015, its 22nd year on the stage, thanks in part to what it calls “dynamic pricing”. Much like airlines, the show’s producers tweak ticket prices to reflect demand to maximise revenues, said Rafi Mohammed, a pricing analyst. “The people behind Hamilton are super creative, but they could have been more creative with their pricing,” he says.However, Ken Davenport, a Tony-award winning producer, argues that more aggressive pricing strategies run the risk of alienating fans. He also suggests that comparing an entertainment conglomerate such as Disney, which has drawn more than $6bn out of The Lion King since its debut, to other Broadway producers is “like comparing a bodega [convenience store] to Walmart”.Hamilton’s producers “are in this very difficult situation of, how do we walk the line of meeting fiduciary responsibility to investors to make the most money, without people saying, ‘oh look, they’re being greedy’,” he says.Higher prices can taint an artist’s brand, warned Chris Carey of Media Insight Consulting: “Maybe you just accept that this is a phenomenal success, and there are other people also benefiting from the success albeit in a grey area.”Hamilton has already raised the price for premium seats to $849 starting in 2017, a record for a Broadway ticket, which lead producer Jeffrey Seller said was aimed at “taking the motivation out of the scalpers”.The majority of Broadway productions fail to break even and big shows such as Hamilton are crucial for rewarding investors who are often losing money on other shows. Hamilton has already returned an initial $12.5m in funding back to investors, a spokesperson said.Mr Davenport predicts that the controversy over robots has jolted drama producers and “fired up” investors, said Mr Davenport. He expects the industry, which has historically “kept an arm’s length” from third party brokers, will in the next few years begin to work with resellers and insist on a share of the pie.However, he says price gouging is unlikely to go away. “In this country, if you want something and are willing to pay for it, you’re going to find a way to get it,” he says. “Especially if it’s a legal substance like going to the theatre.”
13;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2016-06-28T11:46:02Z;Box office gold — Julia Hartz, CEO, Eventbrite;The online service’s co-founder on making ticketing easier and working with her ‘feminist’ husband;"Julia Hartz is sitting on an egg-yolk yellow chair in a room painted grey and white, with the straight-backed poise of a dancer.As a child growing up in Santa Cruz, California, ballet was her extracurricular pursuit. While she has long abandoned her ballet shoes, she reflects that the training has instilled in her an ability to take direction. “That’s usually not the typical entrepreneur skillset,” she laughs. Bec­oming an entrepreneur was not, after all, a childhood ambition, although she was confident she would “do well in business . . . I had that hunch”.In April she became chief executive of Eventbrite, the online ticketing service that can be used by almost any organiser of events, big or small, which she co-founded in 2006.She succeeded Kevin Hartz, who bec­ame executive chairman. The pair had been concerned that employees and business associates would continue to direct problems or questions to Mr Hartz, but that has not been the case, she says. “He is an incredible feminist and [is] just rock solid. It’s working beautifully so far.”That she has some affection for her business partner is not surprising: he is, as their shared name suggests, also her husband. Throughout the conversation in Eventbrite’s London offices in the jewellery district of Hatton Garden, she apologises for “gushing” about him. “I don’t want to sound too idealistic but we have a 50/50 partnership. It’s not like I’m doing 30 per cent more at home. We have the exact same responsibilities.”Half of Eventbrite’s employees are women, as are 40 per cent of the executive leadership team and 33 per cent of the board. Yet, despite having two daughters as well as a business with Mr Hartz, it took courage to put herself forward for the top job: “It wasn’t a given. I needed to earn it and I needed the board’s approval and support.”There is a third co-founder, Frenchman Renaud Visage, founding chief technology officer, who Ms Hartz describes as “the bravest man on the planet” for running a company with a couple. He is neither gooseberry nor mediator, she in­sists.The secret to making the three-way partnership work, she says, is a clear separation of duties: she has focus­ed on marketing, her husband on product development and Mr Visage on engineering.While Ms Hartz’s expertise in marketing and management, gained from a career in television production, complemented the skills of her business partners, it was Mr Hartz who was the experienced entrepreneur in Eventbrite’s formation. That is where the ability to take instructions learned as a ballet student came in useful. Starting a company provided a kind of “MBA on steroids”, Ms Hartz reflects.After studying communications and broadcast journalism at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Ms Hartz went into television, working for channels MTV and FX on programmes including The Shield and Nip/Tuck.It was at her MTV boss’s wedding 13 years ago that she sat next to Mr Hartz, an entrepreneur and early investor in PayPal, the online payments company. After she did a reading at the ceremony, he congratulated her, which got her at­tention. “And he was persistent.”For two years the pair shuttled bet­ween Los Angeles and San Francisco as Mr Hartz built his second start-up, Xoom, a money transfer company, and Ms Hartz developed series at FX. This time gave Ms Hartz an opportunity to live vicariously in the tech industry, ultimately persuading her that this was where she wanted to work: “Things move at a pace . . . In television things move quite slowly. It can take years to get a show off the ground.”In 2005, Mr Hartz pitched the embryonic idea of Eventbrite to his future wife. Both were taken by the concept of “democratising” ticketing for events, by allowing people to sell tickets for small events, such as a fringe theatre production or a photography show. Data are also sent back to organisers to help plan events.They believed that, as with online payments, the ticketing business was ripe for disruption. “There was no self-service platform,” she says. Just as PayPal meant people could set themselves up as merchants, the idea of Eventbrite was to challenge the dominance of the likes of ticketing agency Ticketmaster, and allow anyone to set up, say, a small ticketed yoga class. In retrospect, it was a bold move. “At the beginning we had no idea. If we’d had any idea we wouldn’t have done it . . . because it’s incredibly complicated and nuanced.”Founders share tales from the entrepreneurial frontline with the FT’s Jonathan Moules as the popular podcast returns for a second series.Today, Eventbrite employs 550 staff, in eight countries, and in the 10 years since inception has sold more than $5bn worth of tickets; last year Eventbrite processed more than 100m tickets worldwide. The largest event the company has facilitated was a Salsa Congress in Mexico in 2011 (Festival Internacional de Salsa Boca del Río) that sold almost 100,000 tickets. The company charges a percentage of the ticket price plus a fee on each ticket sold.Using money largely from the returns on Mr Hartz’s earlier investments, the trio kept things relatively lean at the start. In 2008, during the financial crisis, they tried and failed to raise funds. “That was one of the scariest moments for us because we did have people on the payroll. Everybody felt like the sky was falling — and it did for a lot of people.” While it was a difficult time to win investment, ticket sales were relatively unscathed, she says. In fact, many people were setting up events in an attempt to generate income, including meetups for the un­employed and job fairs. By the end of 2009 Eventbrite managed to obtain funds of about $6.5m from Sequoia Capital and had 30 employees.Ms Hartz declines to reveal details of revenue or profit margins, but says Eventbrite hopes to break even by the end of the year. There are no plans to sell the company but flotation is a strong possibility. “We don’t have imminent plans. That’s certainly a very challenging route, but we’re up for the challenge.”Visiting London from Eventbrite’s HQ in San Francisco, she is speaking as the UK is in the grip of Brexit fever. For her, one of the biggest issues raised by the EU referendum is the ability to hire international talent.“It’s important for us to be able to move people around the world. It’s incredibly difficult in the US to bring people in. So anything that would create a barrier would be bad for our business.”In order to meld employees — or Britelings as they are called — the husband and wife hold a weekly Hearts to Hartz session, in person and on Google hang-outs for those overseas. It is an opportunity to discuss challenges, the impact of Brexit and the chief executive succession. For Ms Hartz, Eventbrite is like a third child. “It’s a completely unconditional feeling, an almost irrational loyalty.”In Silicon Valley, notes Julia Hartz, there is almost an “arms race to give more and more time” off to an employee having a child. This is “getting a little bit nuts”, she says.Eventbrite’s policy is a minimum of 16 weeks at full pay for the primary care giver, and 12 weeks at full pay for the secondary care giver. “If it’s culturally appropriate I think that works but you have to have the entire society around that,” she says. More important is to have a sympathetic and supportive corporate culture: “It’s a big change in your life.” Eventbrite has an unofficial buddy system, whereby an employee who takes leave mentors the next new parent to do so.Her focus is to mentor and help “coach [women] through tricky situations”, particularly over issues of confidence, she adds."
14;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2016-06-17T09:40:21Z;Music festivals go upscale and corporate;Consolidation by AEG Live and Live Nation drives up prices and profits, but also improves facilities;When music festivals first started, gatherings at Woodstock in the US, and the UK’s Isle of Wight and Glastonbury were countercultural affairs imbued with a hippy spirit.Four decades on, the business of staging outdoor concerts is a multibillion-dollar industry dominated by two huge companies — Live Nation and AEG Live.In many cases the artists have not changed, but the economics have.Bob Dylan, The Who, Neil Young, The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney all appeared at 1960s and 1970s festivals, which were often free to attend. In October, all of those ageing rockers will appear at the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival in Indio, California, which charges $399 for a three-day ticket.Coachella is produced by Goldenvoice, a division of AEG Live, which is ultimately owned by billionaire Philip Anschutz. According to Billboard, it sold 198,000 tickets in 2015, raking in $84.3m, a new global record for a festival.The four next highest attended festivals in the US are owned by Live Nation, which has a market capitalisation of $4.6bn and billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Media as its largest shareholder.Glastonbury, which is expected to draw an estimated 175,000 people next weekend, remains independent and family run. But the world’s largest festival held in a green field is very much the exception.Over the past decade, Live Nation and AEG Live have acquired dozens of festivals across the world between them, including the former’s purchase of Summer Sonic in Tokyo and the Reading and Leeds festivals in the UK, and the latter’s acquisition of a controlling share in the Hangout Music Festival in Alabama last year.Their business model has been to turn high-risk, weather-dependent propositions into sustainable and profitable ventures. Able to draw the biggest artists to far-flung venues, they have the means to provide thousands of people with food, facilities and security over several days.“We’re not a Johnny-come-lately American company that is just discovering festivals,” says Joe Berchtold, Live Nation’s chief operating officer. “It’s been the linchpin of our concert business for the past 10 to 15 years.”AEG Live did not respond to requests for comment.The growing dominance of the two companies has had profound consequences for artists, music lovers and rival festivals.“Some ask whether corporatisation is a good thing or a bad thing,” says Chris Carey of Media Insight Consulting, a research group. “The answer is, it depends. In some ways, corporatisation means you’re more efficient. You get better negotiating positions. You can do global deals to the benefit of small events.”But the consolidation also runs the risk of squeezing creativity out of the sector. Describing the impact of Live Nation and AEG, one music industry analyst said: “The risk is that they buy out interesting festivals and make them less interesting.”Live Nation and AEG have done much of their spending in the United States, where audiences and promoters began to catch on to festivals in the 2000s, well after weekend-long affairs became established across Europe.Live Nation said it would continue to seek acquisitions, saying there are only a “handful” of interesting targets left in the US and Europe but “Asia and Latin America are particularly ripe for more, relative to what they have got.”Paul Reed, general manager of the UK’s Association of Independent Festivals (AIF), says AEG Live and Live Nation are becoming “more powerful and more aggressive” as they acquire attractive smaller festivals.Festival promoters make money in a number of ways. While the bulk of revenues from ticket sales goes to pay artists, operators boost their profit margins through on-site sales and corporate sponsorship.Mr Berchtold said that 10 per cent of the 63m people in 2015 who attended Live Nation concerts did so at music festivals. Festival-goers spend more per person than at single act concerts because they purchase food, drinks and other goods over a period of days.Live Nation operates around 70 festivals worldwide. In 2014, it took a majority stake in C3 Presents, which runs festivals in the US including Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits, for a reported $125m.The company said one of the main reasons it has targeted these events is that they draw millennial audiences more focused on buying experiences than goods. This in turn has attracted corporate sponsors trying to reach a younger demographic at a time when they are shifting away from watching television to spending time on social media.AEG Live’s British Summer Time Festival in London’s Hyde Park is sponsored by Barclaycard. Live Nation’s Made in America festival, founded by rapper Jay Z in 2012 in Philadelphia, is sponsored by Budweiser.Advisory group IEG calculates spending on music sponsorship in North America has risen from $1.09bn in 2010 to $1.34bn in 2014. Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch InBev and PepsiCo are among the most prolific sponsors of festivals.“We aim to win the hearts and minds of a new generation of consumers — young adults of legal drinking age,” said Anheuser-Busch InBev.Live Nation and AEG Live have also raised the bar for festivals by boosting fees for artists and surrounding their concerts with related “experiential” events, featuring other entertainment, such as comedians, immersive theatre and art.Melvyn Benn, the promoter behind Reading and Leeds festivals said in 2014 that he had seen headline talent fees increase by 400 per cent in 10 years.UK independent festivals group AIF’s 2015 audience survey found that 54 per cent of festival attendees look first at the overall character of a festival when buying a ticket, while only 7.7 per cent choose to attend based on headline acts.“Younger people want to go and choose their own adventure a lot more than just standing in a field and watching their favourite band with a pint of cider,” Mr Reed says.Other trends, such as need to create VIP “glamping” and spa options for those who want to avoid the tents and mud, have also pushed up the costs festival organising.That in turn has put pressure on independents. Even Glastonbury, which is produced by Michael Eavis and his daughter Emily in Somerset, England, made a pre-tax profit of just £86,000 on £37.3m in revenues in 2014, according to Companies House.“The margins are very tight, the expenditure is rising across the board. If you’re operating an independent festival, you’re lucky to break even within four or five years,” says Mr Reed.Live Nation predicts that festivals will continue to be big business worldwide.“One of the things that has fundamentally changed is that . . . Facebook, YouTube and Instagram have enabled a fan in Colombia to hear about new music at the same time as those in Los Angeles or London,” says Mr Berchtold.“When Beyoncé released Lemonade [the R & B artist’s latest album], that was a global event,” he says. “From Peru, Portugal to Polynesia, fans will hear the music and there is global demand. The entire way that fans become aware of and wants to see the artist is changing and a festival is a great way to connect them.”Tickets to London’s Roundhouse concert hall carry a strict warning to purchasers: ‘Any ticket that is resold will become invalid’, writes Hannah Murphy.But last month, after £65 tickets to concerts by the band Radiohead at the venue sold out within minutes, many of them were touted online hours later, this time for hundreds, even thousands, of pounds each.“Unfortunately, it’s big business,” said Brian Message, a partner in Radiohead’s management company and co-manager of musicians Nick Cave and PJ Harvey.Mr Message — and performers such as Adele and Mumford & Sons — complain that the $8bn-a-year secondary ticketing market is pricing out fans and damaging the music industry.But it is also a fast-growing business.Live Nation runs primary ticket sales platform Ticketmaster as well as secondary platforms GetMeIn and Seatwave, which take a commission from the resale of tickets on their online marketplaces.The value of ticket sales at Ticketmaster grew 12 per cent in 2015 to $25m, while sales on the group’s secondary platforms rose 34 per cent to $1.2bn.“They need to decide which side of the fence they sit on,” said Mr Message, who wants the music industry to develop more sophisticated paperless ticketing systems that would allow more control over a ticket.Harvesting of event tickets by touts who resell them at vastly inflated mark-ups is nothing new, but sophisticated software now makes it possible to engage in the practice — known as scalping — on an industrial scale.This month, Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney-general called for tougher punishments for ticket resale sites that fail to reject tickets garnered by using ‘bots’ — computer programmes that automatically scoop up tickets from a primary platforms as soon as they go online.A report by his office in January found a single bot took one minute to purchase more than 1,000 tickets to a U2 show in Manhattan in 2015. His investigation of third-party brokers alleged that they pushed up prices 49 per cent on average.Ticket scalping laws vary from country to country and, in the US, from state to state. Touting can also be prevalent around big football matches and Wimbledon.In the UK, Seatwave, GetMeIn and private competitors StubHub and Viagogo have long battled accusations from police and MPs that they encourage scalping.A review by the UK government in May called for a regulatory clampdown on the platforms, including a requirement that they publicly identify traders who sell large ticket volumes. But it stopped short of recommending price capsOn Tuesday, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority, which had also previously investigated the four platforms opened a compliance review into their practices.Ticketmaster said it “works to combat bots everyday and our industry-leading technology ensures that ticket availability and the overall ticket buying process is the best it possibly can be.”
15;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2016-03-13T16:29:29Z;Live Nation calls for more aggressive ticket pricing from artists;Chief of concert promoter says higher prices would reflect demand and tackle rise of touts;The head of the world’s biggest concert promoter has urged artists to be more aggressive in pricing tickets to reflect demand in a similar way to airlines to maximise revenues and tackle the rise of touts.Michael Rapino, chief executive of Live Nation, said that artists were missing out on billions of dollars by underpricing tickets that are snapped up by touts at face value and then resold for a profit on the $8bn-a-year secondary market.“We have to start pricing the house to match the market,” he said. “We’re only scratching the surface of the opportunity for the artist.”Live Nation generated the bulk of its $7.2bn of revenues last year from concert promotion and sold 465m tickets through its ownership of Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticketing company.Controversially, TicketMaster’s fastest-growing business is allowing people to resell tickets above face value through its secondary ticketing websites, such as Seatwave and GetMeIn.Artists including Prince, Adele and Mumford & Sons have this year accused online resale marketplaces of facilitating ticket touts and preventing ordinary fans from buying tickets at a fair price.The consumer group Which? found in an investigation last year that the four biggest resale sites — Seatwave, GetMeIn, StubHub and Viagogo — had “attracted touts operating on an industrial scale”.However, Chris Carey of Media Insight Consulting, a research group, said that artists had good reasons to be wary of selling tickets at market-clearing prices. “The perception of price gouging would lead to disastrous PR” and could undermine their relationship with fans, he said.Mr Rapino said “there is no simple answer” to the secondary market, and “no right or wrong”. But he argued that reselling would remain rife until artists “price the product at what the market is able to pay”.While Mr Rapino argued that the live music industry had a lot to learn from the airline industry, he stopped short of calling for the wholesale adoption of “dynamic pricing”, or adjusting prices in real time based on demand.The perception of price gouging would lead to disastrous PR“We don’t believe that true dynamic pricing is right for all fans,” he said. “We want to make sure that the fan never gets penalised for buying early. We don’t want to start dropping prices along the way.”Rather than price every ticket dynamically, he suggested that a concert tour might have a dozen different tickets tiers from $20 to $4,000, depending on factors such as the day of the show and the location of the seat.Charging significantly higher prices for the best seats would allow artists to charge lower prices for less desirable seats that might otherwise have gone unsold, he said. “Catching the top end allows you to subsidise the bottom end.”
16;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2016-02-29T12:13:40Z;Ticket resellers reject rip-off accusations;Sites such as StubHub and Viagogo say they provide safe marketplace;The world’s largest ticket reselling sites have defended themselves against accusations that they allow professional touts to profit at the expense of fans.StubHub, Viagogo and Seatwave have told Professor Michael Waterson, who is leading an independent review into ticket resale for the UK government, that they provide safe and transparent marketplaces valued by consumers.The companies warned that placing restrictions on their activities would drive ordinary ticket-buyers to unscrupulous online marketplaces and touts on the street.“Unworkable anti-resale legislation simply pushes consumers to unregulated offshore sites, providing an opening to unscrupulous sites and fraudsters,” said Ticketmaster, which owns resale sites GetMeIn and Seatwave.A battle over how people buy and sell tickets has intensified over the past year, after the UK introduced new disclosure requirements for resellers and raised the possibility of additional restrictions. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 said that anyone who resold tickets online had to disclose detailed information such as the seat number.This requirement for increased disclosure was billed as a measure to stop criminals selling counterfeit or stolen tickets. But some concert promoters and sporting event organisers have taken advantage of the new rules to penalise touts. Late last year, Adele identified and cancelled more than 100 tickets to her forthcoming tour that were listed for resale in online marketplaces.With Prof Waterson due to report his findings in May, many people in the live events sector want even tighter restrictions on ticket resale, arguing that doing so would protect fans from price gouging by touts. Some even want reselling banned.Unworkable anti-resale legislation simply pushes consumers to unregulated offshore sites …But StubHub, Viagogo and Ticketmaster said resale restrictions would harm consumers. StubHub, which is owned by Ebay, cited a survey that found two-thirds of 2,000 respondents believed they should be free to resell their tickets however they liked.Oliver Wheeler, a spokesman for Viagogo, said consumers would always seek to resell. “Whether it was people selling tickets to see the gladiators 2,000 years ago, or in the future people selling tickets on the moon, it will always happen,” he said.“A legitimate, transparent online marketplace such as the one offered by Viagogo is the only practical and realistic solution to street touting and fraudulent selling.”Viagogo and its peers have come in for heavy criticism because of suspicion that they facilitate large-scale ticket reselling by touts. The consumer group Which? found in an investigation last year that the four big secondary ticketing sites had “attracted touts operating on an industrial scale”.Ticketmaster said headline-grabbing examples of tickets being offered for thousands of pounds were unrepresentative, and that 40 per cent of all tickets listed in GetMeIn were in fact sold at below face value.It added that just 1-3 per cent of all ticket sales took place on the secondary market.StubHub argued that the most effective way to keep tickets out of the hands of touts would be for event organisers to more closely scrutinise buyers in the primary market.The company also claimed that those lobbying against resale were driven by greed rather than the interests of consumers. It said that event owners wanted to hamstring independent marketplaces “to gain complete commercial control of the resale market and thereby capture profits while depriving consumers of the benefits of open resale”.
17;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2015-11-20T17:18:02Z;IAC/ Angie’s List: Home Improvement;Take heart fallen unicorns, tech juggernauts can still ride to the rescue;A reliable plumber or electrician — they are reputed to exist — is worth paying extra for. Barry Diller’s IAC may soon be paying a similar safety premium. IAC has long acquired, nurtured and spun off successful digital businesses. Among its trophies are Expedia, Ticketmaster, and most recently, the online dating business Match Group. Its next hot prospect is home repair referral business HomeAdvisor. It will reach $400m in annual revenue this year.The US home services market is estimated to be worth $400bn annually. Monsters Amazon and Google want to muscle their way in. To fend them off, IAC has recently made an $800m unsolicited bid for Angie’s List (rebuffed for now), another established local trade site which would complement HomeAdvisor.Angie’s List was founded by Angie Hicks, who created a website in the 1990s collating reviews of local home contractors. It listed its shares in 2011 at $13/share. By summer this year the shares had drifted down to $4, despite its 3.2m paid members. Unsurprisingly, an activist investor, recently called for Angie’s List to sell itself to a deep-pocketed buyer.Angie’s List both sells subscriptions to consumers and charges service providers to advertise. HomeAdvisor is different — it operates a marketplace where users solicit a project that is then “matched” with contractor bids.A hostile offer is not IAC’s style. Angie’s List’s underperformance leaves it vulnerable though. And a crowded playing field in local commerce includes Yelp and Groupon as other potential suitors. IAC may offer shares in lieu of cash providing Angie’s List shareholders upside in future gains, a nice sweetener given IAC’s record in building businesses.Internet companies with lots of page views and users, but thin profits, have value to those who wish to subcontract growth rather than building it themselves.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
18;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2015-11-12T19:33:10Z;John Malone: give him Liberty;TV dealmaking looks like a chess match these days;Chess moves rarely make sense until four or five subsequent ones have been executed. By that time, checkmate often looms. Few players are more cunning than media tycoon John Malone, who on Thursday announced a series of manoeuvres among his Liberty pieces. Most of these moves relate to two US companies, Liberty Media and Liberty Interactive. Each already has multiple share classes, and both plan to create more.Liberty Media has three classes of stock. Holders of those shares will receive new shares in Liberty Braves (owner of the Atlanta Braves baseball team), Liberty Sirius (owner of satellite radio company Sirius XM) and Liberty Media (the holding company for much else, including stakes in Live Nation, Viacom, and Time Warner).At the same time Liberty Interactive’s four share classes will turn into six, with new listings for CommerceHub and Expedia. At least there are no changes at the largest part of the empire — Liberty Broadband, which owns a quarter of television distributor Charter Communications.The spin-offs are rational in one way: they allow direct exposure to individual business units. But in another sense, they are pointless — companies such as SiriusXM, Expedia and Live Nation are already listed. Investors can already buy shares in them directly.The more interesting developments may be taking place away from the Liberty asset-shuffling. Two other Malone entities, Discovery Communications and Liberty Global, have taken a collective 7 per cent stake in Lionsgate, the studio group behind Hunger Games and Mad Men. Cable television may have been Mr Malone’s focus in recent years, but the Lionsgate deal suggests an interest in combining content assets.All of which makes for a confusing chess board. Perhaps Mr Malone has a master plan. But for the moment, the Liberty empire risks looking directionless.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
19;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2015-08-28T15:23:33Z;SFX Entertainment: going for a song;Concert promoter turns up the sound but cannot find a buyer;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. For some people (notably the sellers), the clearest sign of a successful equity listing is that the stock never trades above that IPO price, suggesting the company maximised the proceeds. So take a bow Deutsche Bank, Jefferies and UBS, the banks that took SFX Entertainment public in 2013.SFX is a concert promoter created by entertainment entrepreneur Robert FX Sillerman. He wanted to replicate in electronic dance music festivals what he did in the concert business. In the 1990s he bought several regional concert promoters, eventually consolidating them and selling the business to Clear Channel for $4.4bn. That business became Live Nation. The outcome for SFX will be different as its share price, which was $13 at the IPO is down to $1, implying an equity value of $100m.SFX has been an enthusiastic buyer of businesses, spending $10m or $20m at a time. Most of its revenue comes from ticket sales (for events such as Electric Zoo, Tomorrowland and Life in Color) but it also sells sponsorships and has a streaming music site. However direct costs chew up about 90 per cent of revenue and cash flow has been negative. Its $300m of gross debt is another drag.To add to the intrigue, Mr Sillerman had a signed deal to buy the two-thirds of the company he did not own. But following a fall in the company’s share price, the deal has been pulled. The founder now owes SFX an $8m termination fee. It is still seeking a buyer and could be had for a song — one with a thumping beat.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
20;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2015-07-22T11:59:39Z;Strategies to soothe disrupted staff;The art of people management when a business is under attack;"We are said to be living in the age of disruption. Technology is enabling start-ups to overturn traditional businesses. The likes of Uber and Airbnb are threatening the taxi business and the travel industry. Carmakers are competing with tech companies such as Google.For those in charge of established companies, devising strategies to stay afloat is a priority but they also need to manage employees’ anxieties. I asked veteran business leaders, consultants and a workplace researcher for tips on handling staff in such circumstances.John Reid
Former CEO of Warner Music EuropeAt Warner, Mr Reid gained first-hand experience of how the recorded music industry was the canary in the coal mine for digital disruption. The sort of structural upheaval that ravaged CD sales can prompt an “existential fear among employees”, he observes. It meant that talented people left the industry, believing that they had no future.Today, he says, the recorded music industry is competing with the likes of Google for staff. “That’s a challenge. You still want bright, contemporary thinkers entering the industry.” Smaller budgets mean more work for remaining staff. But staff retention is aided by emotional attachment to the product.For some, the challenge and excitement of digital disruption in itself is compelling. Staff have to adapt, learning new technical skills, spotting new challengers and also new markets.Mr Reid left the recorded music industry for live music and now leads the European operations of global concert operator, Live Nation. He admits to feeling much happier “now I’m not cutting costs and instead, growing a company”. Nonetheless, he knows he cannot afford to be complacent. “Live music is not immune to digital disruption,” particularly when it comes to ticketing.Tammy Erickson
Executive fellow at London Business SchoolMs Erickson’s research has been on managing a changing workforce. “We tend to join a company or industry with a future in mind,” she observes. “When an industry goes through transition, employees feel the psychological contract has been broken.”She looked at US utilities after the market was deregulated in the 1990s, and found that employees who had joined for a stable career were distressed when told to be entrepreneurial and take risks.‘You have to say “I know you joined for this reason but things have changed”’Ms Erickson believes it is important that management acknowledges the problem. “You have to say ‘I know you joined for this reason but things have changed.’” Managers need to be clear about what they can give in return for employees’ loyalty. “It might be that you offer professional development. If that is the case, you have to make it happen.” This could mean exposure to a broader range of aspects of the business or mentoring.The risk is that you lose valuable staff, she says. “So employers need to come up with compelling propositions, to explain why [you should] work for them rather than someone else.” Yet there is always the risk, she notes, that employers are as paralysed as employees when faced by new challengers.Mark Fields
Ford Motor chief executiveEmployees at the 112-year-old carmaker are asked to bring a start-up mentality to the venerable company, which is trying to find an edge in emerging fields such as driverless vehicles and big data.‘The most important recruiting tool is giving people meaningful work’How does the company woo staff? “The most important recruiting tool is giving people meaningful work,” says Mr Fields. “That is what attracts new team members and retains those already here.” New facilities, such as Ford’s research and innovation centre in Palo Alto, can help.Employee development is important, Mr Fields stresses. “The idea of making a career in one company might seem dated.” Many young employees are surprised that he has been with Ford for 26 years. During that time, he has had “eight or nine different careers”, he explains.Kay Trainor
Tavistock Consulting
Traditionally, employee anxiety may have been managed through reassuring organisational structures and clarity of task, says Ms Trainor, a London-based organisational consultant. An employee had a boss and both worked for a company that knew what it did, making “widgets” or similar products for a specific market. The employee might not have liked his boss and found it boring that the company made just widgets, privately wondering if they should have been sold in other markets.‘The move is from command and control to psychological presence and negotiation’But because of the structure and clarity of the set-up, he was forced to keep his counsel, get on with making widgets and put up with his boss, who told him what to do. This she likens to having strict parents. “One of the effects was that the employee was spared the anxiety of ‘freedom’. He knew his place.”In an era of disruption “all bets are off”. Traditional boundaries and structures do not exist any more: it is often up to the individual employee to negotiate and justify his or her own role continuously. “We’re in the world of the ‘personal brand’.” Management in this context becomes more psychological, she says. “The move is from command and control to psychological presence and negotiation.”Simon Fox
Chief executive, Trinity MirrorMost industries are facing some form of disruption, says Simon Fox, who has experience of it in two sectors: newspapers, with Trinity Mirror; and CD and DVD retailing, at his former employer HMV, which he left in 2012.Some of the sectors undergoing drastic change are in their death throes, he says, before insisting that it is different in journalism: “Print is in decline but the demand is there for news.”Mr Fox says the key to steadying the workforce in such situations is to lay out as clear a vision as possible. “You need to get people to buy into it or leave.”His mantra is “don’t hide”. He adds: “As long as what you say is true, people believe you.” For this reason, Mr Fox regularly updates staff. Ultimately, he believes that if the company treats employees well, they will stay.Those that did so at HMV during his tenure as chief executive might well have regretted that loyalty, however, given that the structurally-challenged business went into administration in 2013 shortly after he left, although it has since been resurrected.The nature of journalism and retail is different, he notes. “For journalists, it is a career and a vocation. At HMV, the skills were transferable, they could work in other [retailers].”Payal Vasudeva
Managing director, Accenture strategyGone are the days when incumbents had time to react to disruption, says Ms Vasudeva. “New ideas can reach millions in weeks and transform markets in months. Think how smartphone apps killed the sat nav sector.”Nonetheless, she feels that large companies will make more of the running over the next 10 years, as long as they change the way that they manage their staff. “Employees — especially younger digital natives — are best placed to detect the next big threat or to suggest the next big thing.” They must be given the permission to do so, she says.Innovation must become continuous experimentation, with employees at all levels free to exploit digital platforms to come up with new ideas. That requires tolerating higher levels of risk and matching employee creativity with organisational agility."
21;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2015-04-10T17:05:12Z;Ticketmaster: scalp hunting;It matters whether you can resell that ticket;"Is a ticket to a football match a piece of property? Or a licence that grants certain rights? Two of the world’s largest ticket sellers, Ticketmaster and StubHub, differ on the answer. StubHub runs a marketplace for reselling tickets; Ticketmaster is a primary seller. The difference is not academic. StubHub sued Ticketmaster (and US basketball’s Golden State Warriors) after season ticket holders who resold on StubHub were barred from buying subsequent season passes.The ticket business is worth fighting over. The US resale market sees about $5bn in transactions a year, twice the level of five years ago. Fees on online sales (both primary and secondary) come to $4bn a year, thinks IbisWorld. Ticketmaster, owned by Live Nation, saw ticketing revenue rise 10 per cent last year to $1.6bn. StubHub, owned by eBay, does not report revenues, but estimates hover around $3bn in transactions annually. Its “take” is between a fifth and a quarter — hundreds of millions of dollars annually, large enough that StubHub’s financials will be broken out after the eBay/PayPal split.StubHub pioneered online ticket scalping (secondary sales, if you prefer). But now the market is getting more crowded. Ticketmaster is selling secondary tickets, and has a big advantage: being part of Live Nation, a live-events company that also handles artist management and sponsorship. Content drives ticket sales. Live Nation reports big losses on its concert segment, but the concerts help drive profits in ticketing and sponsorship. Ticketmaster accounts for a third of Live Nation’s operating income — the rest is sponsorships.Major venues and sports teams are also becoming more proactive in deciding how their tickets are sold and resold — often demanding a cut of the fees. StubHub has an agreement with UK soccer club Tottenham Hotspur, for example. But Live Nation’s network of venues and artists still far outweighs StubHub’s. In this battle, content may be king.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
22;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2014-01-06T15:34:05Z;Sirius XM / Liberty: change the station;Investors should allocate their capital and not defer to Malone;Shareholders in the satellite radio provider Sirius XM have had a grand five years. Now they must decide if they want to diversify into baseball, bookstores, concerts and cable TV. Liberty Media, a John Malone investment vehicle that contains these diverse interests, is offering its shares in exchange for the 47 per cent of Sirius that it does not already own. Liberty’s shares have gained 35 per cent in the past year, more than twice Sirius’s return. But Liberty’s key investments also happen to be publicly traded. So why put Mr Malone, rather than investors, in charge of capital allocation?Liberty’s market value is $17bn. Its stake in Sirius is worth $12bn. Alongside, it has minority stakes in concert promoter Live Nation ($1bn), cable TV provider Charter ($4bn) and bookstore Barnes & Noble ($200m). Cash and other investments, including the Atlanta Braves baseball team, essentially net to zero against Liberty’s debt.The premium that Liberty is offering for Sirius shares is just 5 per cent, but this is not grounds for complaint. Liberty already has control, so Sirius shareholders are just exchanging a minority stake in one company for another. The question for Sirius holders, then, is whether they want to own the new Liberty. Post-merger, Liberty will have an equity value of $27bn, of which $22bn reflects the radio business. But then there is its rumoured buyout of Time Warner Cable via Charter. Full consolidation of Sirius will enable Liberty to raise debt more easily, putting the cable company, with its $37bn market cap, within reach.Such a deal would be complex and pricey. And if Sirius investors want that risk (and potential reward), they can buy Charter shares directly. Similarly, Barnes & Noble and Live Nation are also listed companies. So take the modest premium, sell the Liberty shares and make your own portfolio choices. As for what was lost – a satellite radio pure play – its heyday may have passed. The shares are up 2,500 per cent since 2009.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
23;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2013-11-12T22:26:16Z;U2 and Madonna managers come under the Live Nation tent;;Two management companies representing U2 and Madonna are close to being folded into Live Nation Entertainment in a deal that gives the concert and venue promoter new influence in artist representation.Under the deal, Paul McGuinness’s Principle Management and Guy Oseary’s Maverick will become part of Artist Nation, Live Nation’s artist management company.Mr McGuinness, the manager of U2 since 1978, will become chairman of Principle following the deal. Mr Oseary, who manages Madonna, will become chief executive.Mr McGuinness stands to make approximately $30m from the deal, according to people familiar with the situation. Bono, U2’s lead singer, played an active role in the negotiations, they said.The deal is indicative of an escalating war for top touring talent in the music industry, where rising ticket prices and expanding audiences have kept the live music business growing even as CD sales collapsed.“It could be seen as slightly poor etiquette for a manager to consider retiring before his artist has split, quit or died,” said Mr McGuinness. “But U2 has never subscribed to the rock and roll code of conduct.”He added that he had “resolved to take a less hands on role” as he approached “the musically relevant age of 64”.Artist Nation currently represents more than 200 clients, including acts such as Rihanna, Shakira and Kings of Leon.Live Nation declined to comment.The deal brings two of music’s biggest touring acts into the Live Nation fold. U2’s 360 tour is still the most lucrative ever staged, grossing more than $700m.Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
24;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2013-10-09T16:04:09Z;SFX: the beat goes on;New business is a cover of the Live Nation tune remixed as electronic dance music;Even the best music acts repeat themselves. If there is a melody that resonates with the audience, why mess with a good thing? The suits who run the music business rely on the same trick. Two decades ago, Robert FX Sillerman combined scattered promoters of rock and pop and turned them into Live Nation.Now his SFX Entertainment, which begins trading on Wednesday, is a cover of the same tune, though remixed as electronic dance music (EDM). And investors seem to have caught the euphoria the millennials feel at EDM confabs – SFX’s share offering was upsized and priced at $13, the high end of the range. But when the pulsating beat finally fades at 6am, the case for owning SFX rests on a demographic whose fickle tastes have glorified and then ditched brands such as Abercrombie & Fitch.Avicii and Skrillex may not be household names, but the multi-day festivals (with titles such as Defqon1) where they spin pack in thousands of neon-clad kids. The EDM market is estimated to be $4.5bn in 2013 (Live Nation’s concert revenues alone total $4bn). But attendance growth at the biggest events has been 40 per cent annually during the past five years. SFX’s strategy is about both the growing market (plenty more cities can host large EDM events) and squeezing synergies from the acquisition of far-flung shows. Much of the $260m in IPO proceeds will go to finance already announced deals.At its current enterprise value of $1bn, SFX trades at three times forward revenue and more than 20 times operating cash flow. While it is growing quickly, acquired and organic growth should be distinguished. Nearly all of SFX 2012 revenue is from dealmaking.The ever-hip Mr Sillerman has also attached a social/web presence, Beatport, to SFX. It contributes just a quarter of group revenue. SFX’s valuation implies that it will be the headliner in the near future.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
25;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2013-06-21T10:28:40Z;Live Nation revels as clamour for gigs reaches crescendo;;"A year ago it was the setting for a triumphant London Olympics but these days the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is rocking to a different beat.Music, rather than athletics, is now pulling in the crowds: next month Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake will headline a two-day music festival promoted by Live Nation Entertainment, the concert promoter that bought Ticketmaster in 2009 for $400m.Live Nation used to stage the festival in Hyde Park but an all-star show last summer featuring Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen ended in silent disarray when the performers played beyond their curfew and the plug was pulled mid-song. After that, Live Nation was keen to find another home.“The negativity was growing,” says Michael Rapino, Live Nation’s chief executive at the company’s Beverly Hills headquarters, when asked about relations with the Hyde Park operator. Noise restrictions and logistical issues were making it difficult to stage events there, he says. “We were looking for somewhere to put on those above and beyond shows. We knew Olympic Park well and we thought: ‘This is not a place that finds the show an inconvenience.’”The switch to a new London venue – a city Mr Rapino calls the concert industry’s “global leader” – comes as Live Nation last week prevailed in court against CTS Eventim, a European ticketing services company. CTS had claimed Live Nation breached a software licensing agreement; the International Court of Arbitration ruled that Live Nation had validly terminated its agreement.The shares spiked following the ruling. Live Nation shares have risen more than 70 per cent in the past 12 months.Live Nation has restructured its operations since the takeover of Ticketmaster, which has coincided with the return to health of live touring. The industry is on course for its best year since before the financial crisis, boosted by an expanding global marketplace and new arenas. “Every new major economic development project around the world has a sports arena or amphitheatre as its tent pole,” says Rich Tullo, director of research at Albert Fried & Co, a broker-dealer. “These places want Lady Gaga and Rihanna to tour.”Live music has picked up the slack over the last decade even as recorded music sales has deteriorated due to piracy and a digital distribution model that does not favour album sales.In fact the growth in live music will “more than offset the continued decline in recorded music revenues”, according to PwC. It estimates that sales of tickets and sponsorship will generate revenues of $30.9bn in 2017, up from $26.5bn in 2012.Touring is being boosted by artists that are prepared to tour for longer – and go global. “They are playing more and more dates outside North America,” says Mr Rapino. “It used to be that they would play Europe and North America but now Asia and Latin America are also part of the conversation.”The expansion of social media means the promotion of tours has also changed, he says. The stars are now more involved – particularly those with large online followings. “Stars like Rihanna now have a global audience [on social networks] well beyond what MTV [and] radio used to deliver.”Life for Live Nation has not always been smooth since the Ticketmaster takeover, with the deal facing considerable regulatory scrutiny before it was eventually given the all-clear in 2010. More recently, Irving Azoff, the combative manager of acts including The Eagles and Christina Aguilera, quit as Live Nation chairman in January.That was in January but since then, the shares have continued to climb. John Malone’s Liberty Media has increased its holding in the company from 20 to more than 25 per cent and the company will shortly launch its first new product since the merger, with a service that allows customers to buy tickets on the secondary market.Mr Rapino, who began his career at Labatt Breweries, is refocusing Live Nation’s efforts on selling advertising. “We had to take advertising from a low level – selling signs on site – to becoming a media business. We know you’re going to be at the venue, we’re talking to you along the way. We have your email address, your mobile phone . . . and then I can put a banner or a sample on the seat you’re about to sit down on.”The company also realised it was sitting on a treasure trove of customer data from 400m customers, he adds. When Live Nation bought Ticketmaster “there were 14 fragmented databases that didn’t talk to each other”, he says. The company has built one global database “to bring [the data] to life”.“If you’re the LA Dodgers you have data on everyone who comes to a Dodgers game. What you don’t have is everyone else in LA who maybe hasn’t come to a Dodgers game or who hasn’t come in a few years. We can show them data about customers who went to other sporting events or concerts that are highly likely to want to see the Dodgers.”The takeover of Ticketmaster married the content – the music from concerts promoted by Live Nation – to distribution, as represented by Ticketmaster’s ticket sales. Live Nation never had a way to reach consumers directly, he says. But now it does. “Artists will always gravitate to anyone who can distribute their content, whether it’s a radio station for their music or MTV for their video. We wanted to be the one shaking the consumer’s hand.”"
26;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2013-04-18T17:06:36Z;Deals shed light on Liberty chief’s role;;"John Malone’s portrait hangs in the boardroom of Liberty Media’s Colorado headquarters, and outside the window is a bronze eagle given to him by his wife. Mr Malone, Liberty’s chairman and America’s largest landowner, owns much of the land between the statue and the Rocky Mountains in the distance.The cable pioneer and feng shui follower decorated the building on the 60-acre site in Englewood, near Denver, with South African mahogany to remind him of the interior of his 82-foot yacht, and styled the company logo after the drains on its deck.It is not a setting in which a number two can easily escape from the shadow of the man who built TeleCommunications Inc (TCI) into America’s largest cable company, helped start channels from CNBC to Discovery, jousted with Rupert Murdoch and now oversees an empire stretching from Dutch cable operators to QVC’s shopping channel.Yet a string of recent deals, in which Liberty Media spun off the Starz channel, took control of Sirius XM satellite radio, built a stake in Barnes & Noble and returned to cable distribution by buying 27 per cent of Charter Communications, has started to shine a light on Greg Maffei’s role as chief executive.“The thing to understand about Greg is he’s ADD,” Mr Malone says. Liberty Media, too, could be said to suffer from attention deficit disorder. Mr Maffei says no unifying principle connects its diverse assets because “we’re usually way too opportunistic”.Mr Maffei, who recently became chairman of Sirius, Starz and Live Nation, the concert promoter for such chart-topping acts as Rihanna and U2, identifies one constant theme amid Liberty’s shuffling: aggressive returns of capital to shareholders, designed to incur the minimum of corporation tax.“It hasn’t been about building the empire or trying to build a bigger enterprise. It has been about trying to build shareholder value,” he says. “How many media companies have spun off as much as we have?” he asks.In the 1980s, John Malone seized the opportunity that loose regulations offered cable to turn TCI into “an ungodly successful model”, Greg Maffei says, but his $54bn sale of TCI to AT&T in 1999 left interests in many channels and their parent companies that made little sense without “the big kahuna” at the centre, writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson.Mr Maffei points to four significant moves to make sense of the portfolio since he joined Liberty in 2006. .First, it sold small stakes in “mediocre” investments such as On Command and Open TV; then it swapped its voting stock in News Corp for a controlling holding in DirecTV, which it subsequently spun off.Third was a $530m rescue investment in Sirius, which feared bankruptcy in 2009 as car sales plunged. “We were lucky on timing, on structure and everything,” Mr Maffei says, before adding that Liberty’s bottom-of-the-market move was based on an analysis that Sirius’s liquidation value would exceed its investment.Fourth, Liberty has bought back about 45 per cent of its stock since he joined, at an average price of below $40 compared with its $109.39 valuation on Wednesday night. That has driven up its net asset value dramatically.The remaining holdings are scattered around several companies.As well as Liberty Media, there is the newly spun-off Starz and Liberty Interactive, home to digital brands from Evite to Bodybuilding.com, which is split into two tracking stocks. Liberty Global, the non-US cable business, which has made headline-grabbing deals with Virgin Media and Ziggo in Europe, is run by Mike Fries.The largest assets now held by Liberty represent a series of bets. At Sirius, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of Liberty Media’s value in analysts’ models, the question is how Liberty can extract the value created by its comeback.Mr Maffei says a large dividend or buyback is “likely” now Liberty has control of Sirius, but offers few clues as regards timing.Charter is a bet on America’s appetite for high-speed broadband, and on consolidation in the cable sector creating savings. At Live Nation, the concert business, Liberty sees new ticketing technology leading to a more efficient conversion of earnings to cash.It could as easily cut its 27 per cent stake in Live Nation as add to it, however. “We’re Liberty. We never know whether we want the stock to go up or down,” he says. Across its portfolio, it might buy more if prices fall or sell if they rise.The $2.6bn Charter deal used up the net cash Liberty was left with after the Starz split, but Mr Maffei sees up to $1bn of “non-core stuff” in its portfolio and says with cheap financing on offer it would love to borrow “as much as we could, prudently”.Valuations for potential acquisition targets are more expensive than in 2009 but more international exposure remains an aspiration and Liberty has explored markets including Brazil, Turkey and Spain, he says.Liberty Media, with a capitalisation of $13.3bn, trades below net asset value. The discount has narrowed but is not illogical because “there’s some risk we’ll do a stupid deal”, Mr Maffei says. “We’ve been lucky that some of the big ones have worked out and covered our sins.”Asked whether Liberty might take a break from new deals to absorb its recent moves, he suggests the shark must keep swimming: “My gosh, Liberty without deals? What would that mean?” he laughs.A former chief financial officer to Bill Gates and Larry Ellison, Mr Maffei is used to working for prominent figures. According to one adviser: “Greg’s a great investor. He understands opportunities and is very detail-oriented, but it’s John’s vision.”“More normally, it’s me proposing – or the team and I proposing, more accurately – and John blessing, saying grace on it,” Mr Maffei says. “It’s not like John is always sitting back waiting to say yes or no, but he’s just got a breadth of interests.”Now, he says, Mr Malone is stepping back a little to concentrate on just three boards: Liberty Media, Liberty Global and Discovery, where he holds a large personal stake. “John doesn’t want to be burdened by a lot of the day-to-day, but no major decision gets made without John buying in,” he says.Mr Maffei, one of media’s highest-paid executives, could play an even larger role in the long term. Mr Malone, who holds 83.7 per cent of Liberty Media’s super-voting B shares, told CNBC last week his will dictates that his management teams will have the opportunity to buy his controlling stock after his death."
27;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2013-04-08T22:51:34Z;Universal wins rights to Jay Z label;;Universal Music, fresh from cementing its position as the world’s largest music company by acquiring most of EMI’s record labels, has won a contest for distribution rights to artists under Jay Z’s Roc Nation label.Roc Nation, the label founded by rapper-entrepreneur Shawn “Jay Z” Carter and financed by Live Nation, the live music group, had been distributed since 2009 through Epic, the Sony Music-owned label. The prospect of its contract with Sony expiring had triggered what one person familiar with the process described as a “hugely competitive” battle for the rights to distribute artists under one of the most successful labels of recent years.Universal would not disclose how much it was paying Roc Nation, but the multiyear, global deal will give it a share of the revenues from forthcoming albums from Jay Z and Rihanna, who has been signed to Universal but managed by Roc Nation. Other artists including J Cole and Rita Ora remain under contract to Sony for further albums but will transfer when those contracts expire.The deal comes days after Roc Nation launched a sports management arm, signing Robinson Cano, the New York Yankees second baseman, as its first client. In February, Roc Nation moved an administration deal for its music publishing to Warner Chappell from Sony ATV, the joint venture between Sony and Michael Jackson’s estate.Distribution deals with large companies are common for smaller labels without the resources to distribute CDs globally and to negotiate with large digital download, streaming and radio services.The Roc Nation agreement brings Jay Z back to Universal, which is owned by France’s Vivendi. Already one of the world’s biggest selling artists, he spent three years as president of Universal’s Def Jam Recordings, where he signed Rihanna and Kanye West before leaving to launch Roc Nation.Lucian Grainge, Universal’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement: “In just five years, Roc Nation has established itself as one of the most successful brands in music with a reputation for developing some of today’s most influential and popular talent.”The new deal “extends our relationship with the extraordinary Rihanna and represents a homecoming for Jay Z – a brilliant artist and entrepreneur, who has been a creative cornerstone of our company,” he added.In the announcement, Jay Z hailed what he called “a new age deal”, giving Roc Nation “a unique opportunity [of] being able to continue to operate as an independent label with the strength, power and reach of the best major.”Smaller rivals lobbied against Universal’s bid for EMI, arguing that enlarging the market share of the global market leader would make it harder for them to compete for new artists or for large deals.
28;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2013-03-06T18:53:08Z;Insurers sued over cancelled Lady Gaga show;;Lady Gaga’s production company and promoter are suing three Lloyd’s of London insurance syndicates for not paying out on terrorism policies, after threats from Islamic extremists prompted them to cancel her concert in Jakarta.The legal action has arisen after the singer pulled out last June from a sold-out show in the Indonesian capital, which the hardline Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) vowed to disrupt because it claimed the concert amounted to “satanic worship”.It comes amid growing concerns from companies that insurers are exploiting technicalities and semantics to turn down legitimate claims. The Law Commission in England is proposing to tighten the legal framework.Lady Gaga’s production company, Mermaid Touring, together with Live Nation, a major American concert promoter, and The Atom Factory, which is owned by her manager Troy Carter, said in a claim filed in the US District Court in Los Angeles on March 3 that they had “suffered significant damages” as a result of the cancelled concert.They claimed the insurers – two syndicates operated by Beazley and one operated by Talbot at the historic Lloyd’s market – had refused to pay out based on “language and purported conditions that are not contained in the terrorism policies”.The plaintiffs said this was “unreasonable, without proper cause and in bad faith”.They are seeking damages of at least $150,000 for breach of contract and breach of good faith and fair dealing, as well as legal costs and further punitive damages.The Beazley syndicates are managed by the London-listed insurer, which also puts up 80 per cent of the capital. The remainder of the funding is supplied by so-called Lloyd’s names, or private investors.In a statement Beazley said: “We don’t comment on matters that are the subject of litigation. We always seek to pay all valid claims as quickly as possible.”Talbot is owned by Validus, the Bermuda-based insurer. Both declined to comment.A growing number of international artists, from Sting to Stevie Wonder, are going to Indonesia to tap into the rapidly increasing spending power of the middle class.The proposed concert by Lady Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, stirred up an enthusiastic response from her fans as well as the FPI, a small but vocal, and sometimes violent, group that saw an opportunity to flex its muscles and generate publicity.After speaking out against her penchant for skimpy outfits and flirtatious lyrics, FPI members pledged to stop the concert from going ahead and the local police prevaricated over whether to grant a public performance permit.Her promoters said they decided to cancel the concert on May 17 “in order to prevent bodily injury and property damage and to protect the lives and safety of Lady Gaga”, her crew and the public.Previous terrorist incidents have given rise to disputes over insurance coverage. The World Trade Center attacks resulted in legal debates about whether the losses arose out of two events – one for each tower – rather than one overall event.
29;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2013-03-03T18:50:04Z;Europe is hot ticket for Live Nation;;Live Nation, the global music promoter and venue operator, has doubled its European stadium count and raised its number of arenas by almost a third on the back of a revival in demand for live music in the region, writes Daniel Thomas.The US group, which last year handled tours by Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay and Rihanna, has been in a battle with rival AEG for the rights to secure the biggest venues in the region.Live Nation secured the rights for events at the Olympic Stadium in east London, although AEG, which has been put up for sale, has acquired sites such as Hammersmith Apollo and won the contract to run events in Hyde Park in the last year.On the back of rising demand for tickets since the beginning of the year, Live Nation will this week announce further expansion plans for Europe. The group will increase the number of arenas that show its acts by 29 per cent to almost 5,000, and will increase its stadium count in Europe from 30 to 69.Live Nation said that there had been a sharp rise in ticket sales of about a quarter in Europe in the first six weeks of 2013. The company has forecast strong double-digit growth in both revenue and volume of arena and stadium shows in 2013. Much of demand for tickets was in the UK, according to the group, which runs festivals in the country such as Creamfields, Latitude and Download.This week, Live Nation is due to announce that Springsteen will headline the Hard Rock Calling festival, which has been moved to the Olympic Park. Live Nation’s events at former venue Hyde Park ran into controversy last year after a performance featuring Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen was cut short because of a curfew.Live music revenues were sluggish after the financial crash in 2009, with some big name stars failing to sell out their tours, but have been stronger in the past 18 months in part owing to a surge in popular artists going on the road.Michael Rapino, chief executive, told investors after its results last month that ticket sales had been strong since the start of the year. More than 100,000 tickets for the Wireless festival were sold on the first day last week.
30;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2013-01-23T18:26:36Z;Sony Music invests in dance label Ultra;;Sony Music has made an undisclosed investment in Ultra Music, the electronic dance music label behind DJs such as Kaskade, deadmau5 and Steve Aoki, hoping to capitalise on the music industry’s fastest-growing global genre.Artists including Skrillex, Swedish House Mafia and David Guetta have brought EDM into the mainstream, driving increasing revenues from live events, digital streaming and online videos in a market where CD sales and digital downloads are low compared with rock, pop or country music.Seth Goldstein, who raised venture capital backing for a dance music news site called DJZ.com, estimates that annual EDM revenues, including events and merchandising, are about $4bn. Last year Robert Sillerman, the entertainment mogul, bought dance promoters Donnie Disco and Dayglow Productions, and Live Nation bought Cream Holdings and Hard Events.Patrick Moxey, the Ultra Music president who will become president of electronic music for Sony Music, said Ultra’s revenues had been growing at about 20 per cent a year to $30m last year, in stark contrast to a broader recorded music market that has seen sales halve in a decade.Ultra’s YouTube channel has more than 1m subscribers and attracts more than 100m views a month. This year it will produce about 100 music videos, Mr Moxey said.EDM “has been bubbling beneath the surface for a long, long time,” Mr Moxey said, noting that when he founded Ultra in 1996 it was difficult to persuade radio stations to play dance music. Now, “dance music is a global language. A dance record sounds just as good if you’re in the Philippines as it does in the UK on Radio 1.”Big companies’ growing interest in the genre has raised concerns about a bubble. “EDM has turned into a massively marketed cruise ship, and it’s sinking fast,” deadmau5 wrote on his Tumblr page last summer, bemoaning the use of “the same old pop business/marketing models” to cash in on its growth.“A lot of good companies are piling in and there are going to be some mistakes,” said Mr Moxey, who learnt to DJ from Joe Smooth in Chicago. “I don’t think it’s as easy as pushing a button and all of a sudden you’re going to put an electronic artist on tour in Buffalo, New York, and fill a stadium.”Ultra had been approached by all the major recorded music groups, Mr Moxey said, but he praised Doug Morris and his executive team at Sony Music. “They very much want to be in this space because it’s exploding,” he said, adding that they could offer the company marketing expertise and an international distribution network.
31;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2013-01-22T11:30:37Z;Olympic Stadium to host major concerts;;The Olympic Stadium will host major music concerts this year while a permanent tenant is found for the east London venue, the music company Live Nation announced on Tuesday.John Reid, president of concerts at Live Nation Europe, said he intended to announce major concerts with “world-renowned artists” in the coming weeks.Wireless Festival and the Hard Rock Calling event are already planned for the park.“We are delighted to be staging music concerts at the London Olympics venue, which last year became a globally recognised site for outstanding performances – both in sport and music,” he said.Dennis Hone, chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation, said the deal was an “important stepping stone” towards a long term programme of events in the park, which has been named Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Financial terms of the contract have not been disclosed.Last month, Boris Johnson, mayor of London, declared West Ham United the best of four bidders seeking to become the anchor tenant for the stadium. The east London football club is in talks to secure “final commercial terms” after a saga dogged by a legal challenge.The 560-acre site of the 2012 games is due to reopen to the public in stages between July this year and early 2014.But the London mayor’s most senior legacy official warned in November that the reopening of the Olympic Stadium could take twice as long as expected because of wrangles about work to adapt the venue and funding it.The stadium will compete for live events with London’s Royal Parks which have increased the number of live music performances they stage in a bid to increase revenue.Live Nation staged Hard Rock Calling, Wireless and BT London Live during the 2012 games in Hyde Park last year. Local residents near Hyde Park have complained when live acts have overshot their curfews and the plug was pulled on Bruce Springsteen last year.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
33;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2012-09-19T15:59:34Z;Anschutz puts AEG on the block;;Philip Anschutz, the billionaire owner and operator of venues such as London’s O2 arena and the Staples Center in Los Angeles, has put his sport, music and entertainment company up for sale in a deal that could trigger a break-up of the group.Anschutz Entertainment Group owns stakes in the Los Angeles Lakers basketball franchise alongside investments in the Los Angeles Galaxy soccer team – the US home of David Beckham – and the Los Angeles Kings ice hockey team.It is unclear how much interested buyers will offer for AEG, which also owns AEG Live, the world’s second-largest touring and concert operator. Live Nation, the largest touring and ticketing company, has a market capitalisation of $1.7bn.Unlike Live Nation, AEG also has a vast property portfolio that includes a long-term lease for the O2 arena and other concert venues in Berlin, New York, Shanghai and Sydney.Blackstone, which recently managed the $2bn sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball club, has been appointed to lead the sale of AEG, the company said.“This is an appropriate time to transition AEG to a new qualified owner,” said Cannon Harvey, president of the Anschutz Company. He added that the group had “the highest confidence in AEG’s potential and its management, and will only undertake a transaction that reflects this confidence”.AEG has built a global network of music and entertainment venues by focusing on regenerating urban areas. It was fortunate to secure the long-term lease to the O2 arena at a time when the UK government was desperate to find an operator for what was then the ailing – and empty – Millennium Dome. AEG has since turned the arena, which hosted several events at the London 2012 Olympics, into the world’s most popular music venue when measured by ticket sales.The group enjoyed similar success in Los Angeles, where it redeveloped a swathe of land in the city’s downtown area, building LA Live, a sprawling entertainment district that includes a music venue, restaurants and a hotel. It had less luck with the LA Live residential property component, putting 224 luxury condominiums up for sale in the middle of the financial crisis. More than two years after the units first went on sale, AEG still has 90 to offload.AEG has capitalised on a shift in the economics of the music industry: as sales of recorded music have declined, interest in live performance and touring has increased.“Live entertainment is the economic driver of the music industry, and fan participation and experience are the cornerstones of professional sports,” said Tim Leiweke, president and chief executive officer of AEG.AEG employs more than 3,000 staff in 45 operating companies worldwide. The company’s headquarters are in Los Angeles while its European base is in London.
34;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2012-08-08T20:59:48Z;Liberty to spin off Starz pay-TV unit;;Liberty Media, John Malone’s holding company, plans to spin off its Starz entertainment company, giving Liberty more firepower in its battle for Sirius XM, the satellite radio company.The news sparked speculation of takeover interest in Starz, which operates 16 pay television movie channels in the US, after it becomes a separate public company by late 2012.Greg Maffei, Liberty’s president and chief executive, told the FT it could not engage with potential bidders without undermining its plan for a tax-free spin-off to stockholders. Mr Malone has a reputation for making business deals to minimise tax bills.He added, however: “Could parties who had synergies do more with [Starz]? Absolutely.” Potential bidders could include those able to derive higher “retransmission” fees for its revenues or groups such as studio owners with cost efficiencies.Starz, which had $403m in revenues for the second quarter, will be spun off with $1.5bn in debt and an undetermined amount of cash. It has an enterprise value of about $3.1bn, Morgan Stanley estimated.After the split, Liberty will consist of the Atlanta Braves baseball team and interests in Sirius XM, concert promoter Live Nation, retailer Barnes & Noble and minority investments in media companies Time Warner and Viacom.The Starz news came as Liberty reported a 75 per cent rise in second-quarter net earnings to $156m. Revenues were $537m, a slight dip from $538m in the same quarter last year.Mr Maffei told analysts that the Starz spin-off would better position Liberty in its Sirius and Live Nation interests by creating “significant liquidity” at the parent company. Liberty owns a 46 per cent stake in Sirius, valued at $6.8bn, and 26 per cent of Live Nation.Liberty is in the midst of a battle for control of Sirius, which broadcasts shows from hosts including Howard Stern and Martha Stewart. The company is awaiting a decision from the Federal Communications Commission on its bid to take de facto control.Liberty’s stake in Sirius stems from a 2009 deal to lend the then-struggling radio group up to $530m. Sirius’s business has since rebounded and its stock price has soared. Liberty has suggested one path for its position in Sirius would be to pursue a Reverse Morris Trust, a structure designed to help companies avoid paying tax on mergers and acquisitions that meet certain criteria.Mr Maffei said he did not expect the Starz spin-off to affect the timing of any deal with Sirius. Sirius has tried to fend off Liberty by saying that Liberty has not taken proper steps to assert control.Mel Karmazin, chief executive of Sirius, said on Tuesday that “Liberty has to decide what they want to do and maybe they have done that already. They have not exactly communicated that to us.” Mr Maffei said it had “told Sirius exactly what we’ve told the marketplace”.Mr Karmazin has signalled his reluctance to work for a controlling shareholder, citing his experience as president of Viacom, where he fought for years with Sumner Redstone, the chairman and controlling shareholder.“My experience at Viacom was such that I didn’t enjoy [it] and I like working for a board as compared to working for a controlling shareholder,” he said during the call. Mr Karmazin, whose contract expires at the end of the year, said the board would have resolved his contract negotiations before its next earnings announcement.Mr Maffei told the FT that Live Nation did not fit Mr Malone’s traditional liking for subscription businesses, but there were no plans to sell its stake.
35;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2012-07-17T17:37:17Z;Cash boost for Royal Parks;;London’s Royal Parks have for the first time generated more money than they receive in grants from government, in a sign that events such as Tuesday night’s Madonna concert in Hyde Park are becoming an important revenue earners for the body.Income from events, cafés and other sources reached £18.7m in 2011-12, against £16.4m in government grants. In the previous year grants came to £17m against £13.8m in self-generated income. Fees from events alone made £4.8m in 2011-12, up from £3.2m.However, tensions between the park’s role as a public green space and a big-ticket entertainment venue came to the fore last weekend when organisers pulled the plug on Bruce Springsteen, the US rock star, and Sir Paul McCartney, a guest performer at the concert, after they overshot the curfew.Steven Van Zandt, a guitarist in Mr Springsteen’s E-Street band, took to Twitter to complain that England had become a “police state”.Live Nation, which organised the concert, said: “It was unfortunate that the three-hour-plus performance by Bruce Springsteen was stopped right at the very end but the curfew is laid down by the authorities to restrict noise disturbance.”Earlier this year Westminster city council cut the number of concerts licensed to take place in Hyde Park from 13 to nine after complaints from residents. Maximum numbers for 2013 have also been reduced from the current 80,000 to 65,000 for three concerts and 50,000 for the other six.The council said it had “a duty to balance the needs of local residents with the desire of concert organisers to hold events”.Karen Scarborough, a committee member at Hyde Park Estate Association, a residents’ group, said: “Everybody‘s had enough. It isn’t just the noise, it’s the rubbish, the police helicopter that hovers over the site for two hours as people leave, the people peeing in the street after they’ve been drinking. It’s not a pleasant experience.”Ms Scarborough said that the concerts accounted for a fraction of the Royal Parks’ income and involved a significant loss of amenity. “They need to look for other forms of revenue that are less disruptive to people in this area, which is highly residential.”The Royal Parks said it was unable to comment on whether it expected fee income to fall next year, as it was currently tendering for the 2013-18 concerts and was proposing changes to its fee model.In 2012, fees were £3.50 per head for commercial concerts – charged by potential capacity rather than tickets sold – plus a disruption fee of between £2,000 and £12,000 for central London parks.The Royal Parks receives its fee regardless of whether an event is cancelled – as happened last week when a Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan reunion gig was scotched by heavy rains. Organisers trucked in 8,000 cubic metres of woodchip to soak up the mudbath and guarantee the space can be used as a venue for live screening of Olympic events.Hyde Park has a rich history of hosting public events. The Great Exhibition of 1851 was held there, housed by Joseph Paxton’s monumental iron-and-glass Crystal Palace. Fireworks parties were held at the coronation of William IV, and in earlier times it was celebrated for its horse, foot and coach races, boxing matches and May Day dances.More exotic entertainment could be found at Batty’s Hippodrome, a Victorian-era arena to the south-west of the park featuring camel and ostrich races, and hot air balloon ascents.
36;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2012-07-13T15:51:09Z;Revellers desert music festivals;;Lured away by Olympic celebrations or fed up with braving the British weather armed with just wellington boots and wet wipes, revellers are deserting music festivals this season.The over-saturated festival market had already been predicting a fallow year, with big events such as Glastonbury and the Big Chill taking a year off to avoid competing with the Olympics.But record-breaking rainfall has complicated life for many of those that remain. This week the Hit Factory Live – due to feature Australian pop idols Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan’s long-awaited reunion as performers – was cancelled after its venue in London’s Hyde Park became a mud pit.“It’s the perfect storm,” said Rob Da Bank, organiser of the Bestival event and founder of the Association of Independent Festivals. “The weather has been the final nail in the coffin making some people’s events a struggle to sell.”Although Mr Da Bank thinks his own events will succeed, he finds it hard to remain upbeat about the wider market. “Festivals are my lifeblood. I’m an optimistic person but this year is getting close to defeating even me,” he said.The dwindling demand is in evidence on the secondary market for tickets for outdoor concerts. There, even tickets to see Madonna are trading at a discount to their box office price rather than the usual premium.The Olympics and its partner festivals are at least partly responsible with big names such as the Scissor Sisters and Beverley Knight performing at the BT River of Music in London and hundreds of smaller concerts scheduled across the country.But the bad weather has made the structural problems in the industry starker. The number of festivals has ballooned in the past decade to about 700, all competing for consumers who are more cautious about splashing out up to a couple of hundred pounds on a weekend in the mud.“The weather is awful. It is tough to have an event in a lake or a pond,” said Joe Cohen, chief executive of Seatwave, an online ticket resale site. “But my guess is some events have used the rain as an excuse to cancel because they were not sold out.”“The festival market in the UK is clearly, clearly oversold. It is going to go through a natural cycle of contraction,” Mr Cohen added.The problem with smaller festivals was recent entrants often did not take the time to build a brand but instead expected to make money in their first year, he said.For the larger outdoor concerts, Mr Cohen said there was less of an incentive to cut ticket prices to fill seats since Live Nation, the world’s biggest concert promoter, merged with Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticket seller.Concert promoters used to slash prices and make up the money on drinks and merchandise sales but now that the same company manages the acts, it prefers not to discount, he said.For Mr Da Bank, however, music festivals remain a British industry worth getting wet for.“About 90 per cent of festivals are run by independent entrepreneurs who live and breathe by their last festival,” he said. “They need the support of the public. Maybe there is a surfeit of festivals – but so many are amazing.”
37;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2012-03-16T19:35:09Z;Ebay rolls out secondary ticketing site;;Ebay is accelerating its push into the UK for buying and selling event tickets, despite fresh controversy about touting and online ticketing marketplaces.This week saw the full launch of StubHub, Ebay’s secondary ticketing site, which quietly opened a UK “beta” site in December. StubHub is competing with established local players Viagogo, Seatwave and TicketMaster’s GetMeIn, which all claim to offer a more safe and secure experience for fans than buying tickets from touts on the street.Eric Baker, previously a co-founder of StubHub and now chief executive of Viagogo, said he hoped the arrival of his “former creation” would be the “final nail in the coffin for unreliable ticket touts who sell in car parks, outside pubs or on unreliable auction sites”.StubHub plans to open high-street stores in central London and close to major venues to allow last-minute ticket sales. It promises that “unlike current UK competitors, the company does not buy or sell tickets for profit”, rather it facilitates sales between third parties from which it takes a commission.“We see a huge opportunity for a much higher level of customer service in the UK market,” said Chris Tsakalakis, StubHub’s chief executive.An investigation by Channel 4’s Dispatches documentary last month revealed that concert promoters including Live Nation and SJM Concerts were holding back thousands of tickets for big-name artists including Take That and Rihanna and selling them on Viagogo for well above face value.The site, which takes a percentage of the proceeds from all tickets sold on its site, did not deny the claims but attempted to block the documentary’s broadcast, citing concerns about customer data protection. Viagogo, which trades hundreds of millions of pounds’ worth of tickets every year, has previously struck public partnerships deeming it the “official” secondary ticketing site for Madonna, ATP tennis and football clubs including Chelsea.Even though some in the music industry have – publicly or privately – come to embrace secondary ticketing, many sports groups still oppose ticket reselling. Viagogo is fighting a court order granted to the Rugby Football Union, which wants the four-year-old site to reveal the identities of people who sold tickets to England matches. The Supreme Court will hear the case this summer.Despite a government review concluding in 2010 that ticket reselling did not require further regulation, Mike Weatherley, MP for Hove and Portslade, this week called for a new investigation, calling secondary ticket exchanges “a blight that creams off revenues by exploiting an imperfect market”.Though their marketing focuses on “fan-to-fan” transactions, both Viagogo and StubHub offer online systems dedicated to so-called “brokers” – professional touting outfits – who can upload tickets en masse. The sites say this is necessary for providing “liquidity” but critics say it allows the brokers to distort the market by setting higher prices.“A front-row seat is never sold on the primary market,” said one former Viagogo employee. “It’s just misleading.”StubHub says that 35 per cent of tickets sold on its site, by value, come from brokers, with the remainder from individuals or part-time sellers. “We are not a ticket broker. We do not have tickets from promoters,” Mr Tsakalakis said. “Ours is an open marketplace. We are not trying to control the market and we are not trying to cut in line in front of our consumers.”
38;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2012-02-23T23:45:26Z;Concert promoters embrace ticket sites;;Secondary ticketing sites such as Viagogo, once the target of fierce criticism from the live music industry, have quietly begun to partner with concert promoters to sell tickets for tours from the likes of Take That and Rihanna, as artists eye the higher prices that can often be achieved online.Two years ago, concert promoters were campaigning against ticket touting and pressed for regulation. They claimed fans were being ripped off and that venues and artists failed to benefit from higher prices, often more than face value, that tickets fetched on online “fan to fan exchanges”.But a probe by Channel 4’s Dispatches has found that thousands of tickets for tours by big-name artists such as Coldplay and Westlife had been placed on to Viagogo by their promoters, which include Ticketmaster-owned Live Nation and SJM Concerts. Neither companies could be reached for comment.Documents obtained by Dispatches appeared to show that some promoters have shared in the higher prices obtained on secondary ticketing sites by holding back tickets to distribute through Viagogo, which splits the revenue with promoters.The documentary’s makers claim that fans are being misled because they had not been made aware that they were buying from promoters rather than other fans.Other events, including high-profile art exhibitions and reality-TV shows, were also found to engage in the practice.Reselling tickets is not illegal in the UK and a government review in 2010 concluded that the market did not need further regulation.On Wednesday, Viagogo made a failed attempt to block the broadcast at the High Court, claiming that revealing the names of its tickets sellers was a breach of confidence. But the ticket-selling site, which has struck official partnerships with artists such as Madonna, did not deny the programme’s central claims.“We sought an injunction to prevent customer information being made public. Our number one priority is to protect our customers’ data, so we will always do whatever we can to prevent that information from falling into the wrong hands,” said Edward Parkinson, UK director of Viagogo.“Viagogo exists to provide a safe, secure marketplace for the buying and selling of live event tickets. The vast majority of sellers are fans selling to other fans, and around half of tickets sold sell for face value or less. To ensure we can offer our customers the best seats possible, we have on occasion partnered with promoters or artists as this enables us to go above and beyond for our customers.”The Concert Promoters Association, which lobbied the previous Labour government for legislation to outlaw the resale of concert tickets on the secondary market, said that the absence of regulation had forced its members to work with sites such as Viagogo, which had become a “premium-price primary market”. It argued that touts selling non-existent tickets online was of bigger concern for fans.The CPA, which counts Live Nation and SJM among its members, said that it had warned the Department of Culture Media and Sport and a committee of MPs that without legislation, promoters artists and managers “would, at least in part, operate in the secondary market as a result in order to catch the lost revenue on behalf of the artists and event owners so that this money would at least stay in the industry”.“If promoters put tickets into the secondary market then the result is that prices are brought down whilst also ensuring that some of the tickets available in the secondary are actually genuine ones,” the CPA said. “In this respect the secondary market is effectively being used as a premium-price primary market for those fans who wish to use it for convenience. We are sure that those fans who use the secondary market for convenience and are prepared to pay a premium would be happier that the premium went to the artist via the promoter rather than went to a tout.”
39;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2012-02-03T18:03:12Z;Clear Channel floods world with Madonna;;"Madonna’s performance during Sunday’s Super Bowl game will be only part of a multimedia promotional blitz that could prove critical in determining whether her landmark deal with Live Nation pays off.The performer struck a “revolutionary” 10-year deal with the events group in 2007 worth an estimated $70m-$100m from albums, touring, merchandising, films and other areas, but has not released an album since 2008 and has not toured since 2009.Preparations for her next album’s launch in March include an exclusive deal with Clear Channel, aimed at reaching 150m people. On Friday, the group aired her new single repeatedly on its radio stations and music websites from the US to Australia and played her new video on digital billboards from Times Square to Piccadilly Circus.In addition to the Super Bowl, the most watched US broadcast of the year, Madonna showcased the video on American Idol, and is planning promotions with Apple’s iTunes digital music store Google’s YouTube video site, said Guy Oseary, her manager.“She wants to reach as many people as possible,” Mr Oseary told the FT. “I don’t remember any time with Madonna when she’s ever talked about sales. I don’t think she has any idea how many records she’s sold.”Clear Channel’s promotion reflects efforts by Bob Pittman, chief executive, to reposition the indebted group as a broader entertainment company. “There are lots of other artists we could do this with,” said Tom Poleman, president of Clear Channel media and entertainment national programming platforms.Mr Pittman has combined US and international outdoor businesses under one executive; hired a former cable executive to expand into television, events and digital entertainment; and taken a stake in a TV production company run by Ryan Seacrest, host of American Idol. Clear Channel has pushed its digital billboards as a timely means of promoting live events and TV and radio schedules.Radio remains an important launch platform for musicians, despite the rise of digital music services such as Spotify, Pandora and Mog, Mr Oseary said: “Radio is still a huge asset and one of the ways people get their information and connect to what is going on today.”"
40;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2012-01-18T23:28:59Z;Cuban retunes his TV channel to music;;Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, has struck a deal with Anschutz Entertainment Group to rebrand his HDNet television channel as a live music and entertainment network.The deal will see Mr Cuban form a joint venture with AEG, Ryan Seacrest Media and Creative Artists Agency, relaunching HDNet as AXS TV. Mr Cuban told the Financial Times that the channel would do for live music and entertainment programming “what ESPN SportsCenter did for sports”.AEG is one of the biggest venue owners in the world, operating facilities such as the Staples Center in Los Angeles, as well as the 02 arena in London. Mr Cuban, who made his fortune when he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7bn in 1999, said the channel would broadcast live music coverage from venues across the US.AXS would “go beyond the concerts” with other live entertainment programming, such as behind-the-scenes interviews with top performers, he said.The channel will be available in 35m US homes, after Dish Network, the satellite provider, struck a deal to carry AXS, alongside other distributors, such as DirecTV, Comcast and Verizon.The deal gives AEG a stake in a new TV brand and a platform to boost its ticketing operation, which it recently launched in competition with Live Nation Entertainment. AEG opposed the 2010 merger of Live Nation and TicketMaster, which created the industry leader in concert ticket sales, and recently launched AXS.com, its own ticketing service, which has so far been limited to a couple of its US venues.The participation of Mr Seacrest and CAA should boost AXS’s celebrity credentials. CAA represents some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, while Mr Seacrest, the host of American Idol, has become a significant figure behind the camera as well as in front of it. His company produces reality shows such as Keeping up with the Kardashians. “Nobody has his paws on pop culture like Ryan,” said Mr Cuban.CAA said AXS would become a “new distribution opportunity for artists and content creators”.Mr Cuban will run the relaunched channel, which will retain a weekly show presented by Dan Rather, the former CBS news anchor. HDNet was aimed at young males but the rebranded channel will be targeted at a broader audience, Mr Cuban said. “We see this as an opportunity for anybody interested in pop culture.”AXS is one of Mr Cuban’s portfolio of business interests: since selling Broadcast.com he has acquired the Dallas Mavericks, which last year won the NBA Championship, bought the Landmark cinema chain, and launched a film production company.
41;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2011-11-07T23:08:54Z;EMI sale still has hurdles to clear;;Five months after Citigroup began the auction for EMI, bidders are increasingly unsure whether it will sell the home of The Beatles and Katy Perry. But as people close to potential buyers hope for an answer this week, an independent music lobby group is reminding them that, even if they agree prices with the bank, regulatory challenges remain.A sale of EMI would reshape both halves of the global music industry, representing the biggest shake-up in recorded music since Sony Music merged with Bertelsmann’s BMG labels in 2004, and the largest upheaval in music publishing since Vivendi’s Universal Music acquired most of Bertelsmann’s BMG publishing unit in 2007.Both deals were done only after costly talks with competition authorities in Brussels, after campaigning from Impala, the independent music trade association. Now, with offers on the table or in the wings from all of EMI’s large rivals, Impala is warning that similar fights await any successful bidders.The Sony-BMG merger was nearly unwound, with regulatory challenges taking three years to resolve, while Universal had to dispose of rights to songs by artists including Bruce Springsteen and Dire Straits when it bought BMG publishing.Helen Smith, Impala’s executive chair, says the group will complain to the European Commission about any deal that consolidates the industry into three major recorded music groups and four music publishers. Impala “could not support” market leaders Universal or Sony getting bigger in recorded music or publishing, Ms Smith says: “I don’t believe any remedies would suffice.”In the past month, Impala has written to the Commission to request that it block a joint venture between Universal and Live Nation, the concert business. “The arguments Impala submitted in its case against the Sony/BMG merger and indeed other merger cases remain valid to this day,” it stated.Ms Smith acknowledges that a takeover of EMI recorded music by Warner Music, with which it vies for third place in the charts, could strengthen the industry by giving Universal and Sony a more evenly matched rival.However, even Warner, now owned by Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries, would face hurdles, she adds: “The net result would still be to increase the gap [with the independent sector]. You’d have to compensate independents.”In one past pursuit of EMI, Warner negotiated concessions with Impala in advance, but this time it has secured no such deal.Music publishing remains more fragmented. Bertelsmann’s reformed BMG Music Publishing venture with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts now vies with Sony ATV for fourth place in publishing, however, and Ms Smith says its recent acquisitions of independent publishers may also pose competition issues.“Our fundamental position, that there should be no mergers without remedies, remains,” she says. Impala could push for disposals, behavioural guarantees or guarantees of market access involving distribution deals for independent labels. People close to the bidding pack, which is led by Warner Music on the recorded side and BMG on publishing, play down such concerns.First, they say, EMI’s turmoil under the ownership of Guy Hands’ Terra Firma group has hit its market share.Music market share moves with the charts, and regulators will look at the situation in each relevant country, but this may carry weight.More importantly, music executives say the idea of them wielding market power sounds laughable when technology companies such as Apple and Amazon increasingly control distribution, and new digital entrants such as Spotify are reshaping business models.Citigroup made clear that it would not entertain bids for EMI in which any intervention by regulators could rebound on the bank, leaving it holding assets it thought it had sold, so regulatory risks lie with the purchasers.Most bidders are more concerned about whether a deal will be done.None will comment, but the industry’s well-practised rumour mill claims that Citigroup wants offers $200m-$300m above the $1.5bn that Warner pitched, and that Universal is as much as $400m behind Warner, with an offer of $1.1bn.The music publishing auction has yielded a more palatable offer from BMG of $1.8bn-$2bn, but Sony is still securing financing for a competitive bid and people close to the bidders remain unsure whether Citigroup would sell one half of EMI without the other.Whether an auction will reset the balance of power in an industry feeling increasingly powerless remains uncertain.
42;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2011-09-06T18:14:31Z;Antitrust chief stressed negotiation at DoJ;;After two and half years heading the antitrust division of the US Justice Department, Christine Varney left for private practice only weeks before the DoJ’s momentous move to block AT&T’s $39bn purchase of T-Mobile USA.Now, in her first week as a partner at New York-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore, she has a message for prospective clients as they seek to deal with government antitrust lawyers – be willing to negotiate.“The most common approach that I’ve seen parties take, that I don’t think is fruitful, is to stonewall the government because you don’t want to negotiate against yourself,” Ms Varney told the Financial Times. “The earlier you engage on the government’s concerns, the more likely you are to be able to dispel them and the more quickly you will get to resolution, if they are credible.”With AT&T pledging to make its case in court, Ms Varney will not be drawn on the deal. While closely involved, she departed before the parties began moving towards last week’s denouement.But the DoJ’s quick decision to sue is among the most significant for antitrust enforcement under the Obama administration, which promised a more aggressive stance after the laisser faire years under President George W. Bush.A speedier review was among her goals on joining the division in 2009, she says.“When you dedicate that amount of person-power and analysis to a transaction, in most instances you do not need an 18-month process. We tried to make efficient decisions in all matters,” she says, noting May’s move to block Nasdaq OMX’s attempts to buy NYSE Euronext.Opinions vary about her time at the DoJ. Some applaud her willingness to consider creative solutions, while other practitioners accuse her of overturning decades of well-established practice.Either way, with the White House yet to nominate a successor and her deputy Sharis Pozen now at the helm, her approach should persist for now.Ms Varney, a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, styles herself as pragmatic.“I was interested in setting a course where the division was willing to block any deal that met the criteria of substantially lessening competition, while at the same time recognising that there can be solutions,” she says. “It’s not a binary decision, to block or to let the deal go.”That included a flurry of so-called conduct remedies, which govern companies’ behaviour after a deal’s close.Comcast agreed to license programming as part of its tie-up with NBC Universal, while Ticketmaster committed to share software and open up ticketing at venues in buying Live Nation – both instances where companies were active in countering government concerns.“We found enough credible evidence that this would be anti-competitive and I was prepared to block it,” she notes of the former deal. “Comcast and NBC, to their credit, said: ‘We understand your analysis and we are prepared to address the issues you’ve raised.’ It could have gone the other way. They could have said: ‘We disagree.’”Small deals also provoked unusual results. Having challenged the $3m acquisition of a Virginia poultry processing plant by George’s, the chicken company, the DoJ acquiesced, provided the company installed a special freezer and deboning equipment.“There is obviously a threshold for what is an appropriate use of government resources,” says Ms Varney. “But the size of the deal does not drive the antitrust analysis. If a deal is anti-competitive, the government should approach it with the same amount of rigour.”At Cravath, her diary is filling up despite US ethics rules that bar her from representing clients before the DoJ for two years.The firm already has a highly rated antitrust group, despite no Washington office, and Ms Varney’s move up the east coast is a long-promised concession to her husband of 27 years.“There are already a number of clients who are eager to get the benefit of her insight and experience,” says presiding partner Evan Chesler. “She is going to be quite busy from the time she arrives.”So will the lawyers she leaves behind. However, Express Scripts controversial $29bn purchase of rival Medco will be considered by the FTC.Ms Varney bats away talk of friction between the bodies. Nor does she see a notable rise in companies in relatively consolidated industries opting to take a punt on antitrust approval.“It has always happened over the course of history,” she says. “Sometimes companies, as you would say of people, are not very self-aware.”
43;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2011-08-31T21:52:54Z;Political tinge to DoJ’s move to block AT&T;;The announcement by the Department of Justice on Wednesday challenging AT&T’s takeover of T-Mobile USA came with much of the usual criticism of such deals – that it would lessen competition and hurt consumers.But the decision was also delivered with a political tinge, with James Cole, the deputy attorney-general, saying: “We see this as a move that will help protect jobs in the economy, not a move that’s going to in any way reduce them.”He said: “The general experience with mergers is that there is what’s called efficiencies, which is redundancies when the two companies come together, which usually reduces jobs, in our experience.”Coincidentally or not, such a rationale dovetails perfectly with the agenda of the Obama administration, which is focused on how to create, and protect, jobs, at a time of persistent high unemployment.The timing took some by surprise, as did the DoJ’s decision not to proceed in concert with the Federal Communications Commission.“It looked like the process was still midstream in terms of document production at the FCC,” said Andrew Lipman, partner and head of telecoms practice at Bingham McCutchen.The usual practice in recent antitrust cases has been that the parties discuss potential objections, with the DoJ and FCC offering possible remedies to be met for the deal to go through.The DoJ under Christine Varney demonstrated a willingness to negotiate substantial and creative agreements as part of waving deals through, including in Ticketmaster’s acquisition of Live Nation and in Comcast’s purchase of NBC Universal.This approach prompted some critics to accuse the DoJ of being soft on antitrust issues. Ms Varney left the DoJ in early August.In February 2009, Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticketing service, looked to acquire Live Nation, the world’s biggest promoter of concerts, a deal approved with provisos.In January, Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal to create a $30bn media business was approved by the DoJ, also with heavy remedies. For example, Comcast’s rivals retained access to NBC Universal’s programming.Analysts said the DoJ clearly wanted to send an early signal to the market that it was going to fight the AT&T merger. It is unusual in a merger of this size and complexity for the DoJ to move so quickly to block it.“Maybe this signals the DoJ doesn’t believe in any solutions, or it wanted to get out in front of AT&T and start negotiations with increased leverage,” said Makan Delrahim, former deputy assistant attorney general for the DoJ antitrust division during the George W. Bush administration.AT&T had tried to sweeten the deal by pitching the extra services it would provide across the country. But the DoJ came to the conclusion that it “could obtain substantially the same network enhancements … if it simply invested in its own network without eliminating a close competitor”.AT&T is expected to fight the DoJ’s assessment that the merger would create “higher prices, fewer choices and lower-quality products for mobile wireless services”. But a year-long litigation process has the potential to do serious damage to both companies involved in the deal.Other commentators were more sceptical about the impact of the DoJ’s announcement. “I don’t think this makes a lot of difference,” said David Balto, of the Center for American Progress and an antitrust lawyer. “This just means they are going to resolve the merger issues as part of litigation, it doesn’t change deal dynamics at all.”
44;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2011-07-14T06:53:17Z;Dragon Go nuances voice search;;Nuance, as its name suggests, is a voice recognition company that is getting ever better at learning and processing the nuances of everyday speech.I was impressed with the accuracy of its popular and free Dragon Dictation app in turning to text my spoken words, but its new app Dragon Go, launched on Thursday, goes a step further in understanding our search intentions.It’s a significant advance over the existing Dragon Search app, which produces standard sets of results separated into tabs for Google, YouTube, Twitter, Wikipedia and iTunes pages when a search query is spoken into an iPhone.Dragon Go is capable of dynamically adjusting those search tabs so that saying “Tickets for Lady Gaga” brings up Live Nation results as the first tab, “Tickets for Bad Teacher” brings up the Fandango movie ticket service and “Tickets for the San Francisco Giants” shows the Stubhub sports service,Secondary tabs for a search can be equally relevant – “Reservation at Slanted Door [restaurant]” has OpenTable as the default tab, but the Yelp review site is right next to it and then a Phone tab, with the number of the restaurant.Nuance has signed deals with 180 content partners to feature their results, which made me wonder whether I would get the best service every time or the one that had paid the most for its placement. However, Nuance does seem to have targeted the best known companies in their sectors for its results.I discovered there are some verticals missing at launch though – “Flights to London” brings up a standard Google results page rather than any travel site tabs, for example.Dragon Go reminds me of Siri, a mobile voice search company bought by Apple, but Gary Clayton, Nuance’s chief creative officer, told me Siri offered a more curated, single-threaded search, and used Nuance’s speech recognition for its front end.Dragon Go is now available as a free app on Apple’s iOS devices and certainly beats typing in long search queries on short smartphone keyboards.“I can use my voice more easily, more accurately and more quickly than I can type with a keyboard,” Mr Clayton told me, speaking for most users out there.
45;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2011-07-07T19:02:18Z;Privatisation to ‘benefit’ Liberty’s holdings;;Shares in Live Nation and HSN were up on Thursday after John Malone, chairman of Liberty Media, said he believed both companies could benefit from being taken private.Liberty is the largest shareholder of publicly traded Live Nation, with a 22 per cent stake. “It would probably be nice for that company to be private for a period of time, to settle down, to consolidate the operations,” Mr Malone said. “Getting everything working smoothly, having predictable financial outcomes.”But Mr Malone did not say he had any immediate plans for a move to increase Liberty’s holdings. “That’s a function of how their shareholders feel about the values,” Mr Malone said. “Between here and getting it done is a pretty major financial challenge.”Shares in Live Nation were up nearly 5 per cent in midday trading on Thursday.Asked if he wanted to own 100 per cent of HSN, a home shopping network in which Liberty has a 32 per cent state, Mr Malone replied: “Do we want to? Sure.”Liberty also has a large stake in QVC, another home shopping company. “When the parallel lines on the highway come together down there somewhere, do we think that Home Shopping Network and QVC should be under the same umbrella, yeah we do,” he said. “We think there’s synergies in that. But do we see that happening in any near term? No. That’s a function of markets and the attitude of the control of the other side.”Mr Malone said he felt HSN was well-run operationally but wanted to see the company take on more leverage. “If we have a complaint it’s that they have no leverage on their balance sheet, and so the return as just a simple equity holder – forget about control – is depressed,” he said.Shares in HSN were up more than 3 per cent on Thursday.
46;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2011-06-13T13:59:54Z;Parcom Capital to sell See Tickets for £120m;;See Tickets, one of the largest ticketing companies in Europe, is in the advanced stages of being sold by Dutch investment firm Parcom Capital for between £100m and £120m.The sale, which has reached second round bidding, has attracted interest from a handful of private equity parties and at least three trade participants.CTS Eventim, the largest ticketing company in Europe, is understood to be a frontrunner. The Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), the world’s second-largest presenter of live music and entertainment events after Live Nation, is also in the process.The Ambassador Theatre Group, which is backed by private equity firm Exponent and owns London’s Apollo Victoria Theatre and the Lyceum, is another interested trade bidder.One person familiar with the process said: “Several private equity firms are looking but they are a bit spooked as CTS Eventim are most likely to pick up the business. Also, there is poor visibility on these assets as you don’t know what will be on the roster at the beginning of the year.”See Tickets, which was once part of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Group, owns ticketing businesses in Holland and Spain as well as its core business in the UK.The company competes with Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticket seller, and sells seats at concerts and sports events such as Silverstone and BBC Proms in the Park.Parcom is understood to have bought See Tickets with a view to creating a pan-European ticketing business. But it is understood that the different technology platforms across the industry made consolidation complicated. Parcom was not available for comment.Last year Parcom sold See Tickets’ German business to CTS Eventim, which is publicly listed, for €145m. The business sold for 11 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Ticketmaster is unlikely to enter the bidding for See Tickets because it would face regulation issues.Live Nation, the world’s biggest concert promoter handling tours for the likes of Madonna and U2, merged with Ticketmaster last year.At the time they boasted that they could connect 200m fans in 40 countries to more than 100,000 events. But the celebrations have been shortlived.Attendance at Live Nation events fell 9.4 per cent last year, and it sold 7.6 per cent fewer tickets, sending the group to a net loss of $206m – its fifth year of losses – and prompting warnings that consumers have finally had enough of ticket price inflation.After a decade in which CD sales halved and concert ticket prices climbed, the live entertainment business has replaced record labels as the object of fans’ relationship with music industry money makers.Parcom Capital, which focuses on pan-European mid-market transactions, has been a fully owned subsidiary of ING since 1993.
47;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2011-05-05T19:23:13Z;Warner Music buyer ready to call the tune;;"Five years before he emerged as the leading bidder for Warner Music, Len Blavatnik played host to celebrities such as Paris Hilton and James Blunt at his £41m home in Kensington Palace Gardens, at a Warner Music after-party for the Brit Awards.Now, after beating music industry front-runners such as BMG, Sony and Universal Music – who all could have found substantial cost savings in a merger with the US label owner and music publisher behind Madonna and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers – the billionaire industrialist must prove this is more than just a $3bn vanity
purchase.His small stake in Warner Music, and past position on its board, gave Mr Blavatnik a taste of the glamour of the music business, but also an understanding of the pressures it has faced between the emergence of illegal downloads and the launch of music libraries in the digital cloud.The painful experience of Guy Hands, whose Terra Firma group lost its investment in EMI, has surely scared off some bidders who before the financial crisis had been attracted by the steady cashflows that music publishing seemed to offer.EMI is now in the hands of Citigroup, which is said to have quietly talked to potential bidders and is widely expected to begin the process of selling EMI once the dust settles on the Warner Music auction.One of the factors that attracted Terra Firma to EMI was the prospect of a merger with Warner Music, which could yield big savings from combining the companies’ recorded music businesses.The possibility of such savings will make Mr Blavatnik a front-runner in any EMI auction. But the Russian-born US citizen is said by people familiar with the Warner Music bid process to have planned for two possible outcomes: one in which he wins all or part of EMI, and another standalone scenario.The high number of approaches for Warner Music surprised many observers, suggesting that Mr Blavatnik’s Access Industries group could
face strong competition for EMI.Bids came in for Warner Music from industry members such as Universal, Sony, BMG and Live Nation; buy-out groups; and wealthy individuals including the Gores brothers, Ron Burkle and Poju Zabludovic.Some non-music industry bidders believed they could still make money from a standalone Warner Music, despite Mr Hands’ travails at EMI.Mr Blavatnik is expected to keep many of Warner Music’s senior executives, led by Edgar Bronfman Jr, chief executive. But people familiar with his thinking say he will seek more digital growth, and expand beyond recorded music and publishing.That may involve collaboration with other parts
of his Access Industries vehicle such as FanBridge, which manages e-mail
lists of bands’ fans; Songkick, which allows fans to track concert dates; and ViKi, a video translation site.His new rivals doubt he can make money without an EMI merger but, if
he succeeds, the industry will be partying with
him."
48;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2011-04-01T00:52:53Z;Live Nation tracks Warner Music;;Live Nation has emerged as another suitor for Warner Music, after the US concert promotion, ticketing and artist management group made an offer for Warner’s recorded music arm, according to people familiar with the auction.The bid, the terms of which could not immediately be established, brings to seven the number of groups known to have shown interest in all or parts of Warner Music, but industry members expressed doubt about Live Nation emerging as the auction’s winner.A bid from Live Nation, led by Irving Azoff, could face tougher scrutiny from regulators than offers from rivals with less involvement in the music industry. The US Department of Justice imposed conditions on the group’s merger with Ticketmaster before clearing it in January 2010 after a long review.Unless Live Nation is willing to assume the risk of intervention by competition authorities, Warner’s board may favour an offer with less regulatory complexity.BMG Music Publishing, a joint venture between Bertelsmann and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is widely seen as the frontrunner in a pack including Sony, Tamares, Platinum Equity, Access Industries and Yucaipa Companies.BMG has bid about $2.8bn for all of Warner Music, but may seek to sell on the new music part of its record label, keeping the Warner-Chappell music publishing division and some older recorded catalogue.Live Nation reported long-term debt of $1.7bn as of December 31, after a year in which revenues and profits fell as a weak economy weighed on the concert business.Mr Azoff hinted in February that it could tap funding from Liberty Media, which has built up a 20 per cent stake in Live Nation. Mr Azoff told Bloomberg in February that Live Nation was “on the prowl together” with John Malone’s media holding company.“Greg [Maffei, Liberty’s chief executive] and I have been besieged by every bidder out there who’s interested in EMI and Warner,” Mr Azoff told Bloomberg, but he claimed that he was not pursuing a music deal: “The catalogue of EMI and Warner is the best that ever existed. It’s not to be.”Liberty Media was not immediately available for comment, and Live Nation and Warner Music each declined to comment.Shares in Warner rose 3.5 per cent to $6.77 on Thursday.Live Nation’s interest, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG, expressed doubt that bidders would offer a premium price for Warner, particularly amid expectations that EMI, its UK rival, will soon be put up for sale by Citigroup, its current owner.“We simply see no reason why a buyer is going to pay a premium for WMG – these are simply not must-have assets, within an industry suffering from significant uncertainty [and] headwinds,” Mr Greenfield said.
49;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2011-03-23T19:59:45Z;US deal remedies offer hope to AT&T;;Conventional wisdom in Washington is that big corporate mergers are harder to get past regulators when the Democrats are in power, but President Barack Obama’s administration has shaken this assumption.Instead of blocking major deals outright it has sought to heavily modify them. For this reason, analysts in Washington are largely sanguine about the chance of AT&T’s proposed $39bn acquisition of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA division securing clearance from the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission.On Mr Obama’s watch, two of the largest and most controversial deals for decades have been approved but with heavy “remedies”, or conditions which must be met by the companies for the transactions to obtain regulatory clearance.“One significant difference between this and the previous administration is that under Bush the DoJ was much more likely to [let a deal] go through unfettered, or challenge it and block it,” says John Taladay, an antitrust lawyer at Howrey. “They weren’t as likely to cut deals. The [Obama] administration has been a little more inclined to accept partial remedies to let deals go through.”Michael Sohn, a leading antitrust lawyer at Davis Polk, agrees. “I believe it is harder to clear a merger without remedies now than it was during the prior administration,” he says.The Obama administration’s record bears this out. In February 2009, two of the largest companies in the global concert business announced plans for a tie-up. Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticketing service, looked to acquire Live Nation, the world’s biggest promoter of concerts. There were specific concerns about the combination of ticketing and promotional services, and it was initially condemned by various lawmakers and musicians.The DoJ eventually approved the deal but with a number of provisos, including the stipulation that the merged entity could not retaliate against any venue owner that chose another company’s ticketing services, and firewalls to protect data flows between the combined businesses.Live Nation also had to divest its ticketing business, Paciolan.In January, Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal to create a $30bn media business was approved by the DoJ but only with heavy remedies. For example, Comcast’s rivals retained access to NBC Universal’s programming.These cases stood in contrast to the easy passage of the two most high-profile mergers during George W. Bush’s years in office. In March 2006, the DoJ approved Whirlpool Corp’s $1.8bn acquisition of Maytag without asking for remedies. A year later, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio merged to form a $13bn company, again approved by the DoJ with no remedies.“The DoJ has seen a pretty significant change,” says Mr Taladay.He adds that Christine Varney, head of the antitrust division at the DoJ, has a very different agenda to her Bush-nominated predecessor, Tom Barnett. “She made it very clear coming in that …she intended to be much more aggressive and we have seen an uptick in investigations of monopolistic practices.”But there has also been criticism that the Obama administration has toned down its initially strong antitrust rhetoric as it tries to avoid criticism of damaging the economy by stifling business.With AT&T’s offer to buy T-Mobile USA, analysts believe the regulators could require divestments of customers or radio spectrum in markets where both companies are in strong positions.These could be expensive remedies, but analysts say that is not at all a worry for the current administration.“The Bush administration didn’t want to impose costs on companies, but I think Varney is willing to impose some costs in order to keep regulatory oversight,” says Mr Taladay.However, the takeover of T-Mobile USA could assist with President Obama’s efforts to increase broadband availability. AT&T is pledging, alongside the $39bn deal, to invest in expanding its high-speed mobile broadband network to cover 95 per cent of the US population.This may be AT&T’s strongest card to play during its talks with the regulators.
50;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2011-02-11T12:36:02Z;West Ham wins Olympic stadium bid;;West Ham United has been appointed as preferred bidder to become anchor tenant of the London Olympic stadium after 2012.The decision was taken by the government-appointed Olympic Park Legacy Company, following a meeting of its 14 board members on Friday.It follows weeks of scrutiny by OPLC executives of the bids of West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur, which were involved in an acrimonious public battle over the merits of their respective bids.Announcing the decision, Margaret Ford, OPLC chair, said the board was confident the decision represented the best legacy for the stadium.“The whole purpose of starting this process was to find a legacy that would improve upon the original plans for a 25,000 seat stadium. We have now achieved that objective with this solution – one that is credible and offers an all-round better legacy in serving the needs of sport, culture, entertainment and the local community.”She said that while the two proposals were very different, West Ham’s bid “works best for the wider regeneration of East London and is integrated with our broader vision to make the Olympic Park a leading destination”.West Ham’s bid involves a £95m redevelopment of the stadium to include football, athletics and other sports. Spurs proposed a redevelopment that involved taking out the Olympic running track and creating an arena dedicated to football.West Ham is partnered by Newham Council, which is providing a £40m loan for the stadium project. It is being advised by Live Nation on how to use the venue for sports, concerts and community events.The club convinced the OPLC of the merits of its case in spite of concerns over its finances and its precarious position in the Premier League. It is in bottom place.The club is half-owned by David Gold and David Sullivan, whose fortunes were made in the adult entertainment industry.Spurs have hinted that they may seek to challenge the decision in the courts.
51;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2010-12-31T00:47:46Z;Live music suffers as fans and stars age;;Ageing acts and audiences, high ticket prices and a back injury suffered by U2 lead singer Bono conspired to drive down worldwide concert revenues by 12 per cent in 2010, an indication of trouble for one of the few healthy corners of the music industry over the past decade.The 50 largest tours of the year had combined gross sales of $2.93bn, against $3.34bn in 2009, in spite of an increase of 4 per cent in the average ticket price to $76.69, according to Pollstar, which collects data from promoters and venues.The North American market, which represents more than half of the global total, showed particular signs of consumers cutting back in a weakened economy. Gross sales for the top 50 tours in North America saw a fall of 15 per cent to $1.69bn.Worldwide, the live music industry sold 38.3m tickets, a fall of 15 per cent, to a total of 2,650 shows, down by 8 per cent on the previous year.After a decade of above-inflation increases in ticket prices, 2010 saw consumers “push back” against “overly aggressive” pricing by acts and their promoters, said Gary Bongiovanni, editor-in-chief of Pollstar.The average ticket in North America sold for $64.74 this year, down 2 per cent on the previous year.“The concert business has been fuelled by the baby-boomer generation going to see acts that broke in the Sixties and Seventies,” Mr Bongiovanni said.“At some point, these ‘evergreen’ acts are going to fade away, and there doesn’t seem to be a huge group of acts waiting in the wings to replace them.”Only two of the top 10 touring artists – Lady Gaga and Michael Bublé – broke in the past 20 years, and older artists such as Roger Waters of Pink Floyd fame, the Eagles and Leonard Cohen, typically filled larger venues and commanded higher ticket prices. Tickets to the former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney’s shows sold for an average of $138, compared with $48.90 for Justin Bieber, the 16-year-old Canadian pop star.Digital Music News, an industry blog, calculated recently that the average age of a top touring artist reached 46 in 2009, with more performers in their sixties than in their twenties. The average age of a chart-topping singer, by comparison, was 29.A recent report from Edison Research underscored concern that the industry’s audience is greying, finding that 12- to 24-year-old concert-goers now go to just 0.9 concerts per year on average, against 2.1 shows a year just a decade ago. Almost two-thirds had been to no concert at all in the past year.A sustained slowdown in the live music industry could hit promoters such as Creative Artists Agency, Live Nation Entertainment and William Morris Endeavour, whose artists led this year’s league tables.It could also set back recorded music companies that have sought wider rights deals to offset plunging CD sales and flattening digital downloads.
52;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2010-11-16T23:29:50Z;Olympic stadium is spur for Tottenham;;London Olympic officials say they are convinced that Totteham Hotspur are “dead serious” about their bid to take over the Olympic stadium after 2012 and that the club is in a genuine two-horse race with fellow Premier League rivals West Ham United.The two clubs make up the shortlist announced last week by the Olympic Park Legacy Company, the government agency responsible for what will happen to Olympic venues post-2012, to be anchor tenant of the £550m stadium.Tottenham, bidding with Los Angeles-based entertainments group AEG, which operates the O2 Centre, were last-minute entrants when the deadline for applications closed in September.Their bid was viewed in some quarters as a back-up plan in case its planned redevelopment of the club’s White Hart Lane stadium in Haringey came unstuck. West Ham, whose Boleyn Ground is a short distance from the Olympic stadium, was regarded as favourites to become anchor tenant, in spite of debts running at £80m.But with the club’s redevelopment costs increasing, there is a growing sense among Olympic officials that both options for the club now carry equal weight.One London Olympic insider said: “Tottenham are dead serious about this,” adding that the financial benefits of moving to the Olympic stadium were looking more attractive than they had initially realised.Karren Brady, vice-chairman of West Ham, said: “I have every reason to believe they are serious.”West Ham has the backing of Newham Council and events operator Live Nation, as well as UK Athletics because unlike Tottenham it is willing to retain the stadium running track in order to fulfil the OPLC’s athletics legacy requirement.Tottenham, which is being advised by Goldman Sachs, is working on delivering the athletics legacy at an alternative site. It declined to comment. Both clubs are planning to convert the 80,000-seater Olympics stadium into 60,000-seater venues.Ms Brady added: “I think that in the next few weeks, [Tottenham] will have to decide and put their cards on the table. They are trying to run a two-horse race and I think at some point they will have to decide which horse their jockey sits on.“But we take it seriously. Newham Council takes it seriously becasue they don’t want someone from Haringey moving into their borough.”She added that she expected bank debt to fall to £25m by 2013. “For a business that will be turning over £100m, that‘s a perfectly acceptable level of both overdraft and long-term debt,” said Ms Brady.The OPLC will engage in negotiations with both bidders in the coming weeks, and hopes to find a preferred bidder by the end of the year.
53;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2010-09-29T20:09:39Z;Diller departure exposes Live Nation board rift;;Barry Diller, head of media conglomerate IAC, is to step down as chairman of the board of music promoter Live Nation.The move exposes a rift on a board crammed with big-name entertainment executives including Michael Rapino and Irving Azoff, Live Nation executives, and Ari Emanuel, the agent at William Morris Endeavor Entertainment.Reports suggested Mr Diller was clashing with Mr Azoff and Mr Rapino, but Mr Diller sought to portray his departure as consistent with the plans put in place after Live Nation merged with Ticketmaster, the ticket seller, in January.“I have always said, since the merger of Ticketmaster and Live Nation, that I only planned to stay as chairman through the transition and integration of the two companies,” he said.“It’s been almost a year and I informed the board today that while there was no rush, the board should start the process now to appoint a new chairman.”Live Nation has been beset by troubles since the completion of the Ticketmaster merger. The deal faced antitrust scrutiny from regulators.So far the company has had to contend with weak performance. Second-quarter earnings slumped as inflated ticket prices and continued weak consumer spending hurt US sales during the crucial summer tour season. Live Nation’s revenues were down $135.6m, or almost 10 per cent on the same period a year earlier. Attendance was down 5.7 per cent, while the number of concerts staged fell 2.7 per cent.Mr Azoff recently drew attention when he used micro-blogging website Twitter to spar with journalists and critics of the company, at one point writing: “If you want ticket prices to go down, stop stealing music,” in reference to the proliferation of music downloads.Mr Diller, however, suggested the reason he was stepping down was he already had too many other commitments. He serves as chairman of IAC and the travel website Expedia, and sits on the boards of Coca-Cola and the Washington Post Company.“Another board chair in a company in which I have de minimus [sic] interest certainly isn’t recommended,” Mr Diller told the Financial Times.Live Nation did not respond to requests for comment. Shares in the company were up slightly on the news.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson and Matthew Garrahan.
54;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2009-12-23T00:30:03Z;Regulatory volte face over ticketing deal;;The Competition Commission has reversed its opposition to the merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster Entertainment.The regulator said it had changed its mind about the likely effects that the alliance between the two US-based companies would have on live music events in Britain.Live Nation is the world’s largest producer of live concerts, handling tours for the likes of Madonna and U2 while also owning and operating music venues. It is also the biggest client of Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticket seller that sold more than 140m tickets last year.The two companies – which have significant operations in the UK – announced that they were merging in February in an all-stock deal that sparked competition reviews in a number of countries, including the UK, Canada and the US.While US antitrust authorities were still investigating the merger, their counterparts at the Competition Commission issued a provisional finding in October saying it could lead to a lower quality of service and higher prices, and would damage the market for live music tickets in the UK.The regulator argued that the deal would severely inhibit the entry into the market of CTS Eventim, a ticket agent based in Germany that had signed a deal to work with Live Nation in the UK before the merger was announced.However, the regulator on Tuesday said it had changed its mind on this point, arguing that “the merger will make little difference to the prospects of Eventim’s success in the UK”.Chris Edmonds, managing director of Ticketmaster UK, said: “Today’s clearance is an important milestone in the regulatory review process.”The ruling cited “significant new evidence and arguments” for the U-turn, which it described as “unusual but not unique”. In particular, it said it had found that Live Nation had only promised limited support to Eventim prior to striking a deal with Ticketmaster.Joe Cohen, chief executive of ticketing company Seatwave, said: “We continue to believe this merger will lead to higher ticket prices for fans although the Competition Commission disagrees with our position – and their own initial ruling.“The Competition Commission have given them an early Christmas present and now we’ll wait to see if the US Department of Justice choose to stand up for fans or give them a lump of coal.”The DoJ has been talking to Live Nation and Ticketmaster for months. A decision was expected this year, but now looks likely to come in 2010.
55;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2009-11-03T16:36:00Z;Exponent takes over Ambassador Theatre Group;;Exponent Private Equity has become the new majority owner of Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG), owner of some of the UK’s best-known playhouses, by financing its £90m takeover of its rival Live Nation’s UK operations.The deal, which closed this week, creates one of the UK’s biggest theatre groups with 39 venues, including the Lyceum and Duke of York’s in London, the Edinburgh Playhouse, the Theatre Royal Brighton and the Liverpool Empire.Exponent is providing at least £75m of financing for the deal, which values the new group at £150m, and the private equity house will end up with a majority stake in the company that will dominate London’s West End with 11,000 theatre seats.ATG’s private shareholders are also providing some financing, including Greg Dyke, the former BBC director-general, who will become executive chairman, and Peter Beckwith, the property entrepreneur.Chris Graham, co-founder of Exponent, told the Financial Times that over the last few decades theatres had increased their admissions by an average of 7 per cent a year.“Somewhat surprisingly this growth has remained stable in the recession,” he said.Exponent, which was founded in 2004 by four former 3i dealmakers, also owns Dreams, the bed retailer, Radley, the handbag supplier, and thetrainline.com, the internet rail ticket booking service.ATG, founded in 1992 by husband and wife team Howard Panter and Rosemary Squire, made a gross profit of £35m in the year to September 2008, but suffered a pre-tax loss of £603,000.The company recently won a tender to operate the Aylesbury Waterside Theatre, which will become its 40th venue when it opens next year.Mr Dyke said: “ATG is a great British success story and the acquisition of the Live Nation Theatres will make the Group even more successful.”Live Nation, which had its proposed merger with its rival Ticketmaster provisionally blocked by the competition commission last month, sold its 16 theatres to focus on its concert business, which includes Wembley Arena and the Manchester Apollo.
56;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;An overmighty duo;;There is often excitement in the music industry at the prospect of a double act formed by bringing together two well-established solo performers. But – rightly – that has not been the general reaction to the planned all-stock merger between Ticketmaster and Live Nation. The US Department of Justice is nearing the end of considering the proposed combination of the top US ticket seller and the world’s largest concert promoter. It should not let the deal survive as it is.The UK Competition Commission provisionally ruled against the merger this month, saying it would “severely inhibit” a serious new rival from competing in the British retail ticketing market. That is true too for the much larger US market.One objection to the deal is its “vertical integration”. It would allow a single entity great control throughout the process from signing up acts to staging events and selling tickets. This would tend to stifle competition, but its effect may be hard to measure.There is also the impact on the ticket distribution market. The merger would extend Ticketmaster’s dominant position, not only by bringing it a greater market share, but also by ending Live Nation’s own efforts to build up a ticketing business. Although technology is helping challengers to emerge, Live Nation was one of just a few groups able to exert broad pressure on Ticketmaster.So the main focus for possible concessions should be the primary ticketing market. Seeking to cut into Ticketmaster’s standalone dominance here is not the answer. Instead, one possible remedy would be the prospect of transferring Live Nation’s agreement with CTS Eventim, the largest ticketing company in Europe, to a third party in a way that would produce a credible rival. It looks doubtful.The impact of the DoJ’s decision goes beyond the two companies themselves. As CD sales continue to slide, and consumers remain reluctant to pay for downloads, live performance is almost the only healthy part of the music industry. So it is particularly important, for artists and for fans, that access to shows does not become less competitive.For the DoJ itself, a firm line would make it clear that the change of administration has produced a more rigorous approach to consumer protection. A number of high-profile deals are coming the way of Christine Varney, who runs the antitrust division. This decision is about more than playing to the cheap seats.
57;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2009-10-08T18:32:03Z;UK watchdog rules against ticketing merger;;The merger deal struck by Ticketmaster Entertainment and Live Nation suffered a further setback on Thursday after UK antitrust authorities poured cold water on their plans to create a live music powerhouse.In a provisional ruling, the Competition Commission said the tie-up between the US’s top ticket seller and the world’s largest concert promoter could “severely inhibit” a new rival from competing in the UK ticket retailing market.The combined group – which would also span artist management and venue ownership globally – could lead to higher prices and poorer service for consumers and stifle innovation, the commission said.But the two US-based companies were “optimistic” the deal would “ultimately be approved”.Authorities in the US are probing the all-stock merger, where the Department of Justice inquiry is seen as a test of the Obama administration’s will to boost antitrust enforcement.However, Simon Barnes, competition lawyer at Lovells, doubted the UK decision would influence the DoJ.In the UK, the commission’s findings rested on the proposed deal’s impact on the attempts of another ticket group to gain a foothold in the market. Although Live Nation uses Ticketmaster as its principal agent, that agreement expires in December and – before the merger announcement – it signed an agreement with Germany-based CTS Eventim.The commission could not block the deal but might consider forcing either company to dispose of its UK division or sell tickets via a rival such as CTS.Christopher Clarke, chairman of the inquiry, said: “We believe that, if the merger proceeds, Live Nation will seek to limit its relationship with CTS, with the effect of putting CTS’s future prospects in the UK in considerable doubt.”With estimated annual sales of $6bn, the combined group would own more than 140 concert venues globally, sell 140m tickets and host 2,200 concerts a year.Shares in CTS rose 3.1 per cent. Seatwave, the UK-based online ticketing site, said the ruling was “great for fans”.“This ruling sends a clear message that promoters and ticketing companies cannot …force fans into a single, higher-priced channel,” said Joe Cohen, chief executive.The commission is to consider responses and publish its final report by November 24.Additional reporting by ­Kenneth Li in New York

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking.

The assets, excluding the cable networks, were purchased between 1994 to 1997 for a total of about $1.3bn.Mr Greenfield said a spin-off of Cablevision’s substantial live entertainment operations could provide it with a back-up plan to the pending merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster, given the close ties between the Dolan family, which controls Cablevision, and Irving Azoff, the head of Ticketmaster’s Frontline.A merger of the world’s largest concert promoter and operator of venues including Wembley Arena, and the world’s largest ticketing and artist management group, which is expected to be sealed later this year, has triggered opposition from artists and concert venue owners.Mr Greenfield suggested that a spun-off Madison Square Garden could be of interest to Anschutz Entertainment Group, a rival venue owner. Earlier talks between Ticketmaster and AEG collapsed.Cablevision had considered selling off its Rainbow cable networks, including AMC, which broadcasts the popular Mad Men series, last August, but pulled it from the market in September due to the global economic turmoil.The potential spin-off comes as other media companies seek to offload sports franchises. The New York Times put its minority stake in the Boston Red Sox baseball team up for sale earlier this year to raise cash to pay off debt.
60;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2009-03-01T21:04:17Z;Best show in town;;"Perhaps they should have sold tickets for it. There was certainly entertainment value in appearances last week on Capitol Hill of senior executives from Ticketmaster and Live Nation to explain to lawmakers why the planned merger between the two groups should go ahead. But it lacked a compelling case why it should be allowed to proceed.The top US ticket seller and the world’s largest concert promoter revealed plans for their all-stock merger last month. Irving Azoff, Ticketmaster chief executive, enthused last week about how the combined group could “enhance the artist-to-fan experience”. Michael Rapino, Live Nation chief executive, pointed out that the groups had not overleveraged themselves or handed out giant bonuses, but were instead coming forward with a “self-funded renewal plan”, asking only the freedom to innovate to help a troubled American industry.But those who do not come over all misty-eyed at stories of executives’ early commitment to the music industry and pleas in support of the deal from some artists already on the books see a less appealing picture.The first point is that live shows matter much more now than they used to do. CD sales are sharply down and piracy is rife. So artists rely more heavily on concert tours than when fans were readier to pay for recorded music.Within this more important market, the merged group would be a powerhouse, with annual sales of $6bn and and operating income of almost $500m. It would own more than 140 concert venues globally, sell 140m tickets and host 2,200 concerts a year. It would command a galaxy of big names from The Eagles to Miley Cyrus.Its dominance in ticket sales would be worrying. Technology makes it easier to enter the market; challengers are emerging. But the merger would deal a blow to competition. Live Nation would presumably stop building up its rival ticketing business.A greater concern comes from “vertical integration”. A single entity running the entire process – from signing up the talent, to staging of the concerts and selling the tickets – would stifle competition. This would work against the fans in the longer term, no matter what innovations were on offer initially.So Christine Varney, President Barack Obama’s choice to lead the Justice department’s antitrust division, should take time to unpick the deal and exact strict concessions if it goes ahead at all. This is one of those happy moments for governments when the popular course is also the right policy."
61;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2009-02-10T18:55:05Z;Ticket groups defend merger;;"Live Nation and Ticketmaster Entertainment came out fighting on Tuesday as they confirmed plans for an all-stock merger that is expected to face challenges from artists, regulators and concert venue owners.Barry Diller, chairman of Ticketmaster and the proposed chairman of the merged group, said ticket prices were set by artists rather than by ticket companies and argued that the deal would create a financially stronger company.He dismissed as “a tech glitch” an incident in which customers were steered
to a Ticketmaster-owned “secondary ticketing” website, where tickets for a Bruce Springsteen concert were resold for up to 20 times their $95 face value.The incident triggered a complaint from Mr Springsteen, a lawsuit in Canada, investigations from the attorneys-general of New Jersey and Connecticut, and comments from Charles Schumer, the New York senator, which Mr Diller described as “untrue”.The companies said they could complete the deal “by the second half of 2009”, in spite of an expected extended battle with regulators over a merger that would create a dominant force in live music, spanning artist management, promotion, venue ownership and ticketing.The US Department of Justice is expected to focus on the “vertical integration” of combining the leading company in the ticketing market with Live Nation’s venue and artist relationships. Rivals predicted tension with venue owners.The two groups expressed hope that the combined company, with an enterprise value of $2.5bn, sales of $6bn and operating income of almost $500m, would be more stable in uncertain credit markets.Michael Rapino, chief executive of Live Nation and the proposed CEO of the merged Live Nation Entertainment, said the combination would produce “measurable benefits to consumers.”Irving Azoff, the manager of acts such as The Eagles, who became CEO of Ticketmaster last year and will become executive chairman, said it would develop the bond between artists and fans “to unsurpassed levels”.Each group’s shareholders will hold an equal stake in the combined company although Live Nation’s earnings are slightly lower.The companies said they expected to find about $40m in operating savings.Mr Diller countered questions about the company’s proposed management
structure, saying there was “unique synchronicity” between Mr Azoff and Mr Rapino.Joe Cohen, chief executive of rival Seatwave, told the FT: “I cannot see how this is good for consumers. I think 12 months from now we’ll be looking at higher prices.”"
62;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2009-02-09T23:16:28Z;Misgivings over big ticket tie-up;;"Ticketmaster and Live Nation were on Monday night hoping to announce a merger as early as Tuesday morning in the face of a chorus of concern from artists, politicians and competition lawyers.Both companies’ boards were meeting to discuss a combination that would create the most powerful force in the music industry, spanning ticketing, venue ownership, artist management and merchandising.The two groups agreed an unconventional management structure which would see power shared between three figures, according to people briefed on their discussions.Barry Diller, chairman of Ticketmaster’s former parent company IAC, would become chairman; Irving Azoff, the artist manager who became Ticketmaster’s chief executive last year, would become executive chairman; and Live Nation chief executive Michael Rapino, would be named chief executive of the new group.The two companies, which could save $40m from combined costs, face pressure to explain how the deal would benefit consumers and artists, when the ticketing industry is already under intense scrutiny.Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney-general, said that the proposed merger would create “a singular and dangerously dominant force in the industry that threatens to illegally cut competition and consumer interests.”His office is already investigating complaints that Ticketmaster inappropriately steered online customers to TicketsNow, another of its websites, where tickets for a Bruce Springsteen concert were resold for up to 20 times their $95 face value.Charles Schumer, the New York senator, and Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey congressman, called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Ticketmaster for the practice.The New Jersey attorney-general is investigating whether any violations of the state’s consumer fraud act or ticket resale law occurred.Marc Schildkraut, a former assistant director at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) now working for Howrey, a Washington law firm, said he expected the deal to be subjected to extended scrutiny by the new administration’s antitrust team.Christine Varney, President Obama’s choice to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, had raised objections in a past role at the FTC in cases posing “vertical integration” issues similar to those in the proposed merger, he said.Mr Springsteen said last week that the proposed merger would be “the one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan”, creating “a near-monopoly situation in music ticketing”."
63;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2009-02-06T23:15:31Z;Ticketmaster/Live Nation;;"What an unpopular melody. A mooted merger between Ticketmaster and concert producer Live Nation has yet to be confirmed. The idea, though, has prompted anguished howls from around the music industry. Even Bruce Springsteen is in on the act. His objection mainly concerns the ability of the combined company to direct fans to its resale sites (with higher prices) rather than offering tickets at face value – a charge already levelled at Ticketmaster.Nobody likes paying over the odds. And, given the general outrage, an antitrust investigation beckons, should a deal progress. There would be two broad issues. The first, concerning horizontal concentration within specific markets, is somewhat incidental. The two largely operate in separate domains. True, Ticketmaster dominates ticketing in areas such as concerts and has proved adept at defending that position. Live Nation only in January took its own ticketing inhouse, having also threatened to create more competition by courting third parties. Consumers may feel aggrieved by ticket charges – but ultimately a deal would merely reinstate the competitive landscape of last year.The second issue (concerning vertical integration) is more knotty. A merger would combine artist management (through Ticketmaster’s Front Line acquisition last year) with concert production, venues and primary and secondary ticketing. With interests from singer to stage, the company could squeeze competitors in each area, for example, a non-Ticketmaster venue seeking to attract the top talent, a process known as foreclosure. This kind of competitive threat was largely brushed aside in the name of efficiency under the Bush administration.That Thomas Weisel Partners estimates the deal’s cost savings at just 1 per cent of operating expenses reflects that vertical restraints, rather than a classic horizontal monopoly, is likely to be the hot topic. A high-profile clampdown on ticketing power by authorities may prove popular. Even more tempting, perhaps, is the opportunity to reverse the prevailing competitive wisdom of the past eight years.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

64;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2009-02-04T23:35:13Z;Ticket deal faces close inspection;;A merger between Live Nation and Ticketmaster could provide one of the earliest tests of competition policy under the Obama administration, analysts and rivals said on Wednesday as they predicted that the planned deal would face close scrutiny.Live Nation, the world’s largest concert promoter and operator of venues including Wembley Arena, is in talks with Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticketing and artist management group, people familiar with the groups said, with a deal possible as early as next week.Both companies declined to comment, and the talks could yet be derailed by management, price or antitrust issues.Earlier talks between Ticketmaster and Anschutz Entertainment Group, the rival venue owner, collapsed.Several people predicted strong opposition to a deal that could face scrutiny by the Department of Justice and some national regulators in Europe.“For consumers in the US it would definitely limit the competition. We’d strongly object to this merger,” Don Vaccaro, chief executive of TicketNetwork.com, a secondary ticketing provider, said.He warned that a combined group could force artists it manages to favour the venues it owns.Chris Tsakalakis, president of StubHub, another secondary ticketing group, said: “This merger would not be in the best interest of fans, artists or promoters.”David Kestenbaum, director of equity research at Morgan Joseph, said: “The unknown is how the new Justice Department will react to mergers, but our view is that it will be much tougher than the previous administration.”Shares in both groups rose at the prospect of a merger of two similarly sized businesses that would boost them as a period of rapid growth for the live music industry is expected to end.Natixis Bleichroeder analysts said a deal could end the “game of mutually assured destruction” played by the two companies as they stepped further into each other’s core areas.Through its acquisition of Irving Azoff’s Front Line Management business last October, Ticketmaster began representing acts including The Eagles and Miley Cyrus, moving into the same territory as Live Nation, which has deals with Madonna and U2.Live Nation had been Ticketmaster’s largest customer but launched its own ticketing business last year.Mr Azoff looks poised to chair the merged group, with Live Nation’s Michael Rapino taking the chief executive role.One artist manager welcomed the proposed deal: “The industry needs any good ideas it can find.“There are far too many individual interests in the concert business for it to be sinister.”The two companies could ease antitrust concerns by offering more transparency in ticket pricing, such as removing service fees, and using artists’ fan networks to reduce the number of unsold tickets at concerts.
65;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2009-01-13T16:17:28Z;Live entertainment;;"Fans are said to take their name from “fanatics”. Screaming crowds chasing the latest boy-band demonstrate that logic. But will cash-strapped enthusiasts continue to buy show tickets? Live entertainment takings proved resilient in the 2001 downturn. But a severe, consumer-led slump may make this year more reminiscent of the early 1990s, when North America’s concert industry shrank by 25 per cent. Cyclical pressures will be exacerbated by average top ticket prices that have more than doubled since 1998, according to Pollstar.Companies such as Ticketmaster and concert promoter Live Nation argue that must-see shows still draw crowds. Live entertainment as an (on average) yearly treat may better survive consumer belt-tightening than weekly distractions. But ticket sales in 2008 were skewed to the first half. Investors have since punished both stocks. Ticketmaster, down 70 per cent since it was spun out of IAC last August, has borne the brunt, in part because the company has other strategic concerns. Live Nation, Ticketmaster’s largest customer in 2007 with 17 per cent of revenues, last year opted to take ticketing for its own venues in-house, and followed up by signing a ticketing agreement with venue operator SMG.In teaming up with talent agency Front Line last October, however, Ticketmaster has replaced some lost sales with higher margin business, and strengthened its negotiating hand with venues, which in the US control ticketing policy. Its exposure to sports, where higher inventory means fewer sell-outs, at about 20 per cent of sales, is a concern in a downturn. But relationships with major sports leagues will also help to keep the venues that house them on Ticketmaster’s side, even before technology or marketing clout come into play. Up 6 per cent so far this year, Ticketmaster is languishing on less than five times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Music buffs should consider buying more than the latest hot ticket.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

66;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2008-06-24T18:36:50Z;By promoting gigs, record labels get in on bigger act;;A high-level feud at Live Nation, the world’s largest concert promoter, has all the ego-drenched drama of a rock band on tour. Michael Cohl, the company’s chairman, is quitting after a bust-up with Michael Rapino, a protégé whom he brought in from the brewing business and later made chief executive of Live Nation.Mr Cohl got his start running a strip club in Canada before going on to organise the highest grossing tours of all time, including the Rolling Stones’ Bigger Bang. Yet music industry executives are closely following the saga not only for the personal drama but because of the strategic dispute at the heart of the matter.The two men had contrasting views of the so-called “360 deals” that have become the principal survival strategy for many music companies at a time when compact disc sales are grinding towards extinction.Through such agreements – also known as multiple rights deals – record companies are trying to move beyond traditional record sales to handle their artists’ concert tours, corporate sponsorships, merchandise sales, websites, fan clubs and just about any other source of ancillary revenues imaginable. “We ultimately will become the fifth member of each band,” is how Monte Lipman, president of Universal Republic Records, describes his label’s ambition.Since Robbie Williams signed a groundbreaking £80m ($158m, €101m) contract with EMI in 2002, such all-encompassing deals are becoming ubiquitous in the industry. The Pussycat Dolls, Paramore and Korn have also agreed to variations on the 360 theme. Disney, whose roster of stars includes the Jonas Brothers, employs multiple rights deals, as does American Idol.Coming from the other end of the industry, Live Nation supplied the most visible example of the new model last year when it inked a deal with Madonna in which she will be paid more than $100m in exchange for the rights to just about everything she does. Live Nation then closed an even richer deal with Jay-Z. “Very quietly, they’ve become the norm,” says Steve Greenberg, chief executive of S-Curve Records, an independent label that is distributed by EMI.Still, each deal differs from the next, depending in part on the composition of artists’ business and their leverage in negotiations. In some 360s the record company provides merchandise sales, concert promotion and other activities while in others it takes a “passive” percentage of the revenues from these businesses without doing the work.The question is whether such arrangements represent a viable new model for an industry in crisis or merely another record company ploy to capture a bigger share of artists’ earnings. Some certainly suspect the latter. “If you sign up to one of these things and you have any success, the first thing an artist is going to do is to try to get out of it,” says Chris Castle, a music industry lawyer.Rick Dobbis, a business manager for the Rolling Stones, does not dismiss the concept but remains sceptical. “If you look around, I don’t know how much additional expertise has been added at various record companies to justify why they should be participating in all these other areas,” Mr Dobbis says. Even some record executives admit that it can be difficult to ask an established artist to share revenues from activities that the label does not manage. (“Can you please give us more money?” is how one record executive characterises the approach.)To proponents, though, 360 deals represent a necessary rebalancing of the industry’s economics. Record companies, they note, are the ones that pay to sign artists, groom them and then use their corporate marketing clout to get them on the radio. Nine times out of 10 they fail. So, runs the rationale, they should be entitled to a share of all the bounty on the occasion when one of their bets pays off.“I think record companies are entitled to it. They’ve spent a great deal of their time creating a brand in an artist. But they don’t get the benefit of that brand in terms of touring and merchandise,” says Martin Bandier, chief executive of Sony/ATV Music Publishing.The other argument for 360s is less about fairness than harmony. When record companies earn money only from record sales, they tend to push their artists into the studio to crank out albums when it might benefit them to spend more time writing new material or honing their skills on the road. An arrangement should allow the record company to take a more holistic view of an artist’s career.“This is not a land grab. This is a real bona fide opportunity to make the pie bigger,” says Craig Kallman, chairman of Atlantic Records Group, a division of Warner Music, which cites the band Paramore as an example of the virtues of the 360 approach. Formed in 2004, Paramore gradually built a grassroots following before blossoming into global popularity last year. That might not have happened if Atlantic had taken a more traditional approach by trying to rush a single on to the radio, Mr Kallman argues.When it comes to 360s, Warner is focusing on new artists – hoping to participate in the upside as their careers develop. That appears to have been the crux of the dispute at Live Nation, where the bets run to nine-figure sums of dollars. Eager to build scale, Mr Cohl was pushing for a slew of additional big deals. But with the company’s shares losing nearly half their value since the Madonna signing, Mr Rapino advocated a go-slow approach.Live Nation declined to comment and it is too soon to judge whether its deals will pan out. In the long run, though, many in the industry say the model will succeed or fail to the extent that its purveyors can deliver on their promise of new services. To that end, Universal, Warner and others have been quietly snapping up smaller companies that specialise in artist management, merchandising and other areas.Even with such investments, it may take years to polish their acts. “It took a long time for us to feel reasonably confident and we still have a long way to go,” one record executive confesses of his label’s early efforts to break into the concert business. “The [360] model is easy,” he concludes, “but doing the work is the hard part.”
67;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2008-06-19T23:19:31Z;Split at Live Nation over strategy;;A dispute over strategy is leading to a break-up at the world’s largest concert promoter, Live Nation, where chairman Michael Cohl is negotiating his departure, according to a person familiar with the matter.Mr Cohl, who joined Live Nation a year ago, is renowned in the music industry for orchestrating some of the biggest-grossing concerts of all time, including the Rolling Stones’ Bigger Bang tour.Yet he clashed with Live Nation’s chief executive, Michael Rapino, after the pair negotiated massive, all-encompassing deals with artists Madonna and Jay-Z that paid the artists more than $100m each for rights to everything from touring and merchandise to record sales.Mr Cohl was eager to push ahead with several more so-called “360-deals”, according to people familiar with the matter. However, Mr Rapino objected, preferring to move at a slower pace.The dispute, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is particularly bitter because Mr Cohl recommended Mr Rapino for his job at Live Nation, according to a person who knows them. It is being followed throughout the music industry, where 360-deals are being touted as the model of the future at a time when compact disc sales are collapsing.However, some sceptics argue that record companies lack the expertise to arrange tours for artists and sell merchandise. In a similar vein, they note that Live Nation does not have experience selling and distributing artists’ albums.The company’s strategy has raised eyebrows on Wall Street due to the enormity of the bets that it has placed.Its shares have lost nearly half their value since the Madonna deal was announced last year.Mr Rapino was apparently aware of investors’ concerns. Live Nation’s strategy could be further tested at a time when the US economy is slowing and consumers may not be willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a single concert ticket. Corporate sponsors, another key source of revenue, could also pull back.While acknowledging the high up-front costs, Mr Cohl has argued that it was necessary to push ahead with several additional deals so the business could benefit from greater scale, according to a person familiar with the matter.Live Nation declined to comment.Mr Cohl, Live Nation’s largest shareholder, could remain with the company as a consultant, one person said.
68;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2008-06-03T09:05:38Z;Better regulation of ticket resales urged;;A group representing 400 musicians and their managers is demanding greater regulation of the secondary ticketing market, claiming that a partnership between Madonna and ticket resale site Viagogo suggests the industry cannot regulate itself.The Resale Rights Society, whose members includes the management of Robbie Williams, Radiohead and the Arctic Monkeys, said that Madonna’s partnership with Viagogo as the “official” ticket resale website for her “Sticky & Sweet” tour did not protect consumers or help artists.The RRS said tickets were available on several other reselling sites, often at inflated prices and without the security that official partners provide.It argues that exclusive arrangements also prevented artists from profiting from sales on other secondary ticketing sites, as they would through a levy scheme proposed by the RRS.“The nature of these exclusives are meaningless,” said Marc Marot, chairman-designate of the RRS, because they could not prevent tickets being resold on hundreds of other sites where Madonna would not get a share of revenues.“We feel very strongly that a huge amount of money is being made by lots of people that cuts out the artist that creates the [intellectual property] in the first place.”He added: “There ought to be a blanket right like the Performing Rights Society where artists get a little piece of every transaction right across the board.”The rapid decline in recorded music sales has meant artists are increasingly reliant on live music to generate income. But operators of secondary ticketing sites, which include Seatwave and GetMeIn as well as Viagogo, said it was not possible to control were tickets were sold and accused the RRS of trying to impose a “tax on fans”.Eric Baker, chief executive of Viagogo, said the RRS’s demands for royalties from secondary ticketing revenues were “just as ludicrous” as authors or car manufacturers wanting a share of second-hand sales.He said that Madonna and Live Nation, her management and concert promoter, partnered with Viagogo because it guaranteed security and ticket delivery for fans. “[The RRS] are just upset because they’re not getting paid,” he said. “Obviously Madonna, Live Nation and Viagogo believe that [ours] is a much better solution for everyone involved.”Both the RRS and Viagogo claim to be protecting the interests of consumers and artists.Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, an investor in Viagogo, said the row was a “classic example of how the internet disintermediates. You’re going to have a few unhappy people who are extremely vocal.“There’s no such thing as exclusivity in secondary ticketing,” he added. “We’re not fleecing the consumer, we’re providing what they want.”No other leading artists have yet signed official partnerships that between Madonna and Viagogo. Joe Cohen, chief executive of Seatwave, said that he did not believe the deal would “unleash a torrent of other deals”.“The market will move to a place where there is a regular agreement between secondary exchanges and artists on the value that they can provide to one another,” said Mr Cohen. “In time, we will see deals get cut at reasonable economics for both parties.”Andrew Blachman, general manager of GetMeIn, a ticketing marketplace acquired in January by Ticketmaster, said that a greater choice of secondary ticketing sites created competition, “resulting in higher standards of service and lower prices”.“The UK government has investigated this issue for three years and we agree with their conclusion that regulation is not the answer.”
69;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2008-04-03T18:49:24Z;MySpace challenges Apple in digital music;;News Corp’s MySpace social networking site will attempt to challenge Apple’s hegemony in the burgeoning digital music market after joining with three of the largest record companies to launch its own music service.MySpace Music is expected to debut later this year and will enjoy backing from Universal Music, the largest record company, Sony BMG and Warner Music – all of whom received equity stakes in the venture.EMI, the remaining major, is still in discussions.The service is an attempt to marry MySpace’s vast online audience and its social networking capabilities to the catalogues of the largest music companies.Fans will be able to listen to free streams of music, which will be supported by advertising, pay for downloads and ringtones, and buy concert tickets and merchandise.Chris DeWolfe, MySpace co-founder, called the venture “the next generation of music” and noted that its catalogue would rival that of Apple’s iTunes store.The partnership reflects record companies’ new embrace of the sort of internet sites that they once shunned.If successful, it could also help them to move beyond their reliance on compact disc sales, which are rapidly collapsing, into other music-related revenue streams.The urgency to do so has increased as Live Nation, the concert promoter, has begun to encroach on the record companies’ traditional turf by signing artists such as Madonna, U2 and Jay-Z to long-term, all-encompassing deals.MySpace Music could also provide the record companies with a long-desired counterweight to Apple, whose iTunes store controls about three-quarters of the digital music market.Mr DeWolfe said MySpace Music was aiming to offer the majority of its tracks without digital rights management, which would allow them to play on any device, including the iPod.“We want the downloads to be DRM-free just because the iPod is so ubiquitous,” he said. He also indicated that MySpace Music would offer variable pricing – something that Apple has repeatedly resisted.The partnership came at a high price for MySpace, which had to first settle a copyright lawsuit filed by Universal Music in 2006.One person familiar with the negotiations claimed that Universal will receive roughly $100m from MySpace in addition to its equity stake. Both companies declined to comment.MySpace boasts more than 110m users and considers music to be one of the pillars of its site. Until now, record companies have primarily used it as a promotional tool for their artists, making only limited attempts to sell tracks.The deal could put new pressure on Facebook, one of MySpace’s chief rivals.
70;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2008-03-24T22:52:08Z;Rival labels look to give Stones shelter;;While the Rolling Stones focus on the imminent release of their latest album, Shine A Light, record companies are vying to sign the band to a long-term deal in a contest that highlights the ways in which the music industry is changing.Universal Music, Sony BMG and Warner Music have already begun courting the Stones in an effort to wrest them away from their long-time label, EMI. The band’s contract expires in June, and they are expected to finalise their plans within months.The Stones’ next deal is significant because it will not only include new albums, but also the rights to their catalogue of post- 1971 releases, including such classics as Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street. Those works sold more than 300,000 copies in the US last year, and tend to spike each time the band tours.The negotiations pose a high-profile test for EMI and its new private equity owner, Guy Hands, to prove that they can retain top talent.Mr Hands unsettled the artist community after buying the embattled company for £4bn ($7.9bn) last year, and announcing deep cost cuts in an attempt to remake the business.The talks are also significant because, in addition to the major record companies, EMI will be facing competition from Live Nation, the concert promoter.Last year, the company signed Madonna away from Warner Music in a landmark deal believed to be worth more than $100m.Record companies, merchandisers and touring promoters are increasingly trying to expand into one another’s business at a time when sales of physical albums are collapsing.The Rolling Stones first signed with EMI in 1977. Yet they were one of the first bands to register their discomfort with Mr Hands when they moved Shine A Light, which accompanies a Martin Scorsese film about the band, to rival Universal in January.Disney subsequently followed suit, shifting the European distribution of one of its top emerging acts, the Jonas Brothers, from EMI to Universal.EMI did not immediately comment. However, Mr Hands has been involved in efforts to retain the Stones, according to people familiar with the talks.The Stones’ last album, A Bigger Bang, generated only modest sales in spite of favourable reviews. However, the accompanying tour, produced by Live Nation’s chairman, Michael Cohl, became the highest grossing ever, with receipts of more than $500m, according to Billboard, the industry trade journal.Some people close to the discussions have speculated the band could keep the albums and touring rights separate in their next deal rather than signing an all-encompassing pact like Madonna.
71;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2007-10-11T19:08:49Z;Music industry changes its tune;;As the music industry struggles to reinvent itself for the digital age, some of its most bankable artists are the ones calling the tune.Madonna this week neared a landmark deal to leave Warner Music, her long-time label, for Live Nation, the concert promoter.The 10-year contract would pay more than $70m in cash and stock advances for albums, tours and merchandise, according to people familiar with its terms. Altogether, it could be worth well over $100m for the Material Girl.To record executives and Wall Street analysts, Madonna’s deal represents either a bold bet or an extravagant one by Live Nation that it can break into the broader music industry. Michael Savner, a Bank of America analyst, noted on Thursday that Madonna would turn 60 in the contract’s last year.What is beyond dispute is that the deal is another indication that the collapse of compact disc sales – long the record companies’ lifeblood – is scrambling the traditional relationships between talent, labels and concert promoters that have governed the industry for decades.“It is inevitable,” Barry Diller, chief executive of IAC, which owns TicketMaster, told investors last month.“The idea that these are going be separate horizontal pots is over.”This week, Radiohead began distributing digital versions of its new album, inviting fans to pay as little or as much as they wanted. The band achieved enormous publicity for the move with no help from any record company’s marketing machine.In recent months, Prince has given away his last album through a UK newspaper to promote concert sales, Paul McCartney has signed with Starbucks, and the Eagles have agreed an exclusive US distribution deal with Wal-Mart.Such artist-driven challenges to record companies’ traditional model seem to be adding new meaning to the term one-man band.Yet the record companies themselves are among those most aggressively deserting the traditional business model.With digital sales failing to make up for double-digit declines in physical sales, labels are now trying to participate in all their artists’ revenue streams – from touring to ringtones and merchandise.Universal Music and Warner have invested in artist management groups, and Sony BMG and EMI have laid out plans to sign more “360-degree deals” with new artists. “The idea is, let’s become a talent developer rather than a CD seller,” Rolf Schmidt-Holtz, chief executive of Sony BMG, told the Financial Times last week.Inevitably, the companies that own such assets are not eager to give them up, and – as with Live Nation – are in turn trying to move closer to artists. But Edgar Bronfman, Warner Music’s chief executive, argues that record companies have an advantage in this clash: their ability to find artists early in their career.“Ticketmaster and Live Nation theoretically, potentially are a competitor, but frankly, we’re seeing artists so much earlier,” he told a conference last month.Warner could strike all-encompassing deals on profitable terms, he said, while the promotion agencies would have to “pay retail”.The Live Nation deal is certainly an indication of the power that established artists enjoy in this new environment.One of its remarkable features, however, is that rights to Madonna’s catalogue will remain with Warner. Without these, Live Nation’s deal may not make economic sense.Warner may be losing one of its biggest artists, Mr Savner of Bank of America said on Thursday, but “the bigger risk, in our view, would be to overpay for an artist that does not seem to be generating the revenue to support the contract being discussed”.There have been similar fears about the balance of power between music companies and artists before. In 1992, Madonna set up her own record label, Maverick, following the example of artists such as U2 and Led Zeppelin.None made a dent in the power of the music majors, however, and Madonna was bought out of Maverick by Warner in 2004.“They’re no better at doing business than record executives are at singing,” one seasoned industry member said on Thursday.Analysts believe that only the world’s biggest acts can afford to go solo and note that few of these are turning their backs on the industry altogether.Radiohead is in talks with the major labels and independents to market the CD it intends to issue in January, and the Eagles have turned to Universal for their distribution needs outside the US.Music executives are still irked by such initiatives, however, noting that only the investment they have made allows established artists to go it alone. “Ours is the seed capital that really makes an artist’s brand,” Mr Bronfman commented.For every band “discovered” on MySpace, thousands of undiscovered talents still struggle. The vast majority of artists still need labels to break them and then promote them. But if Live Nation’s gamble pays off, then it may be a concert promoter or ticket vendor that grooms – and profits from – a future queen of pop.
72;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2007-08-06T21:29:35Z;Investors bear down on Warner Music;;Shares in Warner Music fell to a record low on Monday – more than 60 per cent below their peak for the year – as the last quoted recorded music company became the focus for investors’ bearishness about the industry’s prospects.Last month’s decision by Warner, which is due to report third-quarter earnings today, to drop its seven-year pursuit of EMI has raised questions about its prospects in the absence of a merger, which could have provided cost-saving opportunities and built a stronger rival to the larger Universal Music and Sony BMG.Its shares, which peaked at $27.24 late last year, were trading at $10.67, down 3 per cent, on Monday, after analysts at Citigroup lowered their price target from $19 to $10 per share.Warner is expected to report today that its US market share is at its highest level for a decade, at 20.4 per cent, and its share of revenues coming from digital distribution continues to rise.However, such strengths have been overshadowed by continued bad news about CD sales, still the most important part of the recorded music market, and by concerns that Warner may have to pay up to keep some of its most valuable artists.Sales of physical formats are down 19 per cent so far this year in the US, Warner’s largest market. Announcements in recent weeks showing that Universal and Sony BMG have increased recorded music sales in the face of these conditions have raised concerns that smaller groups may be suffering disproportionately.Warner is also understood to be fighting to retain one of its best known artists. Madonna, who is signed to the group for one more studio album and a greatest hits album, is understood to have held talks with Live Nation that could see her record future albums with the concert promoter.“We’d love to keep her and we’ll make an aggressive bid,” said one person close to Warner. Should Madonna leave Warner, the company would retain her recorded music catalogue and publishing rights but her defection would be a symbolic blow.The same person denied industry rumours that Warner’s falling share price could trigger a shake-up in its executive ranks. The position of Lyor Cohen, head of its US recorded music business, has been strengthened by chart successes from Linkin Park, Nickelback and Michael Bublé.Edgar Bronfman Jr, chairman and chief executive, is one of its largest shareholders, having invested in the private equity-backed buy-out from Time Warner in November 2003.Less than a week after Terra Firma secured control of EMI, Warner executives are still thought to be interested in a combination with EMI Music, should the private equity group decide to sell on the recorded music division, as expected.However, the downturn in the CD market could make Warner’s investors more wary of investing more in recorded music.On Monday, the group announced its latest deal to bulk up Warner Chappell, its music publishing business, with the acquisition of Non-Stop Music for an undisclosed sum. Non-Stop has licensed music to films such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter and Shrek 3.Mr Bronfman is expected to tell investors today that healthier areas of the music business, such as publishing, strategic marketing and brand management, are likely to become a growing focus.
73;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;IAC slides as Ticketmaster disappoints;;Shares in IAC/Interactive Corp fell as much as 7 per cent after disappointing revenues at Home Shopping Network and Ticketmaster dragged down earnings at the media and internet company.Ticketmaster, a service through which live-event venues sell tickets, saw its revenues increase 3 per cent to $303m, but revenue in the US fell 5 per cent due to fewer large concerts, the company said. The website also saw higher administration and technology costs.“While we expected this quarter to be difficult, we did not anticipate the softness in domestic ticketing volumes which impacted Ticketmaster,” said Barry Diller, the veteran media entrepreneur who is chairman and chief executive of the company. “We are not satisfied with these results - whether driven by market conditions or our own hand.”Ticketmaster faces an uncertain future because 15-20 per cent of its business relies on a contract with Live Nation, the live events business recently spun out of Clear Channel. That contract may not be renewed next year, according to Jeffrey Lindsay, an analyst at Berstein Research.Lending Tree, IAC’s online mortgage lender, saw revenues down 9 per cent to $99m because of the troubled US housing market.Home Shopping Network saw revenues fall 1 per cent after shutting its America’s Store business.Mr Diller said that talks between IAC and John Malone’s Liberty Media over a possible swap of HSN for some of Liberty’s 25 per cent stake in IAC were ongoing. Liberty owns HSN’s more successful rival shopping channel QVC.Separately, Mr Diller warned that current credit market conditions stood in the way of share buyback plans at IAC. Expedia, which Mr Diller also runs, was recently forced to slash a $3.5bn stock repurchase plan because of the unfavourable market conditions.“There was and is a credit freeze-up,” he said. “Certainly it will abate at some point, and when it does, you will see us doing [buybacks] for Expedia and IAC.”Net income rose 78 per cent to $96m, or 32 cents a share, but included the $196m sale of HSE24, the German wing of HSN. Excluding special items, earnings per share were 31 cents, against analysts’ expectations of 33 cents net income. Operating income fell 33 per cent to $54m because of greater marketing expenses. Revenues grew 5.6 per cent to $1.51bn.Shares in IAC were down 3.9 per cent, or $1.17 to $29.19 by 1pm. Earlier they were down by as much as 7 per cent.IAC owns more than 60 brands, which also include search engine Ask.com and dating website Match.com.
74;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2007-02-23T14:02:29Z;Clear Channel down on sale of unit;;Clear Channel, which accepted a private equity takeover bid in November, reported net earnings in the fourth quarter down 54 per cent from last year.Net income at the world’s biggest radio group was $211m, or 43 cents a share, falling from $462m, or 86 cents, a year ago, when the Live Nation concert business - which has since been sold - and other discontinued units contributed $278.9m.Analysts had expected earnings per share of 41 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.Clear Channel has agreed to be acquired for $19bn by a consortium led by Bain Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners, already joint owners of Warner Music. The deal, the biggest ever in the traditional media industry, is awaiting approval from shareholders. Fidelity Partners, the largest shareholder group, opposes the takeover.Revenues at the company rose 11 per cent to $1.94bn in the quarter.Net income for the year was $692m, or $1.38 a share, down 26 per cent from $936, or $1.16 per share, last year. Revenues were up 7 per cent to $7.07bn.Radio broadcasting revenues rose 6 per cent to $3.7bn over the year on an increase in both local and national advertising revenues. Outdoor advertising revenue lifted 9 per cent to $2.9bn during the year on a stronger Americas performance.Clear Channel said that indications of current sales, known as “pacing”, were up 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2007 and up 0.5 per cent for the full year.
75;LYV;Live Nation Entertainment;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
