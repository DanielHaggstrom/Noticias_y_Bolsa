Prologis eventually plans to shed about $3.5bn of warehouse and office properties it does not view as strategic. It also forecast $120m in cost savings.The deal comes at a time when industrial warehouses — once a relative afterthought in the property industry — have become among its hottest investments due to the rise of ecommerce. As consumers demand ever-faster deliveries for a growing menu of items, state-of-the-art warehouses near big markets have become essential to retailers such as Amazon, Target and many others.The warehouses are vital not only to make “last mile” deliveries but also to handle the huge volume of returns that are a part of online shopping.“The increase in the value of advanced warehouse facilities mirrors the decline in the value of retail locations,” said Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan.“In a downturn, modern, well-located warehouses are likely to outperform most forms of real estate.”In June, Blackstone, the private equity group, acquired the US warehouses portfolio of GLP, another warehouse company, for $18.7bn. At the time, Ken Caplan, Blackstone’s co-head of real estate, called logistics “our highest conviction global investment theme today”.Even as questions swirl about the broader economy, Prologis recently raised its forecast for 2019 rent increases at its facilities to 7 per cent. The company recently opened a three-storey warehouse near Seattle — the first of its kind.The Liberty deal comes on the heels of Prologis’ acquisition of another industrial property group, IPT, for about $4bn, in July. That deal is still pending. It also bought other companies in the sector in 2015 and 2018. It now boasts about 900m square feet of warehouse property around the world.Mr Moghadam acknowledged that slowing economic growth would, inevitably, have an impact on the warehouse business. But he argued that it was coping well with the trade war between the US and China as nervous companies stockpile goods.“In the face of uncertainty, people have to carry more inventory,” he said.Under the deal, Prologis is offering Liberty investors 0.675 Prologis shares for each of their own — equivalent to a 21 per cent premium from Friday’s market close. BofA Securities and Morgan Stanley are acting as advisers.*An earlier version of this story misnamed Liberty Property Trust. The story has been amended since initial publication to clarify that Blackstone purchased a portfolio of properties from GLP.

Pricing power is returning,” Mr Moghadam told the Financial Times.Prologis said average rental rates on leases signed in the second quarter increased 4 per cent from a year ago. In the first quarter they rose 2 per cent year-on-year. This marks the first time in more than four years that rates increased for two consecutive quarters.Vacancies for Prologis buildings, greater than 250,000 sq ft, stand at only 1 per cent while those more than 500,000 sq ft are fully occupied. Its tenants include Amazon, FedEx, Unilever and Home Depot.Logistics experts say it is hard to modify old-fashioned warehouses to serve online shopping, which requires buildings capable of managing smaller orders, sustain greater employee density and are located close to urban areas for shorter delivery times.Prologis expects to spend $2bn on development this year, up from $1.2bn in 2012. A large portion of this will be used to construct ecommerce related buildings, which represented a third of all new development last year.“The supply chain needs of online delivery are completely different from in-store delivery. Companies need new buildings and this is driving demand in a very big way,” Mr Moghadam said.The San Francisco-based company has approximately $48bn of assets owned, managed and under development in countries from the US and Brazil to China and Japan.Although the US is the world’s largest ecommerce market, Prologis is also benefiting from growing demand from countries such as China, Brazil and Mexico where “big box” retailers are uncommon. About 40 per cent of the company’s assets rest outside of the US.“Ecommerce has become the most important driver of industrial property development since China entered the World Trade Organisation [in 2001] and drove up demand for cargo containers,” said Rene Circ, director of industrial research at CoStar Group.

NBIM’s previous investments have tended towards the top end of the market and include a 25 per cent stake in London’s Regent Street and shops on the Champs-Elysées in Paris.The fund, which will be managed by Prologis, will be seeded with a portfolio of 195 properties with floor space of almost 50m sq ft, all of which are already owned by the US group. The bulk of the portfolio will then be built through acquiring assets on the open market.Karsten Kallevig, chief investment officer for real estate at NBIM, said the move into industrial property with Prologis marked an advance in its strategy of increasing its real estate exposure.NBIM has a stated strategy of investing in property through joint venture partnerships. It announced a tie-up this year with Generali, the Italian insurer, to buy offices and shops in central Paris. It also bought a half-stake in Meadowhall, the £1.5bn Sheffield shopping centre, in October.At the start of December, NBIM said it planned to invest about $11bn in the US real estate market.The oil fund has been struggling to reach its target of investing 5 per cent of its assets in real estate, largely because it keeps increasing in value. At the end of the third quarter, property represented just 0.3 per cent of its $650bn in assets and the fund has already increased in size since then to $685bn.The Norwegian government has been reluctant to sanction the fund to invest in other areas – such as private equity and hedge funds, as NBIM itself has proposed for a number of years – at least until it reaches full potential in real estate.Returns from real estate have lagged behind those of the overall fund in four of the six quarters since Norges Bank started reporting them.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
