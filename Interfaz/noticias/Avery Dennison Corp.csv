0;AVY;Avery Dennison Corp;2011-07-19T22:12:58Z;Wall Street lifted by tech shares;;Technology stocks rose the most in a year after IBM’s strong earnings.Industry bellwether IBM topped expectations as revenues surged across its businesses, particularly in sales of servers. It raised its full-year earnings forecast to $13.25 a share, versus the $12.31 that analysts had been anticipating.IBM shares were up 5.7 per cent at $185.21. It led the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which added 200 points, rising 1.6 per cent to 12,587.42.There were hints of caution, as IBM explained that many of the sales of servers were delayed refreshings of existing equipment rather than new sales.But tech traders drove shares of other IT infrastructure groups higher. Broadcom and F5 Networks, which build data storage and networking equipment, led the sector.Broadcom added 6.2 per cent to $34.70, and F5 gained 6.1 per cent to $118.56.Technology groups dominated gains, with the S&P 500 sector higher by 2.7 per cent, its best one-day gain since July 2010.The Nasdaq Composite index enjoyed its best session since October, rising 2.2 per cent to 2,826.52.The broader S&P index – where tech shares make up the largest weighting – was up 1.6 per cent at 1,326.73, its biggest gain since March.The index was boosted by a jump in News Corp, whose shares jumped 5.5 per cent to $15.79. Rupert Murdoch, the company’s chairman and chief executive, was questioned by MPs on a UK parliamentary committee on Tuesday and denied responsibility for alleged phone hacking.Apple recorded earnings of $7.79 a share versus forecasts of $5.87 a share. The shares hit $400 in after-hour trading. Apple’s shares are 10 per cent above their 50-day moving average at $376.85, an all-time high. The shares were up just 0.8 per cent on Tuesday.But strategists at Bespoke Investment Group say that should not prevent big gains if Apple tops estimates of $5.87 in earnings per share for the quarter.“History has shown that the stock has actually done better on report days when it has been overbought than when it has been oversold,” they said.Kevin Pleines, Birinyi Associates analyst, noted that Apple never issues guidance above what Wall Street expects, and so has easily beaten expectations in every quarter since 2004. During trading the day before it reports, Apple has registered gains 71 per cent of the time.The financial sector is lagging, up 1.4 per cent on the session, due to mixed trading among its biggest members.Bank of America reported a one-time writedown of $8.8bn related to settlements of mortgage fraud accusations.But the rest of BofA’s businesses earned 33 cents a share, which topped estimates of 28.7 cents. Improvements were seen in its market share of fixed income trading and growth in consumer loans.Wells Fargo topped estimates by earning 70 cents a share, versus forecasts of 69.4 cents. It set aside fewer dollars for loan loss reserves, leading to a record net income of $3.95bn for the quarter.Wells Fargo shares led the financials, gaining 5.7 per cent to $28.41.BofA’s shares were down 1.5 per cent in trading, to $9.57.Banks that reported strong earnings earlier were stronger. JPMorgan was up 1.4 per cent at $40.39, and Citigroup added 0.7 per cent to $38.02.Goldman Sachs delivered the first disappointing bank earnings of the second-quarter earnings season, thanks to its heavy reliance on trading. The shares fell 0.7 per cent in early trading to $128.49, at one point touching their lowest level since 2009.The Dow was led by IBM and The Coca-Cola Company, which reported earnings per share that topped forecasts by 1 cent, thanks to strong international demand. Its shares rose 3.4 per cent to $69.40.The top advancer in the S&P 500 was Harley-Davidson, the motorbike manufacturer, which jumped 8.9 per cent to $45.11.It reported the first year-over-year quarterly boost in US sales since 2006. That was its highest price since 2007.Avery Dennison was the worst performer in the index, falling 13.7 per cent to $32.65 after the designer of business equipment warned that its third-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations.
1;AVY;Avery Dennison Corp;2009-09-14T20:56:34Z;Utility stocks help Wall Street recover;;Utility stocks helped Wall Street recover from early losses on Monday after investors feared a trade dispute between the US and China would spark a pull-back.Shares in AES, the power company, rose 4.5 per cent to $14.79 after reports that China’s sovereign wealth fund was eyeing a stake in the group. The S&P utility index gained 1.6 per cent, helping to reassure investors even after a row erupted between the two countries.Late on Friday US President Barack Obama had said he would impose a duty of 35 per cent on Chinese tyre imports. Beijing accused Washington of “rampant protectionism”, saying it would investigate imports of US poultry and vehicles.Goodyear Tire & Rubber, the biggest US tyremaker, climbed 3 per cent to $17.78. The Ohio company has been badly hit by the recession and cut 5,000 jobs in February after axing 4,000 staff in the second half of last year. Cooper Tire & Rubber, which manufactures tyres mainly in the US but also in China, rose 7.1 per cent to $15.60.Pilgrim’s Pride, the biggest maker of chicken products in the US, fell 2.3 per cent to $5, while Tyson Foods, the world’s biggest meat processor, fell 2.4 per cent to $12.45.Mr Obama’s speech on regulatory reform on Monday had little immediate effect on the market and stocks continued to fluctuate until rallying late in the day.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,049.34, while the technology-focused Nasdaq gained 0.5 per cent to 2,091.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 9,626.80, powered by a 4.6 per cent gain in General Electric after the shares broke through the $15 milestone to $15.35.“People are taking a little bit of protection but they’re not willing to give up on the market yet,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Canaccord Adams. He said the market had declined in early trading because investors were taking money off the table after last week’s rally and guarding themselves in response to the trade dispute with China.“Markets have been overbought and they’re due for a pull-back at some point, it’s just a question of when that is,” he said.Financial stocks led the market lower in early trading. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-prize winning US economist, had added to concerns about the economy when he said in an interview on Sunday that underlying problems still lingered in the the US banking system after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.After early losses, Bank of America crept up 0.1 per cent to $16.99, while Citigroup lost 2 per cent to $4.52.

Sealed Air, the bubble-wrap maker, added 5.9 per cent to $20.16 after its biggest intraday gain since May on an upgrade from BofA.The brokerage raised its rating on Avery Dennison, the world’s largest label maker, helping boost the shares 6 per cent to $34.55.Sprint Nextel, after soaring 20 per cent, was up 10.1 per cent to $4.15 after reports that Deutsche Telekom was considering a bid for the mobile operator.At the weekend, Cadbury reiterated its stance on the takeover bid from Kraft Foods, saying Kraft’s low-growth business model was an “unappealing prospect”.BofA analysts later issued a note saying the British confectioner was unlikely to receive a competing bid. Kraft closed flat at $26.11.Falling commodity prices had initially hit the market but following the afternoon rally ExxonMobil was unchanged at $70. ConocoPhillips gained 1.4 per cent to $46.59 even though oil remained below the $70 level.Following a good performance last week on the back of rising metal prices, Alcoa was unchanged at $12.94. A downgrade from HSBC had initially pushed the stock lower.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Alexza Pharmaceuticals fell 11.7 per cent to $2.56 after it reported disappointing results from the trial of its migraine drug.Salix Pharmaceuticals soared 51.1 per cent to $20.22 after it said Rifaximin, used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, had met the goals of its latest trials.
