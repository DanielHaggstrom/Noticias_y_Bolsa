0;LIN;Linde Plc;2007-07-02T23:05:51Z;Inner-city schemes boost Galliford Try;;Strong demand from inner-city regeneration projects and the successful integration of recent acquisitions helped Galliford Try predict that full-year profits would be significantly ahead of expectations.The hybrid construction and housebuilding group said the integration of Linden Homes, acquired in March, was on track.Morrison Construction and Chartdale Homes, bought in 2006, were now fully integrated and produced an “excellent performance in their first full financial year since acquisition”.In spite of the £108.5m paid for Linden homes and a land bank that has more than doubled to 11,100 units – from 4,022 in 2006 – Galliford said borrowings were well below market expectations.Analysts had expected net debt of £170m-£175m but have lowered their forecasts to about £120m in spite of the acquisition and the increased land bank.Greg Fitzgerald, chief executive, said: “Once the integration of Linden is complete in September or October, we will pop our head above the parapet again.“We have good coverage in housebuilding now and can expand organically so any acquisition is likely to be in one of the construction sectors we are already in.”He added that Galliford Try had a key advantage on larger and more complex regeneration sites because it could offer the full range of housebuilding and contracting skills.The increased scale in housebuilding led to completions rising 45 per cent to 1,530.The construction-related order book has been maintained at £2.1bn, while infrastructure services is performing well.Galliford Try has a four-year framework deal with the Environment Agency to repair and maintain flood defences and long-term deals with seven of the 11 regulated water utilities. Andy Brown, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said regeneration skills were becoming “increasingly important”.Mr Brown said he was comfortable with the group’s premium rating, compared with housebuilders, because of its margins and exposure to the booming construction sector.He added that the group’s hybrid model was working well and that it had scope for more acquisitions, especially in construction.Tessa Guy, analyst at Investec, upgraded her full-year pre-tax profit expectations 10 per cent to £52.6m. Ms Guy said the group was trading at a discount to Kier, a rival construction and housebuilding group, and that the shares looked cheap.Galliford Try shares rose 10p, or 6.3 per cent, on Monday to 168¾p.
1;LIN;Linde Plc;2007-02-05T23:33:57Z;Galliford in exclusive Linden talks;;Galliford Try is in exclusive talks with Linden Holdings over a possible deal that would see the hybrid construction and housebuilding company buy the entire issued share capital of the UK’s sixth-biggest housebuilder.Galliford Try, best known for building Wimbledon’s centre court, said the discussions “may or may not lead to Galliford Try making an offer to acquire the entire share capital of Linden”.The group would not comment further, other than to confirm weekend press speculation in line with Takeover Panel rules. People familiar with the discussions said the deal was expected to be worth about £200m, short of the £300m suggested at the start of the auction last June.Privately held Linden, which specialises in brownfield land development, is 64.8 per cent owned by management, with HBOS holding the remaining 35.2 per cent.Linden Homes floated in 1996 and was taken private in a HBOS-backed management buy-out in 2000.Galliford Try and Linden have been in exclusive talks since before Christmas. Although the discussions have been going on longer than expected, because of Galliford’s December year-end and extended due diligence, the two parties are believed to be close to a deal.Andrew Sells, Linden chairman, said there had been a lot of interest in the group when it began the auction process last year. Linden has significant exposure to the market in southern England, which makes it attractive because of the high prices being paid in the region.As many as 25 housebuilders and financial groups were said to have expressed an interest in Linden but trade buyers such as George Wimpey, Redrow and Bellway withdrew after taking a closer look. Linden said in June that it made an annual profit of £12.8m on revenues of £280m. It has a landbank of 4,662 plots.Comparing the exclusive nature of the discussions with the competitive bidding for Wilson Bowden, one analyst questioned whether the lack of competition meant Galliford Try was prepared to pay significantly more than other buyers and suggested that it could be overpaying, adding that the split of debt to equity in any offer would be interesting.Chris Millington, analyst at Bridgewell, said he thought the interest rate decision by the Bank of England on Thursday could have an effect on the consolidation in the sector.“Housebuilder shares have had an OK run despite the rises in the last six months,” he said. “But any further interest rate rises could weigh on the sector.”Galliford Try shares rose 1¼p to 158½p on Monday.
2;LIN;Linde Plc;2007-02-05T20:11:40Z;Barratt’s big bid is not just a bet on house prices;;Housing deals have deeper strategic rootsIf you were gambling on the direction of house prices, you would be brave to bet against housebuilders, who see the whole housing market chain, from open fields that are just a glint in the developer’s eye, to the moment when the keys are handed over to a home’s first owners. Overstretched mortgage-holders should not, however, read too much into the fact that Barratt Developments, perhaps the country’s best-known housebuilder, has taken on and defeated rival Wimpey in winning Wilson Bowden’s recommendation for its bid, or that two other builders, Galliford Try and Linden Homes are in takeover talks, or that a new suitor has emerged for Countrywide, the UK estate agency.It is true that Barratt’s bid is a sign that the outlook for the market, despite (or perhaps because of) recent rises in interest rates, is relatively benign – for large builders. Barratt has only ever made bolt-on acquisitions and, at a value of £2.2bn in cash and shares, Wilson Bowden represents a big leap. As a relative M&A debutant, the group is very cautious about the pace of integration and the savings it could achieve. Proposed synergies of £45m by 2008-09 look modest compared with the amount Persimmon, another builder, sought to save in combining with Westbury last year. That deal was accomplished at a valuation of 1.2 times Westbury’s net asset value and Barratt’s bid is worth more than twice the pro forma net assets of Wilson Bowden at end-June 2006. That is closer to what other unsuccessful bidders for the builder – HBOS, the bank, with Sir Tom Hunter, the entrepreneur – are paying for Crest Nicholson, another housebuilder, and have paid for McCarthy & Stone, the retirement homes group.The main reason Barratt can pay up – and take a sanguine view of a housing market that others think is frothy – is that it is an industry specialist. It can judge the value of the strategic land bank it will acquire, while the geographic fit, the addition of Wilson Bowden’s commercial development business and the integration of the group’s experienced middle management will add strength to Barratt at a time of industry consolidation. The buyer’s size also means it can trim its sails if the UK market gets stormy by, say, cutting back on land purchases. Only a few of those currently exposed to British house prices can boast that kind of flexibility.Up like a rocketIn bidding for Countrywide, 3i and management made clear the estate agency was worth a certain amount by declaring their buy-out offer, in effect, final. A minority of shareholders thought otherwise and blocked the deal.Now, deliciously, an approach from another private equity suitor, Apollo of the US, could reopen the discussion closed only 10 days ago. That is great news for shareholders – but a challenge for 3i and those managers involved in the failed buy-out, including Harry Hill, Countrywide’s chairman-elect.A formal bid from Apollo would allow 3i to relaunch its offer. To do so, it would have to suppress its embarrassment at having fluffed its tactics first time round, leaving the launch pad clear for Apollo, but resist the temptation to chase Apollo’s bid skywards to unsustainably high levels. The American firm bought Realogy, a US real estate company, for 12 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That offer was cited by one of the dissident Countrywide shareholders as a reason to resist 3i’s offer of less than nine times – reasoning rejected by Countrywide’s independent directors and, implicitly, by 3i and Mr Hill’s buy-out team.In the wake of the failed buy-out, 3i was praised by some for showing “investment discipline”. If Apollo bids, the coming weeks will test how deep that discipline runs.The ties that boundBack in 2004, Sir Philip Hampton of J Sainsbury quietly dropped Goldman Sachs as a financial adviser, ending a decade of close ties between the supermarket and the investment bank.For the newly-installed chairman it was a bold move. But his reasoning was simple. He was concerned about potential conflicts of interest following Sir Philip Green’s attempted bid for Marks and Spencer: Goldman not only advised on that deal, but also put in £850m of equity.That did not sit well with Sainsbury, which was already in the sights of private equity that autumn. Sir Philip Hampton was trying to deal with endless rumours and would-be suitors while also helping Justin King, Sainsbury’s chief executive, get his turnround plans off the ground.Just over two years on, those rumours are finally coming true and Goldman Sachs is advising the CVC-led consortium on its potential bid. There is no conflict – Sir Philip and Sainsbury’s clean break with Goldman in 2004 made sure of that – but the chairman will have a big “I told you so” moment should the bank turn up as a principal investor in an eventual bid.andrew.hill@ft.com
